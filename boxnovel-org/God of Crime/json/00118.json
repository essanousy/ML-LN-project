Is this hush money? I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thick arms protruded from the blanket and snatched the cigarette from Tae-hyuk\u2019s hand before disappearing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have been easily silenced in the meantime.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Just talking to myself.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shut up as Yoo Cheol-ho raised the cigarette to his mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was just one cigarette, not a pack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhuhu... I should smell this cigarette for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho muttered as he brought the cigarette to his nose.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he literally collapsed on the bed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quietly left his bed and looked at Yoo Cheol-ho who collapsed on the top bunk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He hit Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s cheeks a few times to see if he was really unconscious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. Isn\u2019t this effect amazing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had turned the sleeping pills into powdered form and put them on the tobacco.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was absorbed in the body by putting it in the mouth or by smelling it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eating it would make the affected person fall into a deep sleep within five minutes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If absorbed through the nasal mucosa, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to fall asleep within five seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then the game will start now. Let\u2019s find the gold and perfectly change my destiny.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blue Dragon Dragon Prison was built on a naval base built during the Japanese colonial period.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No one would imagine that an enormous amount of gold would be buried there.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This fact was discovered by change during the prison renovations.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, the entire amount to the treasury and the reporters had only guessed the amount of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But there will be no construction now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had changed the future by creating the prison war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then there won\u2019t be anyone who discovers it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blue Dragon Prion would be shut down in 10 days and would receive a special administration.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then excavators would be brought in and the would be gold dug up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If someone tried to block him then he could use the crime skills to take care of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But things are going too well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if the warden was growing drugs and a bomb exploded, did the prison itself have to be removed?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once he started to question it, there would be many uncertainties.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, in the first place, the existence of Blue Dragon Prison itself was a strange place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...First of all, I should check if the gold is there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk left his cell and quietly headed for the drug farm where the gold was buried.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The location was a very remote place inside the prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At present, most of the guards were under investigation. In the end, the number of patrols could be countered on one hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'But what are those people?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to get to the drug farm, he had to pass through the area where the Japanese inmates were gathered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, even though curfew had passed, a bunch of people were making noises in the corridor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t guards or investigators.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hid his body and listened to their conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oyabun. I didn\u2019t think the warden would be caught like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. He dared to make a deal with the Chinese.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But I\u2019m glad we were able to obtain it safely. With this, most of the gold left behind by Shogun Takeda will belong to our family.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhuhu...

Eh? It needs the iris as well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually, most safes only contained a dial.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The security on this indicated that something very important was kept here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The safe was completely sealed with cement so it couldn\u2019t be forcibly removed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to check the contents, the owner\u2019s fingerprints and eyes were needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are there such cutting edge crime prevention devices in the prison?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The material of the safe was made of a metal alloy that wouldn\u2019t break even if a bomb exploded next to it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he didn\u2019t open the lock, then he would never be able to remove the contents.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he had already opened the weapons warehouse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do it at once. Disguise! Counterfeit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once Disguise was activated, Tae-hyuk\u2019s face became the warden\u2019s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used Counterfeit to change the fingerprints on his fingers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After placing his thumb on the fingerprint reader and his eyes in front of the camera, the safe door opened with a rattling sound.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Apart from the warden, only Tae-hyuk would be able to open this so easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow, let\u2019s see what is in here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The vault contained 10 bundles of $100 bills and a gun loaded with bullets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was also a bunch of documents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoa. $100,000? It must be his escape fund. Eh? This...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once he took out the paperwork, a small envelope fell to the floor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was filled with white powder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It isn\u2019t sugar. Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to check the contents of the documents first.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The information contained there was amazing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to operate the drug factory, he bribed various officials and wrote down the details of numerous corruption scandals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But this wasn\u2019t the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if the warden had the power of a king, it was only inside the prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The warden also made deals with the Chinese and Japanese criminals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant there was a link connecting them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mister Park...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk muttered the name of a man who was mentioned several times in the papers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Mister Park made the drug farm for the warden who wanted to earn big money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In return, he wanted certain people to infiltrate this place as prisoners.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He also forged all the the necessary documents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? If this is real, isn\u2019t the warden simply his puppet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, the warden seemed to know nothing about the gold.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Mister Park\u2019s purpose was clear: Shogun Takeda's gold.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And according to the man called \u2018Oyabun\u2019, the plan was already successful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took all the items inside the safe and exited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Nakada.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slapped the cheeks of one of the sleeping Japanese inmates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakada woke up with a small groan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Japanese inmates received facilities that were different from other places.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed more like a motel or hotel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and stared into his opponent\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bastard. Who dares interrupt my sleep!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am a Korean bimbimbap, not Japanese bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhu... I\u2019ve been in Korea for a year and I don\u2019t know...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and aimed the gun at the other person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Hiik! What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Good evening. Nakada. I have come to ask you a few things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou! Big Brother?!\u201d (Japanese)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakada felt wide awake as he stared at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t understand what you are trying to say.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why is the killer from the Triads here! Besides, didn\u2019t you die in South Korea?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like the other person knew the face of the strongest killer in the Triads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I picked a good disguise.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tell me what you are doing here.

Being able to touch your internal organs isn\u2019t something that just anyone can experience.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooooof...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I don\u2019t think I will be able to eat soondae for the rest of my life.

But you couldn\u2019t bear this much...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the warden was mistaken.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Only the warden and prison guards who knew this fact, while the inmates didn\u2019t know when they would be allowed to have proper food again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How many people would be able to endure it and wait?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This place was a prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was divided between the inmates and the guards who managed them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guards could leave on a weekly basis to rest and recharge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, those imprisoned here wouldn\u2019t be able to leave until their sentence was over, or until they were released on parole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For them, exercise time and meal times were the only moments they could relieve their stress.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was all lost at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden didn\u2019t consider the feelings of the prisoners at all.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he did, the the food poisoning incident and lack of food for a week might have ended up differently.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the warden thought of the prisoners as people who should be controlled and enlightened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The likelihood of him bending any other way was 0%.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRight now, the situation is urgent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the deputy, who was carefully watching the warden, opened his mouth and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First, the dining room and gallery are completely occupied.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I guess they are armed with cooking tools.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. But most of them are unharmed because there aren\u2019t many tools.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fortunately, they can\u2019t enter the warehouse because it is blocked.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was fortunate from the warden\u2019s position.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The warehouse contained weapons to prepare for any situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tear gas, gas masks, electric shockers, gas guns, etc...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is why I am authorizing the use of firearms in the prison. Isn\u2019t it the only way to end this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. Although won\u2019t the human rights groups object?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s not like they are enjoying any freedom from their cells. Prepare to suppress them. All of them will be put in solitary confinement.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Warden-nim... There are so many prisoners involved that there won\u2019t be enough room in solitary confinement.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden glared at the deputy and shouted,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then increase it even more! At any rate, you have an hour and a half to quell them. I will take command.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Understood!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Number 974 was aligning his fingers in the dining room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuoooook!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The task was done without anesthesia, so it was extremely painful.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he went to the infirmary then he could receive proper treatment, but he would end up being beaten up by the guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNumber 974... Ah, I'm sorry. That has become a habit. Park Joon-shik, please endure the pain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Park Joon-shik tried to forget about his pain by thinking about the target of his anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-Where is that bastard guard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but I don\u2019t know...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik\u2019s treatment ended, although it was a bit rough.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik looked around with torn clothes and a hand wrapped in a bandage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026He disappeared like a ghost. Obviously he was here...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes this makes sense?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik glared at the guards tied up in one corner of the restaurant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were those who saw the prison guard being assaulted and came to help.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But despite being armed with gas guns and rods, they couldn\u2019t help being overwhelmed by the huge difference in numbers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOof...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bound guards couldn\u2019t do anything but scream.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik approached them and slapped one of the guard\u2019s cheeks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where is the bastard who made my fingers like this!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tied up guard shook his head desperately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sheesh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik spat and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Obviously he slipped away like a rat. Fuck, I was caught by a real goblin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik recalled the face of that guard with the evil smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He punched the guard with his fist.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was the beginning of everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik approached Shin Chang-ho and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. What do we do now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho sighed as he looked at Park Joon-shik.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of his followers caused such a large incident...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the bodyguard next to Shin Chang-ho frowned and interrupted,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you saying that now? Grab a knife and handle it yourself. Don\u2019t rely on Hyung-nim all the time!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I am ashamed. Still, I couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you think it will be fine if you answer like that?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like a fight would break out among his own men.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho opened his mouth and spoke,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The dice has already been thrown. At the very least, we need to prepare for those here to have their punishments increased.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is okay. No matter what, going against the guards is too much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If Hyung-nim tells me then I will go to hell for you. It is Hyung-nim\u2019s decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dozens of eyes focused on Shin Chang-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Outside, he was part of a big gang but he was just a mere prisoner here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was limited in what he could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, someone quietly walked up to Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Kim Cheol-su?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eh? The cigarette seller?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho\u2019s eyes narrowed as he looked at the other person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The brawl had happened in the area where Shin Chang-ho\u2019s gang was sitting. Most of them became involved in the fight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But why was this person here?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, since when had he been here?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had disguised as a member of Shin Chang-ho\u2019s group first.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he became a guard to persecute the inmates.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And now, he was here with Kim Cheol-su\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two groups here were dancing on the palms of his hands.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All of this was possible with the help of his crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You seem to have a lot of concerns.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho bit his lip.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A few years later, he would become a high-ranking official of the organization after leaving this place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, if he accidentally increased his sentence, would the boss wait for him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it wasn\u2019t possible to get rid of those who followed Shin Chang-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter what choice he made, he wouldn\u2019t like the results.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Shin Chang-ho didn\u2019t reveal that he was nervous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuk. Cigarette Seller, you seem to be very busy with your business. Did you come to this war to sell cigarettes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't know if you remember, but I said that I would cooperate with the war. It is the same again this time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha? You are very conscientious. I\u2019m sorry, but what we are dealing with now is the guards, not the Japanese. What you can do to help?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFirst, I will briefly sum up the situation. There are two things making you troubled right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. Speak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFirst of all, the dining room we occupied is blocked to prevent the inmates from escaping. The key is kept among the guards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know that much. Isn\u2019t that why we are gathered here like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You want to finish this incident in a way that doesn\u2019t increase your prison time, but that isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the right answer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A small groan escaped from Shin Chang-ho\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Knowing the latter, it meant that Shin Chang-ho\u2019s psychology had been completely grasped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"From now on, I will tell you what to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho gulped and looked at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose who seek death shall live. Those who seek life shall die.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Admiral Yi Sun-sin\u2019s words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have to make the war bigger in order to survive. I know there is something wrong with the prison ships, which is why the food hasn\u2019t been distributed properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see. I also thought that. The warden seems to be doing something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is the way of life. The wardens and guards do a lot of work that isn\u2019t publicized, so the warden will choose one of two options: He will either negotiate to cover up his problems, or call for outside support.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm! I would welcome the former with both arms open, but won\u2019t we be ruined if it is the latter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The word \u2018we\u2019 naturally flowed from Shin Chang-ho\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed with satisfaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then we will use the media to expose this incident to the outside world. South Korea is a really good country, so they care about the human rights of prisoners. The prisoners were given only porridge for a week and the guards carried out violence against the prisoners. They will end up squished like rice cakes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The former option of negotiation would benefit them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The latter option would incite sympathy from the public.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, there was a possibility that the result wouldn\u2019t turn out good.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it was possible to decrease the losses caused by the war.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a sweet offer that was difficult to reject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho said in a heavy tone,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But there is one big hole in your proposal. Take a look around.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His companions were armed at best with rough cutlery and cooking knives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Earlier, the fight could be won due to the overwhelming difference in firepower; however, once we leave here, dozens of armed guards would be waiting. The plan will only work if we can fight them equally. It is impossible...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quietly pulled out a set of keys.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They could leave the dining room with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...H-How did you get that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI told you. I will cooperate in this war. I will provide the materials.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Materials?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I got this by chance. There is some very interesting stuff mixed in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk found one key and showed it to Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO-Oh my god! T-That\u2019s the weapons warehouse key!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dozens of members of Shin Chang-ho\u2019s gang gulped.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was possible to become the same as the armed guards with this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now you know what I mean by cooperating.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho nodded quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA-Amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim! There are a lot of batons and tear gas canisters in here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Taser guns and gas guns!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is enough to arm all of us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho watched quietly as his men picked up the things stored in the weapons warehouse.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard at the entrance had been hit with an iron pipe that Cigarette Seller found somewhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And he showed them a magic trick where he opened the door that was locked with iris recognition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026He truly isn\u2019t an ordinary criminal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cigarette Seller was twirling his iron pipe around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you need any weapons from here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable with this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The skill with which you handle that is unusual.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThanks for the praise. Anyways, this war can absolutely be won if we drag out the time. Build a fortress </span><span style=\"\">inside the prison. But I\u2019m a bit bored so I\u2019ve prepared some fun games during that time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Games?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFirst, we will support each other to get what we both want. This won\u2019t end with just you guys being armed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see what you mean. I want to show a bitter taste to the Japanese.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I would also like you to give me Park Sung-yul in this bargain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat isn\u2019t hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"And after the war, I will let you know where your sister is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Any laughter on Shin Chang-ho\u2019s face disappeared at his words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He remembered what he had forgotten for a moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Did Cigarette Seller know for certain where she was?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If I can find my sister with your help, then I will do anything for you. There are many things to be done.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026If there is nothing else then go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled like he knew the ending of the story.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His men finished arming themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho took a deep breath and slowly walked forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFrom now on, we will be at war with the guards. Don\u2019t overdo it, since time is on our side. For our victory!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The armed prisoners cheered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the signal for the start of the prison war.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

You\u2019re returning home in two hours, you really do have a homing instinct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho glared at the investigator in charge of questioning him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Investigator-nim. Let\u2019s be honest here since we know each other so well. Give me a pen and I will tell you who the leader that escaped with Kim Tae-sung is, and everything else you want to know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The investigator clicked his tongue and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is it because you escaped from jail twice? Well, it is good that this will end quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cInstead, I have one condition.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Once the investigation is finished, I want to be sent to another prison...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you cooperate with the investigation, then I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, the whole truth behind the Red Phoenix escape was revealed by Yoo Cheol-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A groan emerged from the mouth of the investigator.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuooooh... P-Phantom and the Bomber have joined hands. If the commissioner hears about this, then he will have a headache for a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, that\u2019s right. This time, I didn\u2019t break out because I wanted to. I was forced into it due to Phantom...

Then this is also fake?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He pulled out the tape recorder that had Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s voice recorded on it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s eyes trembled as he saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"P-Phantom has the ability to change his face and voice into me...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Then I should discuss it with the warden. Anyway, I won\u2019t forget what you told me and will talk to the warden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What? Tell the warden?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s face turned white.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tape recorder showed that he betrayed the warden.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would be dead if it entered the warden\u2019s ears!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The newly appointed police commissioner, Chae Bum-ho, was eating in a high class Korean restaurant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were delicacies such as abalone, sea bream sashimi, roasted eel, fresh roe, etc. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even so, Chae Bum-ho\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t impressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A man in his 30s with a scary atmosphere was sitting in front of Chae Bum-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, Mister Park. Did you get the job done?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park put wasabi on top of the sea bream sashimi and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The evidence that Hyung-nim is related to us has been disposed of.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? If that is so... You went through a lot of effort.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chae Bum-ho\u2019s stiff face became much softer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He grabbed his spoon and started to eat the rice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park finished the sashimi and reached out for the grilled beef.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The charcoal gave it a mouth-watering scent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The meat is very soft.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see.

Let\u2019s have a drink.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park passed a cup of sake to Chae Bum-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their words were dangerous, but there was no need to worry about anyone overhearing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was a place where large business executives and high ranking bureaucrats gathered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, it was very strictly managed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Secret conversations shared over meals wouldn\u2019t be leaked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chae Bum-ho and Mister Park drank the sake and smiled at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"To the newly reborn Hyung-nim!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chae Bum-ho smiled in satisfaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With this, he could focus on catching Phantom without any worries.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t been exposed, but the Japanese Yakuza were already deeply embedded in South Korean society.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I would like your help with Phantom, as well as in covering up the Taesung Group case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKukukuk. Phantom doesn\u2019t know how big of a group he has declared war against. Only the tip of the iceberg has been revealed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chae Bum-ho was the local police commissioner.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was credited for finishing a mysterious illness case and was considered a genius at taking opportunities when they arose.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although the Bomber had run amok, he was now in prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That case wouldn\u2019t be mentioned again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please note that the research is proceeding safely. This is all thanks to Hyung-nim\u2019s efforts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. This time, pay more attention to managing the staff.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! Don\u2019t worry. Sooner or later, I will use this face to enter the political arena. Then we can focus more on the research.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chae Bum-ho smiled at Mister Park\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s talk about Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park replied with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is our enemy. What other explanation is needed? The organization will lend its full support.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard from Kazuo hyung-nim. Sooner or later, a major Phantom extermination plan will be implemented. What? Working with criminals to catch criminals? I will let him know whose home he is playing in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Yakuza and police had a common goal to catch Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a vibration was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Is that a message?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I told them not to contact me while I was eating.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There must be an important reason. You can check it out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chae Bum-ho looked at the screen of his phone and was at a loss for words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung-nim?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park got up and approached Chae Bum-ho, who had become like a stone statue.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What the hell was going on?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at Chae Bum-ho\u2019s phone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was written that Phantom was the ringleader who broke the Bomber out of Red Phoenix Prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHu, huhu, huhuhuhu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chae Bum-ho chuckled in a low voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he muttered in a small voice,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You dared touch this area?! Yes, let\u2019s do it Phantom. I will take it as a declaration of war. Yes. This is war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next day, the police changed their policy from cooperation with Phantom to catching him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom absolutely had to be arrested.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The police declared a war against the criminal Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In secluded rural village deep in the mountains of Gangwon Province was a place that tourists rarely ever visited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It boasted only 20 households and even that number was gradually decreasing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there was a sudden boom a few years ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A dozen or so robust men came to the area to do farming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In addition, the crops they brought were far more profitable than the ones previously grown.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like gold was literally growing from the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was delicious food for worms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The village thoroughly restricted access of outsiders.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The advantage was that people couldn\u2019t enter the village unless they crossed a long bridge between two cliffs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hwang-ssi! I heard that last month\u2019s harvest was 2,000?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhu, it was 500 more than expected. It is because there was a lot of rain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But the crops are also very good this time. If this continues on, then we will be able to harvest more than usual.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. I didn\u2019t know that barley would sell for such an expensive price.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The old man said this but he actually knew the truth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The crops being grown here were drugs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he learned that terrifying fact too late.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The numbers written in the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) account was growing and the village was becoming rich.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could ignore his conscience.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t been in touch with his family for several years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The village changing was exciting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhu, I am going out to work in the fields today...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The old people followed behind the young people who came to town.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the things they were carrying were strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were holding black rifles, not plows, or sickles.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were the escorts and watchdogs of the elderly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the elderly people arrived at the fields, they saw something red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What?

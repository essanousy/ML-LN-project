Be sure to keep the hostages! Those bastards are our lifeline!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Beta\u2019s face distorted as he held a gun to the hostages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou do it if you have a complaint! What? A perfect plan? This? Huh? If you have something to say, then tell me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alpha was dumbfounded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Alpha was just the leader this time. </span><span style=\"\">Beta had more experience and skills than Alpha.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, it was a big hit that Beta joined the team in the first place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a former mafia veteran who could handle skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Gamma, who hadn\u2019t been seen for a while, approached.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Why are you fighting all of a sudden? The situation might have changed but aren\u2019t we allies? Smile instead of looking like you are chewing shit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gamma said with a bright expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The impatient Alpha exploded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-This bastard! What are you saying? Don\u2019t you know why the situation is like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t it because your leadership wasn\u2019t good?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alpha couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and swung his fists at Gamma.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Come on, Alpha. We are allies until the end of the operation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust...! Fuck! This happened due to that monkey-like bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Gamma is also a team member. Forget it. First, let\u2019s think about getting out of here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Okay, I understand. Damn...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only three members here, including Alpha.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Somehow, they had to overcome this crisis with their own strength.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Alpha glared at the grinning Gamma.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a complete bastard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been put on the team as a penetration expert.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was excellent at picking locks and disabling security.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But that wasn't the problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That Satan-level bastard...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gamma had made a mistake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He accidentally caused the alarm to ring.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He tried to leave the bank, leaving the money bag in the safe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was literally an internal enemy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, their plan to rob and escape the bank had failed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now they were holding the customers hostage and were demanding a helicopter to escape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gamma rubbed his palms together and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Beta hyung-nim, please rest! I will manage the hostages!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shit! Once this is finished, I will kill the the broker who introduced me to that bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Beta gestured to the agitated Alpha and went to a corner to start talking to the hostages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He told Gamma to keep an eye on the hostages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, calm down and listen. I don\u2019t like it but in order to leave here, we have to show a strong appearance. If the police don\u2019t listen to our demands then one by one, the hostages...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Alpha and Beta were talking in secret, a familiar voice was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, are you going to kill the hostages now? Then I don\u2019t have time to play around.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They turned their heads and saw the smiling Gamma.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, you should be watching the hostages...uaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So far, Gamma had always been moving like a sloth, but now he moved at a fast pace.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Gamma caused Alpha to trip and then fell on Beta\u2019s back.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he twisted Beta\u2019s arm and forced him to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What? This bastard!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Beta shrieked.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His arms were covered with silver handcuffs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Alpha\u2019s expression was shocked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No way, that bastard...!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gamma said with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung-nim, thank you for your performance this month. I am Detective Seo Tae-hyuk from the Gangdong Police Station. Kim Dong-soo and Bae Sung-jun, I am arresting you for special robbery and the illegal trafficking of guns. You have the right to remain silent...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaaack! Son of a bitch! How dare you deceive us! This scammer! Do you know who I am?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Detective Seo Tae-hyuk laughed at the agitated Kim Dong-soo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t care about who you are. Rather, shouldn\u2019t you be wondering about where you will be going? You won\u2019t be able to leave for at least three years.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAaaaack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDetective-nim! I arrested Delta, who was hacking the security network, and Epsilon, who was in the car. They really were where Detective-nim said they were.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? You went through a lot of trouble.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"However, it has only been a short while since Detective-nim entered. You already solved so many big cases... What is your secret?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, a burning sense of justice?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cops laughed at Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s joke.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took off the coat that he was wearing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he muttered in a small voice so that no one else could hear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like I am finishing up the blacklist.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason he was able to catch so many criminals during a short period of time after becoming a detective was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was because he knew.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a secret that Seo Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t tell anyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew the future for the next four years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of it was about criminals, but there were many changes due to the butterfly effect.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But they were golden memories for a detective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought about the moment 10 years ago when he decided to become a detective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Crime skills... Now that I think about it, that really was a dreamlike year.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He remembered the last crime skill that he got.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wasn\u2019t it the Proxy Attendance skill?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought it was a useless skill when he first got it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">10 years ago, Tae-hyuk was left alone in the Wolsang Institute to stop the Clown\u2019s Core Drive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was reminded of the newly learned crime skill as he was talking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he decided to find out what type of power it was.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a skill to create an \u2018agent\u2019 to do something on behalf of the caster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In order to be used as an intermediary, I had to offer an object of equal value. And I...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He offered up the crime skills as the sacrifice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An alter ego was created to destroy the Core Drive.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The thing that appeared was a ghoulish face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a hollow space where the eyes were and the mouth was ripped from ear to ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It said to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Don\u2019t think this is over.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">As long as human evil remains in the world, someone will become the God of Crime again.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, was that so?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he woke up on the bed in his own house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he thought back to his high school days, Seo Tae-hyuk suddenly heard a loud noise in his ears.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Two people who seemed to be security guards were in front of the bank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, Boss-nim is coming, but who blocked the entrance with this car? It looks expensive so I can\u2019t remove it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! Sunbae! This car is a Lamborghini Aventador!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do you know the car?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course! It is the most expensive model among the Lamborghinis, a man\u2019s romance!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...H-How much is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis has all the options. Is it around 700~800 million won?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wah...that is at the level of a house I would need to be reincarnated three times in order to buy it, Who the hell would be riding this type of car?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe it is a chaebol or a celebrity? At any rate, it isn\u2019t for people like us...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and approached the guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, that is mine. I had business so I parked it in front of the bank for a moment...I\u2019ll take it away right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guards stared at Tae-yuk\u2019s face and they started to exchange glances.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like there was a strange misconception so Tae-hyuk coughed a few times and pulled out his identification.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am Seo Tae-hyuk from the Gangdong Police Station.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the senior guard said with wide eyes,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Detective-nim! Ah, I'm really sorry. I had a weird misconception...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha, it is okay. Please do your best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bowed, took the key out of his pocket and entered his car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow, it really is his.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my god. I thought he was a delinquent instead of a detective at first. But to think he would be driving an expensive car...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey! I told you not to evaluate people based on appearance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I will keep that in mind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he parked his car elsewhere, a person called him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Ah, Tae-hyuk!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">What happened to the case?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah? Kang-suk hyung. Of course, no civilians got hurt. The culprits were arrested.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Wow!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">This brat.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">You work so hard every day.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Why are you leaving work when the chief needs to stay behind and work overtime?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Isn\u2019t this a fully developed police station?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A smile appeared on Tae-hyuk\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk became a pot-bellied uncle and was now in a much higher position than before.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he was still the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Ah right, don\u2019t you have a date today?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Let me meet them next time.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I wonder who it is.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">How pretty is she that you would hide her from me?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm... It is someone that Hyung knows.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">R-really?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Now I am even more curious!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I will have someone investigate this!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wah... Isn\u2019t that an abuse of power?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Then let me meet them!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Sheesh.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">At any rate, you can leave now. Just make sure to submit the report tomorrow.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand, Superintendent Cho Kang-suk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-...</span><i><span style=\"\">You are giving me goose bumps.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hung up and laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were still a few people remaining on the blacklist.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He still had a lot of cases after that, but it wasn\u2019t a problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had experience as the God of Crime, tangling himself up with numerous criminals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Everyday was a fight against the new God of Crime that would someday reappear...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If there was just one small problem\u2015.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bumped into a woman dressed in a suit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it was probably because I wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded and suddenly got an ominous feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Wait a minute, don\u2019t tell me...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He placed his hands in his pockets to check if they contained something.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He touched a piece of soft cloth. It was probably...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018...Damn, I stole it again! A detective is going to be arrested!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk silently screamed as the woman passed by him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Fortunately, it seemed like she hadn\u2019t noticed that something had been stolen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, it occasionally happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Why did he keep stealing things whenever he bumped into another person?</span></p><br/><p>God of Crime is officially complete!!!</p><br/><p>This is the last chapter because I joined the prologue and chapter one.</p><br/><p>A huge, huge thank you to my editor Superposhposh, who was a superstar and managed to edit all the chapters of GOC.

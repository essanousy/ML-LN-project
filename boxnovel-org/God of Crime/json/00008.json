The salary difference was significant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">She had argued that she could send Tae-min to a private cram school with that money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">However, even Tae-min had opposed her, so she was forced to surrender.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">What could be done when Tae-min said that his brain was too good to go to a cram school</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Of course, he had to suffer a headlock from Tae-hyuk who was standing next to him.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Ha-ran was now able to have some personal time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Whether it was because of the time to relax or the move, Ha-ran\u2019s cough had disappeared completely. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk smiled warmly at that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Then</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0the second change...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He now had a family to greet him when he came home.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk moved quickly.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Noona would be waiting for him to eat dinner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018By the way. I never thought that Kang-suk hyung would donate all the reward money...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Originally, a detective wasn\u2019t supposed to receive the bounty money. It was likely to be construed as a bribe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Out of the 200 million won that Tae-hyuk had received, he had given 100 million to Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Yet Kang-suk had donated all the reward money from the Sungjin Group to an orphanage.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk had asked why he didn\u2019t use it for his marriage funds and Kang-suk had simply laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Kang-suk had watched the children playing on the playground and said</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"They are the only ones who would want to marry me</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">, so</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0it seems like I will have to wait 10 years.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cWah. A detective is trying to commit a crime.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">This was because\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Kang-suk was really popular with the children.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Kang-suk had laughed and said this was enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There were only idiots around Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Come to think of it. I haven\u2019t received any crime skills in the past week.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There was still a long time until the next incident on the blacklist. He thought about using that time to pull back the veil of the demon mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Ah, right. I decided to call it the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was the magic mirror that illuminated the true image of a demon.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He had recently discovered that the success rate of Robbery was around 10%.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">However,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0it was good at stealing strange things</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">, such as:</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">A wig</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">; h</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">andcuffs</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">;</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">p</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">ant</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">ies</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Forget it.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He still didn\u2019t know how to get skills and affinity points, nor did he know the identity of the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'Damn</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">, t</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">hat pseudo bastard.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He had taken it to a shaman who was famous in dealing with demon-possessed items. This was what the shaman had said</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It is made of bronze, a mix between copper and tin. The reflection rate is around 80%. This probably wasn\u2019t made to be used as a mirror. It looks ceremonial. The value</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The conclusion was that it was just an ordinary mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk glared at the Demon Revealing Mirror. Strange letters\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">could</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0still be seen on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">[Seo Tae-hyuk]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Title: God of Crime</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Rating: Commoner (Lacking conditions for upgrade)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Skills Possessed: Robbery (Lv 1)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0???</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Eh?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There were letters that he could see.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Additionally, t</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">here w</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">as</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0something blurred under the skills section.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Perhaps...\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">a</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0clue to a new skill?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk pressed on the question marks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">However, there was no reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018The direction...?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk hurried forward.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He decided to look through everything about the Demon Revealing Mirror when he got back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Uh, isn\u2019t that Noona?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk stopped walking. Ha-ran was standing on the street outside their house with a face that seemed like she was about to cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">She looked anxious like something big had happened.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cT-</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">t</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">ae-hyuk!

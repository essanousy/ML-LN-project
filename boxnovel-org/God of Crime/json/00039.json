The dangerous part was having a conversation without any sensitive information leaking out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... Wah. So they drink water until they die. They weren\u2019t forced to do it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hey! Keep quiet! There are ears listening.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAigoo. Sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho bowed exaggeratedly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk laughed. Although it had been more than seven years since they graduated from university, Shin Hyun-ho was still the same old Shin Hyun-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The two people had met at a university reasoning club.\u00a0</span>Cho Kang-suk and Joo Hyun-ho liked reasoning out mysteries, and won the TV program \u2018Mafia Game.\u2019</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho was the so-called \u2018chaebol\u2019 who owned several buildings in Gangnam.\u00a0</span>By only breathing, he could earn hundreds of millions of won in a month.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk always wondered why Hyun-ho became a profiler.\u00a0</span>Hyun-ho had responded to that question with:</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">I can\u2019t be satisfied with only fiction, Sunbae.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk felt goosebumps when he thought of the Hyun-ho of that time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hyun-ho. These are my personal thoughts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I\u2019m glad that you became a profiler. In many ways.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAhaha! Thank you for praising me, Sunbae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> After exchanging some conversation, Kang-suk and Hyun-ho rose from their spot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk went to the counter and paid before saying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hyun-ho, start your car now. Run away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> At Kang-suk\u2019s words, Joo Hyun-ho ran out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Shin Se-ho, who had been watching the two people at ease, was amazed.\u00a0</span>Cho Kang-suk and Joo Hyun-ho had suddenly disappeared from right in front of him.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Today\u2019s scoop was over.\u00a0</span>However, this wasn\u2019t enough to make Shin Se-ho give up.</p><br/><p>@</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> After the cafe, Kang-suk and Hyun-ho headed to the bathroom where the second murder occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk sat in the passenger seat and stretched out. If this case were ever to be exposed to the media, then it wouldn\u2019t just end with him taking off all his clothes and begging.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho turned on the police signal since he wanted to see the scene quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Oh, have you eaten lunch? Let\u2019s go to eat after seeing the scene. Hyung will pay!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ey, you\u2019re just going to eat jajangmyun again. Furthermore, I\u2019m not hungry. From now on, I will be seeing something truly delicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho laughed like he was truly having fun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Sometimes I wonder if you\u2019re either a genius or a psycho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Genius is right, Sunbae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAigoo... Ah, that is the bathroom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk sighed and pointed to a building across the street.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The poor owner, it seems like it was just recently built. Now that a murder has happened, he will need to sell it. Even so, there aren\u2019t many public baths or saunas in the area.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I agree.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> After parking the car in the area, Kang-suk headed to the scene of the crime.\u00a0</span>The policeman on guard stared at the gleaming BMW with wide eyes. Then he nodded with a convinced expression after seeing Joo Hyun-ho exit the driver\u2019s seat.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cDetectives, you\u2019ve worked hard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Jong-wook as well.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cNo! Then come in!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> All the evidence had been collected from the scene of the incident, including the dust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk pulled out the investigation file from his bag.\u00a0</span>The evidence was placed according to where they were found.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho scanned the investigation file and pointed to where the body was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Then I\u2019ll be looking at this. Sunbae should recreate how the body was found over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hey! Why should I recreate it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It is needed for the investigation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Sheesh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk grumbled, but reluctantly followed Hyun-ho\u2019s instructions.\u00a0</span>If Hyun-ho didn\u2019t become a police officer, then he would be a criminal. However, Kang-suk had to recognize his abilities.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk lay down on the floor in the same shape that was drawn, bending his arms and body as much as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hahahaha! Sunbae! You look like a deep fried shrimp.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... This bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk got up and put Hyun-ho into a headlock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Keeek! \u00a0I-I surrender! Give up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I knew you would be like this. Are you a complete pervert?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"B-But I think I know how he killed them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk freed Hyun-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He knew how the victims had died.\u00a0</span>They had drunk a large amount of water, causing their breathing to be blocked and their internal organs to rupture. However, the mystery of how it happened was still unsolved. Yet, Joo Hyun-ho had solved it after only five minutes.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It seems like I did well to bring you over. Yes, Joo Hyun-ho brain cells are still working.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yep. Now leave it to me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho noted some of the evidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> First of all, the victim had been biting a long tube until she died, with leather straps tied around her neck.\u00a0</span>Finally, there was a bucket filled with various foreign substances.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The victim was in an immovable state with her arms tied behind her back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"That's right. He then forced them to drink a lot of water... Ah, damn. Crazy bastard. I will surely put him in jail!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk directed some killing\u00a0intent towards the criminal.\u00a0</span>However, Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s reasoning was just beginning.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Their neck was tied down with a leather strap, and the water was in the bathtub?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... I said it in the car.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Then that means that her head was completely submerged. If that was the case, then she should\u2019ve immediately drowned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"But she didn\u2019t die straight away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes. She was able to breathe in a certain amount of air through the tube, which could be referred to as a lifeline.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was a long, plastic tube found in the evidence, the victim holding it until the moment of her death.\u00a0</span>There were the clear teeth marks on one side.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"So, she struggled in a tied state...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The victim\u2019s body was full of small wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The coroner said that she was probably floundering about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes. It seems like the perpetrator blocked the tube connected to the victim\u2019s mouth and then released it, in order to enjoy her suffering.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Crunch.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk broke the file he was holding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Of course, the culprit wasn\u2019t satisfied with just that, so he used this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho pointed to the bucket next.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The capacity was one litre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The victim drank water desperately. Why? Well, just imagine it. The victim\u2019s eyes are covered and her body is tied up. The culprit then blocks the tube to make her choke.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk\u2019s face turned red as he desperately tried to hold back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Then the bucket appeared. There was clearly liquid in here. Water wasn\u2019t the only liquid in her body, was it? Milk, soy sauce... There was also cooking oil. This is the reason why.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho put the tube in the bucket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"One litre. She had to desperately drink it all in order to breathe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> First was milk.\u00a0</span>Then there was soy sauce. Finally, the cooking oil. He gave her increasingly hard things to drink.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Despite being nauseated, she had to drink in order for her to breathe.\u00a0</span>Desperately...</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"If she drank it all, then she could breathe again. That\u2019s why the bucket was empty at the moment of death. And...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> This time, Hyun-ho put the tube in the bathtub.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Lastly, the hippo placed the tube here. The victim started to drink litres of water that she couldn\u2019t finish. In the end...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The stomach became engorged, and the victim drank water until the moment of death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> All this was done in order to live?\u00a0</span>If she drank one litre of water then she could breathe. Just one more sip... If she took one more sip, then she could breathe. She believed in something that hadn\u2019t been promised, and drank the water in the bathtub. And in the end...</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The desperate act of trying to live drove herself to her ultimate death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"This crazy bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk howled like a beast at the terrible truth.\u00a0</span>The hippo used the victim\u2019s will to live as a murder tool.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"My reasoning is up to here. Uh, by the way, there is salt. Then, the last thing the victim drank was salt water? What was he thinking when he made her drink that? Sunbae...? Um. I will tell you my profile after you calm down a bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk was ready to shoot a gun if the hippo appeared in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Eventually, he settled down after 30 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I'm sorry. I was a little excited.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"No problem, Sunbae. I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ve figured out about the hippo now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho gave his rough profile containing the hippo\u2019s age and personality to Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> After finishing, Hyun-ho said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cMy job is over. Now it is Sunbae\u2019s turn. Please catch the killer. Ah right. This is a personal favor. Once you arrest him, can you leave the psychological analysis to me? I\u2019m interested in the criminal called the hippo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho laughed like he was happy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk replied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... That isn\u2019t hard. But I don\u2019t know if the bastard will be able to speak properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> If Kang-suk caught him, then there would be a punch in the face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk\u2019s eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><br/><p>@</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There were only two days left until the next full moon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk knew who the hippo was, his job, what he looked like, what he liked, all of those things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The problem was that he knew the hippo too well.\u00a0</span>He knew information that only the hippo would know. If he wasn\u2019t careful, then he might be framed as the hippo.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I have to avoid being falsely accused, no matter what.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk laughed bitterly as he thought of the identity of the hippo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk knew where he was. If he beat the hippo\u2019s head with the iron pipe and took him to the police station, then the murders would no longer happen.\u00a0</span>However, there was no evidence that he was the hippo, meaning there would be no reason to hold the hippo.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The most obvious thing to do was to catch him attempting to commit a crime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He had packed a few hidden cameras from the voyeur incident a while ago so they would be very useful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk smiled at the hidden cameras on the table.\u00a0</span>Then he would go and install these at the hippos\u2019 third crime scene...</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> At this moment, Tae-hyuk realized that he had forgotten one important thing.\u00a0</span>He couldn\u2019t remember the exact place of the crime.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cWait a minute. Obviously the hippo killed the third time at the... Ugh, damn. It was definitely an aquarium. I don\u2019t remember the exact aquarium!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk looked at the blacklist. The exact name wasn\u2019t written down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well, there aren\u2019t many aquariums. Eh? Wait a minute. Aquariums are even open at night. It isn\u2019t a place to commit a crime, even if there are no customers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The hippo didn\u2019t kill the victims instantly. He enjoyed watching them die slowly.\u00a0</span>If so, doing it in an aquarium would be impossible.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk connected to the Internet on his smartphone and searched for an aquarium that wasn\u2019t open.\u00a0</span>There was only one place.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk checked the location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The aquarium was approximately five kilometres from his home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... Isn\u2019t this closer than I thought?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was around 15 bus stops away. In such a nearby place, a bizarre murder would take place two days later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThen tonight, I will go and install the trap.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk had no intention of ending it with the camera alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He had the crime skills to help him.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Something....\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike the other attributes he had gained so far, the performance was quite ambiguous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The good news was that it was possible to turn it on and off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Eh? Wait a minute. Can I designate the opponent?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes gleamed as he discovered an additional explanation at the bottom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the story was different. </span><span style=\"\">If Damage to Both Sides was used, doing damage to one person would inflict it on the other.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The scale was exactly 5:5.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was an attribute that would increase the use of the Violence skill if used well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'But in order to damage the other person, the conditions have to be satisfied?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror to check what the conditions were, and then licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Cancel what I said about this being useful... What, these conditions are crazy.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Tae-hyuk was looking at the new attribute, Big Brother had completely broken the mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom\u2019s provocation seemed better than he thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Big Brother started to unleash his anger on the hostages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKid. I said that I would spare you sister if you shot yourself in the belly? That is cancelled. If you want to complain, blame Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother\u2019s eyes were full of madness.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wouldn\u2019t be strange if he killed all the hostages right now.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Min Soo-young wept and clung to his leg.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...P-Please, s-spare... I-I will die. R-Right now...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then she pulled up her clothes and revealed her belly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother looked at her in surprise.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like she really would kill herself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a very interesting situation for him since the sacrifice was nothing but hypocrisy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would have been able to play more if it wasn\u2019t for Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother kicked Min Soo-young\u2019s belly like it was annoying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her body curved like a bow and a sharp scream emerged, but this wasn\u2019t the end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother grabbed her head and slammed it against the floor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a cracking sound and blood rushed out from Min Soo-young\u2019s nose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Keeok, augh... Keook...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019ve just come up with a good idea. I will give you the pleasure of killing your sister directly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Min Soo-young tried to somehow save her sister.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, she didn\u2019t release the gun in her hand even when she was kicked and her face slammed against the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother grabbed Min Soo-young\u2019s shoulder firmly so that she couldn\u2019t resist.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The other hand grabbed her right arm that was holding the pistol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he slowly turned the muzzle towards her little sister.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... No, do...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Min Soo-young tried desperately to resist but her body didn\u2019t budge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cU-Unni...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the muzzle arrived directly in front of Min Soo-yeon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If she pulled the trigger, then her sister\u2019s life would be taken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUwah... Euh...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Min Soo-young finally gave up resisting and closed her eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t want to see her sister dying in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aigoo. You shouldn\u2019t miss something this good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But Big Brother was persistent to the end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He forced open Min Soo-young\u2019s eyes so that the sight in front of her would be imprinted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now. Pull this and there will be a very impressive scene. Don\u2019t worry. You will soon follow your little sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother put his finger on the trigger and pulled.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tatang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bullet fired from the muzzle struck the wall above Soo-yeon\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What, did she avoid the attack just now?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother glared at the man who had pushed Soo-yeon out of the way.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was the only one who knew what that person did.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He mixed in with the hostages and popped out like lightning when the trigger was pulled and kicked Min Soo-yeon\u2019s legs, making her fall to the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As a result, she was bleeding from the nose like her sister, but she was able to avoid being shot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother looked at the man with a strange expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What, this guy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the other person\u2019s response was too early, then Big Brother would\u2019ve seen it and changed the direction of the muzzle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he was too late, then the girl\u2019s head would literally be like a cracked watermelon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was impossible for a human to react that fast when a bullet was shot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm... How did you notice the moment of attack?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Min Soo-young\u2019s gun was loaded with 5.56mm bullets that had a speed of 945 meters per second.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a tremendous speed that was three times the speed of sound.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was normal for the head to already burst the moment the firing sound was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That meant the other person knew exactly when he was shooting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But was that possible?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother looked at the opponent like he had seen a magic trick.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are the one who was with Shin Se-ho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the one who urinated himself after being threatened with a few bullets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, it must just be a coincidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is funny. Very funny! Kuhaha! You made me feel very amused!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was lucky with the first bullet, but Big Brother still had many bullets remaining.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if he shot everyone here 10 times, he would still have some left.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother laughed crazily and aimed the muzzle again at Min Soo-yeon who was rolling on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let\u2019s see if you can avoid it again this time. Of course, such a coincidence won\u2019t be repeated twice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had protected his body with a specially made reinforced suit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In such a situation, murdering other people gave him a pleasure which couldn\u2019t be explained by words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But what are you going to do after killing everyone here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother thought he heard wrong for a moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That crazy bastard was making strange noises as he was staring straight into Big Brother\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are many police officers outside who are trying to save the hostages. If the hostages are alive then there is a possibility of escape. But that will change if they are all dead. So how are you doing to run away?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhuhu... A rat is worried about a cat. If you have questions, then I\u2019ll let you know in the afterlife. At the very least, you should know why you died. I came here to catch the Phantom. Well, do you already know that much? Whether successful or not, a helicopter is going to pick me up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is great, but what should I do? I blew up your rescue helicopter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The pilot\u2019s name is Wei Chang.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis bastard... How do you know that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard put his hand into his clothes and pulled out something white.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom mask? D-Don\u2019t tell me...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do I still look like your hostage?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confused Big Brother slowly counted the number of hostages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were 30 people, and he killed 11 rebellious ones, so 19 people should be remaining.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But no matter how much he counted, the number remained the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c2-20?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I told you. I came here to kill you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard who put on the mask was Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuhahahaha! You walked in here of your own volition.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother picked up the submachine gun that he had left in the corner.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the German-made MP5 that boasted high precision and reliability. It was used in numerous special forces and counter-terrorist units since the 1970s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of them were retired and disappeared into history, but they were still active in the mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The incredible capacity to fire 800 shots per minute meant that it couldn\u2019t even be compared to a pistol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were 30 bullets in 6 cartridges, too much just to kill one person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The whole body would turn into a bloody mess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk told the hostages to gather in one corner of the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you don\u2019t want to be killed by blind bullets then you should all fall to the ground.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uack, aaaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hostages screamed and fell to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like you are planning something interesting, but let\u2019s see if you can survive the first hail of bullets.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Violence has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-An iron pipe is equipped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother pulled the trigger of the MP5.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Dududududu!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In an instant, 30 bullets fired towards Tae-hyuk as the magazine became completely empty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Sixth Sense has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I see the attacks!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sixth Sense allowed Tae-hyuk to feel where the attacks were coming from.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The trajectory of the bullets became a red line in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? B-Blood?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother stared at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Violence allowed him to increase his strength and agility by a certain extent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The higher his stats, the greater the increase.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk currently had 50 agility.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Since it was amplified, it was possible for him to move beyond human limits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the power of the submachine gun was also enormous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even with the help of Violence, he couldn\u2019t avoid all bullets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s shoulders and thighs were soaked with blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are confidently barging in. However, you should realize that you can\u2019t hurt me just by avoiding those bullets.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used all the abilities of Violence, but it was just to avoid the opponent\u2019s attacks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The first one to succumb in the end would be Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk was still smiling with a relaxed face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCheckmate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In no time, Tae-hyuk had reached closed enough to stretch out and touch Big Brother\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahat! I don\u2019t know what construction site you picked up that pipe at. However, you won\u2019t be able to hurt me with it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother wore a reinforced suit that even blocked bullets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But I can touch you at this distance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk struck Big Brother\u2019s shoulder like he was a quarterback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuahaha! You approached me to do this. It is an attack like a mosquito!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now the armour protecting you has disappeared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said and Hyung-nim looked down at his body,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN-No?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reinforced suit he had been wearing had disappeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk threw Big Brother\u2019s reinforced suit, that he had taken with Robbery, into the corner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now let\u2019s try this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he struck Big Brother with the iron pipe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a blow with enough power to shatter asphalt at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t know what you did to take off my reinforced suit, but I wouldn\u2019t be a killer of the Triads if I relied on body armour.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His strike didn\u2019t work.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother grabbed the iron pipe with his right arm and lifted it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It looks like this time it is my checkmate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk groaned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother smiled with satisfaction.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Instead of the sub-machine gun, he pulled out a familiar handgun and pointed it at Tae-hyuk\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, say your last words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he pulled the trigger now, the opponent\u2019s head will smash along with the phantom mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke in a calm voice, even with the muzzle touching his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is there someone you are willing to risk your life to save?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you saying?

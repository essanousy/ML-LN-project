The opponent installed booby traps in the building and completely blocked all access routes. He has a M60 machine gun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The commandos leader felt dizzy at the report from his deputy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What about the damage to us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Two people slightly wounded... Four people severely wounded... Fortunately, there were no casualties.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How can you say that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....I'm really sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The number of enemies was at most three.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, 6 of the 12 people had come back with injuries?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The nation\u2019s largest counterterrorism force...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The deputy started making excuses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a structure that is difficult to break into, due to the narrow passages inside. Furthermore, the opponent isn\u2019t a mere terrorist. The machine gun was aimed precisely at areas where there was no protective clothing. Furthermore, there aren\u2019t just machine guns, but rifles and shotguns...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop your excuses. Prepare a second team to strike. Why isn\u2019t Detective Cho Kang-suk coming!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only two people who could get in touch with Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of them was being held inside the building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then somebody blocking the scene cried out loudly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDetective Cho Kang-suk has arrived!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The commandos leader looked at the place where the voice was heard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The person he had been waiting for rushed in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry. I am late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Detective Cho Kang-suk was accompanied by Investigator Joo Hyun-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a criminal profiler and came along for negotiations with the criminal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho asked the deputy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There isn't much\u00a0time left until the killer kills the first hostage?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, that\u2019s right. There is 10 minutes and 20 seconds left.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. You should try to contact Phantom, and I will buy as much time as possible by trying to communicate with the criminal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The commandos leader nodded favourably at Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So can you contact Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am trying. He seems to be in a place with no radio waves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hu... I don\u2019t know why innocent civilians need to get involved in the power struggle between criminals. Anyway, Investigator Joo Hyun-ho should buy as much time as possible. There will soon be a second attempt to penetrate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s face turned pale.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard that there are 30 hostages. If you try to break through with force, won\u2019t they be harmed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a shame for me as well. However, we are bound by the rule to not negotiate with terrorists. There needs to be some sacrifices.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s face distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They should think of the people\u2019s lives as the top priority.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the hostages were treated like obstacles in the way of catching a terrorist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The commandos leader noticed Kang-suk\u2019s atmosphere and tried to appease him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In the first place, I think that people who work in a place like the karaoke bars are wrong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was counterproductive.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Cho Kang-suk\u2019s anger exploded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The police isn\u2019t here to kill terrorists, but to protect the people!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The face of the commandos leader turned red.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk was obviously right.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he would be broken if he was too upright.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to live in this world, sometimes a moderate compromise was needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk realized that he had shouted at someone higher than him and bowed his head,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....I'm sorry. I am a little agitated.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. It is too cruel for a man like you to live in this world. Anyway, please try to reach Phantom as soon as possible.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk wanted to go inside and save the hostages if he could, but he couldn\u2019t do that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, ah! Why isn\u2019t the call going throu...eh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Did you contact Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems like it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although it wasn\u2019t a phone call, Phantom had sent him a text message.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho and the commandos leader gathered around Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026The culprit is a killer sent by the Triads, and there is only one person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha... A single person did all this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk ignored the commandos leader and continued to read Phantom\u2019s message.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He has already killed 10 hostages. There is a danger that they will all be wiped out if you try to forcefully enter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gathered people groaned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If all the hostages were killed then it meant the hostage taker would die.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">So why did he kill the hostages so easily?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were appalled when they imagined what was going on inside the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Breaching is forbidden. I am currently attempting contact. Oh, that is the end of the message.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The face of the commandos leader turned red after hearing the message.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant that if left to the commandos, the hostages would die so don\u2019t interfere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he suddenly realized something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wait. That meant the Phantom is inside there now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It seems like it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn. Does this makes sense? The blockade is so tight that not even a single ant can get in. How did he get in there?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gathered people gulped and looked at the building where the hostages were being held. </span><span style=\"\">Inside was the terrorist and the hostages...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">And Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk turned off his smartphone and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but I am listening to this conversation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had wiretapped the police and grasped their movements perfectly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Originally, he needed expensive frequency detection equipment, a solar panel that supported 24 hour power, and a remote control device in order to bug them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk had something better than a wiretapping device.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Everybody carried their phones around with them everywhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He installed a Chinese hacking tool that Moonlight Flower put in the smartphones of Cho Kang-suk, the commandos leader, and the police commissioner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could listen to their conversations in real time and see the contents of their phones.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, there were security programs, but they couldn\u2019t stop the hacking tools that cost tens of thousands of dollars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The only downside is the short shelf-life... Should I use this opportunity to learn cracking?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, sooner or later, he would have to visit China in order to deal with the Triads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be nice if he could meet their hackers and learn their skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk analyzed the opponent by combining the information that the police had with his own.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The conclusion that emerged was that he had absolutely no chance of winning in a frontal confrontation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if he had the crime skills, he would die if he was shot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, I\u2019m not an idiot to straight up fight a killer like in an action movie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk picked a suitable room and entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He looked at the things that were present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Laptop, camera, microphone, lights. Perfect.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had this equipment, then Internet broadcasting could be done anywhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Karaoke machines were installed in all rooms.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were LAN connected for song data updates.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The karaoke machines could be operated from the main counter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant he could broadcast a live video into the room of the killer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk connected the LAN connected laptop to the control unit at the counter and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI won\u2019t be able to receive any balloons. Isn\u2019t this Phantom\u2019s Internet debut?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother checked the time and spoke to the hostages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the promised execution time. Who should I kill?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then one of the hostages spoke in a quivering voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the unfortunate schoolgirl who was caught at the convenience store with her younger sister, Min Soo-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y-You\u2019ve already killed 10 people. Is that still not enough?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Moths flying into the fire isn\u2019t an execution. Yes. I\u2019ll kill you first.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Min Soo-young\u2019s face turned white.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cS-Spare me... I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Big Brother laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? I think your little sister is here with you. I\u2019ll let you live if you shoot her in the head. How about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soo-young\u2019s sister , Soo-yeon, who was two years younger than her, called out in a quivering voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cU-Unni... I-I don\u2019t want to die... Huh? U-Unni...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people grabbed each other\u2019s hands and stared into the other\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if it meant living, she couldn\u2019t kill her sister.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Soo-young spoke with determined eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I would rather die. Save my little sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh... This warm love between sisters, I like it. Then I will save your sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut I have one condition. The Yakuza cut their own belly to show their determination. Is it called harakiri? If you want to save your sister then shoot yourself with this. Then I will spare her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother pulled a gun from his waist and threw it towards Soo-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother laughed happily like he was enjoying this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soo-young picked up the gun and stared at the demon in front of her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Could she use this to kill the opponent?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That idea popped up but she shook her head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had seen the demon fighting the hostages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no way she could kill him with this small handgun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you make a fuss then I will blow a hole in your sister\u2019s head, so be sure to shoot at your belly button.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soo-young\u2019s body shook like it was cold.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After cram school was over, she was thirsty and went to buy some milk with her sister...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How did she end up in this situation?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Everything seemed unreal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If she closed her eyes then she might be able to return to reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSob... It isn\u2019t a dream...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In action movies, the protagonist could survive being shot with several bullets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Could she live like that?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With such hope, Soo-young aimed the muzzle of the gun at her stomach with trembling hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, reality wasn\u2019t that easy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once the 5.56mm bullet was fired, a hole the size of a finger would be made where the bullet entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be okay with just that.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the bullet fired from the pistol would rotate and damage the internal organs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It also wasn\u2019t uncommon for there to be an exit hole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a tool designed to kill people in the first place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Being shot in the belly would mean unconditional death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP-Please...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Please survive...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With that hope, Soo-young pulled the trigger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, she was about to pull it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">It seems like something interesting is happening.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The moment a man\u2019s voice was heard out of nowhere, Soo-young stopped her finger that was about to pull the trigger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother and the hostages looked in the direction of the voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A man in a phantom mask had appeared on the karaoke machine in the corner of the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The machine was hacked.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">All the systems in this place are in my hands.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">You should surrender, rather than try to resist.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother smiled and walked over to the monitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! It seems like you can hear my voice. You must have installed a bug somewhere. So what can you do? Huh? Are you going to pop out of the monitor like in a horror movie?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I\u2019ll show you proof that I am controlling all the systems.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the electricity in the room turned off.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The hostages shrieked as it suddenly became dark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother had several more pistols besides what he gave to Soo-young.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He fired towards the door.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-Hik!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Trying to take advantage of the uproar to flee. Yes. Try to do it again a second time. Huhuhu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man who tried to secretly open the door and run away stumbled back into the darkness of the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Less than 10 seconds later, the lights in the room turned on again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The monitor also turned back on.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-How is it?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">This is what I am capable of.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ridiculous. Don\u2019t think you can deal with me by limiting my vision. The darkness won\u2019t be able to stop me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even in the darkness, Big Brother had accurately aimed at the hostage trying to escape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I have a prophecy.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">You will die here today.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bullshit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother was provoked and fired a few bullets towards the monitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Smoke emerged and several pieces flew away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Listen carefully. Stop talking bullshit and appear in front of me right now, or I will kill one hostage every minute. Well, if other people die, then your ratings will fall to the bottom. It means I don\u2019t have to look at you anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother\u2019s words were only half right.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was obviously listening to his words, but it wasn\u2019t through a bug.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'By the way, he ruined the monitor after a little provocation. If I knew this earlier, then I would\u2019ve only recorded three minutes.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled bitterly from where he was hiding among the hostages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Anyway, the killer\u2019s brain is equivalent to Park Sung-kwang.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother thought he was having a real-time conversation with Phantom, but he was wrong.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had just played a pre-recorded video on the karaoke machine.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He entered the room when the electricity went out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now there were two hostages in the room with the same face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Big Brother was agitated and failed to notice it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had disguised himself as Kwon Joon-hyuk and hid inside.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother thought there were only helpless hostages here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was shouting at an illusion of Phantom without knowing that an assassin had come in to kill him.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

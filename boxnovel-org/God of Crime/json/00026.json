He felt sorry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha... Hello. I was just painting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The schoolgirl came in and examined him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you in the art department? I know that the art department was closed due to a lack of resources.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m just a student who is interested in painting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as innocently as possible. This was a workshop that he was barely able to find, so he didn\u2019t want to be kicked out of here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see. I\u2019m actually retired, but I was also in the art department. Are you in the first grade?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m in the second grade.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the first time I\u2019ve seen you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gave his pre-prepared excuse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I just transferred this week.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A transfer student! I am Lee Hana. If you are interested in the art department, then I will let you know the name of the teacher who is the adviser.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha... I will think about it. Oh right, my name is Lee Cheol-su.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gave her a pseudonym.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He met someone a few days after starting to work here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want to advertise that he wasn\u2019t a student at this school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana approached Tae-hyuk, then she laughed softly as she said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can I see what you are doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana looked at the painting that Tae-hyuk copied. Her face was filled with surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wah! Wah... Did you really paint this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am practicing drawing by copying art.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's really great! Have you ever gone to art school? I will go to the adviser immediately. We need such a talent in the art department!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana spoke excitedly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was silent for a moment. He had just copied the original with a skill, so it was strange to hear such praise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-It isn\u2019t that great. I merely copied the brushstrokes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t be shy! Well, if I look closer, then I can see that there are definitely a few missing details.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana squinted at Tae-hyuk\u2019s painting again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it not enough?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This figure is drawn with a simple technique, so you can never perfectly copy the original. It is withdrawn? Do you understand the difference between this painting and a withdrawn work?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shook his head. </span><span style=\"\">He was just a high school student who could use crime skills, and didn\u2019t have a profound knowledge on art.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana laughed like she was glad to discover a new talent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"While your painting doesn\u2019t have a soul, you have great technique. You literally copied the painting that you saw, but you won\u2019t be able to move the heart of the person who painted it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Soul?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Do you know what type of heart this painting was drawn with?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana pointed to the original painting that Tae-hyuk had copied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a landscape painting that depicted a forest where the falling rain had stopped, and a beam of light was shining through the clouds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk replied honestly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A wonderful landscape. It feels like a living forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Doesn\u2019t it? The rain has stopped, and the forest is full of life. It is a place that I really like. When I die, I would like to die in a place like this. Everything felt so vivid when I was painting it. I was so grateful to be alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, Tae-hyuk discovered a strange fact in Lee Hana\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, then Sunbae painted this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Omo, did you only just find out? It is something that I painted in my first year.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I only used it as a reference because I thought it was the best painting here. I didn\u2019t know that it was Sunbae\u2019s.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha. At any rate, bend the brush. I\u2019ll tell you about the brush strokes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From then on, Lee Hana\u2019s drawing lesson began.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk focused on her words, ignoring the notifications from the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could guess what the contents were.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While his skill was enough to copy the artwork, he learned that it was also important to read the heart of the picture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. It is already this time... I\u2019ll have to end here today. Think about what you have learned today, and you will know why the painting was drawn.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana gently winked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used the moment to quickly glance at the Demon Revealing Mirror, where numerous messages had appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your understanding of art has deepened.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Forgery skill proficiency has increased by a lot!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[More sophisticated work is now possible.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After checking the skill, his proficiency level had gone up by around 20 points. </span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t miss this good chance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk asked with a puppy-like expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you, Hana sunbae. Can I see you again next time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha! I'm a busy person. Well, it does feel good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hana laughed like she enjoyed it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was startled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of a sudden, he felt that Lee Hana\u2019s face was familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait. Surely she isn\u2019t that Lee Hana?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She reminded him of someone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was a genius female painter who became so famous that she held a solo exhibition in Paris in her early 20s.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is obviously the same name. She was primarily a landscape illustrator. Eh...? Don't tell me?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was famous for the dreamlike atmosphere of her paintings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait. Then I was copying the painting of a person like that?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt strange all of a sudden, as he never imagined that a celebrity would be so close.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had only been a few days since Tae-hyuk first held a paintbrush.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But now he had a discussion about painting with a genius painter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like practicing dribbling in front of Messi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I heard that she went straight to Europe after graduating from high school. I guess that is the reason why she seems to be so strangely relaxed for a third year in high school.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Lee Hana, and suddenly felt like there was a subtle halo around her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana waved her hand as she turned around to leave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wahahat ~ ah, that\u2019s right. There are rumours that a stalker is wandering around the school. Have you ever seen someone suspicious lately?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stalker?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. They say he is a voyeur.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I haven\u2019t seen anyone suspicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk replied with a face that made it seem like he didn\u2019t know anything. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, he was the most suspicious person in this school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you find something then please tell me. If the incident becomes bigger and the police comes, then this place might be closed down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis would be difficult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Right? I think so as well! Hahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana laughed and exited.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Tae-hyuk was sure that she was gone, his smile disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stalker or a voyeur.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana spoke calmly but he got the impression that she was nervous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he had never seen such a person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he had some ideas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then, the eyes looking at me...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The mystery was unravelled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk searched the art room, and noticed several hidden cameras that were installed throughout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhuhuhu. I got the bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was what had been missing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He discovered traces of the crime, and received a message about a new skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Crime Skill: X-ray Vision has been learnt.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- You can see through things (this doesn\u2019t apply to creatures).</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The criteria to fully learn it has yet to be met.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-A skill has already been registered in the temporary skill window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If you are register a new skill, then the existing skill will disappear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk almost screamed at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">X-ray Vision!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was literally a man\u2019s romance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Crazy, my heart!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He cried out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was impossible to make a living with X-ray Vision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, that\u2019s why it was better.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could literally see through the clothes that people were wearing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ohu, ohuhuhu, ohahahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The feature was so perfect that Tae-hyuk felt like crying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He then recalled the last messages on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a minute. There is something strange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was so excited about the X-ray Vision skill that he hadn\u2019t properly read the rest of the message.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt anxious and confirmed it in the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His face fell like a dog that had been neutered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... I have to give up Forgery to learn X-ray Vision?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the limit of temporary registration. The skill was temporary, so if he learned a new one, the existing skill would disappear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would miss the opportunity to learn it forever.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ugh, no! Then, is it asking me to choose between X-ray Vision and Forgery?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like choosing between jajangmyeon and jjampong.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a fateful decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip. X-ray Vision was a skill that couldn\u2019t be abandoned. But Forgery...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ugh, damn! What is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s hands hovered over X-ray Vision, which he had always desired.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He then stabbed his thigh with a sharp brush tip.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He felt as if his spirit had come back due to the shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Goodbye, my pink life...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t give up Forgery that had over 50 proficiency points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eventually, Tae-hyuk tearfully abandoned the X-ray Vision skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sat in the chair for a while with a sense of emptiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even though I didn\u2019t get it... I will catch the strange voyeur.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were rumours of a voyeur. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe he wasn\u2019t enjoying it alone, but was spreading it on the Internet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the incident became bigger, then the police would be dispatched, which would result in an almost 100% chance of this place being closed down.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They would search through everything to collect evidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had only just found this workshop. Besides, he was able to raise his proficiency at a high speed due to Lee Hana.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was unable to abandon this place. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For one thing, he would never do anything completely selfless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put away his brushes and paints and stood up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He set up a trap to catch the enemy.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

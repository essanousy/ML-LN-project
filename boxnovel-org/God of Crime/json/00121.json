You made sure to keep the promise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Kang-suk as they rode the boat leaving Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He seemed deep in thought and showed no reaction to Tae-hyuk\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The reply came from a man in a trench coat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Phantom? No, should I call you Kim Cheol-su? The promise compensation will be guaranteed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. I hope something like last time isn\u2019t planned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The expression and tone of words was so creepy that Joo Hyun-ho couldn\u2019t help gulping.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That face was a fake that was created.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was it like the special makeup used to shoot movies?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would know clearly if he touched it, but unfortunately he didn\u2019t have that courage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho smiled and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It\u2019s not like you will be caught if that happens again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gave a meaningful smile instead of answering.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Hyun-ho felt regret.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a specialist in terms of identifying the criminal\u2019s feelings and analyzing them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t show it, but he was very proud of that fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But Kim Cheol-su...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, he couldn\u2019t tell anything about Phantom despite questioning him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, this wasn\u2019t enough to make Hyun-ho give up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom, whom he wanted to meet so much, was within a touching distance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He needed to at least find out what midnight snack Phantom liked to eat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"By the way, do you know Shin Chang-ho?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The name is famous, so I\u2019ve heard it a few times. But is the commissioner healthy these days?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He has a pollen allergy so it is a little tough... Hup.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho realized that he made a mistake while talking about the police commissioner\u2019s recent problem.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Conversely, he was the one being interrogated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was a rudimentary mistake that showed the other person wasn\u2019t a beginner. Hyun-ho\u2019s eyes trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Hyun-ho panicked, Tae-hyuk gazed at the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror floating in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Isn\u2019t this a completely fraudulent skill?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He rolled his eyes and gazed at the Demon Revealing Mirror again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a detailed description of the abilities and current psychological state of Joo Hyun-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[No... It seems like the commissioner\u2019s secret mission is a bust...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the ability of the [Hawk Eyes] attribute.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took advantage of it so that Hyun-ho would make mistakes that he wouldn\u2019t normally make.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t been possible to use it until now because he needed 10 affinity points to acquire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he gained those missing points with the end of the prison war.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He guessed it was because he saved Park Sung-yul, who Shin Chang-ho was supposed to kill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018But when I think about it, two points were added.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He only got eight points for dealing with the Triads killer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he got two points for saving Park Sung-yul\u2019s life.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He thought that he got affinity points by saving the lives of people who were destined to die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'But the first one is too low, while the second incident gave too many points.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did Big Brother only kill eight more people in the future?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was still some uncertainty regarding the affinity points that strengthened crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Anyway, the characteristics of \u2018Hawk Eyes\u2019... This is the full jackpot!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he activated it, he could grasp the state of the opponent, almost like mind-reading.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the eyes of Hyun-ho, who didn\u2019t know about the crime skills, Phantom literally seemed like a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk, who was quietly sitting beside Hyun-ho, opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, I was able to finish the Park Sung-yul case due to Kim Cheol-su. Thank you very much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was true that they solved the crime with the help of a criminal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even though he solved a tough case, Cho Kang-suk didn\u2019t seem pleased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is no need for thanks. I am getting paid for this after all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If it wasn't for your help, it wouldn\u2019t have been so easy to find the identity of the victims.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The image of the landlord after they found her daughter popped up in Kang-suk\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now Park Sung-yul would pay for his sins.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All of it was due to Phantom\u2019s help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Kang-suk made a subtle facial expression, Joo Hyun-ho suddenly interrupted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"By the way, the investigation headquarters is having a get together next week. Kim Cheol-su, why don\u2019t you come? You were also crucial in solving this case. Furthermore, it will be very entertaining if you join...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk applied a headlock to the smiling Hyun-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a bit much to recommend Phantom attend a party with cops who were trying to catch him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. A dinner party. Not bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you see? Phantom thinks it is a good idea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Unfortunately, it will become a crime if I attend, so I have to politely refuse.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"O-Of course... Keok! S-Sunbae! I really will die!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! Cheol-su. Forget about this idiot\u2019s words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, Kang-suk and Hyun-ho didn\u2019t correctly interpret Phantom\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom literally meant those words, since it was illegal for a minor to attend a drinking party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Time passed by like the wind, and it had already been a week since Tae-hyuk returned from Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He lied that he was studying abroad for one month, so there were no problems at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Forgery meant that he could come up with the necessary documents.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wondered about what had happened while he was away, since he gave some instructions to Kang Han-seong.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They did better than he thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though Tae-hyuk had the crime skills, he was only one person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could cover that disadvantage with them and the Bomber\u00a0to some extent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll have to use it often in the future. Are these clothes enough?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled at his appearance in the mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had returned to his original appearance after looking like Kim Cheol-su for one month.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the outfit he was wearing was slightly different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was wearing a dark blue suit instead of his normal skinny jeans and leather jacket.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Every year in spring, the three siblings would participate in a family event, and he was currently dressed up for it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tae-hyuk! Are you ready?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s voice was heard outside his door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk flicked back his long bangs and exited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran and Tae-min, who were ready to attend the event, were waiting at the front door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-min pouted and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat man takes longer to get ready than a woman? Detective Cho Kang-suk is waiting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed at his brother\u2019s reaction, whom he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the feeling that Tae-hyuk had returned to where he should be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have to say thank you to Kang-suk for driving us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hah! Ah right, did you remember to bring the barley tea for Detective-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! I nearly forgot! It is in the fridge. Can you take it out for me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw Ha-ran and Tae-min treating Kang-suk like family, Tae-hyuk realized that many things had changed in the past month.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk grabbed the bag on the floor and walked outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a shining new car.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The black sunglasses and white gloves made him look like a chauffeur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eh? Kang-suk hyung. When did you get a car?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Just recently. It is because I was sleeping at the office every day after missing the last train. I weighed the pros and cons and bought it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAye, isn\u2019t it for a different reason?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Really!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t ask anymore questions, although it seemed like Kang-suk bought it to go on dates with Ha-ran.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put his bag in the trunk and sat in the back seat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran carefully climbed into the front passenger seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKang-suk, thank you for doing this favor today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-min instantly started to question Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDetective-nim! You solved another case? It appeared on the news. You look very good on screen!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk laughed and started the car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Then don\u2019t forget your seat belts. We are departing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk drove the car in the warm sunshine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After an hour, the party was able to arrive at their destination.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once the left the city and arrived at a wooded place, the air was completely different.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran spoke cautiously from her seat next to Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have been very busy for a while... Thank you for taking us on such a long drive during your break.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk smiled gently and replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is nothing. I wanted to come with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took his bag from the trunk and headed for the familiar place that he visited every year.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a city run tomb where the ashes of the dead were kept.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk headed to the place where his parents\u2019 remains were.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t difficult to find the familiar names.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a good location, not too high or too low.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Seo Dae-han, Nam Ji-soo\u2019s Tomb]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a framed picture and placed it in front of the urns.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two people had been returning from the same workplace when they got into an accident.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He remembered Ha-ran\u2019s face when his parents were first brought here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">You will be together for the rest of eternity...</span></i><i><span style=\"\">After you die, stay on the royal floor.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tears had flowed from Ha-ran\u2019s eyes as she said this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk muttered quietly,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't worry. I will protect Noona and Tae-min no matter what. And...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eh? I\u2019ve already finished the preparations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSorry Tae-hyuk! Noona will do the rest!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rest of the group that arrived late started bustling around.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They spread a mat on the floor and placed the prepared food on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every year, on this day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the day to visit their deceased parents.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The family gathered together and had a good time sharing stories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKang-suk. Please try some fruit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. I need to do something first. I will eat the fruit later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk, who had been watching the family talking, got up from his seat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His black suit and sunglasses gave him a daunting appearance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he had a look of determination.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk stopped in front of the urns and slowly opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mother-nim, Father-nim. Nice to meet you. I am Cho Kang-suk and I work as a detective at Gangdong Police Station. Although I don\u2019t have anything else, I am confident that I can support Seo Ha-ran.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s face turned red as she watched from the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Omo, Kang-suk is really...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk slowly bowed to Seo Ha-ran\u2019s parents.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he declared with all his will.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will surely make Seo Ha-ran happy. Father-nim, Mother-nim. Please give me your daughter!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Detective-nim?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The family showed various reactions to Kang-suk\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk slowly got up and pulled out something from his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry Ha-ran. This should be done in a place with a little more atmosphere. Nevertheless, I wanted to greet Ha-ran\u2019s parents.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk gazed at Ha-ran with passionate eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he kneeled in front of Ha-ran and asked,\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a ring box on his palm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I felt something the moment that I met you. Will you please marry me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran stood without saying anything while Tae-hyuk interrupted the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wait a minute, Kang-suk hyung. You shouldn\u2019t do this yet. I wish you would have consulted me on such an important matter. How can you even propose this way? You should at least rent a five star lounge and do a romantic event... Ah! I don't know! Noona! Erase this day from your head. You will meet again next week. In the meantime, I will surely educate...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran, who was standing quietly for a while, suddenly threw herself into Kang-suk\u2019s arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! I will!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Tae-hyuk\u2019s mind, he had the perfect proposal planned for Cho Kang-suk and Seo Ha-ran, yet Kang-suk had destroyed it all at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUgh... If you accept... The precious proposal... My plan... Ah, ahhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk literally fell to the ground and moaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk placed the ring on Ha-ran\u2019s left ring finger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, the two people promised to marry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk laughed excitedly and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, everybody must be hungry. Let\u2019s go eat meat! How about beef? Meat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk rose from his seat with a sigh.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The situation was good for both parties so there was nothing he could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk realized that his plan was a success.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With this, Kang-suk was now part of the family of three.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unlike the previous life filled with despair, he had changed their fates perfectly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk\u2019s chest warmed, the Demon Revealing Mirror screen appeared in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"><span>[4]</span></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You can use the affinity points to enhance crime skills or activate hidden attributes.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What?

The armed forces are fearsome. Are they trying to fight a war here? And where the hell did they all come from?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi Takeshi, who also attended, asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou must be Takeshi.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. You really do have a lot of courage.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he conversed with Yamaguchi Takeshi, he could feel Caterina\u2019s gaze behind her cat mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk turned towards her and smiled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was almost like they were long-lost lovers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Caterina\u2019s body started to tremble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk have to forcibly restrain himself from laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'People are against Phantom so I have to use everything I can.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the people gathered and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like everyone has listened to the conditions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The conditions for participating in the mafia game were easy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Each team would have two people, the boss and their aide. They couldn\u2019t bring any weapons that could be used to attack the other teams. Chips purchased with cash would be used to play the games.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, the team that gained the most money would be given Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The winner could decide whether Phantom lived or died, or if they wanted an alliance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng, who was wearing a leopard mask, asked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But what happens if I do win? There is no guarantee that you will keep the promise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t worry about that. The people over there are recording this. I am sending it to you in real time so you don\u2019t have to worry about the promise being broken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom beckoned and a handful of cameramen wearing Phantom masks waved as they stepped through the door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was fantastic timing, as if they had been waiting outside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was actually Shin Se-ho and his people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng nodded and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Certainly, it is due to your popularity with the public that you have gotten this far. If the promise is broken, then we can release the video. Then you will no longer have your Phantoms.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I am putting the phantom mask as a symbol.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I understand. I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Takeshi turned to the other bosses and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Before we play the games, let\u2019s start with a simple self introduction. Isn\u2019t it too childish to refer to each other by the masks?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng nodded and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Li Zheng. This is Jin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jin was a huge, muscular man. It seemed like he would be able to win in a fight with a bear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yamaguchi Takeshi, head of the Yamaguchi clan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am Mister Park.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, the group\u2019s gaze turned to Caterina.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As the only woman in the room, they knew that she was the boss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCaterina. And this is Semon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng murmured in a slightly higher pitched voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is true that Russia is ruled by a queen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Takeshi showed interest in Semon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSemon, the merchant of death? If we weren\u2019t meeting in this place then I would have a proposal for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We can talk about a deal next time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once Tae-hyuk tapped his fingers, several dealers came out with glasses of champagne.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Caterina was the only one to accept it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Takeshi muttered with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are dealers. This is temporary, but everything needed for a casino is here. Where did you find a place like this? It seems like you have avoided police surveillance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk just smiled instead of answering.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Where did it come from? This is yours.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After all, the Yakuza were the ones behind the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yet Yamaguchi Takeshi was the one who asked him this question.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was indeed ironic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s aides pulled out some bags.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They contained the chips that would be used here today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The limit is up to one billion won. How much do you want to purchase?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the aides in charge of the exchange asked, the lieutenants opened their bags immediately.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The money inside was exactly one billion won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Takeshi muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are smart. If you did set a limit then I would\u2019ve definitely won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had tremendous assets and the chairmen of big companies under him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Casino games were a huge advantage for the rich.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For reference, the money they were spending now would become Tae-hyuk\u2019s pocket money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like his savings account.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if he paid the dealers and cameramen a 10 million won share, he still had 2.9 billion won left.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like winning Lottery 1 at least 10 times.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A person could live their whole lives on that money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had earned it purely through using Phantom as a symbol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'There was a time when I wanted to catch a pickpocket for the bounty. This is a new experience.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Three teams bought one billion won each for a total of three billion won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was literally a huge sum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Can I get Ha-ran noona good marriage gifts with this much money?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was enough money for one person\u2019s whole life, but he didn\u2019t intend to end it here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have no intention of leaving it like this. I will also get my hands on the gold.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lieutenants started to collect the chips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">From now on, they had to earn more money than the other teams.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The first one to make a suggestion was Mister Park.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Surely there aren\u2019t things like slot machines or roulette here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm... Isn\u2019t it still early?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two ways to increase the chips here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Play the prepared casino games to make money, or play against other people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, the latter option was more efficient.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they won, they would increase their money while the participants would have their money reduced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Yakuza were confident in psychological warfare so they made the suggestion first.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Caterina said with a smile,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, I would like to try my luck on roulette.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park was the one who made the suggest but the reply came from Takeshi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is no need. The games to be played from now on don\u2019t involve luck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm, no way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is just building up numbers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat card game?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou know about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a simple type of gambling that could be enjoyed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cards from 1-10 would be placed in a row and the dealer would place another card in the designated spot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The player would have to pick up the same card.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The interesting thing was if there was a draw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, the ante would be doubled and they would bet again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t it literally a game of luck?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Takeshi replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So I would like to add some unusual rules. This time, cards from 1-100 will be used. And when placing the card, the front will only be shown for one second. How about it? Doesn\u2019t it seem interesting?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a memory showdown.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It tested the opponent\u2019s abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you think, Young Lady?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina pondered for a moment before answering.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. What about those from China?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, the first round of the mafia game started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason why Yamaguchi suggested the number stacking game was simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a master of Karuta, a unique game in Japan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Karuta involved 100 Japanese cards spread out on the floor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When a moderator recited a poem, they had to find the card containing the latter part of the poem faster than their competitor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The game's winning strategy was to see all the cards on the floor and memorize everything in a short amount of time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was simple but required a lot of memory because the cards were mixed several times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi had a tremendous memory capacity that was close to a photographic memory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One second?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could remember at least 90% of the cards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The game was fast paced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Interestingly enough, the draws kept occurring.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Li Zheng was the first to be eliminated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn. Are these people monsters? My limit is memorizing around 50 cards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Remember 50 cards in one second was great.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Li Zheng knew this so he confidently accepted the game, but Yamaguchi and Caterina were monsters.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two of them kept the 1:1 wins until the 90th card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This will be a draw.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After counting the remaining cards, this was the result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was lucky.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people continued to compete.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then an amazing thing happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Caterina\u2019s winning streak began.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The funny thing about this game was that the first player could make money, but the second player would lose the most money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi\u2019s hands trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"D-Did you memorize all 100 in one second?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina said with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's see? I was just lucky.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi had a huge memory capacity that was close to a photographic memory.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Caterina had the ability to instantly remember everything she saw.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In other words, her abilities were superior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I think I lost this one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you for your efforts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina\u2019s money surpassed 1.5 billion in an instant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Li Zheng had 900 million and Yamaguchi had 600 million.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for the second game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Caterina made a suggestion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I got a lot of money from stacking numbers so I\u2019ve run out of steam. Grandpa can choose the next game.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The expression disappeared from Yamaguchi\u2019s face as he heard those words from a girl young enough to be his granddaughter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he wasn\u2019t the type to be agitated by something like this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Rather, his head turned quicker in a situation like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow about Blackjack?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Okay.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat sounds good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a confrontation with the dealer, so there wouldn\u2019t be any big changes in the rankings.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was still early in the game so the 2nd place Li Zheng didn\u2019t feel any sense of crisis.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi was planning to use his winning method in the third game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He quietly sent a signal to Mister Park.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Mister Park pulled a cigarette out of his pocket and started to light it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The dealer walked up to him and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess your boss has no rule about smoking in his presence. However, don\u2019t go too far. Let\u2019s just stick to one cigarette.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes. I\u2019ll do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park smiled widely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This tobacco contained a special incense that blurred a person\u2019s judgement.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was something that was almost completed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It boasted a performance that couldn\u2019t be compared to what the Death Circus used.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">People without immunity would easily be brainwashed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was the result of years of research.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hu... It is good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would make the dealers go on their side.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now all of the games against the dealers would end with their victory.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How much did it cost to join here?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he doubted they had prepared enough to win.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Can I put it on the table?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span>Now he was ready to play this game.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cA mirror? No, it doesn't matter.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk checked his hand, revealing Two aces and a King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018They gave me very good cards.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was the best beginning, but also the worst one.\u00a0</span>He now had to reveal one of the three cards that he received.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Seven Card Stud Poker was a game where he couldn\u2019t get a lot of money based on only good cards.\u00a0</span>Most of the cards were revealed. If an opponent\u2019s hand was overwhelmingly stronger than one\u2019s own hand, then a majority of players would forfeit early. Even if he completed the hand, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get anything out of it but the most basic of bets.</p><br/><p>He had to win while raising the stakes as much as possible. That was the way to get a lot of money.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'If I reveal the King in this situation, then it is like I am telling them that I have a pair of Aces. \u00a0However, it is even worse to reveal the Ace here.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer gave this type of hand to check for Tae-hyuk\u2019s ability.\u00a0</span>In this case, skilled card cheats would boldly reveal the Ace. Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t care about his poker face as he showed the King, receiving his next card.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Once again, it was a King. With the fourth card, his two pairs were completed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Please make a bet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Wow, that is nice. Hehe... I will go half!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> That meant that he would bet half as much as the current bet on the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The total amount was huge.\u00a0</span>There were five bundles of one million won on the table. In the end, Tae-hyuk added another 2.5 million won. If they accepted, then the stakes would increase tremendously.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> However, experienced gamblers could completely predict the hand of their opponent just by looking at the open cards and the bet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Aigoo. I am being killed from beginning to end, so I will just forfeit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I will also forfeit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Forfeit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> With the exception of the dealer, all of the other players forfeited.\u00a0</span>In that case, Tae-hyuk would only receive the basic betting amount, even if he got a good hand.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You have a good hand, congratulations. I am curious about the completion, so I will stay with you until the end. I will bet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was one of the boss\u2019 privileges to ignore half-bets and to only add the base amount of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Give me the next card.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> In the end, Tae-hyuk received an Ace and finished with a full house.\u00a0</span>Tae-hyuk won seven million won in an instant.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018There is a trick of losing money to the opponent, and then taking their entire fortune.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk had been watching the other players on the table as soon as the hand started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018I thought they were just guests, but everyone here is a card cheat. I will receive a triple whammy. Are they trying to make me into a beggar? By the way, the Gambling skill...is amazing!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The Gambling skill alone had no power, but if he activated the skill along with all his other skills, then he would be optimized for gambling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He literally became a card cheat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018I can see the opponent\u2019s hand with the Spying skill, draw my desired hand with the Robbery skill, and put on a professional poker face with the Voice Modulation skill. In addition, with the Forgery skill, I can manipulate the cards in my hand...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It would literally be a strange situation if he lost.\u00a0</span>However, the opponents were also card cheats, and Tae-Hyuk didn\u2019t know the extent of their strengths. He had to remain vigilant.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk laughed exaggeratedly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAhaha! I was lucky.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The professional gamblers made dying sounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAigoo! You are too strong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I have to try not to lose all my money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The card cheats were all acting in order to receive money from Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span>However, they weren\u2019t the only predators here.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Shall we start the next hand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> With the use of Voice Modulation, Tae-hyuk simulated the voice of an excited, young man. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The game began.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Half. Is anybody else coming along?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cKuoong!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk dominated the next four hands at the table.\u00a0</span>Two full houses and one four of a kind. He also got a straight. The other players couldn\u2019t follow through to the end, and most of them had to forfeit.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> One cheater signalled to the dealer.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-What?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Wasn\u2019t he supposed to lose for the first time?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer shook his head desperately, meaning that that he didn\u2019t do it.\u00a0</span>He hadn\u2019t subtracted any cards, so it was just pure luck that Tae-hyuk had completed a good hand.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Was it beginner\u2019s luck?\u00a0</span>If they lost any more money, then the situation might become irreversible.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The cheaters eventually decided to use their techniques.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-It can't be helped.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Give him a bad hand!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He gave Tae-hyuk a 2, 4 and a 5.\u00a0</span>Next up was a 6. The opponent would keep calling to the end, hoping for a last chance. In the end, he would become bankrupt due to the incomplete straight.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The cheaters doubled and half raised the ante. Tae-hyuk followed along faithfully.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Finally, the last hidden card remained, with the pot closing up to 100 million.\u00a0</span>It was impossible to know if Tae-hyuk had completed the straight or not.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> A cheater said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHyung, should we eat from the same table as someone who is trying for a straight?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHrmm. I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t complete the straight. Either way, I will call.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"T-This bastard...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> A curse emerged from the mouth of a cheater.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk bluffed against himself.\u00a0</span>If it wasn\u2019t for the dealer, then the cheaters might have been deceived by his acting. However, all of the cheaters knew Tae-hyuk\u2019s hand. In the end, the straight wasn\u2019t completed.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There wouldn\u2019t even be a single pair, resulting in a garbage hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I also call. Shall I now hand out the hidden card?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer handed each of the players a card.\u00a0</span>In the end, Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t forfeit.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The cheaters smiled with satisfaction.\u00a0</span>The three of them had joined together to trick the beginner. In the end, he would open the hidden card, and realize that his choices were wrong. He would fall into the swamp of despair.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Then everyone is waiting for their hidden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> One card from above.\u00a0</span>One card from above. And another from the bottom. The one card from the top again.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer knew the order of all the cards in his deck, and could freely draw out the desired hand.\u00a0</span>He could give the opponent the hand he wanted. He wore a uniform, but the dealer was a skilled card cheat.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Each player checked their hidden card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cPlease disclose your hands.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer declared.\u00a0</span>The players would declare their hand in turn.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> One cheater scratched the back of his head and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAce two pair.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The one sitting in front of him touched his chin and revealed his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThis guy. Aren\u2019t you unlucky today? I have a triple 3.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The last cheater shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cTsk tsk. It seems like I have won. Straight 7\u2019s.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then he moved to grab the money piled on the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Seo Tae-hyuk watched the cheaters with an emotionless face and opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Wait a moment. You still haven\u2019t checked my hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The card cheats looked at Tae-hyuk with absurd expressions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHaha, I see. Sorry, Yes. Did you complete the straight?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Their expressions indicated that it was absolutely impossible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I\u2019m sorry about this. No matter what is publicly disclosed, it is impossible to do a straight 6.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"However, there is still a chance that my hand is a flush.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Certainly. Two of the four patterns were the same. If the three hidden cards had the same pattern, then it would be a flush.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHahaha! I'm sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then the dealer, who had been watching quietly, moved.\u00a0</span>He showed his hand to everyone.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cA flush of Aces.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then cheaters started moaning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cKuk! Dealer-nim. This NPC is too strong! In this present situation, that hand is a foul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer scratched his head with a sorry expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I'm sorry. I was lucky.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He was smiling but his eyes were cold.\u00a0</span>With this, the newcomer would completely lose all of his money. He just needed to lose one or two more times, and he would be completely broke.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cIsn\u2019t gambling really fun?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> For a moment, the people gathered at the table thought that they didn\u2019t hear Tae-hyuk\u2019s words properly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Wasn\u2019t this a situation where all of his money was flying away?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Sometimes this happens.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk slowly revealed his hand.\u00a0</span>The cheaters who saw it sat down.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealers shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"T-that is ridiculous! How is your hidden card a 3?! I never...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Obviously, he had given Tae-hyuk the wrong hand.\u00a0</span>However, Seo Tae-hyuk had a 3 as his hidden card, and completed the straight 6.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The cheater who finished with the straight 7 shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"T-That doesn\u2019t beat my straight! But, what is that expression?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Everyone is mistaken. My hand isn\u2019t a straight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> At that moment, Tae-hyuk\u2019s atmosphere changed.\u00a0</span>The mask he was using was broken, and the wicked smile of a cheater appeared.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The straight is a hand that can evolve one step further. Now, take a closer look at my hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> They hadn\u2019t cared about the pattern of the cards because they were worried about the completion of the straight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 straight cards all had the same pattern.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Straight flush!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It broke through the odds of 1/649,740, and had appeared before them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk said quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"However, why did you say that it was impossible for a 3 to come out? Do you have a hand injury?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018I know what you are doing. but it couldn\u2019t stop me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk seemed to be saying to the cheaters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThis bastard... You are also a card cheat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> They realized it.\u00a0</span>The person in front of them wasn\u2019t an easy mark. He was a card cheat like themselves. A monster with tremendous skill.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"But I think the Tee is a little old. There are marks all over it. There should be a duplicate Tee. Shall we use it?\" (Tee= not sure but it seems to be a machine or holder that holds the cards.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ugh. This bastard...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tee allowed them to\u00a0remove a card from the deck.\u00a0The one on the table was a specially made product</span>. Without this, the dealer couldn't draw out his desired hand. If he rejected Tae-hyuk\u2019s request here, then it would be the same as confessing that he was a cheater.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> In the end, the Tee was replaced and a new game started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I will make you lose.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The dealer lost the previous battle.\u00a0</span>The other cheaters started fighting Tae-hyuk with their own techniques in order to defend their final pride.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> After exactly five games, they lost their money.\u00a0</span>Tae-hyuk\u2019s money had tripled in an instant.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> His total cash stack amounted to 150 million, something he achieved in only two hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Han Sang-won said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHrmm. Everything was taken?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk wasn\u2019t playing against ordinary guests, and instead was playing against card cheats hired by SY Capital.\u00a0</span>If they lost money, then it would become SY\u2019s mistake.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Han Sang-won laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He looked at the dealer kowtowing to him with a cold expression\u00a0Hang Sang-won took off his suit jacket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I'm sorry. I thought he was a sucker... He was a card cheat hiding tremendous skills.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cWell, that might be the case. But you should be prepared to lose one finger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"P-Please, just...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Han Sang-won took out a phone from his pocket and started dialing a number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... It\u2019s me. Call Kim Shin-hyeong. I have a direct opponent for him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kim Shin-hyeong was the best card cheat that SY had.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He hung up after 10 minutes.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p>Han Sang-won wiped the bloody knife with a handkerchief. He opened the door to greet Kim Shin-hyeong.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You wouldn\u2019t call me for an ordinary person. Who is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cSeo Tae-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cIt is the first time I\u2019ve heard that name. Is he a card cheat active abroad?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"No, he\u2019s a high school student.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Han Sang-won walked out with Kim Shin-hyeong, stepping around the dealer holding his bloody hand.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

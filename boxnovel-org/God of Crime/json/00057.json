What will you do with the wolf?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an expression that indicated he would do anything that was ordered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOof! Oof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mina\u2019s face turned white.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her life now depended on Tae-hyuk\u2019s words, and she couldn\u2019t even defend herself because she was gagged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI said that I would take everyone out of here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, even a traitor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk immediately answered like it was a no-brainer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Yes. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want to talk to her for a bit before that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other gathered people disappeared and Tae-hyuk approached Mina with a satisfied expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you surprised that you\u2019re still alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want to hear some information from Mina noona.

I\u2019m a little bit interested in who he is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had smelled a familiar scent while walking around Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He checked the Demon Revealing Mirror and all of his stats were decreasing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Fortunately, his concentration didn\u2019t decline as fast as before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, there was definitely a criminal who used psychedelic fragrances in the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were clearly a wolf, and not a regular participant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then another wolf, Mina, was more likely to know his identity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled a syringe containing clear liquid from his pocket and stabbed it in Mina\u2019s arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m not a professional at this, so please understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOof..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mina fiercely struggled but her body was tied up and resistance was impossible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you curious about what this is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk tossed the syringe and said.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Mina looked at him with shaking eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a black and red butterfly stain at the place where he injected her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry. The stain will disappear in a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk started to explain with an emotionless face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"However, if you don\u2019t receive the antidote within a week, then blood will pour out from every hole in your body and you will die... Ah, it is unfortunate that I won\u2019t be able to see it directly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shook his head with a grim expression. He truly felt sorry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cU...!

Isn\u2019t this really usable?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It stated the remaining number of times he could use the Counterfeit skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Counterfeit skill 1/3]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'In the end, it is three times a day?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Counterfeit had the ability to make tangible things look different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was particularly useful because it didn\u2019t need materials to be used.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Instead, he could only use it three times a day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk recalled Mina\u2019s expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She looked at him like she was seeing a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Aigoo. Today is the day when I am hated by females.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk received information about the fifth wolf.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to do that, it was necessary to trick Jeon Mina.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Well, that was just water so don\u2019t blame me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shrugged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bluff Poker table had a bunch of syringes to draw blood.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had taken one, filled it up with water, and injected it in Mina. Then he triggered the Counterfeit skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It made her feel like the drug had turned her skin black.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Moreover, the duration of the Counterfeit skill was five minutes, so it would return to its original state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took full advantage of this to deceive Mina.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thinking about it again, his acting was really plausible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now she would try everything she could to meet him in a week.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then it is time for the Producer to call.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of the participants had the 200 million won needed to clear the circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was something that Kim Joon-young would need to react to.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The participants, who didn\u2019t know what Tae-hyuk was plotting, were talking among themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen we\u2019ll become platinum members of the company now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course! We cleared the Death Circus!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ohhhh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were purely delighted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guests were still here, so there couldn\u2019t be any nonsense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anyway, they had achieved the goal in accordance to the rules of the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But would 17 people really get the platinum membership card?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That Choi Sung-yeol?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, an announcement was heard inside the Death Circus.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">- Bravo!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Congratulations on clearing the Death Circus!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">All of you will receive Tiwai International\u2019s platinum membership certificate.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then please follow the guide outside.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">There will also be an award ceremony for Lee Cheol-su as the representative of the participants</span></i><span style=\"\">.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the announcement ended, all of the participants threw their badges into the sky and cheered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only An Eun-jeong and Yoon Jong-hyun were watching Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A platinum member of Tiwai.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant becoming part of those who tried to kill them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, there were currently 15 platinum members in Tiwai.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If they upgraded all 17 people, then it would double in an instant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If a person thought calmly, they would absolutely never receive the compensation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, they might not even survive this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk just spoke with a relaxed smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey called. Don\u2019t you have to go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In no time, dozens of men in black suits were surrounding the participants.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Their waists were bulging, as if they were wearing something underneath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A black suited man gestured to Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The other participants stepped closer to Tae-hyuk with uneasy eyes. If they followed him then they could at least live.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the men in black suits stopped the participants from walking forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The other people, please wait here. We will bring Lee Cheol-su first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked back at the participants and followed the black suited man in silence.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Producer Kim Joon-young would obviously be waiting for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The remaining An Eun-jeong muttered something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe exodus hasn\u2019t ended yet? What...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh my god, I never thought you would really clear the Death Circus. You showed me many great things today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young headed towards Tae-hyuk with a welcoming pose.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The place that Tae-hyuk was guided to was the Producer\u2019s office, furnished with a big monitor and luxurious furniture.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would watch the Death Circus using this monitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young touched a chair and indicated for him to sit down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen let\u2019s get into the specifics.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sat down in the chair and Kim Joon-young opened his arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCongratulations. With this, you have become a member of Tiwai International.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk replied with an impatient look,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m not one of the players. Aren\u2019t you tired? Won\u2019t you cut to the chase?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young looked at Cheol-su with an expression of interest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Indeed, I know it all. Personally, I think that you are a mysterious expert brought by one of the guests.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is something similar.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIndeed! Then I will be blunt. I would like to scout you. I will try to match your conditions as much as possible. If you become the head of the wolves, then I\u2019m sure the Death Circus will become the best show in history.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought that Tae-hyuk\u2019s actions in the Death Circus were to show off his skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So how much money can you give me?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Please wait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young took out a tablet PC and showed a neatly organized table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a contract stating the terms and conditions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Scamming and ruining one person was worth 20 million won, while a frontal match was 30 million won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And if he created a show like this one, then he would get 200 million in incentives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pushed away the contract and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will only appear twice. Additionally, if I kill more than 10 people then the payout is doubled.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young\u2019s fingers trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough. Double?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young briefly thought about it, but he realized the value of the man in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. Then let\u2019s sign a formal contract.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk raised his hand as Kim Joon-young was about to hand him the contract.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wait. Before that, I want to say hello to the audience as the main character of the Death Circus. If I\u2019m lucky, then can\u2019t I get tips?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I wanted to ask you that. Everyone wants to meet you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis... Today I made a lot of money. That reminds me, what about the other participants? Surely you won\u2019t give all of them a platinum membership card.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young\u2019s eyes shone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He asked, so naturally the answer was obvious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, 20 drums will be dumped off the coast tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha, indeed! You truly are a bad person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you for the compliment. Then let\u2019s go greet the guests.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young completely believed in Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His gait, his gestures, his expression, and especially, his tone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Everything about Tae-hyuk showed that he was the best criminal around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was all just acting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk followed behind Kim Joon-young and confirmed the message from Moonlight Flower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Everything is ready.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled widely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was an uproar as Tae-hyuk entered the ballroom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like he had become a Hollywood star.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhh! You are the main character of the Death Circus right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGreat skills!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! Truly a wolf candidate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah. I am already looking forward to your next stage!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk entered and greeted them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Applause rang out here and there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHello. I am Lee Cheol-su.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">People gathered around him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were holding something in their hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Today's performance was so good. This is a tip.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a 10 million won check.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is a platinum card. You can use up to 100 million freely. Have this glass of wine as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In an instant, Tae-hyuk\u2019s hands became heavy with gifts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you. By the way, I have something I personally want to say to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He caught the attention of the masked people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Were the tips too burdensome?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk gestured, the woman in the butterfly mask came out from among the masked people with a bunch of documents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNoona. Thank you. I will definitely pay this back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bah. You didn\u2019t keep your promise from before. Still, it was fun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the two people conversed, the lion mask and opera mask came forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion mask said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...As expected, you know this person!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The opera mask said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took the bundle of documents and skimmed through it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah. The one wearing the lion mask. Aren\u2019t you Song Won-jin, the chairman of the Taesung Group? You have a hobby like this. Ah, then the opera mask, you are the daughter of the president of Taesung Group? I thought you were married. An affair like this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk started to slowly reveal the identity of the masked people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The inside of the room became frenzied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What is this? Fuck, block his mouth right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAaaaack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is this bastard doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and raised a hand as if to block the masked people rushing towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stop moving! If you don\u2019t want to die then stay still.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrazy bastard. Are you pranking us right now? President Kim. Send that bastard out right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young was furious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been feeling good about finding a worthy wolf after a long time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Death Circus would flourish with him as a wolf, but now everything was messed up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Cheol-su was revealing the identity of the guests.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now they wouldn\u2019t come to see his show again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young thought about how he could painfully kill Cheol-su and called out to the suited men waiting outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The men armed with guns approached.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Stay still if we don\u2019t want to die? Let\u2019s talk after there are a few more holes in your body. Shoot him!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk took off his coat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Dozens of primed explosives, dynamite, could be seen around his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Didn\u2019t I say to stop moving?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaack!\u201d It\u2019s a bomb!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone in the room screamed.</span></p><br/><p><strong>TL Note:\u00a0</strong>Please read this announcement post.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

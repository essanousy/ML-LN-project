They could obtain the bounty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wolf\u2019s plan was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The total amount of money that the group of sheep had was 900 million, with most of the money belonging to the black sheep.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, the next three payment fees meant that more than half of that money would be gone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the number of people who could get out would be reduced to two.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In other words, if they didn\u2019t make money anymoren then the sheep would fight against each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The method is really simple. There can only be one person in the Puzzle House. That is the rule. Once inside, I won\u2019t answer the questions for as long as possible so they won\u2019t be able to proceed. In other words, I will waste all the time.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a simply way to destroy the sheep.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wolf smiled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was their turn to enter the Puzzle House.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018You didn\u2019t notice my identity even at the end.

I\u2019m not a wolf. You should know. The people gathered in Group A absolutely can\u2019t be wolves!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only woman belonging to Group A, Jeon Mina, shouted with confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you aren\u2019t a wolf, then it doesn\u2019t really matter.

It hurts! A little softer! So unfair! I\u2019m really not the wolf!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mina was on the verge of tears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A few participants who saw her were swayed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t think she is...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy is Boss being like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We have to believe in Boss.

My acting was perfect.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mina\u2019s atmosphere instantly changed, making her seem like a different person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The participants watching got goose bumps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk raised two fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You made two mistakes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mistakes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is simple.

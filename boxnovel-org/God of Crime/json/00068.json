Tae-hyuk! You weren\u2019t in school for a week. What have you been doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He seemed really concerned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I couldn\u2019t concentrate on studying so I went to the temple to pray.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Such words are coming from your mouth. Is the sun rising in the west?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a mock exam score card.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All of the subjects on there were rated first class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm... What is this? This is great!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung Nam-ho ruffled Tae-hyuk\u2019s hair with an impressed expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His score was a result of steadily receiving the help of An Eun-young\u2019s studying skill and possessing an intelligence of around 50 points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Criminals should have a good mind.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The increase in stats didn\u2019t simply indicate a change in numbers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">More ideas popped up when he needed it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk was completely different from when he caught Yoo Cheol-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t just his crime skills increasing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sometimes it was eerie thinking about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, have a good winter vacation. I will consult with you at the beginning of school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk would be a third year in two weeks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the time to study in order to enter a good university.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a limit to acting as a student.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First of all, his top priority was to change the future and to catch criminals in order to make money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The course...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the future he remembered, he didn\u2019t go to university.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As soon as he graduated from high school, he became a part time worker for a staffing company and worked as a guard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Going to university meant that he would have a completely different future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I should go on a tour of the universities with Class President.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What course department should he enter?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He decided to slowly decide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Jung Nam-ho\u2019s words, there were five minutes left before classes started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the meantime, An Eun-young carefully spoke from where she was sitting beside him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn\u2019t because she was afraid of Tae-hyuk; she was simply ashamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"These days, there are many bullies near our school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes widened as he looked at An Eun-young.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This topic came out from Class President\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shouldn\u2019t she be more concerned about textbooks rather than gossiping?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They were originally a bad group that operated outside of Seoul. There seemed to be a crackdown in that area so they moved their activities to this side. A few students of our school have already lost money.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bad group?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Nuclear Bomb is their name and the scale is quite large.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the class leader, An Eun-young felt anxious about her classmates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They are quite famous if Class President knows about it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, yes... You should be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a bitter expression,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you telling me to be careful?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? You shouldn\u2019t go to dangerous places.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spoke out as a joke but An Eun-young looked serious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Okay. I understand, Class President. I won\u2019t go anywhere dangerous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A small smile appeared on An Eun-young\u2019s face and she muttered in a small voice so that Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t hear,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026If you do something dangerous, then you\u2019ll get hurt, and we won\u2019t be able to go to university together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh? What did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young noticed Tae-hyuk\u2019s body condition.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like it wasn\u2019t good lately.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She thought about inviting him to her house for a good meal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She still hadn\u2019t been able to reward him for helping her unni. It had been a long time since the two of them...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, An Eun-young shyly shook her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah right. Tae-hyuk. Do you have any plans for the vacation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the saying went, she leapt straight into the fire.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The day she was talking about was Christmas Eve.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If there was time then studying at home like they did before...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, I have a date that night.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Date?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s voice shook.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Who was Tae-hyuk dating?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, Class President doesn\u2019t know. On that day, my Noona has a date. I thought I\u2019d give her some support.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, really? Ha-ran unni?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Their first date was a complete mess, so I thought about helping her this time. I call it Date Hard 2.0!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young was nervous about Tae-hyuk\u2019s naming sense, which seemed to be from 10 years in the past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So you will be busy that day. Ah, that's right. Then I will make you a schedule for studying next year. I\u2019ll make some good and delicious food for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Um. Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t know how much his future would change in one year.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Meanwhile, he didn\u2019t notice that An Eun-young was looking at him every five minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk headed to a construction site after school.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Due to the situation of the adults, it had been neglected for almost a year.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think the performance is getting better.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the place that Tae-hyuk went to in order to practice his crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was steadily rising, but since he hadn\u2019t learnt any new skills ever since the hippo incident, he needed to make sure that he could perfectly use the skills he already had.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After his Spying skill was strengthened, it was possible to project the Demon Revealing Mirror into the air, so he didn\u2019t need to take the mirror out of his pocket anymore.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The time required to activate the skill was also greatly reduced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He also used Robbery to take all the money from the bag that the police officer was carrying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a perfect robbery that wasn\u2019t even detected by the sharp reflexes of the people trained to be sensitive to that type of thing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It took a lot of practice to steal that fast, but the result was satisfactory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I was able to steal 150 million won without anyone seeing.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now it was possible to use the Robbery skill as naturally as flowing water.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The next thing to do was practice the Violence skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once he used it, he held an incredibly hard iron pipe, and also temporarily increased his physical strength and agility.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the Violence skill quickly consumed his stamina.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn\u2019t just the skill that increased his physical strength.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He needed to practice constantly for a long time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He mainly used bags filled with sand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, if someone saw him using a weapon then he would be arrested immediately, which was why he had to intentionally go to places without any people to practice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Eh?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, strange sounds started echoing in Tae-hyuk\u2019s secret hideaway. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He heard somebody\u2019s voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? So what? Give me your money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I don\u2019t h...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you going to make me look for it? Take it out quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cR-Really...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. This son of a bitch! I feel like hitting you. Do you want your eyes to be crushed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed at that moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His hideout had a few gangsters roaming around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Eh? That is my school uniform? I\u2019ve never seen that face before. A freshman?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Jjak!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, one of the man slapped the boy\u2019s cheek.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The boy held his red cheek and screamed,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I was wrong. I-I really don\u2019t have money. I\u2019ll go home and bring it to you. Yes? Please.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis bastard. He wants to go to hell.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Bam!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the thugs kicked the boy\u2019s thighs with his combat boots.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The boy screamed and fell on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck. Do we look like young kids roaming around? My Hyung-nim is in Nuclear Bomb. Take care of this son of a bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaagh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gangsters pushed the boy into a corner and started to step on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk frowned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed a bit too much if they simply wanted money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I guess they haven\u2019t joined a gang yet.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to join such places, they needed to prove their manliness, and what they were doing now was also a part of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Well, I should leave and report this to the police.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although it was a bit intense, it wasn\u2019t enough for the boy to lose his life.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Recently, Tae-hyuk had seen many heinous crimes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe that was why...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This type of thing seemed like kids playing around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Who the fuck is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gangsters noticed that there was an uninvited guest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. Busted.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and approached the gangsters.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One person, who seemed to be the leader, frowned at Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The veins in his neck started pulsing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, you son of a bitch. Did you call a friend? Huh? Tell me, who is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader kicked the abdomen of the boy on the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like wind emerging from a balloon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeook...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The boy gave a pained moan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. You should be careful. If you hit the wrong place then his intestines might burst. Even if you are a minor... Eh? How old are you? Are you a minor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fuck, what is this bastard saying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gangsters were upset at Tae-hyuk\u2019s mocking tone and instantly surrounded him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Aigoo. Sorry Eun-young. I won\u2019t be able to keep my promise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sorry, today is your memorial service.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader gave instructions to his men.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were good in a 1 on 1 fight, but they were confident in their numbers.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Peok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a blunt sound resonated throughout the building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk suddenly held a large iron pipe in his hands, and swung it at one of the gangsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guy couldn\u2019t even scream before he collapsed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a ridiculous power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-This bastard...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader was dismayed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opponent clearly hadn\u2019t been carrying anything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then where did he get such a devastating weapon?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, he was familiar with assaulting people with an iron pipe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gangsters got goose bumps.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They realized that Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes were like a hyena\u2019s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, they had the tenacity of gangsters.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The leader pulled out a knife.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will kill you...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. You are holding the knife like a sword. Do you watch a lot of movies? By the way, you can never beat an opponent with a longer reach than you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk narrowed the distance at once and aimed his iron pipe at the leader\u2019s arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeooook!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader\u2019s arm twisted in a strange direction.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">From then on, it was a one-sided battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had won the battle against Han Sang-won, who had specialized in knives.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The power of the iron pipe and the Violence skill was enormous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could even win if he took on half a dozen neighbourhood thugs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, a 17 on 1 is still impossible.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk rummaged through the pockets of the gangsters on the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Folded bills emerged, most of them taken from nearby students.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had gathered almost 500,000 won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put one third of it into the pocket of the male student to pay for his medical expenses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, he took the rest as his share.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stuffed the bills into his pocket and muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is better than a part time job. By the way, should I call the police and maybe the ambulance? By the way, I think it is best to fight against others using the Violence skill.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a different feeling than when he hit the sandbags.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was often bored so this wouldn\u2019t be too bad as a part-time job.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The bad group is called Nuclear Bomb?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a feeling he would continue to engage with them in the future.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

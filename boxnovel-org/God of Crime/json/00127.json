He really...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was particularly agitated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn. No matter how I look at it, he is real.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-Isn\u2019t it the setting that I made?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Bum-ho was a manhwa writer whose work didn\u2019t sell.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He prepared a story based on Gojoseon, but he hadn\u2019t been able to find an artist, so he plunged into suffering.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That\u2019s when the leader scouted him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although many parts of Park Bum-ho\u2019s setting were awkward, he had the strange power to attract people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In particular, he was en expert at penetrating the mentality of a person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Pungbaek\u2019s abilities could be set up. In particular, we had a plan to change the face and clothes that hadn\u2019t been revealed yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to actually do it, they needed to figure out a way to change the mask on the face in an instant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unsa Kim Jin-woo, who was in charge of the camera installation and eavesdropping, gave his opinion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I analyzed the footage of that person. I couldn\u2019t find any traces of a trick.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk asked Song Chi-hyun to show them his belly and looked closely.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The image of a vast amount of blood spurting from it could still be seen in their minds.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the wound was like he had never been stabbed at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou didn\u2019t pretend to be stabbed with a fake knife right? There also wasn\u2019t plastic bag of blood either, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes... I can guarantee it. I was clearly stabbed by a knife. If you take a closer look, my blood stains are still here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun showed them the knife that had stabbed him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The blood had disappeared, but the traces still remained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn... What the hell...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did a celestial being really appear in the setting that Park Bum-ho created?</span><span style=\"\">Fortunately, the person hadn\u2019t said that they were fakes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were just worried about how Sun would operate in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLeader. First, let\u2019s assume that he really is a celestial being.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think this is right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leaders came to a conclusion at the end of an one hour meeting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First of all, they would cooperate with the heavenly being as much as possible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They couldn\u2019t give up the Sun group.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was literally the goose that laid the golden egg.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At first, they asked the believers to give up the goods they had accumulated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then they could get some peace of mind.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, that didn\u2019t last long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was natural.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was because they lived an unhappy life that they joined the cult in the first place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just removing the cause wouldn\u2019t stop them from feeling unhappy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then they would once again have to give something up in order to get some rest. Thus, an endless chain began.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once the berries were ripe, they would be harvested.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The good news is that the celestial being treats Leader-nim as a fellow god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt really is fortunate. At that moment, I really thought I was the reincarnation of a celestial being. No, maybe...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Leader, I\u2019m sorry but let\u2019s start with the worst case scenario. Maybe you will have to hand over your position to him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader being advised to retire from his position.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t a pleasant feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is one good thing. Pungbaek doesn\u2019t have the ability to read a person\u2019s mind. You know what that means.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun listened to the leader\u2019s words and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We can fool him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. That person is looking for other celestial beings. We can use that as an excuse to expand Sun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bishops nodded at their leader, who managed to turn the crisis of retirement around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You want to create a huge group.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right. Think about it realistically. That person really can use divine techniques. Imagine if he became the leader and showed the miracles in front of all of the believers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaah...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWoo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The news would spread and many new spectators would come to see the heavenly being.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would work.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had to work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Right now, they only had 1,200 believers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That could increase by 10, no 100 or even 1,000 times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even if it is only half...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you think about my idea?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scammers raised their thumbs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the group was plotting, Tae-hyuk was preoccupied with other things.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He needed to find definite proof that the Sun Cult was related to the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First of all, he decided to check the incense, since that was the only connection point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He asked the person who moved the supplies and found out that there was a warehouse they were stored in.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard was someone who hadn\u2019t been able to attend the rally a few hours ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He sat in his chair and played on his smartphone, as if he didn\u2019t know that a real celestial being had appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used Disguise to turn into Song Chi-hyun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although his height was a little shorter, a man\u2019s height could change depending on the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hum hum.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed and the guard raised his head with an annoyed expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he used as he realized that Bishop Song Chi-hyun was in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"B-B-B-Bishop-nim!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His reaction was like a soldier meeting his commanding office while he had been dozing off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You went through a lot of trouble. I need more incense at the rally.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-Is that so? Normally the others come directly...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am tired from waking up at down. I thought a walk would be good for me so don\u2019t think too hard. Then can I go in?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard could only say one thing in response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes! You worked hard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard bowed low, like a broken robot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t be brave enough to take a look inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warehouse was filled with a variety of props, like it was the set of a historical drama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I can film a drama with the things here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The incense wasn\u2019t difficult to find.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the contents were empty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like he would have to use Spying to determine if there was a secret space.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk activated the crime skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Spying!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror flashed in front of Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Information about the objects in the room were written down.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was the ability of the Hawk Eyes attribute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk approached a jar placed in a corner of the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A safe was hidden behind it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This won\u2019t open without fingerprint recognition.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, he gained Cho Min-hyuk\u2019s fingerprints using Counterfeit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there was no reaction from the safe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Next he tried Song Chi-hyun and Park Bum-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It looks like Kim Jin-woo is in charge of this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used the thumbprint of Kim Jin-woo and the safe door opened with a loud clunk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently, the number of fingerprint recognition safes had increased over the dial or lock type.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was much harder for other thieves, but Tae-hyuk was the opposite.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don\u2019t have the skill to pick a lock yet. I\u2019m feel sorry since I\u2019m always getting its help, so I should buy some stock in companies that make fingerprint recognition locks.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked into the safe and as he thought, there was a glass bottle of perfume.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He sniffed the sweet scent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was definitely \u2018that.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s see the source of this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a notebook and pencil.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would prefer a proper easel or drawing sheet but there was no time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then Forgery...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Forgery skill has found an intense image.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The work has been completed through automatic mode.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The familiar intense illusion appeared in front of Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the hidden ability of Forgery that helped him many times.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The secret deal between the Yakuza and bishops was drawn inside the notebook.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The atmosphere was enough to use it as a poster for a crime movie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bingo. The Yakuza was behind the Sun Cult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was able to close the notebook when he saw someone drawn in the corner.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He looked like he was in control of the transaction, but he felt strangely familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm... This person...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, he could ask the bishops if he was curious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took the perfume from the safe and quietly left the warehouse.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had everything he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now it was time to strike.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took the appearance of the celestial being and gave orders to the leader and bishops.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He told them to gather the members of Sun into a room so that he could introduce himself formally.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be the celestial being\u2019s first public appearance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The cult leaders who heard this couldn\u2019t help laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Those words...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It is my job to look after the members here. I can\u2019t promise forever, but I will lead them as long as possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Jin-woo murmured in a touched tone,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP-Pungbaek...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Song Chi-hyun said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPungbaek.

So I will get it ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and didn\u2019t say anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bishops accepted and the rally to introduce \u2018Pungbaek\u2019 was organized in an instant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thousands of believers gathered in an auditorium.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Rumours of Pungbaek started to spread among them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was all staged by Song Chi-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aren\u2019t we gathered today to be introduced to the real Pungbaek?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eh?

Then what will Pungbaek show us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The believers looked up at the podium with excited faces as their expectations grew.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Song Chi-hyun appeared on stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am here to introduce you to Pungbaek, who has been ruling the winds of the world for thousands of years.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like he was introducing a magician.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the public was excited about the obvious direction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eh?

What is its current rating? Liberal arts? Science?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> An Eun-young\u2019s specialty came out as she started firing off specific questions.\u00a0</span>Tae-hyuk scratched his head and replied to the questions that he knew the answer to.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cI don\u2019t care as long as it isn\u2019t expensive. She hasn\u2019t studied for several years, so I want her to learn from the basics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> An Eun-young looked at various cram schools with her phone and checked them thoroughly.\u00a0</span>In the end, she showed him the homepage of the best place.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Then this one should be the best. The teachers are okay and the pass rate is also the highest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cI see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk checked how much the school expenses were.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 700,000 won a month.\u00a0</span>Including food expenses and transportation costs, it would be one million a month.\u00a0There was one year left, so Ha-ran\u2019s tuition fee would be 12 million won.\u00a0However, this wasn\u2019t the end.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThe costs of the textbooks and special lectures... It all costs almost two million.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was more than 25 million won combined for both of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> An Eun-young spoke while Tae-hyuk was looking at the school expenses page.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cI-I looked for the cheapest place possible. The boarding cram schools are three million won a month.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> This was a world of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018I wish I had a surplus of funds... Are there any more bounties?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Unfortunately, there were no more big jackpots until next year.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk muttered as if he were making a promise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I will cling to all of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u00a0An Eun-young made a fighting posture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cTae-hyuk, you can do it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes. The three of us should pass next year.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cUh, yes... T-three...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> An Eun-young looked strangely disappointed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"In addition, there are the interviews and essays... It isn\u2019t just the exam?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"T-That...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> An Eun-young lecture on university admissions began and Tae-hyuk wrote everything down in his notebook.\u00a0</span>This would be useful to Tae-min, who would sit his university entrance exam in a few years.</p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Brr!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> All of a sudden, there was a vibration from his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Did my stats rise or something?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror, showing nothing on the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> An Eun-young giggled from where she was watching.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You mistook your phone with the mirror.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAh, phone...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He forgot, because most of his notifications came from the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span>Tae-hyuk pulled out the phone from deep within his pocket and checked the contents of the notification. It was a text message from someone.</p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Tae-hyuk I</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The message cut off there.\u00a0</span>He checked and saw that it came from Seo Ha-ran\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cEun-young, I\u2019m sorry but I have to leave early. I have an urgent matter so I\u2019ll be going first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cH-huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk grabbed the jacket hanging on his chair and ran out.\u00a0</span>The contents of the message had been omitted, but he could tell.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'Something big has happened!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The situation was so urgent that she couldn\u2019t even send a message properly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk called a taxi in order to get home even one minute faster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Noona, please be safe...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk worried as he rode in the taxi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Why isn\u2019t Kang-suk hyung picking up his phone?!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He must be in a meeting where he needed to turn it off.\u00a0</span>It had been a while since Tae-hyuk saw Kang-suk\u2019s face.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk made a strong fist. He couldn\u2019t expect any help from Kang-suk, so he had to get through this with his own strength. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> This was the second time that something unforeseen had happened.\u00a0</span>Knowing the future wasn\u2019t enough, as taking different actions produced different results.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> After the Rosario incident, Tae-hyuk had searched for related books in the library.\u00a0</span>He learnt of the phenomenon called the \u2018Time Leap\u2019. The Time Leap said that he didn\u2019t return to the past with his memories. Instead, an infinite number of parallel words existed, and he obtained the memories of one of those worlds.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Of course, it was just a hypothesis, albeit a convincing one.\u00a0</span>The book was thick enough to be used as a pillow, but he came to one conclusion. The future wasn\u2019t fixed, it was constantly changing. Someday, Tae-hyuk\u2019s future knowledge would lose its power. Before that, he needed to learn as many crime skills as possible, since it was his second weapon.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Pull yourself together Tae-hyuk. You are walking a tightrope right now.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk arrived at the road near his house and handed the driver a 10,000 won bill. There was no time to get the change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Please make it in time!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk jumped out and ran home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Fortunately, his sister was at home; however, she wasn\u2019t alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Seo Ha-ran ~ You didn\u2019t pay back our money, and yet you moved to such a good place?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> A large number of men were surrounding Ha-ran.\u00a0</span>They were neatly dressed in suits, but the atmosphere was terrifying.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"If you borrowed money from us, then you should pay it back! Isn't that right? Kids.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThat\u2019s right, Hyung-nim!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The man called \u2018Hyung-nim\u2019 seemed to be in his mid-30s. \u00a0Every time he laughed, a gold tooth quickly flashed as it reflected the bright sunlight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The leader of the group extended a hand as he noticed Tae-hyuk entering.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Aigoo. Who is this? Seo Tae-min?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It is Tae-hyuk, Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cUh, yes. Tae-hyuk! Come come. The head of the house has come, so let\u2019s talk business.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk suppressed his anger and spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What are you doing in someone else\u2019s house? I\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> They knew his name.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Creditors?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Based on Tae-hyuk\u2019s memories, they never came to his house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAigoo! Sir! \u00a0We aren\u2019t bad people. It\u2019s just us. We work with unions and are following all of the laws. Do you want to see our business card?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The man pulled a business card from his wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... SY Capital. You are Han Sang-won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThat\u2019s right. We have come to receive the debt, all according to legitimate procedures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk stared at Ha-ran, who was shaking with a pale face, from amongst the men.\u00a0</span>She was biting her lips so hard that blood started to emerge.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> This was a legitimate procedure?\u00a0</span>More than 10 men surrounding a woman was legitimate? Tae-hyuk looked at the baseball bats and iron pipes placed neatly in the corner as threats. The group didn\u2019t carry them, but they were willing to use it at any time.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk said towards Ha-ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cNoona, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let even one of them touch you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Aigoo ~ Sir! You have a strange misconception. We just came to reclaim the debt! Is there any need to touch her if we receive the money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... What type of debt are you here to take?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"There is a guarantor debt in Seo Ha-ran\u2019s name... with the interest, it is approximately 300 million.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"There was a clear exemption.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Their parents had passed away in an accident, leaving behind a huge debt. \u00a0They were able to solve it by giving up the inheritance.\u00a0</span>The problem was that the debt was in Ha-ran\u2019s name. She couldn\u2019t do it, so the last resort was applying for personal bankruptcy. It was a debt that their family had barely escaped from.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Why had it shown up again?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Han Sang-won extended an envelope.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThis...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Read it. This is an order of payment from the courts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk examined the documents. Han Sang-won\u2019s words were real.\u00a0</span>Han Sang-won smiled at him.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Even if there was an exemption, if a claim is made, then the debt will become valid again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> At that moment, Tae-hyuk realized what Han Sang-won was doing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was a type of illegal collection act that indiscriminately purchased dead debts at a cheap price and used lawsuits to activate them again. If the person couldn\u2019t pay, then they would have to register for bankruptcy.\u00a0</span>Of course, there were no prohibitions or penalties, as it was a legitimate business. If someone was hit by this, then they would become a slave, paying off the debt for life due to the huge interest.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Han Sang-won waved Ha-ran\u2019s bankbook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"At any rate, I had forgotten about it. Then not long ago, you bought this house, so I hurried to file a lawsuit to get an order of payment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The house...?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk instantly realized why this had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'They found out about the house and came sniffing around...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Creditors could view the property details of those who owed them money.\u00a0</span>In the end, money brought the hyenas around.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk bit his lip and glanced at Ha-ran.\u00a0</span>Her face looked like she would burst into tears at any moment. However, her desire to protect the money at all costs was seen in her eyes.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAt any rate, tell me your password and nobody will get hurt. Yes? How long has it been? I couldn\u2019t even eat lunch. The account name is Cho Kang-suk? I didn\u2019t expect you to keep this money in a bank account under someone else\u2019s name. Do you want to be kicked out of the house in this cold winter? First of all, I\u2019ll just take this money. I am a very merciful person. Haha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Cho Kang-suk?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Ha-ran had deposited money into a bankbook in Kang-suk\u2019s name. It was her own idea.\u00a0</span>If they found the cash, then they would have just taken it. However it was harder with a bankbook that had a password.</p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Wooduk!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk grinded his teeth together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> These guys hadn\u2019t just come. They had been here for at least half a day.\u00a0</span>Han Sang-won had the bankbook and seal in his hands, which were clearly taken from Ha-ran.\u00a0<span style=\"\">However, she didn\u2019t tell them the password until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> They didn\u2019t touch Ha-ran directly.\u00a0</span>However, Ha-ran\u2019s expression made it obvious that they had threatened her. How had she felt when she was surrounded by 10 men?</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Ha-ran had bravely fought alone.\u00a0</span>In order to protect the precious money necessary for the family\u2019s dreams...</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk wanted to kill these people right now.\u00a0</span>But first, he had to secure Ha-ran\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... The password is Public Employment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHahaha! As expected from a friend! Hey kids, let\u2019s go. Pack up your tools.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The henchmen chuckled and started to pick up the equipment they brought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cSir! We have just received 50 million won! Although, don\u2019t you know that there is still 250 million won left? See you next time. Hahahaha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Han Sang-won and his henchmen were gone in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Ha-ran\u2019s shoulders shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cT-Tae-hyuk... S-sorry.. Noona is a fool... Huaaang!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> In the end, Ha-ran burst into tears.\u00a0</span>They were the desperate tears that she had tried to keep from falling.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... I will make them pay for every tear that fell from Noona\u2019s eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk gazed coldly at Han Sang-won\u2019s business card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018SY Capital...!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Seo Ha-ran had fought against them to the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Now it was Tae-hyuk\u2019s turn to fight. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cNoona. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll get it back tenfold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He would put everything he had into destroying them.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

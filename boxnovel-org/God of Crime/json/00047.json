Many people are making more than five million a month. Are you willing to do that? Do you lack experience? Or is there a lack of enthusiasm?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A person who earned around 800,000 a month would become someone who earned more than 10 million won in the first three months.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A man, who said he was in his first year of employment, took out the key for a foreign car from his pocket and shook it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now everything was gathered for the perfect situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is like taking off the label and replacing it with one from a deluxe brand. Furthermore, that isn\u2019t a key no matter how I look at it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a fake made for use as a movie prop.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was made elaborately so that it couldn\u2019t be distinguished from the real thing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk had the ability to grasp the authenticity of an object, due to the Forgery skill improving his discerning eye.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wondered if he would receive a new crime skill and checked the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Um. There is no new skill.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So far, Tae-hyuk had met seven blacklist members.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, except for Big Mama, he didn\u2019t receive any of their crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was it necessary to upgrade to Noble?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'By the way, what is An Eun-jeong doing? She isn\u2019t a decoy?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She hadn\u2019t appeared with Choi Sung-yeol\u2019s party.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked around the meeting room and was able to find her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong was sitting in a corner and writing down Choi Sung-yeol\u2019s notes in a notebook.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She looked just like An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018... They are truly family.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other people were busy talking to each other.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sat next to An Eun-jeong and asked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have been writing really hard. What is the content?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong laughed and held out her notes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis? I was writing about Choi Sung-yeol sunbae. He really is great, \u00a0and none of his words are ridiculous. The money he earns as well... I want to be like him someday.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong was looking at Choi Sung-yeol with sincerely respectful eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was completely deceived without knowing it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The good news was that she hadn\u2019t been completely corrupted yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I need to discover how deep her feet are.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"An Eun-jeong is working really hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, how did you know my name...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong asked with wide eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pointed to the employee ID hanging around her neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I saw the name hanging around your neck. Oh right, my name is Lee Cheol-su.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gave the pseudonym he used during the voyeur incident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I see. Anyway, I am currently a silver member. If I can recruit 10 more people, then I can upgrade to gold... I need to work harder!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong took a fighting posture.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had a similar atmosphere to Ha-ran.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like he was watching a child.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk lowered his voice as much as possible and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Already a silver member... You must have spent a large amount of money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong hesitated before opening her mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Yes. In fact, it was the money I had set aside to rent a room. I used it all but... I can make a lot more once I become a gold member!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s head started to hurt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She must have devoted millions of won into this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After becoming a part of the multilevel marketing, a person could easily obtain a higher grade if they spent a certain amount of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the problem was after that happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had already invested money, and now they couldn\u2019t pull their feet out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once that happened, the appearance of the company would change by 180 degrees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Gather members.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Bring in more money because your shares are low.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Go out and sell new products.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was constant exploitation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At the end of the day, they wouldn\u2019t be able to sell enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong was laughing with an innocent face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I thought she was moderately quick-witted...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The woman in front of him never even imagined that she was being deceived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll ask you just one thing. How many people have you brought here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell... Two or three people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A fool pulled in other fools.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The multilevel scheme was truly scary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk asked with a heavy expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So they all became part of Eun-jeong\u2019s shares?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, An Eun-jeong\u2019s eyes shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"... It isn\u2019t like that. It will be given the next time I register a name.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see. The people Eun-jeong brought in received consultation from another person and was registered under their name. Next time, do better. Is that the method?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong looked at Tae-hyuk with a startled expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Based on her expression, it seemed like he had struck the nail on the head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-How did you know?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk told An Eun-jeong the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you gather 10 more people, then you can reach the gold rank?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confident voice from a few minutes ago had become smaller.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That number will never go to zero. Eun-jeong also knows this to a certain extent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong looked at Tae-hyuk with a shocked face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had stabbed her with the sword of truth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he needed to use this degree of shock therapy on Eun-jeong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a strange thing happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Uh, what?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk noticed a strange smell spreading in the seminar room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a smoke with a sweet, floral scent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He felt light-headed the moment he breathed it in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong\u2019s eyes also became blank.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then suddenly, her eyes became animated again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She spoke in a strong tone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-That can\u2019t be. I can surely upgrade my rank if I work hard! Ah, that's right. Cheol-su! Cheol-su shouldn\u2019t think like that. Cheol-su is also in our company. We should work hard together to make a lot of money. Then my father...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Damn...'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought it was almost over.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, An Eun-jeong was completely possessed by this strange perfume.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror to check his status.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"O-Oh my god! All my stats are being reduced at a tremendous pace!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His intelligence, that was close to 50, was now near 40 points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk realized that his judgement was gradually falling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Did they even use a hallucinogen?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He grabbed his left little finger in order to regain his spirit.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Wooduk!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The twisting of the bones caused his stats to stop falling.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly screamed but persisted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This isn\u2019t a normal method for a multilevel company. Wait a minute. Didn\u2019t Choi Sung-yeol have a partner?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t a criminal who worked alone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He committed his scams with an even worse colleague.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The name of another blacklist member popped into Tae-hyuk\u2019s mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018... Producer Kim Joon-young!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a famous criminal who produced bizarre shows, a producer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the fragrance with the hallucinatory effect...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Perhaps there were three or more criminals gathered here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Damn.

However, he remembered about the Death Circus run by the Producer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a flashy show of human desire and betrayal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk thought about the structure of the building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The interior was much smaller compared to the size.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like there were secret rooms that couldn\u2019t be entered through a normal route.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe the Producer was planning the Death Circus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk realized that there was only one way for An Eun-jeong to escape from here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEun-jeong.

He didn\u2019t even know the success rate of Robbery, so it was suicidal to act while believing in it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Then there was only one thing left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The prosecutors assured that they would be able to catch Yoo Cheol-ho tomorrow; however, according to Tae-hyuk\u2019s dream, Yoo Cheol-ho would start fleeing across the country for more than a month.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Within that time period, three innocent civilians would be killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The most important thing was for Tae-hyun to deviate from the predetermined date.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">If Yoo Cheol-ho were caught today... then the three victims that were supposed to die would be saved in the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He hoped that he could change the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk hurried into action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Yes. I will call a reliable detective.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk thought about who to contact while searching through his pockets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He then pulled out his handphone to make a call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018... There is no more battery.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was an old-fashioned flip phone that he inherited from his sister. Even if he charged it every day, it was still a junk phone that would quickly run out of power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk went to a nearby convenience store and charged his handphone. A few minutes would be enough to make one call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The TV in the store was showing news about Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Finally, there is a reward of 50 million won. However, his location is still unknown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Bounty!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk almost fell backwards at that word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Why didn't I think of it before? He is an escaped prisoner, so naturally there will be a reward!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Come to think of it, his brother had said something similar this morning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">At first, this was simply to check if he was in a dream or not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Then he suddenly learned a strange crime skill - but this fact wasn\u2019t too important.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'50 million won...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was an amount that allowed him to not only buy clothes for his hard-working sister, but also allowed them to get out of the monthly rented semi-basement room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The person he called would be someone who would obtain a huge merit. Therefore, he wanted to give it to someone he knew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Yes. I will call Cho Kang-suk hyung.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He was a crime squad investigator who had questioned Tae-hyuk several times in the past. He was one of the few people who treated Tae-hyuk as a human instead of a death row inmate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">His promotion luck was quite bad, despite have a vibrant sense of justice, so he was still in the field despite being in his late 40s.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018He should be roughly in his 30s right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">After confirming that the battery was charged to a certain extent, Tae-hyuk pressed a number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>-This is the Gang-dong police station.</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"I wish to speak to Detective Cho Kang-suk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>-Yes, I understand.</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There was a moment of silence before Cho Kang-suk\u2019s voice was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>-Yes, the phone has been changed. I am Cho Kang-suk of the Gang-dong police station\u2019s 2nd team.</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Will I really get a reward if I catch Yoo Cheol-ho?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk asked directly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>-It has to be directly. Or can it just be a crucial tip that leads to the arrest... Hey, are you a high school student? Why are you making a prank call? If I catch you then I\u2019ll be angry!</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was a reaction that Tae-hyuk had expected from Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He was more like a neighbourhood hyung than a detective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"It is real. But is it in cash? What are the tax percentages?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>-Hyung is busy so I\u2019m hanging up.</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"It is definitely Yoo Cheol-ho. Isn\u2019t this a situation where you have to find every grain of rice\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">that Yoo Cheol-ho\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">shed while eating? How about just checking it out?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>-I will do it. I hope it is real or I will one punch you so hard that three teeth will be knocked out.</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>-How did you even see him?</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"I made a delivery.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>-Even an escaped prisoner has to eat.</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk smiled widely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Despite his crude way of speaking, Cho Kang-suk was a thorough detective. He would check any minor clue directly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk told Kang-suk his location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">* \u00a0 \u00a0 * \u00a0 \u00a0 *</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cFuck. It is real. To think that he was hiding in this type of place. Son of a bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He used the walkie-talkie, requesting that reinforcements be sent from the investigation headquarters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cI found where he is hiding. Location...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Kang-suk patted Tae-hyuk\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cSorry for doubting you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cNo problem. Please be sure to catch him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cThen. Watch as I catch him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk licked the ice cream Kang-suk bought him and watched the arrest operation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The rest happened quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The investigation had been in trouble because there were no witnesses to report the location. But now they knew exactly where he was hiding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Cho Kang-suk acted quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">After contacting the special investigation headquarters, dozens of police cars arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk watched in interest as they broke through the door of the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Yoo Cheol-ho took off the clothes that he was wearing and started to run away quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Cho Kang-suk threw himself onto Yoo Cheol-ho, like a hawk hunting its prey.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Yoo Cheol-ho was handcuffed and started screaming. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cFuck! Which son of a bitch knew I was here? Tell me! I\u2019ll bite off the flesh on their bones!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Yoo Cheol-ho was taken away by five police officers while still furiously struggling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk just watched as he put the last bit of ice cream in his mouth..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Ah, cool!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was sweet and delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">After Yoo Cheol-ho was dragged out, the police entered the church to find any remaining evidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Cho Kang-suk continued walking around with a walkie-talkie to check if there were any more threats to Tae-hyuk, the witness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk thought it was good that the tip went to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'Ah, Detective-nim. You are rejuvenated. You don\u2019t even have the potbelly anymore.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was so different from the Cho Kang-suk he remembered that Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t help laughing. Only the eyes that burned with the flames of justice were the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Detective Cho Kang-suk. You should now receive a special promotion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Brat. If\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">you are facing</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0any trouble, contact Hyung... but you don\u2019t look like the type who will be easily bullied. \"Ah. Have you eaten lunch? Shall Hyung buy you a bowl of jajangmyeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cWah. I gave you the top merit for catching this criminal, yet you only want to buy\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">m</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">e a bowl of jajangmyeon?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Well. Do you want tangsuyuk as well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Nope. I\u2019ve actually already eaten. Instead, there is something else I need your hel</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">p with</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">. Help me get the bounty money</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">, as</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">t</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">his is my first time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Cho Kang-suk chuckled. He seemed to like the bold Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cHaha. Doesn\u2019t it sound like you\u2019re planning to do this again?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cPuhaha. What is with that expression? Anyway. You are Tae-hyuk? Really, thank you. Yoo Cheol-ho, that bastard, is a really dangerous guy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Had he</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">escaped,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0then he would have definitely</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0started</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0kill</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">ing</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0again. We were able to catch him without any\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">injury,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0thanks to your report.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk felt something hot rising from within his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He hadn\u2019t realized because he had been focused on the reward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk had saved the lives of three future murder victims.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The tragedy in the future had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The \u00a0mirror vibrated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'Eh, I didn\u2019t bump into anyone.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The crime skill Robbery seemed to activate regardless of Tae-hyuk\u2019s will.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">However, there was the condition that he needed to touch the other person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He pulled out the mirror and checked the sentences.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><span>[3]</span></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">[You can use the affinity points to enhance crime skills or activate hidden attributes.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p></div><div class=\"footnotes\"><ol><li><span id=\"footnote-3\">affinity points have been acquired.<i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-left\"></i></span></li></ol></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Other than that, he needed to study by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018My stats didn\u2019t go up today...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the study skill wasn\u2019t present, then it took him almost 10 times longer for his stats to rise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order for Tae-hyuk to be on a similar level to An Eun-young, he needed to raise his school rank by almost 200. </span><span style=\"\">It needed to be done within a month.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would\u2019ve been impossible if he didn\u2019t have the help of the studying skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I would love to spend all day with Eun-young but...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had her own life.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t do that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he had to study alone while An Eun-young was at school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why am I desperately trying to become 1st in the school...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t complain to anyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Demon Revealing Mirror showed that he had dark circles under his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one person who would come and see it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is An Eun-young.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyway, it is time for the stolen goods broker to do business.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thieves worked at night, and would check their equipment as they disposed of stolen items during the day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, this was the broker\u2019s main activity time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk searched through his vague memories as he headed to Cheonggyecheon.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it this place?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hid in a back alley and looked at a building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the surface, it was a pawn shop that didn\u2019t seem that suspicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Everybody has a tired face, as if they couldn\u2019t sleep at night.

It is better than the leather clothes she wore yesterday...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even so, the exposure was too high.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know where to look.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower approached and plastered herself onto Tae-hyuk\u2019s side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then she spoke in a chirpy voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you come to get supplies from Mama?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The broker is called Mama?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mama?

No, you couldn\u2019t even cross the wall properly. Why are you going to a broker of stolen goods...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower\u2019s face turned red. She waved her hands and exclaimed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, I'm not trying to dispose of stolen goods! Yesterday, I accidentally broke a stick. I\u2019m trying to get a new one...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded with a convinced look.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thieves would also buy things from brokers, as the brokers also sold equipment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower had a variety of tools. She wouldn\u2019t have bought them from an auction, so most of them would be purchased here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI came to buy equipment. What did Tae-hyuk come to buy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That\u2019s not it. I need information.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. Obviously, there is something that you are looking for. That other thief must have stolen it. Then, did you come to the broker to ask if somebody had come to the store to sell it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought that she was just a stupid thief. However, she was smarter than he thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower smiled at the expression on Tae-hyuk\u2019s face and poked his cheek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhah, is that the answer? You shouldn\u2019t make fun of a woman\u2019s senses.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026. Please keep it a secret from Mama. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to share each other\u2019s secrets?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed to ensure that Moonlight Flower didn\u2019t reveal it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower folded her arms and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I\u2019ll won\u2019t reveal it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But isn\u2019t Noona curious about the thief who ignored the rules and invaded someone else\u2019s territory?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I am curious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then do you want to go with me? Don\u2019t you have something to do here anyway?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-Is that so? I also didn\u2019t want to go alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I will be the one talking. Just watch from the sidelines.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let\u2019s go!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower seemed to be familiar with the stolen goods broker. If he entered with her, then the broker\u2019s wariness would reduce. He would be able to obtain what he wanted earlier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Shall I get some information about Mama from Moonlight Flower?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk asked casually.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You seem to come here often.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mama\u2019s store was on a corner of an alley in Cheonggyecheon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It looked like any other ordinary pawn shop.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A place that lend money for goods received.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the most famous place for handling stolen jewellery in the area.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The important thing was for the broker to evaluate the goods and calculate the correct price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Among the items that the thieves handled, there were many fakes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was up to the broker to judge the stolen goods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower started talking about things that Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t even ask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was a person who would be called an enemy to herself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stored the things Moonlight Flower told him in his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Information was always valuable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let's go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk and Moonlight Flower opened the door and entered the pawn shop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A woman who was painting stood up and welcomed them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Welcome. How can I help you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The woman seemed to be in her early 30s. She was dressed in black mourning clothes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A beautiful woman who gave off a mature atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, Ajumma! I came here to ask you something. Well, not exactly me but this guy.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOmo. It is Moonlight. Come on. Didn\u2019t I tell you to call me unni, instead of ajumma?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand! Mama unni!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will say it one more time, if you call me ajumma then I will stick a knife in your belly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mama laughed, but she had a strange expression on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs he your boyfriend? Well, you are pretty. Why are you just standing there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Nope. He is just a younger brother that I know. He is a little naive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Anyway, I\u2019ll go and get some cold drinks. Wait here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower talked in a familiar manner to Mama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was just watching with an open mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I should have noticed when I heard the name Mama. I didn\u2019t think that it would be Big Mama.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt dizzy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama was one of the big criminal brokers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She dealt with counterfeit art that went into the range of tens of billions of won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was a representative of South Korea, just like the Russian or American mafias.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had entered the lair of a tiger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I-I have to get out of here!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Mama spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Omo, Moonlight. Your brother is trying to run away? However, I hope he knows that this place is free to enter, but not free to leave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wanted to cry.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Of course, the food is made by the best chef as you said...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But the problem is that the show is missing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sweat flowed down the owner\u2019s chin.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Today was Christmas Eve, the best day of the year.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it was from the evening onwards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">From 15:00 to 17:00, it was literally called Break Time where the restaurant was closed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A customer specifically wanted to rent that time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As the owner, he naturally welcomed the customer with both hands.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The meals could be cooked in advance, and he could serve it himself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But there was a problem.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t a simple restaurant, but a cafe restaurant that served food while watching a show.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa, ha, ha... I am sorry for that. But really, you don\u2019t have a person to perform?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By doing this, he could rent the restaurant at an unbelievably low price.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But this trap was waiting for him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The atmosphere wouldn\u2019t exist if there were no performances.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Can I borrow the stage instead?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe stage?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. A date should have music.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owner\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Will you be performing directly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will use classical music to set up the atmosphere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough. Yes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, he would absolutely never allow customers on stage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The expensive equipment could break, and it was against the policy of the restaurant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, what was happening today was at the fault of the restaurant, so it was natural for the owner to take a low profile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk added one last thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, please note that the stage might be noisy. Even if the equipment is broken, I will reimburse you in full so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha, I understand. Then please show a great stage.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owner nodded with a pleasant expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he was inwardly laughing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He thought that the customer just wanted to stand on the stage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At best, it would be a tambourine and some karaoke skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Did he even know how to turn on the amps?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was a money-giving customer, so the owner bowed politely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I have to go and prepare the dessert. The stage is opposite of the hallway.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quickly headed to the place that the owner directed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No show?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he would do it himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, there was still a bit of time until Nuclear Bomb\u2019s henchmen arrived.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would come up with something suitable during that time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Indeed, a sweet song added to the dating atmosphere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t handle instruments, no matter how many crime skills he had.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he could imitate voices, and he could use a CD for the accompaniment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shouldn\u2019t Ave Maria be played on Christmas?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the song of greeting that was sung when the angel Gabriel visited the Virgin Mary when baby Jesus was conceived.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the best song for a date on Christmas Eve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You can directly imitate the voice of Lee Yong-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Singer Lee Yong-ho!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With his profound voice and gentle stage manners, he was a celebrity that sometimes appeared on TV.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It was worth spending a lot of money to watch his performance.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and turned on the microphone before singing along with the accompaniment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The restrained voice of a soprano spread throughout the restaurant and into the hearts of those listening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After singing a song to praise Mary, it was time for a carol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The favourite song of the Koreans was Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want For Christmas Is You.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would make the heart that rose up from Ave Maria pound even more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk and Seo Ha-ran.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The stage for only those two was unfolding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Omo, there is suddenly a song. What song is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ave Maria. It is so powerful that it doesn\u2019t seem to be coming from a CD. It seems like someone is on stage.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I can\u2019t see it from here... Are we sitting in a corner?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk discovered that they couldn\u2019t see the stage from where they were sitting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Why did Tae-hyuk tell him to sit here?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, the restaurant was empty.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be good to sit in a place where they could see the stage well.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk thought so and asked Ha-ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you want to move to a place where we can see the stage better?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... I just feel like listening. In addition, I\u2019d feel sorry for the waiter if I move the food after eating. We can just keep eating here...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I don\u2019t care as long as Ha-ran is fine with it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk gazed at Ha-ran sitting in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was so beautiful that it was hard for him to even look at her properly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran blinked at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-Is there something on my face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. You are so beautiful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Y-You don\u2019t need to go that far...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNope. I am serious. It is embarrassing that I can\u2019t even express the full extent of your beauty.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s eyes were serious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At first, he thought that she was just a beautiful woman when they first met.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When he met her the second time, he realized that it wasn\u2019t just her appearance that was beautiful.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was really sweet and beautiful...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm hmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk coughed while blushing,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha... Kang-suk is also cool. Those clothes suit you really well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two quietly started eating the food, and the music turned into an exciting carol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like a Christmas blessing for both of them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The date that started from the bowling alley, planetarium, and amusement park was nearing its end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Today was really fun. I\u2019m scared to be this happy...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Ha-ran stopped.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was something strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All of a sudden, she felt a deep despair as she thought back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Ha-ran\u2019s face darkened, Kang-suk\u2019s expression became serious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He quietly wrapped his hands around Ha-ran\u2019s.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ran. You know that my job is to catch criminals who have done bad things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes... I\u2019m aware of that. You are doing a really good job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I punish those who are doing bad things. However, is there nothing in the opposite direction? I think I give their victims the right to be happy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHappy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Today was fun.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, indeed.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t want it to end today. I hope that Ha-ran will continue being happy in the future. So... Ah... That...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran realized that there was a strange attitude around Kang-suk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He kept putting his hands in his pocket and was touching something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran smiled gently at the nervous Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. If your words are hard to say then I\u2019ll wait. I\u2019m really good at waiting. So please slow down and tell me. Yes? For example, I think I waited a long time for someone... Ahaha. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUmm. T-Then, by the way, will you date me again next time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk stuttered out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran replied with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk cheered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although he couldn\u2019t communicate everything properly, he could do it slowly from now on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah right, Ha-ran. After the meal, there is a place I\u2019d like to go with you. This wasn\u2019t in the original plan, but I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a large sack beside the table where the two people were sitting, large enough to accommodate one person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk looked at it and smiled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he missed this on Christmas Eve then he would feel regret.</span></p><br/><p>@</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for Nuclear Bomb to arrive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow, I thought this was going to be Hiroshima.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He bribed one of the henchmen to report the movements of the group.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They betrayed their group so easily for one million won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was the weight of a bad group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, the time constraints meant there was no encore.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He received information from the source that the point of entry would be the through back door of the restaurant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk moved to set up a trap that was prepared in advance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then once it was the scheduled time, voices were heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you sure?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s go through the back door as I said before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The henchmen quickly followed Kang Han-seong\u2019s instructions, holding iron pipes and baseball bats in their hands.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t properly armed because they thought it would be a one-sided fight against Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue as he watched through the surveillance camera.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. Don\u2019t you know the basics of a raid? At least 30% of the total number of infiltrators should support from outside.

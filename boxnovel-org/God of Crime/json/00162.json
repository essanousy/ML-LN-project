Kiiiiiik! Kilkil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Something shone in the gap between his bright red lips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk ignored the Clown and looked around the laboratory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'There is a pierrot.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was waiting in a corner of the laboratory, as if he was sleeping.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Pierrots were standing over a chair and Seo Ha-ran was lying on top of it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Apart from being unconscious, her body seemed fine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018N-Noona!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to rush over and grab her hand to get out of here, but he couldn\u2019t do that.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The pierrots nearby were holding weapons.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran could be in danger if he did anything wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took the time to look inside the laboratory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt something.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Clown turned his head and looked at the entrance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was clearly nothing there, but he bowed down and greeted the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUhaha... I was so immersed in my research that I didn\u2019t realize a guest had come. It is a shabby place but please come in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been looking through the door with a hidden camera.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How did the Clown notice?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His words showed that it wasn\u2019t just a gamble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk placed the opera mask on his face and entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t let it be known that his purpose was Ha-ran.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to treat her like she was just a decoration in the laboratory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019m sorry to throw you away, but I will use you one last time Phantom.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was impossible to become his old self after he escaped from the influence of the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he had spent over half a year as Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could do this type of acting quite simply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk entered the lab naturally, like it was his own home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Director Go Ah-tae... no, should I call you the Clown now? It seems like you are doing something very interesting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...This is true. Are you wearing a strange mask?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is like my trademark.

Kiik, kikikikik!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown suddenly started laughing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he began to scratch at his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The nails dug at the burnt skin and it became bloody in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown continued to laugh while harming himself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he said with a grin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou! Seo Tae-hyuk! Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the moment, Tae-hyuk\u2019s heart froze.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How do this madman know his identity?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was impossible even for the mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-D-Don\u2019t tell me! Am I wrong? You clearly have the same smell as my assistant!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Smell?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a mistake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if he used the mask, he normally triggered the Disguise or Transformation skill as well.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he was only using a minimum of his crime skills now, so he was just wearing the opera mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Despite all of this, he didn\u2019t think he would be discovered through smell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk glared at the opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Demon Revealing Mirror sent him a message to tempt him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your identity has been discovered. Kill the opponent to prevent it from being leaked!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In any other circumstances, he would ignore the message; however, he could do it easily this time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk was conflicted, the Clown opened his mouth with an unconcerned expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, well, well! A precious guest has come! I don\u2019t have any tea to serve! What should I do, Jung Cho-gyu?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown seem to ask someone but there was no reply.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He started to look around the room with a hand on his forehead. But he couldn\u2019t find the person he was looking for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where, where, where are you? Another cigarette... Kuhehe! Kuhehehehek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown\u2019s face distorted with a strange joy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kekekekek! I am talking to you! Jung Cho-gyu, Jung Cho-gyuuuuu! I killed you! Kihehehehehe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gulped as he looked at the Clown\u2019s actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Crazy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That person was completely crazy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Isn't that right? Jung Cho-gyu said my research was a failure! Such a person can\u2019t be kept alive!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed as though he was seeking agreement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My great research! There is no chance it will fail. I will succeeed!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown stomped his feet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was at that moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of the pierrots seemed to slightly recover their minds and spoke,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Director, nim... The Core Drive is really dangerous. Do something wrong... really big accident...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhhh? Huhhhhhhhh? Did you just say that I failed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown\u2019s face distorted with anger thrust a sharp skewer at the pierrot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Blood and flesh splashed as the person collapsed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"K-Kuwak! Kuaaaak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown ignored the screams as he straddled the body and repeated the actions.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After less than 10 seconds, the person had died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? My research won\u2019t fail! My research is perfect! It is perfect!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A creepy madness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A monster was in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just a week ago, he was a researcher who wanted to make progress in science, but an ugly monster was born due to an accident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slowly approached the Clown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Clown.

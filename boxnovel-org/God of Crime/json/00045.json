All of them have known him since high school. I became aware of a shocking fact. That is...

If you want to know more, you have to pay extra.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes twitched.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to pay more money if he wanted to know?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t a three part porn ad, it was too much.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, Tae-hyuk needed to know.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... So how much more do I need to pay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is enough.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama emphasized the one finger that she had raised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ten million won.

Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama had really great insight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The information about Park Jung-hwan had to be obtained, even if he needed to pay a lot of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but I\u2019ve spent the 100 million I received with Rosario.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh. But you made some money from SY.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama knew about it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t do that.

You should be aware of that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'That old lioness... !\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s expression distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter what, he needed the information about Park Jung-hwan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, she might not give all the remaining information even after receiving 100 million.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unlike the Rosario incident, this time Tae-hyuk was caught on Big Mama\u2019s rod.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, Tae-hyuk decided to use a trump card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... By the way, let me ask you one thing. Is there any counterfeit artwork that you need?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama nodded with a warm smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk, who was sitting on the table, had a comfortable expression after a long time.</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk asked from where he was sitting on the opposite side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It has been a long time since you came to dinner. Have you missed Noona?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was startled and quickly replied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I came to see you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded with a convinced expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I was super busy with an awful case. Somehow it was solved. I have some time to rest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. Well, I\u2019m glad that you did well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. In fact, I didn\u2019t do anything. It is a little awkward since it somehow became my achievement. Tomorrow, I will formally report to the higher ups.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk's expression was serious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk felt a knot in his chest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a serial murderer case with two bodies and one victim.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Solving it would be a big achievement for a detective.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Kang-suk was trying to kick it away with his own feet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Ah, that person! It is the dinner I worked hard to prepare for him. Why is he going to spit it out! He is so upright that he is damaging himself!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was truly a very nice person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, such a person would only receive loss in the world.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like Tae-hyuk would have to do some work behind Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke cautiously so that he wouldn\u2019t be heard by Ha-ran who was cooking in the kitchen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, is now the time? When are you going to ask for a date?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"D-D-Date! C-Cough! We are just going to play...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sighed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like he wouldn\u2019t be able to ask for a date until he was an old man.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Tae-hyuk acted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNoona! Kang-suk hyung wants you to hang out with him this weekend!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYa, ya, hey!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was embarrassed but Ha-ran looked at him with an expression of astonishment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she looked at Kang-suk like she was waiting for something.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Kang-suk surrendered and asked Ha-ran to go out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, ugh... That's correct. Ha-ran. Do you have time to go somewhere with me this weekend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran clapped with pleasure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah...! Hang out together? Then I\u2019ll prepare a lunch box!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sighed as he glanced at Ha-ran and Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was their first date since first meeting each other three months ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How long would it take for them to become a couple?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe he should help them a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hippo incident passed in a flash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk lay down on his desk in the classroom and groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... I need to make some money. I also need to support Kang-suk hyung. Ohh. Should I just skip school?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young heard Tae-hyuk\u2019s complaints from her seat next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tae-hyuk... You can\u2019t skip school. Go home after school finishes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUgh. Did you hear?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young said with a serious voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Next week is the final exams. Have you prepared well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stared dumbly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently, he had been so busy that he didn\u2019t care about studying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The proof was that his intelligence stat hadn\u2019t risen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess not. You did seem strangely busy... If you take the test properly, didn\u2019t you say that you would be first in the school?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I can give you special lessons again this time...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young was strangely hesitant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like there was something she wanted to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is there something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no. Let's study together like last time. Will you come to my house this weekend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk realized that An Eun-young was asking for help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eun-young. Is something going on? If you don\u2019t mind then I am willing to listen to your story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young looked at Tae-hyuk with deeply touched eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she slowly explained the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tae-hyuk... That... You know...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young had an older sister.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, she recently got involved in a multi-level scheme and ran away from home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was troubled after hearing the story.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His head was about to burst just from his own matters.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But now he needed to help An Eun-young\u2019s family matters as well?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What benefits would there be?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He realized that he always made calculations before moving.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same with Big Mama.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When he used the crime skill, he had the mindset of a criminal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had received enormous help from An Eun-young.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thanks to her studying skill, he could tremendously increase his intelligence stat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could finally become a model student.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young was now asking for help.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How could he refuse just because there were no benefits?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk thought for a moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was currently ranked third.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Until he went to university, he needed An Eun-young\u2019s studying skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he helped her now then he could use her studying skills in the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was moving for An Eun-young\u2019s studying skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk came to this conclusion and said to An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you don't mind then I will help you.

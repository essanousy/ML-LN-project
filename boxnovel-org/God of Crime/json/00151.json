This means...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk combined his future knowledge and the information he had obtained as Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was able to come up with a shocking fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The hands of the Yakuza might\u2019ve reached the prosecutors as well. It is a high-ranking person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he investigated then more details would emerge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If so, he knew what had to be done from now on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, gather information.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The goal was the Taesung Institute of Physics and Chemistry.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was one of the few natural sciences institutes in South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Physics, engineering, chemistry, computational science, biology and medical science were closely studied there.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Originally, it was inside the Taesung Research Complex, but it was moved after the incident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I should go into the lion\u2019s den to catch the lion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t a place he could easily enter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just like fighting against the mafia, it was impossible to shatter all of the research institutes belonging to the Taesung Group.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had only been able to drive the mafia away from South Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If I roam around the lair as a fox, then I can escape the lion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eh? If it was a lion then he knew someone similar.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk suddenly came up with a very good plan before heading to Taesung Chemical\u2019s headquarters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike the institute, it was easy to reach by taxi.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He headed to a nearby restroom and pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Then shall I test the power of Transformation?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the new skill he learnt after upgrading to a King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The spy shouldn\u2019t be a good-looking woman.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He ended up becoming a new reporter who was in her early 20s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had bright blonde hair that was cut short, and makeup that felt unfamiliar.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The clothes she wore were the same, so the leather jacket was baggy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I forgot to change clothes. Ahaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His voice was perfectly changed into a woman\u2019s, so there was no need to use Voice Modulation separately.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used Counterfeit to change his leather jacket and jeans into a neat ladies\u2019 suit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The pass around his neck allowed him access to large companies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked in the mirror and tried to make an expression that was as innocent as possible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know where to go but he decided to try it first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Like all large companies, the entire high-rise building was the headquarters of Taesung Chemicals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once he opened the door and approached the desk, the receptionist bowed politely and greeted him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hello?

You went through a lot of trouble.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk purposely made his hair disheveled and clothes messy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He perfectly looked like a person who was in a hurry because they were running late.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The receptionist said with a soft smile,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but could you please show me your pass?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk raised the pass hanging around his neck.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">On it was the name of a person who frequently wrote articles on Taesung Chemicals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was able to register her appearance on the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was literally a bounteous tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is verified.

Did you make an appointment in advance?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made the most pathetic expression he could and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-That...S-Sunbae...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't panic. Can you tell me who it was?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The receptionist looked at the new reporter with sympathy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How was she supposed to interview someone like this?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was reminded of her new employee days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes...!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although they weren\u2019t in the same field, she decided to be kind to the rookie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A-An interview with C-Chairman Song Won-jin...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWith the boss?! T-that is impossible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The receptionist\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That interview was too big to be done by a new reporter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even she had never seen the boss before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes...

It is originally like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes flashed as he gazed at the receptionist.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had deliberately picked someone who was kind and gentle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She acted as he expected.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk left the place after completing his conversation with the friendly receptionist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is the best way to gain information.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He pretended to be a new journalist so people were vigilant against him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He never expected to meet Chairman Song Won-jin in the first place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was good enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I never thought it would be easy to see Chairman Song Won-jin.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk immediately triggered the Spying skill after he started talking to the receptionist.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After upgrading to a King, he was able to get much more detailed information from Spying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'For example, where the receiver is connected to.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could trace calls without using any equipment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When he was a Noble, skills could be raised by consuming affinity points or satisfying certain conditions.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, when he upgraded to a King, the level of all of his crime skills had risen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In addition, Tae-hyuk\u2019s psychological state became more like a psychopathic criminal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But a little thing like that didn\u2019t matter right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The place where the voice is coming from is the 7th floor of this building.

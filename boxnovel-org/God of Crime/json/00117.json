However, I will tell the warden that you need to be hospitalized for a period of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. Then Doctor, do you know why the prison is so loud right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It feels like an explosion. At first, I was nervous because I thought patients would come flocking. But you are the first visitor. If so, hadn\u2019t it ended without any casualties? Ah, I have to stitch this up so stop moving. Stay put.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul looked around at the doctor\u2019s words. Certainly, he was the only patient in here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A war was taking place between the prisoners and guards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if there were no guns, it was strange that not a single person came here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant there was no armed conflict between the two groups.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe it was related to the explosion just before...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I don't know. No matter how crazy they are, would the rebels hit this place? Ugh... Worrying about it unnecessarily just hurt my wounds. I'm sorry Doctor. Can I have a painkiller?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, wait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The doctor injected a painkiller into Park Sung-yul\u2019s arm after he complained of pain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Park Sung-yul could breathe more easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul leaned back on the bed and thought about the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Why did a subordinate of Shin Chang-ho torture him?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he had to confess everything because he was in such pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Damn, he won\u2019t tell the police right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That would undo all the work he put into creating the puzzles.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul was worried about more than just his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He gained a sense of superiority and conquest from killing someone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was an exhilarating pleasure that couldn\u2019t be explained in words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t feel that anymore thanks to one detective.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He felt like a young child who had his toy stolen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But I found something new.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the puzzles.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was moderately smart.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With the exception of the 14th murder, he had killed 13 people without the world knowing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would make them into puzzles and present them to the detective who caught him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was the beginning of the murder puzzle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul would become the man controlling the detectives from the darkness.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was different from others.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was playing a game with the police while locked in prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just thinking about that gave him a sense of superiority and conquest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul suddenly laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t feel any pain anymore, whether it was due to the medicine, or his thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know why the enemy struck.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he had known, then he wouldn\u2019t have begged in such a way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Park Joon-shik will regret making me his enemy. I am someone who is playing the country\u2019s detectives...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, the door opened and a group of criminals entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Park Sung-yul! It has been a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spoke in a friendly tone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP-Park Joon-shik?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry if you were resting, but I have someone who wants to meet you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The doctor paled as dozens of armed gangsters entered the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Park Joon-shik gestured to one of the henchmen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah Doctor, you should rest outside for a while. I need to talk to him for a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Take it easy outside. Have something like a cup of coffee from the vending machine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two of the henchmen grabbed the doctor\u2019s arms and dragged him out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim! It is ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho entered the room with a nonchalant expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the calm just before a volcano exploded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho arrived at the bed where Park Sung-yul was lying and pulled out some papers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet me ask you one thing. Is everything written here true?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul nodded with an expression like he now understood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess Shin Chang-ho is also interested in my puzzles. If you promise not to tell the police, then I will happily let you enjoy my puzzles. How about it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Park Joon-shik cried out,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This bastard! Who are you trying to bargain with?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJoon-shik. Stay still for a while. I\u2019ll finish this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Yes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho looked at Park Sung-yul with cold eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course I won\u2019t tell the police. So answer me, everything in here is true?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul answered with a brighter expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Of course. Well, you seem to like the story. If you want more details then I will tell you... Keok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Park Sung-yul couldn\u2019t say anything else.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho grabbed Park Sung-yul\u2019s mouth with a big hand and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Is that so? Ah, don\u2019t worry. I really won\u2019t say anything to the police. It is natural, since I don\u2019t have the hobby of talking about people I kill, unlike you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOof! Ooo, ooff!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul\u2019s eyes shook.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The situation didn\u2019t make sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJoon-shik. Give me the scissors from earlier.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I need to dig out his eyeballs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooooof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a shame. Are you wondering why I am acting like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kkuck!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho moved his face closer to Park Sung-yul.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he whispered in the other person\u2019s ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This person, who you killed and proudly wrote about, was my younger sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho showed Park Sung-yul the page about the 13th victim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despair filled Park Sung-yul\u2019s eyes as he understood the whole situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He ended up making the family of a woman he killed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The person also ended up being the leader of gangsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This nonsense...!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul shrieked in his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He felt his own death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho inserted strength in the hand holding the scissors.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His sister and lover...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, he would make the one who killed his only family pay.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGoodbye, Park Sung-yul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Bam!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a blunt shock the moment Shin Chang-ho raised his scissors into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What, this isn\u2019t in the contract, Cigarette Seller.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho looked at Tae-hyuk, who suddenly appeared, with cold eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The other person was holding a deformed metal pipe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis bastard! Where did he come from?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry Hyung-nim! That bastard just suddenly moved!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They screamed as Tae-hyuk abruptly appeared in the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk placed the iron pipe on his shoulder and spoke with a relaxed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shin Chang-ho. Cool down a little bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What? Don\u2019t tell me you want this bastard to live?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat isn\u2019t it, but don\u2019t you think it is a little too much to kill him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t shrink away from the dozens of people with weapons in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like he was confident that he could fight against all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kill him right here. Then what would happen? The bomb is excusable once the war with the prison guards is known to the press. However, it isn\u2019t the same when killing an inmate to resolve a grudge. This will certainly increase your sentence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It doesn\u2019t matter. Any reason I have to get out is gone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Even if she is died, don\u2019t you want to keep your promise to her?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the last promise that Shin Chang-ho shared with Shin Seo-yeon came to his mind.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Just wait seven years.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then a ring and flowers...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Do you mean that she is waiting for this promise even though she is dead?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. At least, if I were her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s words rippled through Shin Chang-ho\u2019s heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The woman who had waited a lifetime for him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was she still waiting even after death?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tears flowed from Shin Chang-ho\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes...promise...I will keep it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul, who almost died, spoke with a relieved expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Kim Cheol-su, thank you. I'm alive thanks to you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed at Park Sung-yul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, you are alive. You are alive to pay for what you have done.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk approached the bemused Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You still have three years left in prison. Are you a regular person in here? Then let your opponent know. The price of the sins he committed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuhu, kuhuhuhu. The price of his sins? That\u2019s right. I know the meaning of your words now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m glad that you understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho\u2019s eyes came back to life.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he killed Park Sung-yul, then Shin Chang-ho would receive all of the sins.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But besides killing, there were lots of ways to torment Park Sung-yul.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho came up to Park Sung-yul and whispered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Over the next three years. I will let you know what the price of your sins are. Don\u2019t worry, I have a lot of skilled men. Isn\u2019t that right? Joon-shik.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaaaaack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul\u2019s face filled with despair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he shifted his gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Cheol-su smirked at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah\u2015</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul realized who the true puppet master in this place was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'What the hell is going on?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden shouted at the armed guards and Chinese inmates standing in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All of a sudden, the passage leading to the place where the prisoners were gathered had exploded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a bomb that had dealt considerable damage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know where they got it from.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the warden couldn\u2019t move hastily until he knew how many bombs were left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this continued, then the incident would leak.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Investigators would come flocking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The traces of drug smuggling that he hadn\u2019t disposed of would be revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...We have to take out all of the prisoners right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the doctor in charge of the infirmary came running.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-Warden-nim! It is serious! Armed prisoners have attacked the infirmary...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What, the infirmary?!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The infirmary was far away from the passage where the bomb exploded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! There are around 30 of them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my god! That is almost all their power! God has helped me! If I can grab all the prisoners in the infirmary right now then this case can quietly...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light of hope appeared in the warden\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But that didn\u2019t last for even 10 seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Warden-nim! Did you send a request for support?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The deputy, who had been guarding the warden\u2019s room, came running.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What nonsense is this? Why would I do such a thing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed to keep this incident inside the prison at all cost.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Calling external support was just committing suicide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The counterterrorism team received Warden-nim\u2019s request for support and have arrived at the port by seaplane...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden ran forward with a blank expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He opened a window and looked out at the shoreline.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The deputy\u2019s words were true.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I never sent a request for support!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden howled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thanks to the support of the soldiers, the war inside the prison ended simply.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Investigators came to investigate the cause of the incident and found the drug farms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden paid for his own sins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a week since the end of the prison war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is the end of Blue Dragon Prison.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The incident couldn\u2019t be blocked and spread through the Internet media at a tremendous pace.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was all Tae-hyuk\u2019s work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cruel acts of the guards and the war of the prisoners against it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It caused a lot of controversy and talk on the Internet forums.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the warden was arrested for growing drugs, drug smuggling, abuse of prisoners by the guards, and assisting in murder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho and his group didn\u2019t suffer severe punishment because the public opinion was on their side.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, the fact that no one was hurt also played a role.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, all of them were just punished with a month of solitary confinement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk lay on the bed in his cell and smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two years later, Shin Chang-ho would\u2019ve found out that Park Sung-yul killed his sister.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the day after all of Park Sung-yul\u2019s puzzles were solved by the police.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Shin Chang-ho brutally killed Park Sung-yul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He staged it as a suicide.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The investigation didn\u2019t last long.

Anyway, did you investigate what I asked you to?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been 10 days since finding Ji-young\u2019s body. In addition, Park Sung-yul had remained silent since then.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">So how long would it take to find the remaining 12 people that he said he killed?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The best way was to plant a spy in the Blue Dragon Prison where Park Sung-yul was staying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He tried to find someone using all his connections, but it was in vain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is a lot of acting to be done. It is too much for the criminals I know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t hear a positive answer from Hyun-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So I told you to check with the other detectives.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Detectives who caught criminals were well aware of their ecology.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, they might know people inside criminal organizations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know. Most of them are busy with what they are doing right now. In addition, criminals who are free changed after hearing the words Blue Dragon.

Didn\u2019t you hear about the Killer case? Phantom can imitate other people\u2019s faces. He also knows a lot about criminals. Furthermore, don\u2019t you remember the Bomber incident? He penetrated the psychology of the culprit. If it is the Phantom, he will be able to get everything from Park Sung-yul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho fought with Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want to acknowledge it, but Phantom had a terrifying ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026But will he want to be a source of police information?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will fall to my knees and beg him if he contacts me.

He did ask for money in return for capturing criminals.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t like the Bomber case. I don\u2019t think 100 million won will come out of the budget for this case... However, it does seem like the best method. I\u2019ll ask the commissioner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you don\u2019t have enough budget then I\u2019ll add a little bit. I\u2019ll cooperate as much as possible with Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk nodded quietly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He decided to try everything he could, with kneeling as a last resort.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Anyway, first Phantom needs to contact me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Keep talking, he might call just because your voice will tickle his ears.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAish, it can\u2019t be.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Dururu-</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was suddenly a call.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk stared at the phone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The called ID said God of Crime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh!

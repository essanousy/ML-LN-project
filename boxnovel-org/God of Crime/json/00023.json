He then poured milk in his coffee and drank it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well. I see that you arrested Kim Sang-hyun yesterday?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. Do you know him?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk thought about what to say to Kang-suk. In the end, he explained everything except for the blacklist and crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk glared once he heard that a thief had robbed their home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs Ha-ran ssi okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. She is safe.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That, if something like that happens next time, then you should call Hyung straight away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk clouted Tae-hyuk with his knuckles.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Robbery had failed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOuch... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was sincerely worried about Tae-hyuk and Ha-ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk knew that Kang-suk was currently meeting with Ha-ran every weekend.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They went out to eat and watch movies.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like Ha-ran didn\u2019t hate Kang-suk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Despite the age difference, weren\u2019t they a surprisingly good match?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to cheer on the two people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, are you sure you want to meet Kim Sang-hyun?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay, as there are a few things that I want to ask him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, as a condition, Kang-suk accompanied Tae-hyuk to the interrogation room in order to meet Kim Sang-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun was handcuffed and screaming loudly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I mean, it was an accident! Why would I even go to the chief of police\u2019s house?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sat on the other side of the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hello. Kim Sang-hyun?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun stared at Tae-hyuk who suddenly appeared and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is this bastard?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is nice to meet you. I have one thing that I want to ask.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the? Are you giving kids a tour now? Has the police department gone soft?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk, who was standing at the door with crossed arms, approached.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sang-hyun. This friend is like my younger brother. Talk to him. Also, before answering, think about how much soybean paste was in the soybean paste stew that you had yesterday.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun turned pale at Kang-suk\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHiik! D-Detective Cho Kang-suk! I understand!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You\u2019ll have it for more than a week if I like what I hear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Three, no four days! I\u2019m sick of jajangmyeon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the interrogated suspects were provided with jajangmyeon from a nearby Chinese restaurant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun had already eaten it for all three of his meals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The detectives didn\u2019t even bother to give him jjampong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBrat. That\u2019s how delicious it is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, Tae-hyuk\u2019s interrogation began.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Two days ago, did you steal an item called Rosario from a house in H-dong? Let me know where it is currently at.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun whistled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There was such a thing... Do I remember?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You obviously stole it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Kang-suk had to come over again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sang-hyun. Do you want to eat pickled radish starting from today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHiik!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Kim Sang-hyun confessed everything he knew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That, I handed it over to Mama! It was completely cheap! I haven\u2019t even received the remainder of the money yet. Ah, damn. Surely, I didn\u2019t get caught because of that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey. Who is Mama? Your mother?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun flinched and replied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I can\u2019t answer that, even if you ask! This is my life!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou bastard. I am Cho Kang-suk. Do you want to keep a secret from Hyung? Say it quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk and Kim Sang-hyun started to fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed after hearing of Rosario\u2019s whereabouts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung. I think I know where it is. The interrogation can stop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-Is that so? Is this really okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk left the interrogation room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He leaned against the wall of the corridor and muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... That sly snake!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama had Rosario.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t even laugh at the sheer absurdity of the current situation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was like Son Wukong playing into the hands of Buddha.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... I asked for info on the thief who stole Rosario, so she technically didn\u2019t lie to me. Hah. What should I do now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought about leaving it alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk wasn\u2019t the type to avoid a fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He came up with a very good idea to get revenge on Big Mama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhuhu... you took Rosario, and in return, I will take away your most precious thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled slyly. </span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama welcomed him as he entered the pawn shop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Welcome. Omo, is it Seo Tae-hyuk? Did you come to leave something with me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama was still wearing black mourning clothes. Her long hair was neatly tied back.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a style that exposed her white neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That good looking smile is a trap. A nine-tailed fox!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked around Big Mama\u2019s store.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was seemed like a common pawn shop; but in reality, it was a stomping ground for thieves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had gone home to get his blacklist before coming here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He read the words he wrote down about Big Mama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is she still not big?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew what she was interested in. He knew her purpose for staying here as a stolen goods broker, and stored those things in his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Based on that information, he would be able to get what he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Nope. Actually, Mama is so pretty. Do you have time to go for a cup of coffee with me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOmo! This child. Don\u2019t play around with Mama!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama covered her mouth with a hand and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then, the smile disappeared from her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, Seo Tae-hyuk. Didn\u2019t you ask about Sang-hyun? Yesterday, he was caught trying to rob the police chief\u2019s house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You truly had no idea?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama stared into Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her eyes were eerily piercing, like she was reading his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Not at all.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see. Then, sit down on the chair over there. I will prepare a cup of tea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt sweat flowing down his back.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had only exchanged a few words, yet Big Mama had already discerned that Kim Sang-hyun was caught by Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a few moments.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Mama made a cup of green tea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t from a teabag, but was freshly brewed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama said with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The information you told me was a lie. Moreover, you even thought about coming back here. You have more guts than I thought.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mama isn\u2019t much different, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p>\"I'm not a liar like Tae-hyuk.\"</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people laughed, but the atmosphere was heavy with blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took a sip of the tea and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. Mama, what do you think about art?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama made a sound at the unexpected question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoh~ why are you asking such a thing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In fact, I'm very interested in art. The artworks hanging in your store are quite famous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn\u2019t expect that Tae-hyuk would be interested in art.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"However, aren\u2019t they all forgeries?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, they are genuine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva. This was the most important moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right. If you think of artwork as genuine, then they are genuine. If you believe that they are fake, then they are fake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama made an amazed sound.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She never thought there would be someone who thought like her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was delighted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is natural. This is the motto of the Big Mama family.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama looked at Tae-hyuk without saying anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'She is searching for my reason for coming here. I shouldn\u2019t give it to her straight away, however.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk leisurely drank the green tea that Big Mama made him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The expensive tea leaves created a completely different scent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A long time passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke in a tone that was neither too fast nor too slow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Big Mama, yesterday was the \u2018Cyan Girl\u2019 right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOmomo! How did you know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cyan Girl was one of the hidden oil paintings by the baroque master Saint Germain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was unknown to the public, but was traded among collectors for a fairly high price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t answer Mama\u2019s question. He just continued his story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I really think that it is a tragedy for one person to monopolize such a wonderful piece of work. Mama, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a picture and handed it to Big Mama.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was an image of the Trail of the Sunset that she had been looking for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The mask disappeared from Big Mama\u2019s face as her hidden feelings were revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was shocked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Beautiful. Someone with a terminal illness saw this painting, and their mind could rest at ease, despite the fact that their illness wouldn\u2019t get better. They looked at this painting until their last moments. At least, that is just what I heard. This painting was then stolen by a thief, and became a legendary masterpiece in the end. Obviously, any collector would monopolize it. So, I had a thought. Let\u2019s paint this and distribute it to the people of this world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama was at a loss for words. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same. </span><span style=\"\">The little boy in front of her was saying the same thing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How was this possible?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She never told anyone her dream.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A coincidence? </span><span style=\"\">Or destiny?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What word could explain this phenomenon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama liked art, but such art was mostly dominated by a handful of rich collectors.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, she entered the world of counterfeit art. She was living in an alley right now, but one day, she wanted to spread her ideals around the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, how did this boy come to know all her thoughts?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, the Trail of the Sunset that her dead husband liked was the first thing she wanted to copy and distribute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if all her clothes had been stripped off for the public to see.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was ashamed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time she felt like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama asked in a trembling voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That, can you tell me where you took the photo? Obviously, you want to make a deal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But we lied to each other.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo once again, I would like to offer a deal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-what...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please accept me as a disciple.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama\u2019s eyes shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was troubled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had the Trail of the Sunset that she wanted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">On the contrary, Tae-hyuk wanted her to teach him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she accepted this deal, then there would be a struggle to steal each other\u2019s possessions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Many questions surfaced and disappeared in a period of less than 10 seconds.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, she reached an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama laughed and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then you should start with cleaning.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk confirmed the message on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Crime Skill: Forgery Knowledge has been learnt.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You can create one item after analysis completion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The quality of the finished object depends on your dexterity stat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Due to low proficiency, the quality of the goods made is poor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-It has been registered in the temporary skills window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is like I thought!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He became Big Mama\u2019s disciple and had learned a new crime skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to perfectly master it, he needed to use the new skill to deal Big Mama a big blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But was this really the only way to learn a crime skill?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What if he learned how to make art for Big Mama here?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Experimenting would give him more information on the crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This skill was affected by dexterity, meaning that dexterity would increase as he practiced the skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just like how he learned to study from An Eun-young, he would learn forgery from Big Mama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, he needed to improve his dexterity to upgrade to a \u2018Noble\u2019 status.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And after he perfectly mastered the skill...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I will take everything away from Big Mama.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama had Tae-hyuk\u2019s Rosario.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would take everything away from her.

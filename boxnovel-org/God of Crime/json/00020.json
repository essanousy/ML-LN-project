There!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scene wasn\u2019t much different than it was 30 minutes ago. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hid his body in the darkness and watched.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If she had Rosario, then he could steal it using Robbery.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018She still hasn\u2019t climbed the fence.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was worried about how to enter the yard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But what if it was just a performance...?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Something different happened than usual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thief huffed angrily and kicked the wall with her feet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, this caused tremendous pain, so she grabbed her toes and started rolling on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For the first time, Tae-hyuk was able to see the face of the female thief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He almost screamed at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018T-that woman!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thief was a person that Tae-hyuk knew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had long black hair that flowed down to her waist, and a butterfly mask on her face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was it to hide her identity?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, half of the face was clearly revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is Moonlight Flower!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was in her early 20s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was 10 years younger than what Tae-hyuk remembered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the other person was also astonished to see him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kyaaak! T-thief!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... You shouldn\u2019t be the one saying that. Who is the thief?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk angrily replied to Moonlight Flower\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not a thief. You must be mistaken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat argument is hardly convincing when wearing such clothes... You completely look like a thief.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower looked down at her body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was dressed in tight clothing that showed off her body. Many of her body parts were highlighted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower shrieked again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kyaaak! Where are you looking?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower covered her chest with both arms.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was to cover something exceptionally large. </span><span style=\"\">Still, the size meant that it couldn\u2019t be completely hidden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a wry smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018I never expected to meet Moonlight Flower here, of all places.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was a capable thief who started her activities approximately four years from now.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She primarily aimed at banks, large corporations, and also conglomerates.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Rather than stealing money or objects, she was famous for leaving marks of her visit. </span><span style=\"\">She would enter a vault filled with gold bars, taking nothing and leaving after leaving a sign, showing that she was there.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For example, she would break into a museum and vandalize a painting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She only aimed for the richest, and also had a cute appearance. The youthful personality meant that she would become popular and have a large fan club.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Four years later. Did she work before her name was known?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unlikely that Moonlight Flower had robbed his house. </span><span style=\"\">However, he needed to check to confirm it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had kicked a wall, so it seemed like she couldn\u2019t move properly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk moved quickly and narrowed the distance to Moonlight Flower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower, who had fallen to the ground, instantly got up and started to run away.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A thief with sore feet...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk ran to catch the opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he was shocked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of Moonlight Flower\u2019s feet was obviously hurting, yet she was running at such a quick speed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The distance between the two people gradually started to widen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018W-what is this speed?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The movements were unexpected from someone who couldn\u2019t even climb a wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk exclaimed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a minute! I have no intention of catching you. I just want to ask you something!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heheng! Do you think I will be convinced by that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The distance widened from five metres to twenty metres in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was going to end up missing her.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Biiiik!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was at that moment. There was the sound of a whistle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were police patrolling nearby.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Two senior policemen and one junior policeman approached Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk panted as he pointed in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-thief.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to see the back of Moonlight Flower, who was currently running away. The policeman nodded like he already knew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have a perfect grasp of these streets. We will go chase them. Students, please take this path.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A group of three people ran through the streets in order to catch Moonlight Flower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk chased after Moonlight Flower, while the policemen were circling around to build a net.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had a very good knowledge of this area.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018She will be caught soon.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower had great physical abilities, so Tae-hyuk would never be able to catch her alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was four against one.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, one of the policemen had perfectly grasped the geography.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait. Should I let Moonlight Flower get caught?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was important that Tae-hyuk recover Roasario.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if Moonlight Flower wasn\u2019t the criminal, he shouldn\u2019t let her get caught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smirked.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He suddenly came up with a good idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He ignored the policemen and entered a side street.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He climbed up to the roof of a house and confirmed the location of Moonlight Flower and the policemen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Isn\u2019t she clearly being surrounded?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to read the plan from this height.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk discovered the final destination and decided to wait there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The policemen were herding Moonlight Flower like she was a rabbit. In no time, she was in a dead end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower could escape if she climbed over the wall, but she couldn\u2019t do so with an injured foot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Grab on! Quickly!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk extended his hand to Moonlight Flower from his position on the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower looked at Tae-hyuk with a confused expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn\u2019t he want to catch her?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yet Tae-hyuk suddenly appeared and shouted like he was planning to rescue Moonlight Flower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Damn, just do it! They are coming!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke again as Moonlight Flower kept hesitating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you don\u2019t grab my hand in three seconds then I am running away alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"O-Okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower grabbed the hand of the angry Tae-hyuk and climbed the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then both of them ran away with all their strength.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk arrived at a safe place and calmed his breathing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was because they wanted the reward for catching the thief or a holiday, the policemen were really persistent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had ran for over an hour and barely managed to escape. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPant...! Keok...! Really great stamina... How are you fine after running...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha. I have confidence in my stamina.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, she couldn\u2019t do something as basic as climb a wall. A strange thief.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After confirming that they were safe, Moonlight Flower made an odd expression. Then she asked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy did you save me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... I wasn\u2019t trying to catch you. Is this answer enough? Besides, I\u2019m also a thief.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then why were you chasing me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Didn\u2019t you try to rob my house a few hours ago? This is my area. It is a violation of the rules to invade my area. I was trying to tell you this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The movements of Moonlight Flower stopped completely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had met a lot of thieves in prison, and learned that they had their own laws.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it because he saved her from being caught? Moonlight Flower\u2019s expression softened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Eung. I didn\u2019t go anywhere today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had completely caught her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Someone aimed for my house and I was robbed today. It really wasn\u2019t you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower responded \u201cYes.\u201d in a small voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was surprisingly naive. </span><span style=\"\">It was a good type to be scammed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The control of the conversation was completely in Tae-hyuk\u2019s hands. She was physically better than Tae-hyuk, but he had 10 years of experience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you telling me the truth? You might have hidden the stolen item somewhere on your body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said with a smile. It was a speech that would touch the person\u2019s hidden intentions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Then check it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower huffed angrily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t expected that it would come to this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was wearing leather clothes that exposed her body. There was not much space to hide anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why, just do it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower came up to Tae-hyuk, grabbed his hand, and placed it on her chest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like he was touching a soft marshmallow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s face reddened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNothing? Is this still lacking? Do you want to check anywhere else?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk blushed and coughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Cough. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His tone had changed to speaking in honorifics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In addition, I think that you are mistaken about something. Come along with me for a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower grabbed Tae-hyuk\u2019s hand and pulled him back to the original location.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the place where she tried to cross the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know that you think I was trying to rob this house... Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong! It is just my hobby! This is actually my house!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She emphasized it again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My house!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower even took a key out from her pocket and opened the gate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Look. Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So she was trying to climb the wall of her own house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Indeed, Moonlight Flower... I really can\u2019t understand her. Really...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"By the way, are you really a thief? It is suspicious. Aren\u2019t you going to show me proof?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower\u2019s eyes narrowed with doubt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quickly pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror from his pocket and prepared a skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well. Let me show you the evidence. \"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk started slowly walking and bumped Moonlight Flower in the shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Please select the item you want to steal!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Now, let\u2019s steal something suitable.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror to see what would come up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of a sudden, Moonlight Flower rushed towards Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! What is that thing? Cute!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a mirror with a demon engraved on it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time he had seen a reaction like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk chose randomly from the list due to Moonlight Flower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018W-what! What did I steal this time?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confused Tae-hyuk searched through his pocket, and touched a piece of soft cloth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'D-Don't tell me...?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, it was the butterfly mask on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled it out and waved it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, when did you steal this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower ran to Tae-hyung, grabbed the mask, and put it on her face again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Did you see?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou saw! My face!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words. In the first place, the butterfly mask was already half falling off. Did she think it would hide her identity?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyway, do you believe that I\u2019m a thief now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower placed her hands on her waist and turned her head to the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bah. Your skills still have a long way to go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one speaking was someone who couldn\u2019t even climb the wall of her own house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk just extended his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Either way, this is a relationship. How about exchanging information among business partners?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thieves had their own network. It ranged from places to dispose of stolen goods to equipment deals. </span><span style=\"\">Even if it was still early, Moonlight Flower was a thief.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was likely that she knew more information than Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was what Tae-hyuk was aiming for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower moaned pathetically.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to help her make a decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In exchange for becoming business partners... I\u2019ll take what I just saw to the grave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... You did see! Bah! It can\u2019t be helped. Should I give you my cell phone number?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower said in a strange voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wah. You got a phone number through this outrageous method.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a dumbfounded expression and held out his cell phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Moonlight Flower approached Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could feel something soft leaning against his arm.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed. He couldn\u2019t control the blood in his body due to the good food that An Eun-young made.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His face turned red as he felt Moonlight Flower\u2019s soft body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"An old fashioned phone... By the way, why are you blushing? How old are you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is my 2nd year of high school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The cell phone seems to be the same age. At any rate, I am your Noona! Cutie, what is your name?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSeo Tae-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Noona is called Moonlight Flower. A pseudonym.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower then left her contact details in Tae-hyuk\u2019s phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hrmm. Her real name is Yoo Ha-yang.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower had registered her number with her real name, not her pseudonym. He was starting to doubt whether she really wanted to hide her identity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sent a short text to the number entered by Moonlight Flower. </span><span style=\"\">It was to exchange contact details.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Anyway, I believe that Moonlight Flower is a thief. I can take advantage of this.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen, Tae-hyuk! By careful when walking the streets at night!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Moonlight Flower noona should be careful not to get hurt when falling from the wall. Be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn\u2019t fall!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said goodbye and started walking home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To Moonlight Flower, stealing was a \u2018hobby.\u2019 It didn\u2019t matter if she was just a clumsy novice now, as her growth potential was tremendous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018She has really good physical capabilities... I can use this.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Above all, her chest was big.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Pant...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk was running through the dimly lit aquarium.\u00a0</span>Something was strange about this place. It took him more than five minutes to run to the other side, yet the path had yet to end.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... What? Wasn\u2019t this here earlier?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was breathing roughly.\u00a0</span>After running around for a while, he realized that he had returned to his original place. There was clearly only one path among the tanks. He felt like a rat trapped in a maze.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> While this was happening, the hippo might be killing another innocent victim.\u00a0</span>Kang-suk took a deep breath and started running towards the other side of the aquarium again. Colorful fish were swimming in the tanks. However, Kang-suk couldn\u2019t afford to think about it.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... Here again!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was a dreamlike coral reef tank in front of Kang-suk.\u00a0</span>He had once again returned to the starting point. He had to get out of this aquarium. But when he tried to go to the opposite passage, some mysterious power sent Kang-suk back to the origin.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Is this the hall of the nine-tailed fox?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk suddenly recalled the old story about the nine-tailed fox.\u00a0</span>As someone walked through a dark mountain trail, a beauty appeared. The man followed her deeper into the mountain. By the time he recovered his spirit, he was standing in front of a deep cliff.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> This situation was just like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018It can\u2019t be...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk shook his head.\u00a0</span>It was unlikely that this was the same as the legend. He was probably overthinking it.\u00a0Now he had to just think about going through the aquarium that had become a maze.\u00a0At that time, he heard a rustling sound.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Uh, is this the sound of paper?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was coming from the other side of the aisle. It was a place that wasn\u2019t blocked by the maze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"There is someone in here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk clenched his teeth and ran. The maze wasn\u2019t the problem. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He just couldn\u2019t delay any longer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Do you think this maze will stop me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk decided to go to the other side of the aquarium, even if he had to smash through something.\u00a0</span>His senses were telling him that the hippo was there. In the end, there were around 10 incidents of vandalism. How many months salary would that be?</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> But there was no need to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cUh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk stopped moving.\u00a0</span>There was definitely a large tropical fish tank. However, it was still far away. He could also see someone collapsed on the far side.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c\u2026 Is this the real hall of the nine-tailed fox?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk pulled out the handgun that was hanging from his waist.\u00a0</span>He loaded it so that he could fire at any time.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The first round was a blank. </span><span style=\"\">But from the second round, there were real bullets. He was prepared to fire if he met the hippo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"First of all, I will aim at his feet... Maybe I should accidentally miss? The groin...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk took a deep breath and stepped forward.\u00a0</span>He had worked for seven years in the field, but his fingers were shaking at this moment. The aquarium was dark so he couldn\u2019t tell who the other person was until he got close.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> A person tied up with clothes...\u00a0</span>The shadow was familiar.\u00a0Kang-suk ran forward without thinking and confirmed the man\u2019s face.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cK-Kim Jong-wook...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Why was he collapsed here?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk could only think of one possibility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c\u2026 Is he here to catch the hippo?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk recalled that Joo Hyun-ho had asked for assistance from the police nearby.\u00a0</span>There was a high chance that Kim Jong-wook had come here to catch the hippo. First, he had to check if Jong-wook was alive. Kang-suk touched a finger to Jong-wook\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He found a vein and looked for a pulse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cA-Alive! Eh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He turned Jong-wook\u2019s forehead and revealed something that had previously been hidden.\u00a0</span>There was something written on it. It was written with felt tip pen, and his forehead was sweaty so it was hard to read at first.\u00a0<span style=\"\">But once he concentrated, he thought he could read the letters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk slowly read each character out loud. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... This, bastard, H, hippo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then there was a long arrow pointing to the mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cIt means there is something in his mouth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk opened Jong-wook\u2019s mouth and checked for what was inside.\u00a0</span>Jong-wook was completely unconscious so there were no signs of his eyes opening.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cSD card?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Everything would become clear once he checked the contents.\u00a0</span>Kang-suk pulled out his phone and tried to call Hyun-ho. By the way, there were a lot of missed calls.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cEh? That Hyun-ho brat. He called me a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He had forgotten that it was on vibrate and hadn\u2019t realized that there were calls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAigoo... He will be very angry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk sighed, entered Hyun-ho\u2019s number, and pressed the call button. </span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Dururu.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The signal connection and Hyun-ho\u2019s excited voice was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">Sunbae!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Why are you only calling me now!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Right here...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cStop nagging. Come to the aquarium. I think I caught the hippo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">Huh?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk hung up and looked up at the ceiling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Something extraordinary had happened while he was wandering in the maze.\u00a0</span>Had the nine-tailed fox really appeared here?</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk couldn\u2019t understand it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm so this is how he slowly killed his victims.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cOh! Son of a bitch!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk cursed as he watched the video on the SD card.\u00a0</span>Kim Jong-wook had trapped the woman inside the tank and tortured her.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho found the scene of the hippo killing someone very interesting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Kim Jong-wook is the hippo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The SD card was undeniable proof.\u00a0</span>Kang-suk narrowed his eyes as he glared.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hyun-ho. Can I hit him once? It will be fine if you pretend not to see anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHold on, your hands will get dirty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"That bastard brutally...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk couldn\u2019t stand his anger and made a fist. There was a loud sound as his joints cracked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Fortunately, the video was cut off in the middle. Perhaps the victim is still alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes. I found her and called an ambulance. She has hypothermia. However, there appears to be no risk to her life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well done!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho suddenly recalled something as he stared at the video and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAh, Sunbae. I figured out why he used salt water.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cA-All of a sudden...? We caught the culprit so it is all over. We just need to write up a report.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He didn\u2019t want to hear any more horrible stories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAren\u2019t you curious as to why he used salt water?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hrm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk didn\u2019t answer. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho started talking on his own.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cIt turned out to be simple. People drink water to maintain the concentration of ingredients in the blood, such as sodium. On the other hand, if they drink too much water, then the kidneys can\u2019t handle it properly. The concentration of components in the blood will become very thin. This osmotic phenomenon will cause the body\u2019s cells to absorb the moisture and swell up. Then the organs and brain will fail!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cFuck. What does that mean? What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk rubbed his knuckles against Hyun-ho\u2019s head.\u00a0</span>Hyun-ho laughed and continued.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"In order to feed the person as much water as possible, he needs to feed them salt water in order to maintain the body\u2019s salinity. A large amount isn\u2019t needed. It's why the coroner couldn\u2019t find the salt. The blood maintained the same salinity so he couldn\u2019t find anything suspicious. It is because the hippo wanted to feed them to drink as much water as possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cCrazy bastard...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk spat on the floor.\u00a0</span>He felt like he wouldn\u2019t be able to drink water in a while.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThen... Who caught the hippo? Isn\u2019t it the same person who saved the victim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk questioned.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p>First, he had to deal with the hippo who had been placed in the corridor.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Anyway, let\u2019s call the investigation headquarters. What would the inspector say after hearing that the hippo was finally arrested?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Won\u2019t he look like a boiled octopus?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Sunbae, you just imagined it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho held his belly and laughed.\u00a0</span>Kang-suk sighed. Even if he was skilled, Hyun-ho was too frivolous.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"But what do we report about how the hippo was caught?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cCough. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m going to report that something struck the hippo and suddenly disappeared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cBut who are they? They realized the identity of the hippo before the Sunbae and I did. He was caught in a way I never imagined. Maybe he is the God of Investigation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk slowly thought about the person.\u00a0</span>No matter how he looked at the evidence, he couldn\u2019t tell who it was.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then he said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"No, he isn\u2019t the God of Investigation. The video taken on the SD card was from a hidden camera. Also, look at the state of the hippo. He wasn\u2019t caught in a legitimate way.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"That\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ah, I\u2019d rather call him something else.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well, did you think of a better nickname?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... God of Crime.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cPuhaha! Sunbae! Have you been reading too much manhwa?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho chuckled again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk responded with a red face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cGod of Investigation isn\u2019t the same?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 20 minutes after reporting, they heard the sound of sirens.\u00a0</span>Kang-suk and Hyun-ho\u2019s work was over.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Inspector Kim Do-shik rushed into the aquarium.\u00a0</span>His eyes shone as he heard that they caught the hippo. In particular, his face turned red after hearing that the hippo\u2019s identity was a policeman. Kim Do-shik was more agitated than usual as he tried to calm his excitement.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hahaha! Detective Cho! Investigator Joo! I knew the two of you could pull it off! Well done! Bravo! Hooray for Detective Cho! I\u2019ll make sure to tell the chief that Detective Cho resolved this case!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAh, thank you. Still, the criminal is a police officer...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well, the media doesn\u2019t have to know. We can handle this quietly. You have suffered a lot in the meantime. Take a rest for the next few days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The incident was resolved, but there was a bitter aftertaste.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho, who had been watching Kim Jong-wook, approached Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cSunbae. I want to talk to you for a bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cEh? Really? Inspector. I'm sorry but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Uh, go!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk followed Hyun-ho to another place.\u00a0</span>Once they arrived in a place with no one present, Hyun-ho opened his mouth.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The hippo gained consciousness, but his words are a bit strange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What did he say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"A person who didn\u2019t die when stabbed with a knife. Changing the voice at will. An iron pipe appearing out of thin air. What the hell is that? The contents are really strange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cPerhaps...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was all ridiculous.\u00a0</span>If all of that was possible...</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThe person who caught the hippo would truly the God of Crime, Sunbae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk was watching the police from a place far from the aquarium.\u00a0</span>With this, Cho Kang-suk would receive tremendous acclaim as the one who arrested the hippo. As the identity of the hippo was a police offer, it wouldn\u2019t be known to the mass media but it was certain that he would get a promotion.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk was reminded of his sister Seo Ha-ran.\u00a0</span>She became the head of the family at a young age. She gave up her dreams to take care of her family. Rather than love, she had to do the housework on the weekend.\u00a0He wanted to find a good partner for such a sister.\u00a0He would do anything to see the two people living happily.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> In order to do that, Kang-suk\u2019s status should rise a little more.\u00a0</span>Simply catching criminals in the field was insufficient.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Principal investigator...\u00a0</span>No, shouldn\u2019t he at least be a police commissioner?</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk laughed. That seemed too far in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Shouldn\u2019t they go on their first date first? Ahu. How can I turn the bear into a gentlemen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk\u2019s dating plan was created in Tae-hyuk\u2019s mind.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Brr!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> At the same time, a vibration was heard in two places.\u00a0</span>Tae-hyuk checked the Demon Revealing Mirror first.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Oh, 10 affinity points! A-Amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He acquired 10 affinity points all at once.\u00a0</span>Tae-hyuk grinned from ear to ear. With this, he would be able to strengthen two skills.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Then the phone...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The smartphone was cracked due to the hippo\u2019s strikes. Still, it was possible to receive calls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hello?\"</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Uh, Tae-hyuk.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Sorry for calling you late at night.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">It is Mama.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The caller was Big Mama.\u00a0</span>Tae-hyuk lowered his voice.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... Did something happen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">This is about your commission from the other day.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">The results are out.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">But it is a little strange so I called to deliver the results right away.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk had commissioned information from Big Mama three weeks ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was about Park Jung-hwan, whose death Tae-hyuk was framed for. Then he found out that Park Jung-hwan was prying into Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span>It was strange.\u00a0So he wanted to find out where Park Jung-hwan was and check it out for himself.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> What was the reason?\u00a0</span>He felt like there was a huge hidden conspiracy. Therefore, he had given 10 million won to Big Mama to find Park Jung-hwan\u2019s whereabouts.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It took a bit long but the results had now come out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... Where is Park Jung-hwan now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">He is dead.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">It occurred two years ago...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk dropped his phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Park Jung-hwan was dead?\u00a0</span>He was framed four years later for killing Park Jung-hwan. But now he was already dead?! It was also two years ago? What the hell was this?!</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then who was digging for information on Tae-hyuk?\u00a0</span>It had clearly been Park Jung-hwan.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk stared at the sky with a bemused expression.\u00a0</span>The truth, which he thought would be uncovered to a certain extent, just got further away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I will use everything I can!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk moved the clouds around his body towards the believers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The bishops seemed familiar with the smoke, but the believers were different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were those who bowed or wailed like a child.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the curtain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The situation meant that the king had to come out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some time passed by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader, who had never been seen before, slowly walked forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man had a corpse-like face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had pale white skin. Unfocused pupils. White lips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like opening a coffin and looking at the person inside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t seem like a living person at all.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was difficult to guess his age because there were no fine lines on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But although he pretended to be as calm as possible, he couldn\u2019t hide his fingers shaking with tension.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He opened his mouth with a veneer of calm,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you really Pungbaek?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a clear question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes and looked at the leader.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He knew how much pressure silence would give in this situation, so he decided to use it moderately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason why Tae-hyuk proclaimed himself as Pungbaek was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unlike Unsa and Usa who were called masters, Pungbaek was the head of the 3,000 followers and was called Earl.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was called Wind Master, Verve, Rain master, Head of a Thousand Arms, etc. However, his most famous title was Pungbaek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Despite going through hundreds of rebirths through the cycle of life and death, have you forgotten the face of the firstborn?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dignified figure was literally the God of Wind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...T-Then show me the evidence. This isn\u2019t enough to prove that you are Pungbaek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was one of the bishops who attacked first.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He asked Tae-hyuk to prove that he was truly Pungbaek in order to raise doubts.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the modus operandi of those who pretended to have powers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe it has been too long. As long as the sun exists, the wind, rain and clouds will forever repeat their lives and deaths. It is no wonder that Usa doesn\u2019t remember me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt goosebumps form as he continued talking in the tone of a historical drama.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it was why he used Kim Bum-soo\u2019s voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could now speak for several hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk waved his hands and the clouds moved along with his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Repeatedly using Counterfeit was very tiring, but the effect was enormous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Usa and Unsa are unsatisfied with the human body and repeated the cycle of reincarnation. And now the name of the leader is clearly...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He paused for a moment, heightening the atmosphere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he slowly called the opponent\u2019s name.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCho Min-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk\u2019s calm face suddenly distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is no need to be surprised, but your people seem to be carrying a little bit of dirt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk walked lightly to Song Chi-hyun and touched his shoulders.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a soft touch, like a massage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Robbery!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, a sharp knife appeared in Tae-hyuk\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hueeok!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun groaned like he had seen a ghost.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The knife had been hidden in his clothes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yet the other person took it just by lightly touching his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t have believed it if he hadn\u2019t seen it directly with his own eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t a technique that humans could show.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, this wasn\u2019t the end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk turned the knife a few times like he was shaking off the dust, then stabbed it in Song Chi-hyun\u2019s belly.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Hwaaaaack!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKwaaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the unexpected attack, Song Chi-hyun grabbed his bloody belly and collapsed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Pungbaek attacked Usa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, no, he clearly said that Hwanin... Is that Usa fake?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Was he killed because he is a fake? Ah, he is still alive!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don't have to worry. I did this as a demonstration.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk beckoned to the believers near Song Chi-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Take off his robe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Ah, yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scared believers stripped off Song Chi-hyun\u2019s heavy robes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They saw the blood that spurted from the stab wound.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then there were alarmed screams!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-He is dead!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"P-Pungbaek! Please have mercy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Pungbaek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stretched out his hand towards Song Chi-hyun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The cloud surrounding his body spread towards Song Chi-hyun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a miracle happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-What am I seeing now...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe wound is healed!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ahh, P-Pungbaek. It is really Pungbaek...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun groaned and sat up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He touched his belly with a bewildered look.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-Heok! W-What? Wasn\u2019t I obviously stabbed by a knife?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The believers were stunned by the sight and there were those who even fainted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun looked over at the celestial being.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yes, celestial being.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a real celestial being.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cR-R-R-Rea...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was so agitated that words couldn\u2019t come out properly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they first met, he thought the other person was just a high school teacher.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he had changed into a god.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A miracle occurred that was different from the scam they had been doing so far.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One hand could control wind and clouds, and the other could treat fatal injuries.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was literally a heavenly being from the stories.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun unknowingly fell to his knees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'If I expose them as fake, then I can break the Sun Cult.

Now...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had acted a perfect play.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The bishops and believers thought he was Pungbaek.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could dismantle Sun with simple words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But before that, there was information he needed to obtain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The play couldn\u2019t finish yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said with a stern expression,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou seem to be misunderstanding something.

On September 17. After that, he started looking for his brothers and sisters.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was exactly when Sun was created.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the leader denied the words, then it was like confessing this was a scam.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had no choice but to agree to the nonsense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All the believers gathered here in the name of Hwanin.

Ah...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to continue until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you remembering now, Usa?

Nothing lasts forever in front of time. Even though Hwanung\u2019s technique is great, he can\u2019t keep them sealed up forever. It will gradually leak and disappear naturally.

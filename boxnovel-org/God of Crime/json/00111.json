What are you doing? Go to work!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man sitting on the toilet raised his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The face that had been fine just yesterday was now in pain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Number 304 groaned and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGuard-nim. I\u2019m sorry. M-My stomach...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, what is this smell? Finish up and come out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cell next door had a similar situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, it was worse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cF-Finish quickly! I don\u2019t want to see this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt keeps coming. I can\u2019t stop it in the middle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cF-Fuck, leaking...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Get out of here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Something was strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The same thing was happening in most of the cells.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In one room, the person hadn\u2019t been able to reach the toilet and there was a disgusting smell in the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNumber 411! Ya, hey!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The new guard was dismayed as there was no reaction from the prisoner.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he opened the door with a key and went inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Number 411 had collapsed on the bed like he was dead.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The bed was messed up with vomit and feces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStomach pains... Nausea, diarrhea... This is food poisoning!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In addition, it seemed to be affecting many prisoners.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe need to report this to the warden!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The new guard realized that he had to tell the warden before the situation became serious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After an hour went by, the warden and guards gathered for an emergency meeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Food poisoning?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden\u2019s face distorted as he heard the report of the prison guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A few days ago, the logistics line had broken down, but there was still one ship that could be operated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were also food ingredients piled up in the warehouse.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, one of the remaining bastions, the food warehouse, had bacteria growing that was causing food poisoning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even so, he couldn\u2019t panic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After a week, he could harvest the money from the farms.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If outsiders entered here, then he would have to pull them all out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wanted to avoid that no matter what.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere aren\u2019t good crops these days so the output is decreasing... If we fail to properly harvest it at this time...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just imagining it was terrible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The warden issued instructions to the guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Go to the warehouse and use the food poisoning bacteria detector! We purchased it just for occasions like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yep! I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some of the guards hurriedly rushed out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In such a situation, it would take a long time to do a full investigation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I need to mobilize the remaining supply ship as soon as possible. Damn. In addition, the budget...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, one of the prison\u2019s secretaries raised his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why?!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Warden-nim... I was going to tell you today, but the engine for the remaining supply ship is broken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-What the?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden felt dizzy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would take a week for the repairs on the other ship to finish.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, if he asked for support from the outside then he risked exposing his gardens.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn. I need to hope that a lot of ingredients are safe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden sat in his chair and waited for the investigation people to come back.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Bad news constantly came in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Warden-nim! There is no more room in the infirmary. There are more than 50 patients.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are even guards who are patients. The entire prison is paralyzed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Warden-nim...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ward..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His last hope was that the food poisoning bacteria hadn\u2019t spread too much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One hour passed by.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eventually, the team that went to investigate the food ingredients returned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fortunately, not all of the food supply was contaminated with the bacteria.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cR-Really? I\u2019m glad... How much is still fine?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c30... No, it is around 20%. There isn\u2019t enough for the guards to eat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden collapsed onto his chair as he became aware of the desperate situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the worst.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should I do...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t get a clear answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk went to the store selling food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were selling simple food like sausages, canned tuna, and smoked chicken legs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would like to buy all of it, but it would be considered suspicious if he did so.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he bought only enough to fit into a box of sweets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What type of dinner are you having?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The food store worker asked with a curious expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk just smiled instead of answering.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was enough for him to eat alone for a week.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guards were distracted by the food poisoning epidemic inside the prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They wouldn\u2019t even realize if I tried to escape right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk muttered with a sausage in his mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ever since he put the bacteria on the food, he hadn\u2019t eaten anything other than instant food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once he returned to his cell, Yoo Cheol-ho was groaning on the bed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had been sitting on the toilet all night but it seemed like it was blocked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuook...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho grabbed his belly and groaned. There were so many patients in the infirmary that he had to stay in his cell.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He received a few treatment pills and an IV.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to prevent dehydration, it was necessary to continue taking electrolytic water, which was simply salt water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Water, give me water.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and grabbed bucket on the table next to Yoo Cheol-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His cellmate ended up suffering from his work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you want me to feed you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho took the bucket of water with trembling hands and gulped it down.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, more of it flowed down his chin than into his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn... Those scum should cook the food properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho grunted from his spot on the bed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hid his food in between the sheets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he ate one more sausage as he watched the guards walking around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once a person had food poisoning, they had to drink plenty of water to prevent symptoms of dehydration.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If they took antibiotics to treat the bacterial poisoning, they could be cured within a few days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Make sure to take the antibiotics 30 minutes after eating. Drink at least two liters of water a day for three days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The patients in the infirmary finished their treatment and started returning to their rooms.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like the food poisoning incident was finished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But the main problem was in the dining room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">White rice porridge was on the menu twice in a row, which wasn\u2019t even enough to fill their stomachs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of the inmates spoke after receiving the food from the worker,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is this? Are we in Auschwitz? Why are we eating something like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The worker responsible for the food distribution replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the warden\u2019s command. Since everybody became sick from the food poisoning, he ordered porridge to be served. Just eat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fuck, did I get food poisoning?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A watching guard came running over and grabbed the inmate\u2019s collar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Get away right now, Number 974! Didn\u2019t I say you would be put in solitary confinement if you fought one more time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Number 974 said to the guard,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, is this too much? Still, I\u2019m not eating this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eat the meal. It is a precious food made from the taxes of the people, so eat it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What expression is this bastard making?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Number 974 smiled before heading to his seat with his tray.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, Number 974 wasn\u2019t the only one who complained.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no need to use a spoon; they just tilted their plates and poured it into their mouths.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This isn\u2019t enough. Damn, I\u2019m going to get some chicken legs from the store.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The inmates started flocking towards the store.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although it cost money, they couldn\u2019t handle just one bowl of porridge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Number 974 joined the long line to the store.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was able to enter the store just as lunchtime was over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? It is all gone!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The food that could be eaten had disappeared like locusts had passed by.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were only a few condiments left, such as sesame oil and hot pepper paste.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Number 974 asked the worker responsible for the store.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When will more goods be coming in?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't know. At least a week.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrazy. Isn\u2019t there anything to put out this fire?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The worker pulled out a link of sausage and a chicken leg hidden in a corner of the counter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll give this to you. Don't tell anybody else.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I understand. I will eat it well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Number 974 went outside thinking that he had become friends with the worker.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After a day or two, this rush would end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He laughed at the thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Another day passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the meals didn\u2019t return to normal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The inmates were eating things like anpan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, most of them grabbed their bellies and groaned from hunger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is this? Everything is crazy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard from someone that the guards are eating very well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. What are we?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were trapped in a prison and there was no place to relieve their accumulated stress.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After a few days of the food crisis, their anger was reaching a boiling point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, do I smell sausage from your body?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What nonsense are you saying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, I\u2019m sure of it. Did you eat secretly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The prisoners\u2019 feelings became more intense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Little by little, they became harder for the guards to deal with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk watched from a corner and realized that it was almost time for the final stages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The prisoners would now become bombs that would explode.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, they couldn\u2019t do anything against armed guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I need a hot explosion for the prison war, and it can only be done by him.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked around for a certain person\u2019s face and sat in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe meal is delicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is nice to eat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung smiled as he faced Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there were no emotions in his eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt as if he had transcended all things in this world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Bomber Kim Tae-sung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quietly said the other person\u2019s nickname.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung\u2019s hands trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You know my nickname.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know very well.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My identity is classified as first class confidential.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Not many people knew that Kim Tae-sung was confined here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a man who could make a bomb that would blow up a building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a chance he could be taken into a criminal organization, which could lead to terrorism.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man who smashed the Taesung Group with only one bomb stared at Tae-hyuk with empty eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll get straight to the point.

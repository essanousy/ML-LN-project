I will wear the Santa costume.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk proposed wearing the Santa suit for his volunteer work.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was misunderstood as strange behaviour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran poked her fingers together in embarrassment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two people laughed as they looked at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-Ha-ran. What were you imagining?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kang-suk should\u2019ve given me a precise explanation!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk finally realized that his explanation was quite poor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I\u2019ll explain. There is an orphanage that I sponsor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOrphanage?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. They have no parents to become Santa, so every year I become Santa. I wanted to go with Ha-ran this year so I prepared the costumes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran started to move her fingers in circles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I-I didn\u2019t know so I had some strange thoughts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you don\u2019t mind, would you like to hand out gifts with me? Maybe you will like it as well. Oh, today was supposed to be a day for Ha-ran. Sorry for asking this all of a sudden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s heart started to beat faster at the gruff, but warm Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I want to go with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Then let\u2019s change the clothes we are wearing. If we clearly explain to the owner then he will let us use the locker room. Oh, do you want to be Santa or the elf? It is a little big because the Santa costume is for men.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll take the elf.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The costume that Kang-suk provided wasn\u2019t like Tinkerbell, who was often the image when thinking of a fairy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a Christmas elf with pumpkin pants and a green cap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ve changed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Me too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran couldn\u2019t resist laughing after seeing Kang-suk wearing Santa clothes and the beard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"F-Fuhub...! I\u2019m sorry. It really suits you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked like he was a mixed martial artist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will really look like it if I carry the gifts. Haha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! Santa should have presents!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s go. The limo will be waiting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Santa is coming in a limo instead of a sleigh. It is strangely modern.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Indeed.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people looked at each other and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The prepared gifts weren\u2019t that expensive.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Teddy bears, crayons, sketchbooks, lego toys, etc.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The name of each child was written on the wrapping paper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran asked after seeing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you prepare everything they wanted?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Last month, I asked them to write down any gift that they wanted to receive from Grandpa Santa. I prepared their gifts to the best of my ability.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is really great. You do this every year?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I started five years ago. But a few years ago, they started telling me to bring Rudolph or an elf. That reminded me to ask Ha-ran to join me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran realized that the children knew Santa\u2019s identity, and she could understand the meaning of the children telling Kang-suk not to come alone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her chest warmed at their consideration towards each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So shall we do this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was carrying heavy gifts but her footsteps seemed strangely light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHohoho! Kids, Santa is here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! Kang-suk o... No, Santa oppa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Today I even brought an elf noona!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! Oppa is good!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The children of the orphanage cheered at Santa Kang-suk\u2019s appearance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The popularity of Santa Kang-suk was enormous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The amount of gifts was too much for Kang-suk to carry alone, so Ha-ran arrived a bit later with some gifts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! Elf noona is also working!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran raised her hand and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, please stand in a line to make it easier for Grandpa Santa to hand out the gifts!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A girl, who seemed to be an elementary student, shook her head and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Not grandpa! Oppa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, Santa oppa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was happy not to be called a grandpa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran felt strangely sorry.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The kindergarten kids seemed to know the identity of Santa Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHohoho! Merry Christmas!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, Ha-ran burst out laughing after seeing him desperately pretending to be Santa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! Elf\u00a0unni! Your smile is so beautiful!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you. Since Santa oppa is busy, I will give out the gifts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes~\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The kids gathered in front of Ha-ran like baby birds waiting for food.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran laughed at the cute faces.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Ha-ran looked at Kang-suk who had children hanging on him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He did this type of thing every year, but he also worked day and night shifts to catch criminals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But this was more like a family than a sponsorship.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. Santa doesn\u2019t have enough sense.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran suddenly heard a familiar voice from behind her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was Seo Tae-hyuk, dressed as Rudolph.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? T-Tae-hyuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This can\u2019t be missed when it is Christmas.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk started stacking some boxes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The children shrieked with joy when they saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! Cake!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Chicken!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Rudolph is amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Santa Kang-suk asked Rudolph Tae-hyuk,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-How did you know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. You suddenly disappeared on the date. If you do this then you should tell me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. I forgot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, I will share this. It is one box per two people. There is plenty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"As expected from our Rudolph!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Santa Kang-suk, Rudolph Tae-hyuk and Elf Ha-ran.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The three representatives of Christmas earnestly started the Christmas party with the children of the orphanage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Everyone gathered shouted with one heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a fun party for a sacred night.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At dawn, it was a restaurant staff member who came to work and discovered it.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Christmas morning, but he could get more money on days like this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anyway, it wasn\u2019t like he had family to spend the holidays with.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to make as much money as possible to pay the rent for next month.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Snow had fallen overnight so the streets were covered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, this is the devil's dung powder.

It is cold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The weather was cold enough to petrify the brain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Every time he opened his mouth, a white cloud would emerge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that moment, he found something strange in front of the restaurant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChristmas tree?

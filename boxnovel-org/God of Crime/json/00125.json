Pungbaek=earl of the wind. Unsa=master of the clouds)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo cried out at the familiar names,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat means you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I am Usa.\u201d (Another follower. Master of the rain)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were three people from the Dangun myth. (See the Hwanin link)\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were natural titles based on the leader of the church being called Hwanin.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that moment, someone\u2019s voice was heard from among the silent followers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO-Oppa?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo stared at the other person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was wearing court clothing, but he was sure that she was his sister.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, this brat! What are you doing here?! Do you know how worried I have been?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What...? I have become one of the seven fairies who serve Hwanin. More than that, Oppa. Listen. Hwanin is really great...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the brother and sister reunited, Tae-hyuk looked at the shadow beyond the curtain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was Cho Min-hyuk, the leader of \u2018Sun.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'No, isn\u2019t he called Hwanin here? However, this scent is clearly...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a few incense burners placed around the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A slightly sweet aroma was coming from them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the incense that Choi Sung-yeol used to blur the mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is diluted since my stats aren\u2019t falling as drastically as the last time it happened. However, it certainly looks like his judgement is declining.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo\u2019s eyes were drooping and the mental strength of a soldier couldn\u2019t be seen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The Yakuza made this? It has a crazy effect...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the cause of the blind devotion among the followers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The interior decorations and gorgeous garments that seemed to come from a historical drama set were meant to hide it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo was perfectly drunk on the scent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even so, he never forgot his purpose for coming here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Cough! Anyway, I will be taking my sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I mean, I\u2019m not going! I will continue staying here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Min-young\u2019s voice was small compared to her brother, who seemed like he would burst on fire at any moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He grabbed her hand to drag her out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the watching bishops didn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like they had expected this and were waiting for something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk realized that the shadow behind the curtain had started swaying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is starting.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if it was waiting, a strange voice flowed from behind the curtain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLee Gun-woo. Your sister is tied up by karma. If you bring her out of here, then she will lose her life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fury filled Lee Gun-woo\u2019s eyes at the words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how he scolded her, she was still his sister.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t allow any threats to her life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. You\u2019ve finally exposed your true colours! I think I know how you scammed Min-young.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Min-young. Ignore his words.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo pulled his sister\u2019s hand and tried to leave the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He thought that his little sister probably told them his personal information.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Lee Min-young\u2019s condition was strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She desperately tried to persuade Lee Gun-woo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Oppa, you are misunderstanding. Hwanin\u2019s words are all true.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader whispered in a low voice towards the confused Lee Gun-woo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLee Gun-woo. The same applies to you. You are also tied up by karma.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo started shouting,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is like I told my sister! Who would fall for such tricks?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the leader spoke like he was giving a prophecy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aren\u2019t you struggling because of the distorted future?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyone can say that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think it would be nice to speak a little more clearly. Captain Lee Gun-woo and Private Park\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Woo-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo stopped moving with a shocked expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He seemed like a stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the surprised Lee Min-young asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO-Oppa? What is it? What does Hwanin mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t make sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How did that person...?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The accident that occurred six months ago appeared in Lee Gun-woo\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was treated as confidential, and his name didn\u2019t even appear in the newspapers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Naturally, he didn\u2019t even inform his family.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But that name emerged from that person\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk tsk. Have you realized your ignorance? But don\u2019t worry. The sins committed are also part of the cleansing. It is my role to remedy that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was originally scheduled to be promoted to major.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He felt he was doing well and couldn\u2019t be touched as he lived at headquarters.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there was a huge mistake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo ignored the harsh abuse that was happening.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The victim, Park Woo-hyuk, couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and committed suicide through a grenade in his barrack.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At the time, there were four other soldiers present and they also lost their lives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a big enough event for the unit itself to be dismantled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo could\u2019ve stopped it if he paid more attention to the team.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, his promotion disappeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was barely able to avoid a dishonourable discharge due to his history.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Your karma is the soldiers who died unjustly. An offering is necessary to purify it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOffering? Money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The answer came from a different place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa, Hwanin isn\u2019t interested in such things. He isn\u2019t a shaman who tricks people for money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then what is the offering?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader stopped for a moment and beckoned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The believers moved and lit a few more incense burners.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The scent became more widespread in the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The proof that you are still alive is enough. The clothes you wore, the bedding you sleep in, the shoes you wear. Offer them up in the cleansing ritual.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The words were convincing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the leader had asked for money, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it so easily.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the offerings were just keepsakes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Wouldn\u2019t it be okay to try it once?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some time passed by.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The distressed Lee Gun-woo finally opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Cough. For Min-young\u2019s sake, I guess I can listen to your story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"As long as you have the offerings, all the things necessary for the cleansing will be prepared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Min-young clapped happily at Gun-woo\u2019s response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Right? I told you it wasn\u2019t fake. Hwanin is the real thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gun-woo involuntarily nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun smiled at the sight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had been a long time since the play had been so perfectly completed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had been scamming people for years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They used it to secure hundreds of believers, but this was the first time it was perfected.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There wasn\u2019t a chance of getting unknown information from outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was true that money wasn\u2019t important.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As long as they gained the person\u2019s faith, they had obtained the life of that person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now Pungbaek and Unsa would put the finishing touches on the scam.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the remaining person...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun looked at the man who came with Lee Gun-woo.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a high school maths teacher.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was the only information they got.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was enough for today.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A believer\u2019s family member had been brought in to Sun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In most cases, the remaining family members would also follow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk, who had been quietly watching the situation, slowly came forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLee Gun-woo. Can you please wait a moment?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I still haven\u2019t achieved my purpose for coming here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everybody\u2019s gaze focused on Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pungbaek and Unsa frowned at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were still a little immature compared to Song Chi-hyun, whose poker face was perfect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Didn\u2019t Kim Cheol-su come to find your little brother? Hwanin said that he couldn\u2019t find him. \u2018Kim Sung-soo\u2019 isn\u2019t here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">According to the information obtained, his little brother Kim Sung-soo wasn\u2019t here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He probably got caught by some other cult.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This person had found the wrong address.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just in case, Song Chi-hyun had thought of some measures about his brother\u2019s whereabouts.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It could be used to fool him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but I didn\u2019t come here to find my little brother.

What does that mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slowly licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could use the fact that his opponent proclaimed himself a god.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Among those gathered here, only five people knew that this church was a scam.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The rest were followed and really believed they were following a god.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the most effective way to use that...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk activated a crime skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Disguise has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Your appearance has changed to Song Chi-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In an instant, Tae-hyuk's face changed into another person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The people who saw it shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaaack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-Whatttttt!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"F-Face, his face changed!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are two Usa\u2019s!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shadow behind the curtain shook like he was also confused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used a crime skill before opening his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You can imitate the voice of Kim Bum-soo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now his voice was dignified.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnsa!

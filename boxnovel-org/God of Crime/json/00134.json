How can you snipe a sniper with a submachine gun?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom scratched his head as Anne made a fuss.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a feat that was possible due to the Shooting Spree skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had no answer for how he did it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I just did it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne\u2019s answer was a low moan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then her butler appeared behind her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was Semon who had gone around the battlefield to see if there was any more danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYoung Lady. The enemy has been wiped out, even the snipers waiting at a distance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were more snipers than the one that Anne saw.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anne looked at the man wearing the opera mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t have any wounds despite dealing with so many people alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rather, he seemed hungry as he watched his work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne nodded a few times, like she had made up her mind, before speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Phantom...I followed the traces of the mask. As I said, I was going to use you to deal with the Yakuza and the Triads. Of course, I am going to pay you for your abilities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, don\u2019t you know me very well despite just meeting today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne laughed at his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have more spies in the police than just art appraisers. I can\u2019t tell you their identities, but I was able to learn about you through them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What, there are more spies in the police? Aigoo. There might even be spies among Mister Park\u2019s group.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I won\u2019t deny it. At any rate, your abilities are more than what Mister said. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have believed it if I didn\u2019t see it with my own eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was because he had just gotten the Shooting Spree skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom smirked.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a fact that his crime skills were still growing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Once today\u2019s incident reaches the ears of the Yakuza or the Triads, they will try to set you on fire. Originally, I intended to promise you the boss seat of the Korean branch. But any other organization can offer that, so I can only offer one more thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne looked at the Phantom with a slightly red face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The person behind the opera mask was definitely a man.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Among the Red Mafia, the Yakuza, and the Triads, she was the only female boss.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That\u2019s why only she could offer this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will give you all of the Red Mafia. Could you please marry me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Wait. Is that a proposal?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other person was the boss of the Ivankov family.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He knew what it meant to marry her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t just the boss of South Korea, but ruling over all of the Red Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fortunately, I am still in my 20s and still haven\u2019t been married. In addition, I think I am fairly beautiful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"20s...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I am 29.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, Tae-hyuk gulped.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although he tried to be as calm as possible, he was several times more nervous than when he was fighting the mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He never thought he would receive a proposal from a woman more than 10 years older than him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I thought she was around the same age as Noona, but she is five years older?!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was beautiful enough to become a model right now.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, she would bring along the Red Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If your answer is a yes, can you take off the mask?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk\u2019s spirit recovered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne proposed to Phantom, not Seo Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to protect his precious ones, this line couldn\u2019t be crossed no matter what.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Phantom seemed to hesitate, Anne moved closer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Perhaps you already have someone in mind? First place is good, but I can be satisfied with being the second.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough. That isn\u2019t the problem. And I'm sorry, but can you back away a little bit?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you not like me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t unpleasant to marry a beauty like Anne.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, problems would arise after accepting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026At any rate, I will accept half of Anne\u2019s offer. First, I will deal with the Yakuza and the Triads. However, I will be doing it by myself, and will not be working with the Red Mafia. Of course, I\u2019ll be happy if you provide weapons.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm... then are you rejecting my proposal? My appearance...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, don\u2019t you think it is too fast to marry someone after only meeting them for one day?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne clapped in pleasure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then it isn\u2019t a refusal? Shall we date first? It is okay if you don\u2019t want to show my your face. It is like a real phantom so I don\u2019t think it is bad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t help sighing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like the number of females around him who gave him headaches had increased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, let's leave this place. The police will soon come swarming.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My car... Oh my. The anti-tank rocket destroyed it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was probably to prevent any escape.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I already stole cash from the mafia. Let\u2019s try Vehicle Theft.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk touched it, the truck started up without the car keys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne clapped in amazement.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about catching a taxi on the honeymoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho, the chief of ABS Broadcasting, opened his eyes as a familiar voice was heard over the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...P-Phantom!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-It has been a while.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Have you recovered from your injuries?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa, ha, ha!

I thought you forgot our promise because you haven\u2019t contacted me in a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho had a deal with Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he wanted to broadcast something then he would release it only through Shin Se-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho was an ambitious person and didn\u2019t miss the opportunity that Phantom gave him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he was promoted from being a PD at ABS.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Since then, he acted like he was Phantom\u2019s good friend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I\u2019ve been away for a while now, so I think I need a big hit.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho\u2019s hands shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just Phantom alone would cause the audience ratings to skyrocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But a big hit?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a word that Phantom never said despite several broadcasts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Thank you. I\u2019m sorry but can you give me a quick hint?

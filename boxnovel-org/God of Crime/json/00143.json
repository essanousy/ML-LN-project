These devices are a little bit like Phantoms. Should I call them Phantomz?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk muttered as he drove a stolen car down a small street.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like he was thinking about something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantomz, Phantomz. Well. Good!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Inside the trunk were special bombs made by the Bomber.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if he could leave other things to the Phantoms, he would install the bomb himself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wanted to reduce the damage to the civilians as much as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the bomb would blow the whole building down.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Many people not involved with the Triads would be affected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI've already started this. If so, I will carry the guilt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt emotional.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, it was strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Since he started to fight the mafia in earnest, he had killed many people, directly or indirectly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, rather than feeling guilty, he felt like it was something he had to do.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was surely a criminal...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I really am a criminal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had always paid attention to his bodily and psychological changes ever since he first received the crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The higher his stats climbed, the more he felt like someone else.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It got worse after Phantom appeared and he started his activities in earnest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is like there is another personality called Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shook his head at the thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had a mountain of work to do.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no time to spend on such introspection.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Biiik!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a message arrived on his phone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He parked the car and checked the message.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was from a Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-I can confirm that this medical centre is involved in organs trafficking.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">There are traces of Chinese mail being sent and received from the computer in the head office.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">The information...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Phantoms were doing a lot of work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyu...how much money have I spent on this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Because there were so many people looking for Phantom, all communication had to be through burner phones.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He also hired a hacker through Moonlight Flower to disperse the call history.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But this wasn\u2019t the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The activity fees for the Phantoms are coming from my pocket... There will be a deficit this month.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the savings he earned in the meantime were shrinking at the speed of light.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Well, if he found the Yamashita gold, then he could get back his money a thousand times over.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no need to look at all of the message.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The place he was entering now was run by the Triads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Things similar to the events of the Doll Play incident would be going on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Plus, it is right next to a port so it is easy to move things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk ordered the Phantoms to retreat from the medical centre.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Except for the operating rooms that were deep underground, it was an ordinary medical facility.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The core personnel such as the doctors and guards were people dispatched from the Triads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But in addition to them, it was necessary to have people who would operate the medical centre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, there were plenty of gaps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018From the second floor upwards, general patients are hospitalized. Then the operating rooms are only underground?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to get rid of all the doctors, but he decided to endure it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t aiming at the destruction of the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk opened the trunk and check the bombs inside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were many types available for use in different situations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is too explosive, so the building might collapse if placed in the wrong area... This should be enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He picked the right type and moved it to the front seat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">On the surface, it looked like an ordinary briefcase.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But if someone tried to forcefully open it or it was the appointed time, the briefcase would explode with a huge force.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">From now on, he had to install it in the basement of the medical centre and escape before it exploded 600 seconds later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened the drawer in the driver\u2019s door and saw the familiar Russian made pistol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He placed it at his waist and triggered Vehicle Theft.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was the sound of the engine starting and the car\u2019s appearance changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The medium sized car became a luxury Mercedes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The camouflage attribute was to escape without being seen by the police, but he mainly used it to hide his identity.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He changed his face into Cho Kang-suk\u2019s and looked like the chauffeur of a luxury car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCounterfeit and Camouflage. The abilities are similar but I like the fact that I don\u2019t need to worry by using both at once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he arrived at the medical centre, the security guard watching the \u00a0back door blocked the car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry, but if you have an appointment at the medical center, then please go via the front way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk rolled down the window and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Didn\u2019t you hear from the director? I have a reservation today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard nodded and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, you are a guest here. I understand. Come in.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and stepped on the pedal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he parked the car in a good location, the guard came hurrying over.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had realized something was strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I'm really sorry. What is the name of the person riding in the back? I asked the director and there are no plans for a surgery today...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, the person in the back?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry. The atmosphere is tense these days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The grim reaper bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hit the guard with the iron pipe that was hidden in the back seat of the car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve smashed a few places so the guards are more careful these days. I have to watch out in the future.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Other guards would notice over time and come flocking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk grabbed the briefcase and headed to the underground area of the medical centre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY-You! What are you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Bullet Time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk invoked Bullet Time as guards with guns gathered around him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His mind accelerated and time seemed to be going dozens of times slower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is surprisingly busy despite there being no booking today. Are they preparing to export the products?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and fired at the guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is made using Forgery but it is almost the same as the real thing. Isn\u2019t this almost an art?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After becoming a Noble, the attribute Trace was added to Forgery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had the ability to copy not only the appearance, but the function of the object.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could make bullets and guns if he had the materials.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Shooting Spree couldn\u2019t be used with his created guns, so he had to be satisfied with just bullets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'How do you like the taste of the bullets that I sweated to make!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the guards all fell, Tae-hyuk leisurely turned off Bullet Time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a scream belatedly entered his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyaaak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cArgggghhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a security camera in the hallway. Other guards would see it and come flocking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to finish all the work before that.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quickly left the medical centre after setting up the \u00a0bomb in a place that was deep underground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But it was strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t see any other security guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t just responsible for protecting this place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They handled all types of dirty things from kidnapping to corpse handling.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, there were at least 10 security guards working at the medical centres.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did they run away because Phantom attacked?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already blown away five of the Triads\u2019 businesses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used the method of blowing up the buildings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk disguised himself as a guard who he had killed already.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he headed into the lobby of the medical centre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cR-Run away! P-Phantom!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A bomb will explode! Take your valuables and run away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What about the hospitalized patients?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck! Our lives are more important, so why should we worry about them? Destroy all of the important documents and flee!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as he looked at the staff members running around.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The man, who seemed to be the director, screamed when he saw Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you just standing there? Pack up and prepare to escape like planned...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, they even practiced running away.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quietly pulled out the opera mask and placed it on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh, it looks like you are busy. I\u2019m sorry. Can I ask questions at the reception desk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP-Phan...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t stutter because your panties are so tight. When will the ship come to the port to pick up the exported goods?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-That...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like it is hard to say. Do you want a little help?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out his gun and aimed it at the director.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll ask once again. When will the smuggling vehicle come?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The director of the medical centre flopped to the ground and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tonight at 8 o\u2019clock... But you can\u2019t meet them unless I contact... S-So please, my life...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out the phone from the director\u2019s pocket and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you! You contact them on this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes. That's right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you. Oh, this is a gift.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a pair of handcuffs and placed one link on the handle of the briefcase he was holding.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The other side was connected to the director\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t try to open this. It might pop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaagh!\" B-Bomb...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I hope you can escape safely.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk walked out of the medical centre.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A bomb was connected to the director\u2019s hand!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The employees screamed and ran away after realizing this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The director shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"C-Cut it off right now! Bring a tool! Even if it is from the operating room, just bring a tool! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What on earth would be cut off?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was very curious but just left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The security guards were too busy trying to deal with the bomb connected to the director that they didn\u2019t chase Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Will he be shocked to know that only documents are inside?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The real bomb was in the basement of the building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were 480 seconds until the bomb would explode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk started the car as he imagined what would happen in the meantime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the medical center, dealing with the transport ship was anticlimactic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The sun rose and broke apart the darkness of the sea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The trees will blow like this on the weekend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the blood on his clothes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He thought he had been careful but some seemed to splattered on his clothes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had shot many bullets in the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I won\u2019t be able to go home like this. I should go to a public bath.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After setting his next destination, he stretched and started the car.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This time he was Phantom, not Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Mafia, Yakuza and the Triads were feeling various emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng\u2019s one was anger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The young boss of the Huaqing Triad, Li Zheng, opened his drawer after hearing the report from his subordinate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He aimed a gun at the subordinate and pulled the trigger.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Taaang - tang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The subordinate instantly collapsed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I thought he was just a clown, but now he is trying to bite.

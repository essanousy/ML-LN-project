If it was a bomb...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a skill that could make a literal walking bomb.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That wasn\u2019t the only scary thing about Illegal Surgery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The results of all surgeries were cancelled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same with amputation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He cut off his toe and triggered Cancel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then an amazing thing happened in front of him, just like watching a movie.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The toe he placed on his desk returned to its original place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only thing was that Cancel could only be used up to 60 minutes after a surgery was done.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Cutting my neck is impossible, but I can cut off my arms or legs.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a bizarre skill that allowed him to freely do things with the human body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'First, I have to take this out.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Due to having something foreign in his body, it felt like he had indigestion.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wanted to get rid of it as soon as possible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to perform an incision, he needed tools such as a scalpel, tweezers, and a clamp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk had the Illegal Surgery skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was possible to cut it with something like a kitchen knife or scissors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018But the problem is that this is a prison, not the outside world. There is no such thing available.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was natural that prisoners would be restricted in handling anything that could be used as a weapon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same with utensils like forks or chopsticks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Chopsticks sharpened using bricks could be used to hurt someone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For the same reason, pages from a notebook or shoelaces from shoes were removed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But could he cut his belly with cutlery?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t an easy task.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had lived here for 10 years, so he knew more about the Blue Dragon\u2019s environment than the guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018First, I need a worker.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Worker referred to a person who took a job in prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Usually they were model prisoners or people who gave bribes to the guards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk knew very well how to get close to one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he checked the wall clock, he saw that it was almost time for dinner.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time he would meet the prisoners here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was also a testing place for every newbie.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Beep!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The signal sounded and the firmly closed door opened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A guard with a rod entered and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Numbers 1047 and 747, it is time for your meal. Gather in the dining room.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded without saying anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey Newbie. Huhu. Did you learn many things from this friend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think I learned very thoroughly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kukuk! Don\u2019t be too scared. This is a place where people live.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unlike the warden, whom he provoked, he had to see the guards every day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, his answers would be as close to what they wanted as possible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was able to look like a moderately frightened newbie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard looked at Yoo Cheol-ho lying on the bed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He poked Yoo Cheol-ho with his rod and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, it is time to eat. Stand up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho was lying quietly without any movements.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was stunned due to being hit by an iron pipe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be hard for him to get up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the guard didn\u2019t know this and screamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This bastard is completely crazy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard tried to pull back the blanket covering Yoo Cheol-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk said quietly,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He told the other guard but I don\u2019t think his body is that good. I think he received a doctor\u2019s diagnosis to sleep for the rest of the day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Say that sooner you brat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard looked at Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s body with an annoyed expression before leaving the cell.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he raised his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the violent incidents in Blue Dragon Prison mainly took place in the dining room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was one of the few times that criminals of all nationalities gathered in the same space.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The rule of don\u2019t touch other animals when eating didn\u2019t apply here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk muttered in a small voice so that the guard walking in front of him couldn\u2019t hear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen let\u2019s try the best way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The eyes of the prisoners eating at the tables shone as they saw the newcomer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, Newbie. Why is your face rotten?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you on the 9 o\u2019clock news. What did you get caught for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid the kid bring a little spoon? If not, he will have to eat by hand. Kilkil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't tease. Don\u2019t you remember how the newcomer last week was so frightened that he urinated himself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aish, that should happen with that face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk ignored the other prisoners teasing him and went to the rationing area.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Sarcastic remarks like these were already tedious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he reacted, then it would just become more severe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he walked forward with a plastic plate, a staff member wearing a hygiene mask gave him rice and various side dishes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although it was the principle of quantitative food distribution, it was normally done at the discretion of the staff worker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was one of the reasons why prisoners wanted to become a worker.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the pancake and soup that he saw.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He watched the other prisoners receive the best food for a minute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the worker passed him a note under the tray.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was so natural that he had obviously done it a lot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t deceive Tae-hyuk\u2019s Gambling skill that was well-versed in many tricks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It seems like this guy is in charge of trading.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke in a small voice so that only the worker could here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want to buy it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a gesture like he was holding a cigarette and paused.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The worker knew what it meant and smiled,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you a newbie entering today? If you can\u2019t suppress yourself now, what will happen in the future?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It isn\u2019t what you think. Please sell it to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, if you have money then I will sell it at any time. However, it is a bit expensive because this is an island.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk remembered that the price of cigarettes was around 20,000 won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he thought about how it could be purchased for 5,000 won at a convenience store, it was an exorbitant price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How much?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"100,000 won for one pack.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That sounds a bit expensive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t buy it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he bargained here, then he could cut the price in half.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk needed to get what he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I will buy 20 packs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow, that is a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The worker gave a small whistle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of the prisoners here were criminals who committed terrible crimes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unlike other prisons, there were few scammers or people who committed economic crimes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But buying 20 packs of cigarettes for 100,000 won?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was probably the first financier in a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The stiff face of the worker relaxed and he gave a friendly smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are a newcomer so I\u2019ll let you know how we handle trades.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is no need as I\u2019ll pay in advance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled an envelope from his sleeve and extended it under the tray.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Criminals in prison were allowed a certain amount of money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was up to two million won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After that, they could receive one million at a time through mail or money transfer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With that money, it was possible to buy things like snacks from the prison kiosk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The amount should be right. Please check it so I can receive the goods as soon as possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhu, understood. It will be ready soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even a prison on a remote island wasn\u2019t completely disconnected from the outside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Many vendors brought in foodstuffs and there were goods sold at kiosks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was probably the best thing for the workers here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The workers would bribe the contractors in order to bring some things into the prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was mainly cigarettes, but sometimes there were psychotropic medicines and cutlery being smuggled in.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, the higher the risk, the more expensive it was.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A newbie would be able to buy cigarettes, but it would take longer for anything else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Of course, they aren\u2019t necessary. I\u2019ll obtain everything with just cigarettes.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and bowed slightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were many people here who couldn\u2019t buy cigarettes because they had no money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he gave them one pack then they would kill for him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The rumour that there was a person who bought a huge amount of cigarettes spread quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at his plate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The menu of the day was miso soup, stir fried anchovies, radish kimchi, and soy sauce beef.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t bad because there was meat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it because Tae-hyuk bought 20 packs of cigarettes?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were two big lumps of meat on his plate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took it and sat in a vacant seat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A hulking person who looked like he did martial arts sat across Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey Newbie. Do you know that you are famous?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hulking person had nothing to say as Tae-hyuk smiled and picked up his spoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess you are still used to homemade food. You should be glad that you were given decent food.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said nothing before grabbing the oversize fist.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the opponent\u2019s face distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"K-Kuong. W-Why is this bastard so strong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Next time, it will be your crotch instead of your hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Kuong, let go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He drew the attention of the other prisoners around.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then someone deliberately poured a plate containing hot soup towards Tae-hyuk, which would literally burn the face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'They aren\u2019t kids. If you want to harass me then you should do it right.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and grabbed the collar of the big guy sitting near him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the big guy sat in Tae-hyuk\u2019s spot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a superhuman move that was only possible due to his agility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA-Ack! Hot, hotttt!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of Tae-hyuk, the big person was the one hit by the miso soup.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guards watching from the entrance of the dining room cried out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The other prisoner explained,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry. My leg caught on the chair and I accidentally poured my soup as I slipped.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Take him to the infirmary right now! Don\u2019t cause any more problems for me today. Che!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The big guy walked out with a face covered in a cold towel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he didn\u2019t forget to curse Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It looks like you have a bit of strength. I\u2019ll let you know who is in charge here. Just wait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t the end of the newcomer\u2019s welcome.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eat some rice and soybeans.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What did you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">10 prisoners surrounded Tae-hyuk like he was a novelty toy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be difficult to expect the help of the guards if anything happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once Tae-hyuk saw the people gathered, he realized it was time for him to lay down his cards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don\u2019t have any money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What is this dog?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you want some cigarettes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The criminals gulped since they knew that Tae-hyuk had bought 20 packs of cigarettes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, they couldn\u2019t bend to a newcomer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as he noticed everyone watching him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no big person among here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At most, they were \u2018Commoners\u2019, those with a sentence that was shorter than three years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was easy to take care of those types of people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you do me a favor then I\u2019ll give you a cigarette.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is simple. I\u2019m too bored in here. You can get a cigarette if you tell me one of the funny stories that happens here. Isn\u2019t it a good deal?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could hear gulps from around him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there were prisoners who still had their pride even with no money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey Newbie. Are you crazy? Do you think we are beggars? If you keep talking like that then I\u2019ll make you eat glass powder.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Glass powder.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When finely grounded and put into food, the stomach would become a mess, and the person would bleed out and die.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it wasn\u2019t easy to find glass in this place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was even more so for those who didn\u2019t even have the money to buy cigarettes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'In my 10 years of staying here, I\u2019ve only seen three people die from powdered glass.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Then how about one story per pack? You don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The eyes of the complaining prisoner changed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt like he would be the first one to come and see Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, the cigarettes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were the beginning of his plan.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

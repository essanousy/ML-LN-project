You want to say something, but there is a gag in your mouth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black shadow came up and pulled out the fabric blocking the guard\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he was able to do what he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c....C-Cough! P-P-Phantom!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Am I so famous that you are shouting with a happy face to see me? This is the taste of appearing on TV. Shouldn\u2019t I take this opportunity to get one CF?\u201d (CF=commercial)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom started to talk nonsense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard looked at Phantom with an perplexed expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard thought back to eight generations of his family tree.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, none of them were associated with the mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Why did you attack me? Didn\u2019t you say that you were aiming for the mafia?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That? Did I say I would only catch the mafia?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Then...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry too much. I don\u2019t plan to do anything to you. If you help me, then you will be able to go home without being hurt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...If I refuse?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The exposed mouth gently curved upwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat will happen? I personally recommend that you don\u2019t listen. Do you still want to hear it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom was holding a knife.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard shook his head and bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cName, Cho Il-jang. 29 years old. You started working at Red Phoenix three months ago. You haven\u2019t received a ticket yet? Due to recent worries, you haven\u2019t been able to sleep properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-How?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His name and age wasn\u2019t so hard to find out, but the last part gave him goose bumps.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t even tell his parents that he was struggling!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t have a long time to explain so I\u2019ll just tell you what I want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Il-jang, a new guard, gulped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Perhaps Phantom wanted inside information about Red Phoenix.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he picked the wrong person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cho Il-jang hadn\u2019t even received a proper pass yet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was literally just a rookie.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know anything about the prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If Phantom wanted information then he should\u2019ve snatched another guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, it is over now. Your cries or moans won\u2019t register properly. Oh, did I say I would give an explanation? This is all you need to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom swung the iron pipe that was hidden behind his body.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Peeok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Il-jang couldn\u2019t even scream as he fell unconscious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Just sleep here for one day. Think of it as a vacation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom pulled off the mask to reveal Cho Il-jang\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same as the face in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">From now on, he would enter Red Phoenix Prison as the new guard Cho Il-jang.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he would grab the hand of the Bomber and escape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom looked at Cho Il-jang who had fallen unconscious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will leave evidence behind so that you can avoid being framed. Well, I\u2019ll also help you out with the boss who has been bothering you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police officers patrolling the area in 24 hours would find the car that was left unattended.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had until then to finish everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis brat must be crazy. Why are you so late?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Il-jang\u2019s supervisor, Kim Byung-gun, wasn\u2019t feeling well this morning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His junior made him wait 10 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I\u2019m really sorry. My car broke down so I hurriedly had to take a taxi... But it seems like I am still a little late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shouldn\u2019t you answer be I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Ah, no.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eh? You\u2019re not even looking in the face of your sunbae when talking. Shouldn\u2019t this brat show respect for your sunbae?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m not ignoring you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then do you dislike looking at my face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was like a Mobius strip; it seemed like it would go on forever.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk held his tongue and looked as sorry as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Then shouldn\u2019t we be getting on the boat? If we don\u2019t hurry, then we will miss the good positions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Byung-gun gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This bastard...move.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The newbie stared fearfully at his angry expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But Kim Byung-gun didn\u2019t see how his mouth slowly curved upwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then pick a suitable place to sit down.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yep!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk naturally sat at the empty entrance side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I don\u2019t want to sit facing the sea breeze. Aish, this rookie is late, so there are no other seats.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Phoenix Prison was far away from land.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, abuse under the pretext of education was widespread.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In particular, the prison warden was a colonel in the army.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Every word from his mouth emphasized discipline.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the prison guards of Red Phoenix were so obedient to the ones above them that they were like soldiers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ship arrived at the prison, and the guards started to disembark.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Byung-gun said with a sneer,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shouldn\u2019t you do the heavy lifting for your sunbae? Look at you. Have you only come here once or twice?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm take it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes brat. Move a little bit faster.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This is enough to cause a neurosis. Isn\u2019t it like a military pairing? No, isn\u2019t it worse? At least there is a time limit until I can be discharged from the army.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The turnover rate here was higher than everywhere else.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A guard who had his cap covering his face was at the prison entrance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was holding a metal detector in his hand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even the guards had to be thoroughly searched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk and Kim Byung-gun, who were at the exit, were the first to get off the ship.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, they were at the front of the line to enter the prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please stand in one line.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The method for a physical search was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First, all metallic objects would be placed in a basket, and then the body would be checked with the detector.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Biiik!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The detector made a loud sound as it moved around Tae-hyuk\u2019s body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The person checking him was perplexed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, what is this? Hey, Newbie. What did you miss?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I'm really sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t just apologize. Ah, the people waiting behind...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, maybe my leather belt...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I told you not to wear a metal one! Ah, I feel like I am being tortured due to this brat. Ack! Why are you taking off your pants here? Just enter. Ah...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes! Sunbae, good work!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Tae-hyuk passed, it was Kim Byung-gun\u2019s turn.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His face was completely rotten.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As soon as he passed through the checkpoint, he spat at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, this fucking brat. What a stupid thing to do. How many times have I told you to be careful?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Byung-gun spat on the floor and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Head for the accommodations and wait there. I will show you hell today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he walked towards the smoking area.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled widely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2014As planned.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk touched his belly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could feel something bulging out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two reasons why Tae-hyuk chose Cho Il-jang as the target of Disguise.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a famous target among the prison guards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if Tae-hyuk behaved strangely, the guards would just blame it on him being a brat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It was the right thing to sit at the entrance.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The entrance of the ship was an area that people avoided because it was very busy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, today there would be a sea breeze and water splashing if anyone sat there.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a place that the prison guards were reluctant to sit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he was able to get off first when arriving at the destination.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That\u2019s why he deliberately arrived just as the ship was going to depart.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Tae-hyuk was able to pass the physical examination very quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The person in charge of the checkpoint today dislikes Cho Il-jang. It will be impossible for him to ignore the long line and do a slow physical search.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he could safely pass through the checkpoint while hiding various things in his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And another reason why...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey! Cho Il-jang! What are you doing! Quickly change clothes to prepare for your shift!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the guards urged him quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the building that the guards were entering.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Bomber was trapped inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This guy is in charge of the bombs.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was changing clothes in the dressing room when he heard a rough voice from somewhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This bastard. Why did I say just now? Didn\u2019t I say to head to the accommodations?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I\u2019m really sorry. I was told it was my shift right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Byung-gun\u2019s temper ignited as he heard the name from Tae-hyuk\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck, that bastard must be crazy. Who is the most senior one?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Kim Byung-gun sunbae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then you should listen to me until the end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will listen to Kim Byung-gun sunbae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know this? Hey, you brat. Come with me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Byung-gun grabbed Tae-hyuk\u2019s collar and pulled him into a warehouse.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard at the entrance of the warehouse saw Kim Byung-gun\u2019s face and pretended not to know anything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After entering the warehouse, Kim Byung-gun hurled Tae-hyuk to the floor and shouted,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cToday you are dead. Eh? Is this bastard smiling?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuhuhuhut...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Very well...a-aaack! W-What is that?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took out a scalpel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was something that he had hidden in his clothes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was only a blade without a holder, so he had to hold it with the tips of his fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Scalpel No.20. It is good for making large incisions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-This crazy bastard, crazy! You brought a razor blade? F-Fuck...it was good that I brought this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Byung-gun said angrily as he pulled out a taser.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he turned on the output to the maximum.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was enough to take down a martial artist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite seeing the taser gun, the bastard still stood with a confident face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Today is your memorial service day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Kim Byung-gun while holding the scalpel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Byung-gun got goosebumps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since when did that person smile laugh like that?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a laugh that seemed to suit the criminals locked up here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am looking forward to your replacement.\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Once it is learned properly, it is helpful in studying for university and is surprisingly fun. Interesting things like linear algebra and ordinary differential equations... In particular, I like the Laplace transform the most.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-Is that so?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho started sweating at the unexpected response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These days, high school girls seemed to be learning university level maths as a hobby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In recent years, there is a tendency to have complex problems that can\u2019t be solved by just one area, such as the matrix, function, derivative and integral. You need to know the exact intentions...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young suddenly bowed with a flustered face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I-I'm sorry. I don\u2019t think that is what you were asking...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. An Eun-young\u2019s interest is studying. I suppose that is how you passed the special admission. That is how you passed right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho nodded, and looked at the girl again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Come to think of it, the place where they were currently walking was S University.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Those who entered through special admissions were considered to be the best of the best in the country.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, the boy she was with had a different atmosphere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How did they become so friendly?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho laughed at the thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was analyzing children.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the so-called occupational disease.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Come to think of it, he was like this before becoming an investigator...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen what is Seo Tae-hyuk interested in these days?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time, Hyun-ho shifted his gaze to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cInterested?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don't have to be so nervous. I'm just asking as a personal interest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His heart was still wary after he accidentally stole a police badge before.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When he first got the crime skills, he stole wigs, handcuffs, underwear and various other things, but he had rarely made mistakes recently.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he had accidentally bumped into Joo Hyun-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Robbery was triggered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was able to steal the other person\u2019s belonging in one try thanks to his 50 points in dexterity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho might have been suspicious if it wasn\u2019t for An Eun-young\u2019s innocent face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like Hyun-ho had relaxed after talking to An Eun-young a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh? Wait a minute... He feels comfortable with Class President...? Is this also the impact of the studying skill?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t been to this degree before, so maybe her skill had also evolved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'By the way, what am I interested in?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk thought for a moment before answering Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t it money? I want to buy a house. In today\u2019s low-growth era, cash is the best. I recently found a good way to make money. I\u2019m thinking of earning money whenever I can.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026These days, children are growing up prematurely. I was busy talking about games all day when I was younger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I love games.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? What games?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Poker, Go, Texas Hold\u2019em, Blackjack... Well, anything that makes money. But rumors spread since I keep winning, so it wasn\u2019t always good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough. In my time, it was just flipping coins on a book...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, it is similar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s expression turned grumpy because he couldn\u2019t get the information he wanted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Were all kids like this these days?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once they arrived at the destination, Joo Hyun-ho started to give an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why is there a museum on school grounds?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It says here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk waved the pamphlet about the school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In order to do community service, this university opened up some facilities for the public. It is a multi-purpose space boasting a unique architectural style and displays modern and contemporary art.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho ignored Tae-hyuk and continued the explanation,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Especially in the winter, it is displaying various works of art from the Baroque period in cooperation with the Russian Hermitage Museum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a strangely familiar name.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk searched through his future memories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t it the museum created by Catherine the Great?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho asked with wide eyes,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh. You surprisingly have a lot of interest in art. Do you plan to pursue this path?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That\u2019s not it. I just found out by chance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I thought you were a chrysalis for a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Obviously, the Hermitage contained a collection of artworks from all over the world, causing it to be called one of the world\u2019s three largest museums.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And if his memories were right, Russia\u2019s [Red Mafia] operated there. </span><span style=\"\">Ironically, the owner of the museum was the world\u2019s foremost forgery specialist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then the works of \u00a0Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Rubinson, Picasso, Van Gogh and Renoir are displayed here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAish, no way. No matter how cooperative, they wouldn\u2019t lend us something so famous. At best, they have Poussin or Rubens pieces.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am sure that the value of the paintings in the Hermitage Museum is close to a trillion won in terms of money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Joo Hyun-ho said, famous paintings were worth billions of won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The reason he came here was to get information on the machine \u2018Machina\u2019 for Kim Soo-bin.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it was possible to raise his discerning eye by viewing artwork.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He never knew when he needed Forgery again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be better if he could make some preparations in advance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDirector! It has been a long time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho greeted the man dozing at the entrance of the museum.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The old man with grey hair acted ignorant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Who is this? If it isn\u2019t Investigator Joo? But the people with you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They are touring the school and wanted to see the museum. It is break time right now, so is it okay for them to look?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course. But Investigator Joo owes me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do, the curator of the art museum, easily nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Students are good at observing. Ah right, if you step over a line then you will hear a beep. Watch out, since the police will come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Should I call a guide?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is okay. Thank you for letting us in during the break time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason why Kim Hyun-do could look relaxed despite the museum full of expensive paintings was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The inside of the museum was so strictly managed that not even one ant could hide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you know that most paintings displayed in museums are forgeries?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cR-Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s eyes widened since this was the first time she heard about it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then people were paying to look at fakes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho said with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Vincent van Gogh's self-portrait and Renoirs\u2019 Bal du moulin de la Galette are worth billions of won, and are too valuable to be displayed in museums. So, as an alternative, replicas were made of ceramic plates. They stay well in light and are strong against fire. The guests can also touch them directly. They can also take a commemorative photo in front of it. A lot of people prefer this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the first time I\u2019ve heard of this!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The funny thing is that a replica created properly can be priced at hundreds of million of won. In some cases, a replica of the replica is on the market. It is like the Matryoshka dolls. Isn\u2019t it funny?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young smiled without making a sound.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she noticed Tae-hyuk staring silently at a painting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Tae-hyuk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the paintings displayed here were authentic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were surrounded by a barrier to prevent access.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If someone stepped inside then the warning system installed would go off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk looked at the painting with a serious expression and said in a quiet voice,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026It is a wonderful painting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Your eyes are surprisingly good. That is Rubens\u2019 \u2018The Descent of the Cross\u2019.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young spoke with an impressed face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Then this is the painting that the protagonists from a Dog of Flanders wanted to see last...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCorrect. Ruben\u2019s work is displayed directly in the cathedral.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young looked at the displayed Rubens painting with shining eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a painter who painted many grandiose and brilliant mythical and religious paintings throughout Europe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anyone would think of him when thinking of a Baroque master painter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now she could see his paintings close up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is this authentic?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. So you shouldn't touch it. The huge security bell here will ring.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Famous works are being displayed. Isn\u2019t it surprisingly not well know? I think the attendance would be big if it was advertised as the painting from a Dog of Flanders.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Right? I also think it is a bit strange. Well, it seems like the director doesn\u2019t like doing such a thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see. Thank you for the explanation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I guess I did a good job. There is a school club where I worked as the manager. Would you like to go? It is a mystery club. There are things like murder props, and we also have mystery novels so you will have fun there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I also like mystery novels! What will Tae-hyuk do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm... I want to look at the paintings a bit more. I will follow you in five minutes, so go ahead and play.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then don\u2019t come too late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho and Eun-young were delighted to learn that they were both huge mystery novel fans.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They left the museum while asking about each other\u2019s favourite works.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes flashed as he stayed behind and looked at the Rubens painting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t mistaken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a fake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a fake product in a museum that only displayed genuine items.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was made so well that his crime skills reacted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have seen a forgery of incredible perfection.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The level of your discerning eye has risen.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The autograph of the artist is hidden behind it.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sometimes forgeries were brought in if it was too risky to display the original.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the expenses of the exhibition was too heavy to display a fake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'There is something here.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, it was currently the museum\u2019s break time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was only a minimum of staff in the hall, with the rest eating or resting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To avoid any doubts, Tae-hyuk first left the museum and hid behind the building and took out the opera mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He also didn\u2019t forget to use Disguise in case his mask was peeled off.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After changing into clothes that looked like a tuxedo, the Phantom disguise was completed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Was his name Kim Hyun-do?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk boldly entered the museum thought the front door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The yawning Kim Hyun-do said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry but we are currently on break. Please return 30 minutes later... A-Ack! Ah...I'm really sorry. Isn\u2019t this in fashion these days?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the advent of Phantom on the TV, it was the fashion to walk around with opera masks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do often saw people wearing opera masks so he was only a little surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am the original product.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as he slowly took off his mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The face behind it was Kim Hyun-do\u2019s.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAaaaack G-Ghost, ghost...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do shrieked and fell off his chair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he stuttered out,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-H-Here, d-did you come here to blow it up?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shrugged and replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t always bomb people. I just wanted to have a private talk with Director. Don\u2019t worry. It will end very soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The mouth below the mask slowly curved upwards.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

I can really make a lot of money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt depends on you. But if you work hard, you can make a few thousand each time. Furthermore, it is a legitimate business...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Blue Dragon Prison, there were a huge number of criminals around.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Choi Sung-yeol was trying to gather them for his business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In fact, the whole thing is a scam.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed because he knew what Choi Sung-yeol wanted to do.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As the prisoner talking to Choi Sung-yeol left, Tae-hyuk naturally sat down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm?

It seems like you were quite lucky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choi Sung-yeol gazed at the supposedly supreme card shark with narrowed eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t been able to do any tricks so far.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But what was this confidence?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, the full-fledged betting began.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The pushovers both forfeited with one pair and two pairs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the game became a 1:1 match between Choi Sung-yeol and Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t it boring if we just play for fun?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. What about a pack of cigarettes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choi Sung-yeol completed a full house of Queens. It was quite hard to get in a five card draw.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With two bets, the pot increased to a pack of cigarettes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Show your cards. I have a Queens full house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. It was good that you exchanged your cards. But I\u2019m sorry, the cigarettes are mine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slowly revealed his cards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a 10, a Jack, a Queen, a King, and an Ace.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were all spades.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Royal straight flush?!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the strongest hand with a probability of 1/649,740.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The fact that he hadn\u2019t changed any cards meant that it was already completed when he received the cards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choi Sung-yeol\u2019s hands trembled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How was this possible?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The cigarettes are appreciated.

Let\u2019s open it because I am curious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh...yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choi Sung-yeol carefully revealed Tae-hyuk\u2019s cards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"O-Oh my god...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was another royal straight flush.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I hope this is enough to believe that I am a superior card shark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO-Of course. But how on earth...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but it is a trade secret.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choi Sung-yeol sighed with a red face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was hard to believe even after seeing it with his own eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was a superior card shark that was within the top 0.1%.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuu... At any rate, it is a great technique.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t figure out what trick the opponent used, no matter how he squeezed his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Choi Sung-yeol looked at the card shark with respect in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I just need some work. If you are already full then it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no. A person like you is always welcome.

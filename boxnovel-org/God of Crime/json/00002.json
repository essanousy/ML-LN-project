It was the same as fox hunting, if a fox\u2019s cave was lit on fire, then it would fall prey to the hunters waiting outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">If there was a definite hideout, it was better to keep hiding there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'The place where Yoo Cheol-ho is located is 20 bus stops away.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">A serial killer that had the whole nation in an uproar was in such close proximity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk pulled out the wallet from his pocket and checked its contents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Um. It have about 3,000 won in total.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was said that a man should always have 3,000 won on him. He had no idea that would be true.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was only enough for a round-trip bus fare. Furthermore, if he used up all of it then he would have to starve for lunch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018If I had known that then I would have eaten more for breakfast.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He hadn\u2019t even eaten half a bowl of stew due to thinking about Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was like in the military or the prison. It was an unspoken law that those who left food behind would soon regret it. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'Damn. This is just like a real criminal.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was within walking distance but Tae-hyuk decided to take the bus. It was noticeable if a student wearing a uniform was walking the streets during class time. Due to his delinquent looks, he was often picked up by police officers on patrol and lectured.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Every time Ha-ran was contacted, he would have to see her in tears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Indeed, I should take the bus.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">What did he want to do when he met Yoo Cheol-ho?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s mind became complicated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">What if Yoo Cheol-ho was really at the location where he was going now? Then it would be proof that what he thought was a dream actually wasn\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Then...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Would he really go to jail in five years after being falsely accused?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">As a result those events, his older sister Seo Ha-ran and younger brother Seo Tae-min would be ruined.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Fuck. It is like hearing that I have a terminal illness...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">However, it was better to know and be prepared than to be ignorant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk got on the bus towards his destination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He pulled his baseball cap deep over his face, just in case he saw a face that he knew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Um. It is past the time to go to work so there aren\u2019t many people on the bus.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There was only an old lady and a man with a baseball cap positioned like Tae-hyuk\u2019s.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He had bumped into the man when he got on the bus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">But there was something suspicious about him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'It is so empty in here, so why is he sitting next to someone?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk, who had sat in an empty seat, turned and closely observed the two of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>Brr!</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There was a vibration from between his crotch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk looked around with surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'Fuck... If anyone saw that then they would think I was a pervert.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There was something in the pocket of his school uniform that was vibrating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'Uh, is it a mirror? Why is it in the pocket of my uniform?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was the mirror that he used to look at himself this morning. The demon carved on the outside still looked really ominous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk squinted and looked at the mirror..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">His face was reflected but there were still some strange letters written.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">[Crime Skill: Robbery has been acquired.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-You can acquire one random item when bumping against another person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-The probability of success depends on your dexterity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The letters came and then disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk's mouth trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018What is this...?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">At the same time, new letters emerged above his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">[Seo Tae-hyuk]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Title: God of Crime</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Rating: Commoner (Lacking conditions for upgrade)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Skills Possessed: Robbery (Lv 1)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'Did I learn the Robbery skill just now? Why? WHY?!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk realized that the demon mirror wasn\u2019t an ordinary item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">In the first place, he had clearly left this on Tae-min\u2019s desk, yet it somehow ended up in his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He thought that the demon looked like a true dick. A really dick-like thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Anyway, if the words on the demon mirror were true, then he had just learnt a crime skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk looked around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It wasn\u2019t difficult to find the reason.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018If there is a result, then there needs to be a cause.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">After Tae-hyuk\u2019s arrival on the bus, the old lady started to snore as she dozed off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The man sitting next to her then revealed his true colours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Pickpocket!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The man used careful hand techniques to prevent the old lady from waking up. He easily opened the locked handbag using a razor, and all he took out was a wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">If Tae-hyuk hadn\u2019t known that something was going to happen beforehand, then he would have thought the man\u2019s body had moved because the bus was shaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">That\u2019s how perfect the man\u2019s skill was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk wouldn\u2019t have noticed if he hadn\u2019t seen the word \u2018robbery\u2019 on the demon mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'What on earth is this mirror?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk chewed on his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Was it truly a mirror that had a demon dwelling inside it?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The pickpocket tried to get off the bus before Tae-hyuk could calm his confused mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>Duk!</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The pickpocket was rushing like he could feel a gaze on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Then Tae-hyeok's body was lightly bumped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Once again, the demon mirror vibrated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>Brr!</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk made a crazy expression and looked at the mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-You have succeeded in stealing the opponent\u2019s belongings! \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The pickpocket had already escaped the bus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Robbery?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">According to the message in the mirror, he had stolen something from the pickpocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018I should check to see what I stole first.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk searched through his pockets before a long wallet that he hadn\u2019t seen before emerged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'Oh my god!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was as he had thought. The pickpocket had stolen the old lady\u2019s wallet then it was stolen again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">In this situation, the one accused of being the criminal would be him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk hurriedly got off the bus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The the old lady\u2019s scream rang through the bus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cOmo! My wallet is gone!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There was no time. Tae-hyuk ran through the alleys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Crazy...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">A pickpocket stole the old lady's wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">And the pickpocket had the wallet stolen by Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">If Tae-hyuk had been a little late getting off the bus then he would have been arrested by the police officer on duty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018What? God of Crime? Trying to make a good person a criminal!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk angrily threw the demon mirror with all his strength towards the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>Jjeok!</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Wah...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Rather than the fragile mirror breaking, the cement ground was the one that cracked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">This time he stepped on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cUaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It hurt like he had kicked a stone pillar. Tae-hyuk spat out curses and threw the demon mirror into a trash bin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He then turned his body and left this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">* \u00a0 \u00a0 * \u00a0 \u00a0 *</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk was worried about what to do with the old lady\u2019s wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It seemed like he was becoming a criminal without his consent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Just like those guys.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">In his dream, Tae-hyuk had been imprisoned for 10 years. Unless he was in solitary confinement, it was impossible not to meet other criminals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There were even those criminals convicted of atrocities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Yoo Cheol-ho was one of those people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">They were monsters in a human guise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Now, he wasn\u2019t too sure that it was a dream. At any rate, he was a falsely accused death row inmate in his dream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">For 10 years, he had struggled to escape from that place. It had been a really painful, long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Would it have been easier if he knew that he had been postponing death for 10 years?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">So if he became a criminal here, it would be like denying his very existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018I need to find its owner\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">But how?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He could go to the police station and give them the wallet. They would thank him for surrendering, and then they would handcuff him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Well. It is best to just put it in the mailbox.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Inside the wallet were 20 checkbooks worth 100,000 won each and ten 50,000 won bills. The total was 2.5 million won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There was also identification. He would definitely put it in the mailbox that belonged to the owner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018She is richer than I thought.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">His heart shook at the tidy sum. It was enough to buy some new clothes for his troubled sister.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018...Seo Tae-hyuk. What are you thinking? I don\u2019t think that Noona would like that.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk pulled a 50,000 won bill from the wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">This was lost property, so to speak. If he returned it to the owner, then 10% was his.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Then he put the wallet in the mailbox.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'I can buy\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline\">samgyeopsal</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0and grill it with Noona.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He thought as he placed the money in his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He froze in shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Crazy...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was the demon mirror that he had obviously tossed in the bin.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

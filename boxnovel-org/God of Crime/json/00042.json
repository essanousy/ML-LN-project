If she didn\u2019t pull her clothes down with her hand, then her butt would be seen.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> However, her upper body was more serious.\u00a0</span>Her chest was big enough to cause every man to take a second look. Thus, the buttons on the jacket could only be done up partway.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHah...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> A moan escaped from Jung Yuri\u2019s pale white lips.\u00a0</span>She hugged herself to warm up her body even a little bit.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> She looked so pathetic that Tae-hyuk felt strangely dizzy for a moment.\u00a0</span>Tae-hyuk stretched his hand out to Yuri and said.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not trying to touch your chest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cUh... yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk exercised tremendous self-control as he turned his gaze away from the chest that was visible through the leather jacket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> When he touched Yuri\u2019s forehead, he could feel that it was as cold as ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHaang!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Yuri shrieked as Tae-hyuk\u2019s hand touched her forehead; however, she didn\u2019t resist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'Cold... Still, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any risk to her life. Once her body warms up...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Severe hypothermia was a risk.\u00a0</span>The muscles of her body would be stiff and she would feel extreme fatigue.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Wipe the water from your body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Haang... Yes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk looked around, but he couldn\u2019t find anything resembling a towel.\u00a0</span>In the end, he had to take off his t-shirt so that Yuri could have something to wipe her body down with.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHum hum. I do laundry everyday so it shouldn\u2019t smell of sweat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... No. It seems good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk looked at Yuri's complexion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> A red glow was starting to appear on the previously white face.\u00a0</span>Her body temperature was rising, but it was still dangerous.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cCan you get on my back? If we go to a concession stand, then there will be a heater. You can warm up there. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Yuri nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Her lips were blue and her whole body was shaking.\u00a0</span>Occasional moans couldn\u2019t help emerging from her mouth. The first thing to do was to take her to a safe place, since her legs didn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk knelt down in a good posture.\u00a0</span>Yuri couldn\u2019t support her body properly and fell on his back. Tae-hyuk e felt a heavy weight...</p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Mulkeong!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Heok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was something as soft as a marshmallow touching Tae-hyuk\u2019s back.\u00a0</span>Yuri relaxed her grip on the leather jacket and clung onto Tae-hyuk. In the end, her breasts were touching Tae-hyuk\u2019s back.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'C-Cold... But very soft... N-no! Wake up Seo Tae-hyuk!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Haaang...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk\u2019s back was very warm, so a pleasant moan emerged from Yuri\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span>She was naked on the back of a man who she didn\u2019t know well. She would\u2019ve been terribly embarrassed if she was in her normal mental state.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> However, was it due to the sense of relief from her survival?\u00a0</span>Jung Yuri couldn\u2019t feel any shame. It was comfortable, as if she was on her father\u2019s back.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk was more embarrassed about being hugged from behind than Jung Yuri was embarrassed form being on his back.\u00a0</span>Her legs didn\u2019t move, so he carefully held her thighs with both hands. The soft texture was conveyed directly. Strangely, she smelled good.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018I-I don\u2019t know who is doing a service for whom!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jung Yuri was 170 cm tall, a height that was similar to Tae-hyuk\u2019s.\u00a0</span>It was harder than he thought to lift up Yuri.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'But what if I use the Violence skill? I can do it with my stamina!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk used the Violence skill.\u00a0</span>Both hands were holding Jung Yuri\u2019s thighs, so he had to put the iron pipe in his mouth.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk and Yuri headed to a concession stand.\u00a0</span>He had to stop once in awhile due to the sound of Yuri\u2019s breathing getting too close. Then he had to calm something excited down.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am a man. A man who is made for this job!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho hummed as he walked around the performance venue.\u00a0</span>Kang-suk was looking at the aquarium, while Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s task was to check this place. There was no one on the stage and in the audience seats.\u00a0The only place left was the performer\u2019s waiting room.\u00a0There was a bathtub where animals such as seals and penguins could be washed. If he were the Hippo, then he would commit the crime there.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho was holding a handgun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I just picked up a gas gun. It isn\u2019t real like Sunbae\u2019s. Still, isn\u2019t it better than nothing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho majored in criminology and psychology and became a profiler. However, in order to serve as an investigator, he completed two years of basic education at the police academy.\u00a0</span>He knew the perfect method to hold a gun. Furthermore, unlike his frail appearance, he was a master of judo.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cBang bang! Haha! Isn\u2019t this good?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho aimed towards an imaginary criminal.\u00a0</span>He didn\u2019t seem like a genius investigator at this moment.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho released his finger from the trigger and spun the gas gun around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"That\u2019s enough playing. Then let\u2019s start searching in earnest!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He walked towards the place where the Hippo was hiding with a serious expression.\u00a0</span>As he arrived at the back of the performance venue, a door with STAFF ONLY appeared.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Here.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho looked at the door with a serious expression and kicked it open with his foot.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Bam!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The closed door opened with a loud sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hands up! If you move then I will shoot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho knelt down and aimed the gun forward. Then he looked around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Sheesh. There is no one here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The room only contained a large fish tank, rope and buckets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cUh, wait a minute.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho put the gun away and approached.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHere... Someone was clearly just here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There wasn\u2019t anyone here. However, the evidence still remained.\u00a0</span>The fish tank was half filled with water. He checked it by hand and the water was ice cold.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cLet\u2019s think like Archimedes. The tank is half full. This means there was something in the water. Roughly...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho calculated the volume of the tank and the amount that it was empty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c.... It sound be one person who weighs around 50 kg.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was a lot of water on the floor.\u00a0</span>It meant that someone had pulled out another person from the fish tank.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho looked around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There were rope and several buckets filled with liquid.\u00a0</span>Hyun-ho checked the contents of the bucket.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Milk, soy sauce and cooking oil...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was only a one metre long tube near the fish tank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I should be glad since my reasoning is correct. It is amazing, even if the culprit is gone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho touched the surface of the fish tank. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Water was splattered from someone leaving the fish tank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"This means the person was in here until recently.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The surface of the fish tank was smooth.\u00a0</span>Even if the water splashed, it would flow down to the ground after 10 minutes.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho swallowed his saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... This is the Hippo\u2019s workshop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> And the Hippo was gone.\u00a0</span>His victim was inside the fish tank.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHas he killed her already?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It couldn\u2019t be. The liquids used for the murder were still inside the buckets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> This meant...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-hos face turned white.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... Sunbae is in danger!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk stood in the dark aquarium.\u00a0</span>Whether it was from tiredness due to the continuous overtime, Kang-suk\u2019s face was stiff, as if he were a wax doll.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then someone approached him.\u00a0</span>Cho Kang-suk felt it and turned around quickly.\u00a0It was someone that Cho Kang-suk knew.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAh. Kim Jong-wook? Have you come to catch the hippo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kim Jong-wook was a police officer working in the jurisdiction.\u00a0</span>Whenever a murder took place in the area, he was a cop who would take turns guarding the crime scene. Kim Jong-wook was responsible for the bathroom where the hippo committed his second murder. The location wasn\u2019t far from here. It seemed he rushed here after hearing the request for reinforcements.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jong-wook yelled with a pleasantly surprised face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAh Detective Cho Kang-suk! What\u2019s going on here? The hippo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk replied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I received a tip that the hippo was here so I came to check. It\u2019s been a bust so far, as there\u2019s nobody here. Ah, I need to catch the hippo as quickly as possible. This whole day seems to be all a waste.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk\u2019s face was covered with a dark shadow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHaha, indeed. I ran here after suddenly receiving an order.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Kim Jong-wook should take a break.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHaha! Isn\u2019t this our job?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk stared at Kim Jong-wook with a blank expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He was dressed in civilian clothes.\u00a0</span>He had one hand in his pocket, and his pants were all wet.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Was it raining outside? Your clothes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jong-wook gave a deep sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAigoo. It just suddenly rained. Did you bring an umbrella?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I didn't bring one. When I leave then I\u2019ll just use a newspaper. I\u2019d like to call a taxi, but I can\u2019t. You should know. The salary of a detective is poor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cIt seems so. You must have suffered.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Anyway, I think that the tip is likely to be a joke. Then, I will look around the performance venue. Do you want to come?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jong-wook nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThat seems best. By the way, are you alone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk paused for a moment before asking in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Why do you ask?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jong-wook slowly approached Kang-suk and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"That is...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The two of them were now close enough to touch if he stretched out his hand.\u00a0</span>Jong-wook\u2019s mouth twisted oddly.\u00a0There was a sharp knife in his hand.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I need to know how many people I have to kill!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jong-wook stepped forward and plunged the knife into Kang-suk\u2019s chest.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Puok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cKeok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk screamed. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The attack was so unexpected that there was no resistance at all.\u00a0</span>He instantly fell down.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jong-wook giggled like he was enjoying the scene and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cOhuhu... I wonder how you knew I was here. Will you listen to me before dying? Huh? Detective Cho Kang-suk. Please say something. Uhahahaha! That's correct. I am the Hippo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jong-wook... No, the hippo grinned brutally as he twisted the knife stuck in Kang-suk\u2019s chest.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

We can talk about the details later, but I think we should run away first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right! Then what good plan do you have?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out the paper that he had used to make the counterfeit documents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will apply what I have done before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As his hand passed over the sheet, something appeared on the blank white paper.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This time it was a map, rather than some documents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I wrote it in advance with Forgery and then implemented it with Counterfeit. Then, like magic, a map containing the escape route is created.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho looked at the map and exclaimed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a detailed plan to escape the police once arriving at the port.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But Phantom, can\u2019t you easily escape by changing your appearance? Why this thing...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am fine alone, but both of you will need to disguise yourselves if you want to escape with me. Two prisoners have escaped from prison, but the jailbreak isn\u2019t over until you completely get away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Thinking up to here...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho looked at Tae-hyuk with an impressed expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had forced Phantom to bring him along, yet Phantom was paying such careful attention to help him escape.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk beckoned and urged the two people to hurry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"As time passes, the encirclement is narrowing. We have to hurry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The criminals who escaped from Red Phoenix moved along the route on Tae-hyuk\u2019s map.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The first destination was a nearby container box.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">These boxes could be rented for a week at a cost of 100,000 won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were used for various purposes, such as temporary warehouses or housing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Dress appropriately as you like.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead, there were various clothing like a department store.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Both prisoners were still in their prison uniforms, while Tae-hyuk was dressed as a prison guard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Their clothing was too prominent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh? There is a mirror. Is this to look at the disguises?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think a wig and some glasses are good for changing my appearance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho, who wore a clean suit and had nearly combed hair, looked like a white-collar office worker.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung wore cargo pants, a plain shirt, and used some disguise items.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wore a tuxedo used by chauffeurs of luxury cars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now it is time to go to the safe house in a car that is parked nearby.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you prepare the car in advance? Can\u2019t you use your abilities to steal one?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you escape in a stolen vehicle, then you are more likely to be caught by the police. A perfectly washed car will allow you to escape without detection.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then what about the safe house?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a shelter. Most people who escape don\u2019t have a place to stay, so they lurk around their homes or friends\u2019 places, causing them to be caught. If you stay in this shelter, then you won\u2019t be caught for your whole lifetime.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The safe house depicted was a house in the quiet countryside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was good compared to the church that he was caught in.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, he could avoid the police by changing his appearance and stealing a vehicle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But Yoo Cheol-ho didn\u2019t want to show all the skills that he had.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Then let\u2019s finish this play.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shelter... You also prepared for what would happen after escaping the prison.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI made a promise that I would help you break out of prison.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho chuckled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to fight the mafia, Kim Tae-sung\u2019s bombs were needed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The police weren\u2019t stupid.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If Kim Tae-sung accidentally got caught again, then it wouldn\u2019t be easy for him to escape next time.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'He is something precious that I should deal with very carefully. Except for him, of course.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"And don\u2019t forget this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as he watched Yoo Cheol-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like he was looking at an old relationship.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, Yoo Cheol-ho was the start of everything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Catching Yoo Cheol-ho had started a lot of things, but now it was farewell.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As Yoo Cheol-ho looked in the mirror, Tae-hyuk handcuffed his hand to a pole nearby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP-Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is far enough, Yoo Cheol-ho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-What are you doing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The promise was clearly to help you escape from prison. I have now honored my promise, it and now it is time to separate. We shouldn\u2019t travel together.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But a true jailbreak is when the person gets away...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right; however, unlike the Bomber, you are now useless. I\u2019m not the type of person to carry around loose baggage. Then I will give you the last mission: be captured by the police. We will use that time to get away safely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">T-Tricked!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had trusted the other person completely!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho cried out,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom...! If you leave me like this then I will tell the police the location of the safe house! Then you will never be saf...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah? That?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A wicked smile appeared on Tae-hyuk\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He touched the map with one hand and something new appeared on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you really think that I would show you the real thing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuooock!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho shouted with a red face as he realized.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"P-Phantom! This isn\u2019t over! How dare you betray me? I will twist your neck no matter what! Aha, ahahaha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? But I am sorry. Once you go back to prison, it won\u2019t be so easy to escape this time. You will receive very good treatment inside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and pulled a tape recorder out of Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s suit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-This...obviously the voice of the warden is recorded...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is a lie. I wonder what is really recorded?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho got goosebumps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had carried it around all this time, but hadn\u2019t thought much of it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But there was something other than the warden\u2019s voice recorded on it?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The button was clicked and Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s voice flowed out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">The warden ordered me to watch Kim Tae-sung.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">He promised to give me some conveniences in the prison in return.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Haha!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Of course I am a mole.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">But who cares about my petty dealings with the warden, ohuhu!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...N-No! T-That!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho, who knew very well how spies were treated in prison, screamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I think it is time to go home. Please get along well with your friends.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk placed it back in Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s pocket and buttoned it up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he couldn\u2019t get rid of the tape recorder as he was struggled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As both hands were tied to the pole, he had to listen to his voice coming from the tape recorder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bye bye Yoo Cheol-ho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kwang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door of the warehouse closed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The police would come here soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho bit his lip and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. If I knew this would happen, then I would\u2019ve eaten the grilled ribs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After leaving the warehouse, they walked a few minutes and arrived at the prepared car.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a used car purchased through Big Mama, but Tae-hyuk deliberately didn\u2019t bring the car keys.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As he placed his hand on the front door and activated the skill, the door opened and the car turned on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a reason to use the Vehicle Theft skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This way, he could apply the attributes that changed the appearance and boosted the speed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It feels strange because I am stealing something I own. Before I know it, my right and left hands might automatically steal...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gestured and Kim Tae-sung got on the back seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn't think you would abandon him like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is an uninvited guest. Plus, didn\u2019t I say that I would help him escape from prison? I made sure to keep my promise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want you to keep your promise to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung escaped in order to get revenge on the group that killed his family.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He promised to make bombs in return for Phantom\u2019s help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he drove along a quiet country road, breaking news appeared on the radio.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-...One of the prisoners who escaped from Red Phoenix Prison has been arrested by the police.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">The police are using all of their efforts to arrest the remaining one...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He was captured safely. Once he returns, he will be greeted enthusiastically by his friends as well as the warden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After one hour, the downtown area of the city appeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s hideaway was a small officetel \u00a0located between other buildings. (Officetel=Google Link)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung entered the room and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t this a place with many people? I thought the hideout would be in a quiet rural village.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is actually more dangerous in the countryside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The countryside has an open atmosphere. The individuals there know everything about each other. In that respect, an officetel or an apartment is safer. Even if a person dies next time, they can be left there for several months.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha, I agree. Then I will be working here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. You will make the bombs here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The room was perfectly prepared for it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even the most important ventilation system is set up. Often people only think about the materials and tools.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It will be inconvenient if someone wonders about the smell. There is no need to create too much. One a day is enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung\u2019s eyes flashed as he checked the equipment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tell me if there is something missing and I will prepare it for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let me ask you one thing: What are you going to do with my bombs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung had killed innocent people in the past, but that was for the sake of revenge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If Phantom\u2019s purpose was to kill civilians...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom was wearing an opera mask made of plaster over his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung felt like the mask smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Right now, China\u2019s, Russia\u2019s, and Japan\u2019s mafias are all gathering in South Korea. This place will soon be their battleground, and I want to stop that. Of course, I don\u2019t want to be a hero of justice. One of them has what I want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y-You will deal with all of them by yourself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, I won\u2019t be able to do it alone. That is why I am gathering criminals.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung noticed that he was one of them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took off his shoes and entered the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like a university laboratory filled with various tools.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But this wasn\u2019t the end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were home appliances and multimedia equipment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If there was enough food, someone would be able to stay here for several months.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk headed towards the Bomber\u2019s workshop.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was something made of plaster on the table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung followed behind Tae-hyuk and muttered as he saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOpera mask...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same as the mask that was on Phantom\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom picked it up and approached the Bomber.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he placed it on the Bomber\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom opened his firmly closed mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2015From now on, you are Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

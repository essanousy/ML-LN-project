They only focused on that, and he was treated like a sociopath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, Tae-hyuk was in prison. </span><span style=\"\">The media were unable to meet him and turned the arrow towards his family.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-What type of family could raise a son that would brutally kill someone that way?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-His parents passed away, and was raised by his older sister. Doesn\u2019t she feel even a little responsible for this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-I heard that he was violent since he was a child. Did she happen to be hit by him or something?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A ruthless news coverage sprang up against Seo Tae-min and Seo Ha-ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It became known to the public that both of them were Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s family members.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Why did Seo Ha-ran and Seo Tae-min receive such treatment?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The \u2018thing\u2019 he met before receiving the death penalty said that Seo Ha-ran was fired from her job.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, would that really have been the end of it? </span><span style=\"\">What else had happened?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt horrible just imagining it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took deep breaths to calm himself down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t happened yet, and he had to make sure it didn\u2019t happen in the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First of all, he needed information on Park Jung-hwan. In order to do that, Big Mama's cooperation was needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk opened the door to Big Mama\u2019s pawn shop and went inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOmo, Tae-hyuk came. Hung ~ those clothes fit you well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama laughed and praised Tae-hyuk\u2019s new outfit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hello. I came to receive the rest of the payment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, I have prepared it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama smiled and pulled a box of vitamin drinks out of her safe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I feel like it\u2019s a crime to give you money in this box. It used to be that money was given an apple box, but this is what everyone is doing these days. One box contains 50 million won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, then I\u2019ll check it right away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to open the box to check the amount.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama was a criminal who dealt with information and stolen goods. </span><span style=\"\">If she deceived someone regarding money then it would be a blow to her credibility. However, it would be good to make sure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The box contained 10 bottles of vitamin drinks. It was exactly as written on the outside of the box.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk cried out angrily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is supposed to be Shin Saimdang! Shin Saimdang! Don\u2019t be jealous just because she looks younger than you!\u201d\u00a0(Shin Saimdang: the first woman to appear on a Korean banknote, the 50,000 won note)\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhoho! It\u2019s a joke, a gift. This is the real one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama pulled out two different boxes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This time, it really did contain a lot of money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk carefully checked if the amount was correct. There were 20 bundles of 100 sheets, making an \u00a0exact 100 million.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now it was time to cut to the chase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"By the way, is Big Mama in the information business?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow did you know? In fact, it is a new business that I started. By the way... the name Big Mama doesn\u2019t hold the dignity I\u2019m looking for. In the future, I might change it to something else.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... I can\u2019t think of you as anything but Big Mama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha. Anyway, what did you want to know? The three sizes of your favourite girl?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although he was a bit curious, he wouldn\u2019t spend money just to know such a thing. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want to find out everything about Park Jung-hwan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I figured you would ask that. By the way, my information is a bit expensive, so will it be okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gazed at the box in front of him without saying anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Pay a deposit of one million first. The investigation period is 10 days, and if I\u2019m successful then pay me another two million.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sorry, I didn\u2019t quite hear that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This time it isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cE-Expensive!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was more than three times the price of other pieces of information.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was probably trying to take as much as she could because he currently had a lot of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama said with a soft smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Politicians on the front lines have a rating above A grade. Furthermore, he is currently in retirement. This is a reasonable price.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuheom! Yes, I understand. Instead, please make sure that the information is accurate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will zoom in so close that I will know if he holds on to his buddy with his left hand or right hand when he pees.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t want to know anything like that, he didn\u2019t want to miss any little clues.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then we have a deal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you for using my services.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama called out to Tae-hyuk as he was leaving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, right. Tell me if you ever want to come back to work. You are always welcome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How much will you pay me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm, 6,500 won an hour?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed bitterly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a little better than the minimum wage, but there were many things that he wanted to learn from her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Anyway, I have no choice but to wait.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would use Big Mama\u2019s power as much as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For Tae-hyuk, who only had four skills, this was the best way.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk handed his report card to Ha-ran with a serious expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was second in the class, and seventh in the school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran asked after seeing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is this Tae-min\u2019s?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, it's mine.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran started to scrutinize his report card with a confused expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She screamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s name was definitely written on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOmo! Omo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran reflexively stroked Tae-hyuk\u2019s head and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat did Noona say? I knew you could do it! Really well done!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s amazement didn\u2019t end there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"By the way, Noona. I have one thing to ask so please answer with the truth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Noona isn\u2019t stupid. In fact, aren\u2019t you good at studying? It is enough to go to the university that you wanted.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I saw the acceptance letter that Noona hid during the voice phishing case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-That, I was just lucky...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. Just tell me the truth. Noona had to give up on your dream because of Tae-min and me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Yes. Sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you sorry Noona? I\u2019m the one who should be saying sorry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tae-hyuk doesn\u2019t need to be sorry! I just did what I needed to do... So... Waaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran suddenly started to cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gently stroked his sister\u2019s back and gave her some tissue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, you did what you had to do, Noona. Please stop working at the factory now and prepare your luck. And... let\u2019s take the university entrance exam together next year.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran gazed at Tae-hyuk with red eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Huh? T-The living expenses...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will do it somehow. The school registration fees as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-That will cost a lot of money...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The living expenses for a family of three and the school admission fees. If he included the university tuition, it was a lot of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have a lot of money right now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haven\u2019t you spent all the bounty money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, he had saved quite a bit of that money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt remorse for a moment, but that wasn\u2019t what mattered right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Not long ago, I met with the vice president of the Jinsung Group in private. He took me around his house, and in his house, there was a painting that I liked so much that he gave it to me as a gift. In fact, it was actually a very expensive painting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"R-Receiving such an expensive gift! Give it back right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well. In fact...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk showed her the box filled with money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve already sold it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran held a hand to her head, as if she was dizzy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The box was filled with 50,000 won bills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The total seemed to be in the tens of millions. It was the first time she had seen such a large amount of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t this enough to live for a few years?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran said quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Go now and return the money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He knew that Ha-ran was overflowing with goodness but he hadn\u2019t expected this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he have thought of another excuse?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Something like a passerby saving him. They gave him the lotto number or something like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But the water had already been spilled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, 50 million won may be a big amount of money for us, but is it really such a big deal for those who already have a lot of money? Thus, he gave me this as a gift. Moreover, I don\u2019t think it is polite to return something received as a gift.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In that case, Tae-hyuk would become a villain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He first had to convince Ha-ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke smoothly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen I think about the personality of the person who gave it to me, I think we should use it. Study hard and go to a good university.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Certainly, it is rude to return a gift.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right. Can\u2019t we use this money? Let\u2019s study hard and go to university together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk patted Ha-ran\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, Noona should put this in your treasure chest. That is the safest place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So, let\u2019s go to a private cram school this Saturday. A friend of mine gave me the information, and she recommended the best cram school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A friend? Is it a man?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, it is a woman.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Ha-ran looked at Tae-hyuk with a shocked face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The kid who had followed her around finally grew up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Write the resignation letter immediately. From now on, Noona is a student.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s expression brightened the moment she heard those words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were her dream words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, yes. I understand. Tae-hyuk... Really, thank you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sighed with relief. Now, it would really start.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be different from his previous life, where everyone was unhappy. Ha-ran and Tae-min too. Everybody would be able to achieve what they wanted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was his only reward for those who believed in him until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk muttered under his breath, as if he was making a promise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm going to slowly change it.

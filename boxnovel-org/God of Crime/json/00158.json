Message?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I wanted to buy clothes you clothes for my wedding. Didn\u2019t you come running after seeing it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was just before the wedding. Even though she was surely busy... Was his sister worried about his clothing now?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She seriously wanted to talk about this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had no one to help with the wedding plans, so she had to do everything herself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her dark circles reminded him of An Eun-young in her prime studying days.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even so, she was beautiful.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was like a flower that had just fully bloomed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran had started studying at the Wolsang Institute not long ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She wasn\u2019t even an intern yet, but her face was filled with hope.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm still a student so I can wear my uniform. So don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A small smile appeared on Ha-ran\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy Tae-hyuk is all grown up. I knew you would say that. But in this situation, I want to buy you some clothes as thanks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t you have to do more wedding invitations? It looks like there are a lot of pamphlets in the living room. It is hard to do alone, so shall I help you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course! This is important too! But first, shopping for Tae-hyuk\u2019s clothes! ...In fact, I feel really sorry that you are wearing the same clothes every day. Oh look at this!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Ha-ran pulled out a folded envelope from her pocket.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She showed him the contents with a cheerful expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI saved this to buy Tae-hyuk\u2019s clothing. Let\u2019s find something stylish.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">10,000 won bills were crammed inside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were around 50 of them?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk felt a lump in his throat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the meantime, he had hidden the fact that he made a huge amount of money from his crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He decided to reveal it after changing the future completely.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could use the excuse of winning the lottery or receiving a blank inheritance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he used the crime skills then he could make a plausible lie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until then, he lived sparingly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In such a situation, Ha-ran had collected 500,000 won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018...This is obviously something she collected by living sparingly.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his dry lips and asked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Noona, if we were rich then what would you like to have?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You told me that you wanted to live in a two-story house with a garden while we were watching a drama. That is good. Or do you want something else? Or maybe a wish that you want to fulfill?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to confess the day before her wedding that he was rich by showing her the bankbooks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The fight with Mister Park was over so the timing was good.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ha-ran suddenly hugged Tae-hyuk with red eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My wish? Tae-hyuk. Noona only has one wish...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So that wish...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-Why are you asking?

It is to see you and Tae-min living well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Is that it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. The end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran closed her eyes and opened her mouth like it was time to confess something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMother and Father... they died in an accident... I was always anxious. I confidently said that I would be your parents instead...

Why was the scene so familiar?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like he saw it directly in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The facts overlapped in Tae-hyuk\u2019s mind.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran never went to the swimming pool after the death of their parents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran whispered to Tae-hyuk,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want Tae-hyuk and Tae-min to live better lives than before... As if that accident never occurred...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Noona. I\u2019m sorry to say this all of a sudden. Can you show me your belly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran blushed and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-What are you saying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is something I would like to check.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran was very embarrassed by his sudden request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you remember that time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Maybe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran struggled for a moment in silence.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.

Ugh...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he couldn\u2019t endure it and dunked his head over the sink.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t eaten anything, so only yellow gastric juices were vomited out, but it was better than nothing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After a few minutes, he felt the nausea fading away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s concerned voice could be heard from outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTae-hyuk? What's going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All of a sudden, my stomach...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! Y-Your stomach hurts? I\u2019ll go and buy medicine straight away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I think it will get better if I rest a little bit. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made an excuse to Ha-ran and sat on the bathtub.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the illusion of people dying appeared in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I...killed...

W-What on earth...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When did he start to cross the line?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and desperately searched through his memories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Yes. It is clearly after I upgraded to a King.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were some signs of it when he was a Noble.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The more he used the crime skills, the more numb he became to committing crimes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like he became another person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It became worse after he was a King, and he easily killed others.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like he was spellbound by something, but the memories still remained intact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A few hours ago, he was about to kill a couple who hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This, dammit! I am just like a serial killer!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the future, he was framed and went to prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he might be punished for the sins he committed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut I have the crime skills... Waaaack! Y-Yes! That is the killer!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis really was a cursed object from the beginning!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had barely come back to his senses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But what if he started using the crime skills again?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not a criminal... So now I will quit being Phantom. I will return to being the high school student Seo Tae-hyuk, Ha-ran noona\u2019s little brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t throw away the Demon Revealing Mirror but he decided not to use the sinister crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Woong!</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Woong woong!</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Woong woong woong!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Demon Revealing Mirror started to vibrate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Do you think I will be convinced by that? I\u2019m not going to use the crime skills. So just disappear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a message appeared on the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is possible to become the God of Crime by obtaining one million affinity points.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Demon Revealing Mirror showed him the condition required to upgrade his rank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you saying that you want me to kill one million people?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He obtained affinity points by changing the fate of others.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a simple way to do this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was to kill someone who should\u2019ve lived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Damn!

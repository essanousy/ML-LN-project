Go buy a box of vitamin drinks and pretend you came for a volunteer activity. Go clean the toilets, play with the children, and gently squeeze out the information you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung-nim\u2019s plan is truly smart!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong didn\u2019t become of the leaders of this gang just due to his fighting skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He also had a surprisingly good head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gangsters bought vitamin drinks and headed over to the orphanages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Their excuse worked well because they were high school students.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you here to do volunteer work?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I am a student from D High School.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The staff member sent him a suspicious look, but nodded after seeing the student ID.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What we need is...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m happy to do anything, I will even clean the toilets.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? I see. Please do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a few moments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStudent! You are more sincere than you look. Please eat these snacks and rest a little bit. I\u2019ll take four hours of volunteer work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah! Thank you. By the way, how long has Noona been here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, the gangsters started collecting their information.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thanks to Kang Han-seong\u2019s plan, it was surprisingly easy to gather information.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The data piled up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Boss. This is an interim report.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Where should I look?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong laid out a map of Seoul that had been marked in advance before explaining each one. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are a total of 44 orphanages in Seoul. These 30 places are where the search is finished, and the rest will be finished soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So how many people are missing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat... It is a bit strange. In most orphanages, the children run away just as they are about to leave that place. I arranged the dates and that was the common point. It is the same for each of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk touched his chin and thought of Kang Han-seong\u2019s investigation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was one thing that caught his attention.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then why wasn\u2019t it reported?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The reason is mostly similar: The children would leave soon anyway. The police didn\u2019t really listen since they were just orphans. There are hundreds of children who go missing in one year.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police in South Korea were only concerned with the disappearance of children who have parents.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But they were orphans living in a facility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s wait for the rest of the reports to come in before making a conclusion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After three hours, all the information from the orphanages had been gathered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the conclusion was that children disappeared from 40 of the 44 orphanages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was a huge number, when taken as a percentage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There was no one who went to the orphanages to investigate the missing people?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It was the same person. Perhaps they didn\u2019t investigate properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see. Then it is a total wipe out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gangsters found out when the children had disappeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded with a satisfied expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They did a better job than he expected.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a bundle of 50,000 won banknotes and handed it to Kang Han-seong.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a huge five million won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-This...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Think of it as a reward. You did a better job than I thought. However, don\u2019t think about taking that money alone but distribute it. I\u2019m looking forward to your work in the future.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Thank you. Boss!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It might be an over-investment, but Tae-hyuk shouldn\u2019t spare on the carrots when he was trying to attract rabbits.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now Kang Han-seong would try to accomplish whatever Tae-hyuk wanted with more effort.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong got up from his seat with an impressed face and went outside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk stayed to look at the map alone, he found something strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took out a pen from his pocket and marked from the oldest one who went missing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was an amazing result.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a little off, but there was the shape of a circle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was impossible to do without someone being involved.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...They aren\u2019t disappearances. It is a serial kidnapping of over 40 children. Obviously, one of those victims is Kim Soo-bin...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin had been kidnapped relatively later, but if her severed arm had been found, the rest of the children...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt dizzy as he realized the ridiculous truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWake up Seo Tae-hyuk. There must be some clues.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slapped his cheeks with both hands.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There had to be something in advance to signify such a massive kidnapping spree.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to find out what it was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used Voice Modulation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You can imitate the voice of Kim Bum-soo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Bum-soo\u2019s voice was the best for this type of thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk called the orphanage that had the first missing person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the voice of a middle-aged woman was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHello? I am a welfare officer from the Department of Health and Welfare in Gangseo-gu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Ah, thank you for your hard work.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Did something happen?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voice of the woman receiving the call was strangely flirtatious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed to be due to Kim Bum-soo\u2019s voice, who was popular among middle aged women.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Due to a recent incident, there is a child-welfare related rebate occurring. I wanted to contact you to see if anything unusual happened on October 7th.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">At that time?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Can you please wait a moment?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I\u2019ll find the records.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It worked really well.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Bum-soo acted as a king in historical dramas, as his profound voice gave a strange sense of trust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">There were no visitors that day, but there was a health checkup at T Medical Centre on that day.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Are you referring to this?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018T Medical Centre...?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Thank you for the answer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Is it something that will cause the orphanage to be damaged?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course not. Don't worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk called a different orphanage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This time he just asked if they visited T Medical Centre on that day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he finished calling all the orphanages, Tae-hyuk sighed and leaned back in his chair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...All of them went missing shortly after a checkup.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no evidence but he could feel it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like I need Big Mama\u2019s help.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only one small piece remained to reach the truth that nobody had revealed yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk and Hyun-ho were discussing this incident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well I think the killer if a very meticulous person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho stared blankly at Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunbae. Didn\u2019t I say that three days ago?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I haven\u2019t finished speaking yet. Listen. At any rate, we have been looking for clues or witnesses by mobilizing the media, and there has nothing so far. There was a plausible tip about a man wearing a mask that bought a saw, tarp, and plastic container. However, the payment was made in cash, and he moved in a position where he wasn\u2019t caught on CCTV, so we can\u2019t identify him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. Is the store far away from the crime scene?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Completely different cities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That certainly sounds suspicious...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were no witnesses and no clues.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Kang-suk stood up and beat on his chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No matter how trivial the clue is, it is our job to squeeze out as much as possible. If the police gives up, then the case will remain forever unsolved. I want to solve this case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It has been a long time since the appearance of Senses Kang-suk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is something strange lingering in my mind. The other day, didn\u2019t you tell me about an avant-garde performance using dolls? The artist changed the arms and legs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid I say that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You certainly did. And there was one person who said something similar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGod of Crime.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho laughed bitterly at the unexpected name.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He said that this was playing with dolls. Obviously, the police are calling it the Christmas Tree Mutilation murders.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoll play?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The arms and legs of people were cut off and used to decorate a Christmas tree.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If they switched the focus to dolls, then there was definitely someone who gave such a performance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The name of that person was...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. The doll artist you talked about the other day. I did some research on the Internet. Here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk showed him the Internet screen on his phone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were some photos of the famous person and his work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hup...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The doll\u2019s arms and legs were cut off and switched to create a bizarre atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow is it? Similar?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoa. Once again, I think that Sunbae\u2019s senses are really great!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, this isn\u2019t evidence that he is the killer. It might simply be coincidence or a copycat. But isn\u2019t it worth visiting once?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you want to go together now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, it has been on my mind for a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Interestingly enough, the two people had been investigating together since the hippo incident.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho worked in the office to grasp the psychology of the criminal with the collected evidence, while Detective Kang-suk was the opposite.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A detective whose career was in fieldwork.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He judged everything through seeing it and touching it directly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although it was a little inefficient, most of the time he had great results.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, the two of them had opposite styles.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even so, they strangely worked well together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, let\u2019s just talk to him to get his opinion first. You can show that you suspect him of being the criminal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAish, Sunbae. I\u2019ve been working in the field for seven years. I won\u2019t do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Okay. Then shall we call a taxi?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We can go in my car.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk shrugged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Having a car made things much easier than he thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he got married then he would buy a car...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Ha-ran\u2019s face popped up, causing Kang-suk to cough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is it here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like it. This is the workshop of the doll artist, Yoo Ho-jin. By the way. It is quite unique.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a building with a pastel roof and pink bricks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like looking at a doll house.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk laughed as soon as he got out of the car and saw the name on the nameplate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Doll House]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a really fitting name, and \u2018the place for my beloved dolls\u2019 was written in fine print.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The artist seemed to be living a doll-like life here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk carefully knocked on the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A cracked and barren voice, like a broken vinyl record, was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDetective Cho Kang-suk from the Gangdong Police Station. Sorry, but are you Master Yoo Ho-jin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That\u2019s right. What is going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a thin man in his early 40s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The door opened slightly and a cracked hand, that was like bark, protruded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There was a bizarre incident, and I heard that Master-nim was an expert in dolls, so I was hoping to get your opinion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk pulled his police badge from his pocket and showed it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Ho-jin\u2019s eyes peered at them from between the gap in the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you bring a warrant?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but not yet since I visited personally.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m busy because of work. Can you come back later?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At those words, Yoo Ho-jin tried to close the door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Kang-suk was faster.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He stuck his feet in the door and then literally forced it open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you doing? The police barging into my home...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt will only take a short time... heok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk groaned as he entered the house.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a ridiculous scene inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...D-Dolls?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were dozens of cut off arm and legs from dolls.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were glass beads rolling around on the work table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Looking closer, they were the eyeballs of the dolls.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a large stainless steel saw on the ground among doll pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-This...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Yoo Ho-jin shouted with an upset face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y-You entered my workshop without permission! This is obviously a home invasion!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho picked up one of the doll arms and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunbae. This is a doll.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a plastic tub filled with what seemed to be doll heads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was confused.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no evidence of any mutilated humans in the workshop.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was his feeling wrong?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Ho-jin\u2019s face was red with anger,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Master-nim. I\u2019m sorry but could you take a look at these photos?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, I mean get out of here right now... Um...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Ho-jin\u2019s expression changed when Kang-suk showed him a photo of the Doll Play scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a murder scene that I am in charge of. Doesn\u2019t it resemble your work?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Ho-jin's mouth twitched,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The atmosphere is certainly quite similar. It is like what I am pursuing, and is why you can\u2019t help but be suspicious. After seeing my workshop, do you understand that I work with dolls instead of people? Then get out right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Ho-jin\u2019s voice had softened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Looking at the tools in the workshop, it must\u2019ve been doll artist Yoo Ho-jin who bought the tools at the store.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">So was it really unrelated to dolls?</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kuuong!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he heard a\u00a0thumping sound\u00a0from the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk confirmed that Yoo Ho-jin\u2019s expression instantly changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He remembered seeing such a look before.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Criminals gave such responses after their hidden weapons were found.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk grabbed Yoo Ho-jin\u2019s arm and asked in a quiet voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Master-nim.

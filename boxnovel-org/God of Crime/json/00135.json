However, he hadn\u2019t studied with her after that.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But it rose at a tremendous pace while fighting other criminals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Mafia art forgery case. the Triads\u2019 organ trafficking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After the cult incident with the Yakuza, Tae-hyuk\u2019s stats increased enormously.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the case of his stamina, it went up by 10 after fighting against dozens of mafia members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I literally took a giant leap.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yesterday, mock tests were conducted all across the country.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He thought it was a good opportunity to see how his head had improved.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The result was a perfect score for all subjects.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He also finished the tests with 10 minutes to spare.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is just 70 points. If I get 100 points, then can\u2019t I win a Noble Prize?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was more interesting to plot crimes than to study.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anyways, his stats seemed to ascend when he specialized in crime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018A criminal should have a good head.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was still some time before homeroom would start.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out his phone from his pocket and accessed the Internet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The incident from a few days ago was still heating up the news columns.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Declaring war on the mafia who encroached on South Korea? Phantom\u2019s purpose.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an obvious gossip story that he knew the contents without even clicking on it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But there was an eye-catching ripple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">No matter how incredible Phantom is, it will be hard for him to deal with the whole mafia alone.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Even if the mafia were chased out, they can just start operating secretly.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Will we ever be able to get rid of their weeds?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">It will remain the same.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Even if one sprout is pulled out, two more will grow in its place until the person is exhausted.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The debate continued.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It made a lot of sense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t appear in the news but the mafia were still active in South Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Phantom\u2019s declaration of war wasn\u2019t a prank call.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would let the opponent know how much damage he could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One person alone couldn\u2019t deal with the whole mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018But I am sorry. In this case, I\u2019ve prepared a plan.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it couldn\u2019t be implemented right now.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were a few things that needed to be taken care of before he could smash the mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018First...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Bam!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, his eyes flashed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey! Tae-hyuk! What are you doing? Class has begun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Jung Nam-ho, his teacher, who spoke with his unique dialect.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had hit the back of Tae-hyuk\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk rubbed his head and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uhh...Teacher-nim.

N-Noona?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes shook as Jung Nam-ho requested the presence of his guardian.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Surely no one knew that he was the Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Did Jung Nam-ho perhaps see him with the Nuclear Bomb members?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It couldn\u2019t be...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes!

They are grades that anyone would desire. Effort never betrays you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk was thinking about something else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Then it is time to talk with him.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as he visualized someone\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2014 I will punish them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kwang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The young boss of the Triads, Li Zheng, struck his desk after seeing the video from the UCC site.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"B-Boss...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The subordinates trembled at the boss\u2019 agitated state.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Their boss was someone who always kept his cool, even when subordinates were lost.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yet he was agitated this time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng glared at his subordinates with blazing eyes then tore up the reports on his desk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were the results of various plans to bring Phantom into the Triads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of them failed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe hates money, hates honor, and hates women.

Even Phantom wouldn\u2019t be able to take on dozens of armed men. Tell them that anyone who obtains Phantom\u2019s neck will be give a three million dollar reward. Let\u2019s see how much he can do alone. I might be using a flamethrower to catch a rat in a warehouse, but I have to let him know that he can be killed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the door opened and an agitated man in a black suit entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"B-Boss...

The bosses of the Red Mafia mobilized armed men with powerful firearms to kill the \u2018Princess.\u2019\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. I think I recall it. What does it have to do with Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The subordinate dropped his head and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Phantom rescued her from the Red Mafia\u2019s hands.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What?! Wait a minute. The opponents were armed with weapons! I clearly remember that anti-tank rockets and sniper rifles were mobilized, yet one man saved the princess and got away?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng got goosebumps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that the Red Mafia was engaged in a civil war was well known.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They would obvious fight among themselves and self-destruct.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t worried about the movements of the Red Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But what was this?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom stopped the assassination of the boss?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me... Phantom has gone under the princess of the Red Mafia?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know. It is the worst case scenario.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to absolutely stop it! Phantom doesn\u2019t need to join the Triads.

He really is great. Saving the boss from dozens of armed people. Yes, what about the damage to both sides?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be preferable if Phantom got a big injury and died.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the expression of his subordinate was strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like opening a box that shouldn\u2019t be opened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTell me.

I am a child growing every day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once Tae-hyuk asked about the Yakuza who were active in South Korea, Big Mama gazed at him with suspicious eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Have you been making a bad friend these days? In particular, someone who has a hobby of wearing a strange mask?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, do you think that I know Phantom? I am just filled with burning patriotism these days.

Should I just kill her?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a gun...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He touched the grip of the hidden pistol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Bullets were loaded so pulling the trigger would fire it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opponents were just an ordinary high school student and his mother.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t need to use Bullet Time to put a hole in their heads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he raised the gun, then the peacock would tremble with fear...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'No. I didn\u2019t place a silencer on the pistol and too many people are watching. In that case, I can be a little bit playful.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The peacock couldn\u2019t imagine how close she came to dying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He glared at the peacock with a cold expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMother! He is Seo Tae-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSeo Tae-hyuk?

Tae-hyuk! Come in and sit down!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk and Ha-ran sat down and the consultation began.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran bowed politely and greeted the teacher.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hello. I am Tae-hyuk\u2019s sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Cough! Ah, his sister? Seo Tae-hyuk... Seo Tae-hyuk is my most beloved disciple.

If he tells me which university he wants to go to, then I will give him my full support.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Universities with a slightly lower cut-off line than S University were checked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most career counseling was based on the student\u2019s grades.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, it was often a one-sided conversation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Jung Nam-ho didn\u2019t forcibly talk and instead listened to Ha-ran calmly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, I would like to send Tae-hyuk to the university he wants to go, regardless of scholarships.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, is that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them focused on Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. I don\u2019t care if it is S University.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"S University...the medical school might be hard, but you will be able to easily enter the other courses.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cR-Really? S-Sob...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s eyes reddened and thick tears started to flow down her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cS-Sob, s... I-I\u2019m sorry. I just didn\u2019t know that Tae-hyuk would be doing so well... Our parents died in an accident and raising him alone...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, she had seen the report cards from school.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, hearing it directly from the mouth of a teacher was different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like something from a dream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, the tears have broken out...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk grunted and quietly pulled out a handkerchief from his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Crying all of a sudden...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Tae-hyuk\u2019s path was to study to enter S University.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was due to a promise to go to the same university as An Eun-young.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He just meant to keep it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the future...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been one year since he first received memories of the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Could he get a scholarship to go to university?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was something he wouldn\u2019t have imagined in his previous life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tae-hyuk, let\u2019s go eat meat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran suddenly smiled and tugged at Tae-hyuk\u2019s arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I would rather go home and eat Noona\u2019s cooking.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It has been a long time since we went out together like this.

You are completely excited over a career consultation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHehe!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran laughed brightly in her clean suit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her tired appearance from his previous life seemed to overlap with her current form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t want to see that again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He suddenly felt anxious and decided to ask her something,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"By the way, what is Noona thinking of studying at university?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran spun around and spoke.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She looked so refreshing and lively.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m thinking about it. I think I want to go to a university with an energy research institute.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Energy research institute?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. A place to study eco-friendly energy... I happen to know the department manager there so I think I can enter with his recommendation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s eyes shone as she talked about the research institute.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to figure out what type of place it was at the next opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you remember when we lived in the basement room in the past? It was too cold in winter, so we would hug each other in order to sleep. If the research is a success, it can supply energy that is dozens of times cheaper than the current fuels we use. Then won\u2019t everyone be able to stay warm in winter? And the children at the orphanage...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wondered how long she had been dreaming of this to be talking about it so excitedly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If there was such a new energy, then the person who discovered it would instantly receive the Nobel Prize.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t want to break Ha-ran\u2019s dream.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran had decided what she wanted to do, unless her previous life that was stained in despair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was too much...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI hope it turns out well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After taking Ha-ran home, Tae-hyuk hid in a dark alley.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, let\u2019s try this out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once he exited, he was a completely different person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked down at his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The power of the \u2018Transformation\u2019 skill was enough to make his mouth drop open.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Not just his face and voice, but his body was also perfectly transformed into another person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now he could hide anywhere without the Phantom mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, the place where I\u2019m going now isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had allied with the Bomber for the mafia game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now it was time to keep his promise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In order to do that, I need to get rid of the remnants of the Yakuza still remaining in South Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi Takeshi had gone back to Japan, leaving Mister Park behind to repair his remaining forces.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to wipe them out as well as destroy Taesung Group\u2019s laboratories.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Getting revenge on those who drove the Bomber\u2019s family to ruin was Tae-hyuk\u2019s promise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is no need to hurry.

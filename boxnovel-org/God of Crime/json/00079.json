It\u2019s completely bloody in here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh... The blood isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even so, I would rather do this, since it\u2019s easy money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then one of them asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBy the way, Hyung-nim. I have a question.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it? Ah, be careful there. If you fall then you will die. Your flesh will be cut off and sliced in pieces.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The young man, who almost slipped, clicked his tongue and put the flesh into the bag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why isn\u2019t anesthesia used? Rather than cutting off one limb to stop them from moving, it would be better to just inject them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The older one smirked at the youth\u2019s question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey! If you care about that then you shouldn\u2019t work here. The reason is simple. It\u2019s just like how fish are kept alive for sashimi. Won\u2019t the medicine affect the organs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The young man nodded with a face like he understood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, the cleaning of the operation room is almost finished... Now it is just throwing away the trash.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Bring some hydrochloric acid and plastic from the warehouse. After the room is soaked for 3~4 hours, it can be used. Put the rest in the drum barrel. Ah, prepare two drums.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, one more is being done in the afternoon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. This is a really good business.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the organs from prisoners were banned in China, those who needed transplants now came to Korea for the surgery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In particular, it was safer than China which normally had side effects due to the unhygienic surgical environment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently, the global market was heavily saturated with organs from India and Southeast Asia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The most expensive parts, such as the heart, liver and kidney, were traded for around 200 million won a piece.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, T Medical Center had fresh organs that were checked by medical staff, making their prices were twice as high as international ones. </span><span style=\"\">Despite this fact, people still waited in line for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019s roughly 1.5 billion per person? I would be happy to sell mine at such a high price. I would die happy. Huhuhu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the operating room door opened and Dr. J, a surgeon, entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? It still isn\u2019t clean? I told you to finish it as quickly as possible, didn\u2019t you hear me? Why are you just standing around?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The older cleaner bowed his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I\u2019m really sorry. We will finish it as soon as possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes. Make sure you handle it. Kim Soo-bin still has one arm left; however, the schedule is tight, so she has to be done soon. Make sure you tie her up so that she\u2019s unable to move.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019ll make sure she can\u2019t life even one finger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Phew, I\u2019ll trust you this time...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. J sighed and exited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The youth asked the older cleaner who was still bowing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is the doctor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, that is him. Remember the person in charge here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah... The atmosphere isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard he is one of the top three experts in China. Don\u2019t rile him up because I don\u2019t know what he would do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. But I am wondering one thing. Why are the limbs being cut off?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s to prevent the doctor from being hit with an arm or leg during the surgery. They\u2019re sold for surprisingly high prices to collectors. Moreover, did you see yesterday\u2019s news?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Dr. J has a really fantastic mind. He used the parts that were thrown away to fake a mutilation murder case. Recently, there was a police officer sniffing around the missing children.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the firmly closed door opened and Dr. J entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He quietly approached the older cleaner and sliced his neck with a scalpel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cK... Keook...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood sprayed out from the older cleaner\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Dr. J cleaned the blood from his hand and took out a cigarette before asking,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What did I say? I told you to watch your mouth. Hey, Newbie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes? Yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The youth froze with surprise before replying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now you\u2019re the main cleaner, and your salary will double. Have you learned everything about the job?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The youth smiled at the promotion and replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then prepare that one. His body is rotten, but there might be a part that can be used.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. J smoked his cigarette as he laid the man on the operating table and started working.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After finishing everything, the doctor said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is one more in the afternoon so keep it clean. And remember to watch your mouth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. Doctor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing the cleaning, the young man went to eat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The menu was beef tripe and intestine soup.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin stared at the firmly closed door in the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time it was opened, one person in this room would be dragged out, never to come back.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What happened to them?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t want to imagine it, but it absolutely wasn\u2019t a good thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even with her eyes that had become accustomed to darkness, she could only dimly see the outline of body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin hugged her trembling body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she woke up, one arm had disappeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, the even sadder thing was that she lost the token of promise that she shared with her only friend.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The token she treasured on her little finger...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tears suddenly poured down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin was a child who didn\u2019t receive any love from an early age.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her mother left the house.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her only remaining family, her father, saw her mother in Kim Soo-bin and abused her every day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, she left the house and wandered the streets, committing all types of dirty actions such as shoplifting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt like paradise didn\u2019t exist.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the police picked her up at a crime scene and she was taken to a facility.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Life there wasn\u2019t much different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was stamped with the stigma of a criminal so the eyes of the adults were cold.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If anything happened then she was suspected and beaten.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just as she became resigned to suffering for eternity, Song Hye-mi appeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two people, who resembled each other so much so that it was like looking in a mirror, instantly became friends.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I want to be happy.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the first time, that thought appeared in Kim Soo-bin\u2019s mind.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">On that day, Kim Soo-bin was reborn.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t do anything bad anymore and worked hard to develop her skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She wanted to live with Song Hye-mi as soon as she left the orphanage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If she stretched out her hand, then she thought she could catch the happiness that she craved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But then she was kidnapped by unidentified people.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Ddubeok...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, Kim Soo-bin heard someone\u2019s footsteps.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was the only one remaining in this room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was it finally her turn?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had constantly wished that someone would save her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, when she was kidnapped, and when her arm was cut off, nobody came to her rescue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe someone is coming to save me...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin didn\u2019t abandon hope until the end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This couldn\u2019t be over.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had a promise to keep.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Let\u2019s be happy together.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the door opened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin\u2019s face distorted as she confirmed the appearance of the person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That man.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The man who cut off her arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAha, ahahaha! Be glad. It\u2019s finally your turn. Now you\u2019ll be able to live while surrounded by luxurious furniture. You can now eat all types of delicious foods, and be able to meet and have a loving relationship with a nice person. You\u2019ll now be able to spend your days in happiness.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin understood what the man\u2019s words meant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t the happiness that she wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cS-Spare me. I'll do anything... P-Plea... Oof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The young cleaner standing behind Dr. J covered Kim Soo-bin\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin struggled desperately to avoid being dragged.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Dr. J clicked his tongue and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI should\u2019ve had someone cut off the remaining arm in advance. I\u2019ve been too busy these days. The death of one of you will bring happiness to over 10 people. Don\u2019t you think that is much better than living a tragic life?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. J stroked Kim Soo-bin\u2019s head like he was complimenting her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then slowly, he injected an anesthetic into her neck.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin\u2019s struggling body instantly relaxed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Cleaner, pick her up. I didn\u2019t want to use this to maintain the freshness. Still, it couldn\u2019t be helped. It wasn\u2019t a strong dose so even if she doesn\u2019t move, her consciousness will still remain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I've done all the preparations, doctor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. J nodded with a satisfied expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are quiet in comparison to your predecessor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cleaner carried Kim Soo-bin and headed to the operating room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. J said quietly,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Be careful. That girl you are carrying is worth 1.5 billion won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scalp, artery, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, blood, skin, eyes, teeth, shoulders, heart, spleen, stomach, small intestines...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Every single one of those organs were worth valuable money that couldn\u2019t be abandoned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even at the last minute, Kim Soo-bin was constantly thinking,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019m sorry... Hye-mi... I couldn\u2019t keep my promise...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at T Medical Center from a distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like an ordinary hospital, but there was something wicked and nefarious was happening in its basement.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wanted to blow it up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It would be great if I was a bomber.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The important thing was justification.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk planned to inform the mass media about the existence of Phantom through the Doll Play event.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to do this, Shin Se-ho the PD had been steadily preparing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'First of all, I have to capture what is happening here on camera.

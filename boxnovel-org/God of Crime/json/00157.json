Furthermore, the Taesung Group can now barely take care of itself. Then the Yakuza controlling everything from behind...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Along with the Chinese Triads and the Russian Red Mafia, they were walking around with a chain around their necks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the butterfly effect.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The theory that a butterfly\u2019s wings flapping could cause a hurricane on the other side of the earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk changed his and many others\u2019 fates by using his knowledge of the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Every time he received a reward, it was like he got another piece of the puzzle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, a great picture was formed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had overturned the table so thoroughly that even the butterfly effect couldn\u2019t occur anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror with a satisfied expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a message to find out about the God of Crime.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Nothing had been revealed yet about the conditions required.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was no need to rush.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had been one year since he had first obtained the Demon Revealing Mirror and his crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he was able to win the fight against fate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, he decided to relax and enjoy this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBy the way, I think I am forgetting something very important. What was it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and wondered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then something suddenly popped into his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Ah, Noona\u2019s wedding gift!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been busy for a while, thanks to the mafia game and the Bomber\u2019s revenge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the meantime, Seo Ha-ran\u2019s wedding was imminent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What would be good...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was deep in thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...In the end, it is a house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The place where they were living now was like a mansion compared to their previous rented room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Kang-suk was taking care of children.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk recalled that Ha-ran wanted to live in a two-storey house with a garden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Kang-suk and Ha-ran got married, Tae-hyuk and Tae-min agreed to live with them until they graduated from university.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There would be six people living together so a large house was needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, it was okay if the house was in the suburbs because Kang-suk had bought a car recently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, how much money do I have now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He decided to check the balances of his various accounts.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had collected a significant amount of money while working as Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It increased greatly after the mafia game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...4.07 billion?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Winning the normal lottery gave a jackpot of 500 million won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In one year, the amount he earned was like winning the lottery several times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, he would be able to buy a house for his family for one billion won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He decided to go to a real estate agent in the suburbs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were smartphone apps that allowed him to search for businesses that specialized in certain things, such as apartments or housing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He finally decided on a single family home and started wondering what to wear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is the house that I am going to live in so why should I change myself?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wore his usual clothes and went to visit the real estate agent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The agent in his 50s was watching TV with a sleepy expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWelcome. Have you come to see the house?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The agent studied Tae-hyuk before making a listless expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At best, he was a freshman who just entered university.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was wearing a leather jacket and his hair wasn\u2019t even trimmed properly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His body was wet with sweat, like he had been running.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe he came to look for a room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes. I wanted to look at what was on sale.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think we have any guest rooms suitable for you. The cheapest one is an officetel that requires a basic security deposit of three million and monthly rent is 1.2 million.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His words meant to leave now.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk shook his head and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I came to see about buying a place, not renting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"B-Buying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I was wondering if there was a suitable single family home. There should be a lot of rooms. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is new or not But there should be a small garden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa, ha, ha... Guest-nim... You seem to be mistaken about something. Such a house is at least one billion won...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have that much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The agent\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This guy had one billion won?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The agent turned red and he thought about calling the police.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you joking right now? This is obstructing my business...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes narrowed as he watched the agent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like he would have to take out his bankbook and show his balance for things to go smoothly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was at that moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Two guests entered through the half open door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a young woman with colourful makeup and a man who seemed to be in his late 40s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two of them were stuck close together like they were dating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how he looked, it seemed like an affair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The atmosphere of the agent changed as the couple entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, Boss-nim is here! I have found a house that fits your requirements.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The middle-aged man chuckled and replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Is it was two-storey house with lots of rooms and a yard? I thought I would buy one due to the redevelopment happening nearby. We need a house to live in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A fresh smile appeared on the agent\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The real estate agent would receive a percentage of the sales price as a commission fee.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Selling a house was much better than renting one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please sit here and look at the catalogue. I\u2019ll go and get you some tea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The middle-aged man started talking business with the agent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is cheaper than the market price in a nearby area. In this location, a house for one billion won is cheap.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Coincidentally, the house he was looking for had the same specs that Tae-hyuk was interested in.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes narrowed as he stared at the couple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If you want to live, then get out quickly.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the couple ignored him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm... It seems a bit more expensive than I thought....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat, Oppa. Buy me a house~\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, not that one. The price is a little...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like the price was a little expensive just for an affair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two people started to argue for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Argh! Annoying! By the way, who is the person who keeps looking at us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That reminds me, he was here from the beginning.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the agent said with embarrassment,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no. I\u2019ll get rid of him straight away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The agent approached Tae-hyuk and waved his hand like he was shooing away a fly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have an important deal to take care of, so please come see me about the house next time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made an absurd expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The house that the couple was buying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had enough money to buy two or three of them if he wanted, yet he was being treated as a troublesome fly?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? That person came to see you about a house?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yes. It seems like he wants to buy a small house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! Is it a rooftop house? By the way, I truly don\u2019t know how people can live in that. I would die if I needed to live in a rooftop house. Huh? Right Oppa?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Okay, okay. Oppa believes you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All expression disappeared from Tae-hyuk\u2019s face as he listened to the conversation between the couple and the agent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His family had lived in a rented semi-basement room for years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well... What a disagreeable couple. Should I just take them out quietly? Then I will buy that property. It is a good idea.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He touched the Tokarev TT-33 pistol that was hidden on his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had obtained it from the mafia members who attacked Caterina.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had been really useful in the meantime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk heard the whisperings of the couple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But are we going to live in the same neighbourhood as a person like that? It is disgusting...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAish, surely not. This is an expensive area. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His grip on the gun tightened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He instantly started planning the crime in his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opponents knew his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, he needed to get rid of everyone here. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After all, the dead couldn\u2019t talk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This place had CCTV but it wasn\u2019t on an external server.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he knew the exact location then it wouldn\u2019t be that difficult...</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-The most important thing that Mother left isn\u2019t this Rosario.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Pajik!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he felt like something was breaking on his face and there was a strange pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His wildly beating heart calmed down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Eh? I thought I heard something strange just now. Was I mistaken? Um... Didn\u2019t I come here for Noona\u2019s gift? There is no need to do such annoying things. First, let me ask what gift Noona would like to receive. Then I can buy them a house if it isn\u2019t enough.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk let go of the pistol and quietly left the rest estate business.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The couple looked after him and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. An empty-headed fellow like that. Boss-nim. Don\u2019t rent a house to someone like that in this neighbourhood. It will bring the quality down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha, of course. Anyway, I doubt he would have the ability to obtain any of the properties. He will probably go to the slums.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t you think the quality of the person living there is important to increase the value of the house? Then let\u2019s go see this property.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Oppa, let\u2019s go see the room.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yep! I will go start the car. Boss-nim, please be at ease.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The agent and couple laughed happily without realizing that they had almost died.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

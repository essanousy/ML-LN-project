This cafe is the best trap. However, doesn\u2019t the status of the leader seem a bit low?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been one year after gaining the crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Did he feel like this because he had faced so many criminals in the meantime?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk found 12 hidden cameras inside the cafe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were also mini-microphones installed at the tables.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Obviously, the bishops of the Sun Cult would be checking all of the guests that entered here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Using Tae-hyuk\u2019s abilities, he could penetrate the building without anyone knowing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But in order to shatter the Sun cult, he needed to use a frontal attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHere is your coffee. By the way, I guess you have been waiting for someone. Have they arrived yet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the door as he replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is a little late but I think he is coming now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a rattle as someone entered the cafe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Naturally, the gazes of the people inside the cafe would focus on him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a man in his 30s with shortly cropped hair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His physique showed that he exercised a significant amount.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man looked around the cafe and confirmed that there were only two people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He turned to Tae-hyuk and bowed slightly,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you Kim Cheol-su?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes. Hello.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am Lee Gun-woo. Pleased to meet you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He extended a small business card towards Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The words \u2018Republic of Korea\u2019s Army\u2019 in English and the title of \u2018Captain\u2019 were written.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo received Tae-hyuk\u2019s business card and muttered with a surprised face,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It is your real name. Ah. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha, it is okay. Isn\u2019t it a name you often see in textbooks?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyone who saw the business card with \u2018Kim Cheol-su, maths teacher\u2019 would have the same reaction.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two people had only exchanged a few phone calls.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time actually meeting today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo ordered a glass of white mocha and sat at the table where Tae-hyuk was currently at. </span><span style=\"\">Then he carefully started his story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo was a lieutenant who failed to get promoted and was preparing for discharge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He then found out that his sister had become involved in the \u2018Sun\u2019 cult.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was searching for a person to help him and met Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In fact, I hadn\u2019t thought about going there directly at first. She is an adult and I should leave her to her own work. However... I don\u2019t think I can leave her in a cult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded with a heavy expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I also want to regain the family that I lost to the Sun Cult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That family is...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, my little brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see. At any rate, I want to find Min-young and bring her out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people exchanged information about the Sun Cult.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And there were a few eyes watching them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The base of the Sun Cult was only a minute\u2019s drive from the cafe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo started the car and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I wanted to bring a handgun, like a pistol. However, I don\u2019t have much time left until my discharge, and I don\u2019t want to go to military prison, so I am just a soldier in spirit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Then did you bring any weapons?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I brought a small rod, so I will be fine. Rather, you should be careful as a maths teacher.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. A lot of students abandoned maths so I had to study other subjects.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo continued to joke around as if to calm himself down.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he suddenly stopped and raised his hand from the steering wheel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There wasn\u2019t even time for a deep breath as they arrived at the base of the Sun Cult.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke like it was the first time he had visited this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It isn\u2019t as large as I thought.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems so. I thought that it would at least have an atmosphere similar to that of a military base or a prison, but the fence is low and people can freely enter and leave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk knew the answer but he didn\u2019t speak it aloud.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was just a high school teacher whose family member was taken away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason for having no barriers or guards was simple: the Sun followers lived in groups of five.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were the shackles that restricted each other\u2019s actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo took slow, deep breaths and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hu... Then as we already discussed, let\u2019s break through the front.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if it wasn\u2019t wide, there were three 4-story buildings.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how they moved, it would take a while with just two of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see we have people who came to visit. Sun welcomes all visitors.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they drove through the gate, a few people in suits came out to greet them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The man standing in the front said with a smile,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHwanin said you would come and you really did. The two of you are welcome.\u201d (Hwanin: google link. I suggest you glance over this link because this myth will be mentioned several times)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo\u2019s eyes widened at the unexpected hospitality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kim Cheol-su and Lee Gun-woo, please follow me. Min-young is waiting for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo groaned as the name of his sister emerged from the man\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-How do you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hwanin knows everything. Then please come this way for a more detailed explanation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guide was one of the bishops of the Sun Cult.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They followed him and arrived at a big bathroom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aren\u2019t I going to see my younger sister? And how the hell did you know my name and my sister\u2019s name? Perhaps...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo was obviously agitated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He even came to this place without saying anything to his little sister.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then suddenly, he recalled a rumor about Sun\u2019s leader.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He called himself the incarnation of Hwanin and had the ability to see the past, present, and future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Surely those abilities weren\u2019t real.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Such thoughts disappeared from his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t believe in things like that in this world.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was obviously some crafty trick.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bishop smiled at Gun-woo\u2019s look of suspicion and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but there is an order in everything. First you have to clean your body and wipe away everything of this world. Then we will arrange some clothes for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gun-woo didn\u2019t protest again and entered the bathroom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk followed behind him with a puzzled expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In fact, Tae-hyuk knew the trick used by the bishop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How did he do that? It was a cold reading based on the contents of the wiretap. What the hell, wasn\u2019t that a tactic used a few hundred years ago?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a technique that utilized psychological tricks during a conversation to guess what the person was thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The information that they have isn\u2019t perfect yet, so they will use the time in the bathroom to supplement it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like watching a young child\u2019s cute tricks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Well, if that is what you wish. I\u2019ll give it to you.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The smiling expression disappeared from the bishop\u2019s face as the two men entered the bathroom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhu. The two of them don\u2019t know that they are moths in a web. Hey, what are you doing? Go grab their ID cards and phones.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Make sure to set up some massages. It should take at least one hour.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During that time, all the preparations needed to be finished.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The bishop made them take a bath under the pretense of being cleansed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a prelude to the scam that would now begin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It has been a while since people have fallen into the trap.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cafe and nearby rest areas were all operated by Sun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Those who visited there were under the watchful eye of Sun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If one of them tried to come here, then it would be like this event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When bathing, everyone was forced to undress.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, they would leave their wallets and phones in the locker room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The believers entered and came outside with something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We got everything!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Check if they have SNS and get as much personal information as you can. I\u2019ll be unlocking the phones.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bishop smiled as he received the phones from the believers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Smartphones made cold reading much easier.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This little device contained everything about a person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Moreover, it was possible to release the fingerprint lock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It there are fingerprints, then we can collect a lot of it. After making the artificial fingerprint, I can see all the personal information. It is a really good world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Name, gender, age as well as the place of birth and what school they attended.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The name and contact information of the people they knew.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The most visited sites on the Internet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, there was the ID card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From there, it was simple to pass on the information and make the leader appear like the incarnation of Hwanin.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only thing left was how to produce a plausible stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is very simple. We have done this over 100 times.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bishop laughed and headed for his studio with the two phones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An hour passed by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After bathing, Tae-hyuk and Gun-woo opened the bathroom door and went outside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The waiting believer held out some clothes and a glass of milk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is milk gained directly from the cows raised here. There are no external chemicals ,so you can drink with confidence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gun-woo muttered as he took it,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It really feels like everything about the world has been washed away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then they heard the voice of the waiting bishop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It was cleansing. You have been purged through Hwanin\u2019s power. Now you are ready to meet Hwanin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, then your name...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am called Song Chi-hyun. The founder is waiting. Please follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk and Gun-woo walked down the long corridor as they followed Song Chi-hyun, a bishop of the Sun Cult.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

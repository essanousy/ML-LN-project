I don\u2019t know why Park Sung-yul, who has been in prison for three years, is sending such a thing now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe he thought that the way he was caught was unfair.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wasn\u2019t it due to a drunk driving crackdown?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk nodded and thought back to when he caught Park Sung-yul three years ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On that day, Kang-suk went out to support some drunk driving crackdowns.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were always skirmishes with drunk drivers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As a large-sized Homicide detective, just standing there would make people control their anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt the time, Park Sung-yul was driving a mid sized sedan. He submitted to the breathalyzer without saying anything. I couldn\u2019t find any traces of drinking, but he even abstained from smoking in front of the police. I accidentally saw his eyes, and it was like looking at a frozen lake. I didn\u2019t feel any emotions from him. I couldn\u2019t help but feel like he was a bad guy...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk remembered the situation at that time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It really was an accident that he caught Park Sung-yul, now that he thought about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There was obviously only Park Sung-yul in the car. However, the rear tires were similar to the front, meaning that there was something heavy in the trunk. It was something that weighed around the same as a human being.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik coughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It might be an accident, but it is only a slight difference. Finding it like that... You really are a detective. At any rate, continue.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then for the first time, Park Sung-yul showed some emotion. After seeing it, I was sure that he was hiding something. Originally, it was impossible to search the interior just for a DUI, so I used a little coercion to open the door of the trunk and looked inside. There...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know from there. There was a body inside a black plastic bag.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul was arrested and charged with murder and abandoning a body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment in \u2018Blue Dragon Prison\u2019 because he acknowledged his sin and had no previous convictions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Others might say you were lucky but I think that your observations skills and ability to carry it out is really great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOther people call it my senses.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. This brat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk stared at Kim Do-shik with a serious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI would like to be in charge of this case. It felt like a gauntlet was sent to me, so I'll definitely finish it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt still isn\u2019t sure if this is a case or not. Giving you solid support will be hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk touched his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. If this is a hidden crime, the victims\u2019 families will be waiting forever for them to return. If I can at least tell them the truth then I will be happy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tracking down a hidden crime was hard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t save anyone, and eventually people would end up unhappy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even so, Kang-suk wanted to be in charge of the case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I understand. Starting today, you will be personally in charge of Park Sung-yul\u2019s case. Although there won\u2019t be a headquarters for the investigation, please work on it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk closed his mouth and nodded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First of all, he had to interpret this stupid password.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is a child who likes these type of things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone\u2019s face popped into his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt sounds interesting Let me help you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho accepted Kang-suk\u2019s offer in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I feel relieved now that you have accepted, although it will be hard to get any proper support.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Originally, I wanted to catch Phantom together. But before that, we have to solve this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou... Aren\u2019t you lacking sincerity?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sunbae is too serious. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to clean this place up first?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk coughed and looked around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He built a temporary investigation headquarters by borrowing a place that was originally a warehouse.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was inevitable that it would be filled with dusty boxes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHave you read Park Sung-yul\u2019s letter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I think he is overly self-conscious. Then let\u2019s work on deciphering this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk placed the Park Sung-yul\u2019s letter and picture on the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is drawn with crayons that are commonly available in prisons, and the paper is cut out from a sketchbook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho pulled out his laptop that contained his profiling materials.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He started to compare the picture to information he had about Park Sung-yul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you know something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a simple trick. I think I\u2019m probably right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho pointed to the 5-1 that was written in the corner of Park Sung-yul\u2019s picture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, I can tell what this means just by looking.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c5 - 1? Then it is 4. But why did he write his name after that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt indicates the grade. In a picture contest at school, this information is often written down in the corner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-that's right.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGrade 5-1. Looking at Park Sung-yul, I can see the schools and classes that he graduated from. Perhaps he is talking about A Elementary School.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It could be middle school or high school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is no 5th grade.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk nodded with a convinced expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, we should go to this school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people headed to Park Sung-yul\u2019s elementary school.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Due to the fuel cost not being supported, he had to ride in Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There should at least be funding for fuel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Thank you for doing this for me, even if it is interesting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The elementary school that Park Sung-yul was a branch school in the mountains.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Surprisingly, Park Sung-yul\u2019s teacher was still at the small school that didn\u2019t even have 20 students.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, 20 years had passed so he was now the principal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he drank the tea that the principal made, Joo Hyun-ho started the questioning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPark Sung-yul? I still remember. He was a truly smart student.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The principal looked into the air like he was reminiscing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn\u2019t need to teach him much, and despite behind an elementary school student, he had already learned up to the high school standard. He was a brilliant mind in this rural school. Four years ago... He came to visit me once. I thought he was a successful businessman because he was wearing a suit. By the way, what did he do? Why are detectives...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk felt sorry to shatter the principal\u2019s memories, but he didn\u2019t want to hide the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is currently in prison for killing a person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026That kid? I\u2019m sorry Detective-nim. Anything you need...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The principal bowed to Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It isn\u2019t Teacher\u2019s fault. Get up. By the way, did Park Sung-yul ever join a painting contest in fifth grade?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCould you please wait a moment? Obviously the student journal .... \"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The principal brought out the old papers where events were written down.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After looking it over, he said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes. There was a drawing contest for landscape paintings when he was in the 5th grade. Sung-yol participated.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then do you remember seeing this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk extended Park Sung-yul\u2019s drawing to the principal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but this was a long time ago... However, if he was the winner, then it might still be here. The branch school has a magic box that holds memories. It is hard to throw things away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The principal went back to the warehouse before bringing out a number of drawings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Here it is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Surprisingly, the same picture from Park Sung-yul\u2019s letter was drawn on the faded paper.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk compared the two images and mnuttered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026It is exactly the same. Did he remember the painting from 20 years ago and drew it perfectly again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess so Sunbae. It seems like he is bigger than I thought. How the hell did you catch him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSenses.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The principal looked closely at the picture and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I think I know where this place is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Really?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure but... It might fit. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Under the guidance of the principal, Kang-suk and Hyun-ho climbed a hill behind the school.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although it wasn\u2019t very high, the landscape of the countryside appeared once they reached the top.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a minute...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk pulled out the painting and compared it to the surrounding landscape.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was an exact match.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This landscape was the one in the picture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess it was the correct answer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho talked to the principal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The principal told Joo Hyun-ho things like Park Sung-yul\u2019s usual appearance and personality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk interrupted the two people and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Park Sung-yul visited here a few years ago?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It was on Teacher\u2019s Day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid he do anything questionable?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Not at all. Ah, the weather wasn\u2019t that hot but he was sweating a lot.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It can\u2019t be.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk hurried down to the school.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had an idea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After gaining another teacher\u2019s consent, he borrowed a shovel and returned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like I should dig around. I don't know how much time it will take alone, but I have to try it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The principal touched his mouth and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCould you please wait a moment?\u201d I'll be happy to help.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m confident when it comes to shovelling.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk, Hyun-ho, and the principal recalled their memories of the army as they started digging.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After two hours, the mountain top was so messed up that there was no more places to dig.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is it not this mountain?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk asked while wiping his sweating head with a towel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul might have lied to get them out here in the middle of nowhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe it was revenge for being trapped in prison?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Joo Hyun-ho called out to Kang-suk in a heavy voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunbae. Take a look at this. The land here is exceptionally good and...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a body in a black plastic bag.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The flesh was rotting, but he could tell it was a petite woman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Well, I guess we found it. This is definitely a hidden crime. Park Sung-yul was right. He is a serial killer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk used the radio to call for support.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Tae-hyuk recovered to a certain extent, he started to search the hospital.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he entered the hallway, an alarm flashed on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Forgery skill has found an intense image.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The work can be completed through automatic clerk mode.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked up to see what room was in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSurgery rooms.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and got rid of the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew what intense image would be drawn.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were more than 10 cases of abortion performed here every day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like the entire hospital was shrouded by death.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was harder than expected to find a hidden passage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess I should use that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was going to draw the entire hospital, just like how he drew all of Atlantis in order to escape.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to do that, he needed a large drawing paper and a pencil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me! You shouldn\u2019t be here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A nurse came running over after finding Tae-hyuk snooping in front of the operating room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put on as innocent an expression as possible and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Noonim. I\u2019m sorry. Do you have any pencil and paper?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN-Noonim... Are you the patient from Room 207? I understand. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can it be as big as possible?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The nurse blushed and nodded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He went back to his room and waited. The nurse came back with drawing paper and a pencil after 10 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-Is this okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you Noonim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bowed his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The nurse smiled and sat on a chair in the corner of the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if it was a back alley hospital, he was someone wealthy enough to be admitted to a single room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, he had a fairly handsome face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems like drawing is your hobby.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I was in the art department at school. I was bored lying in bed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people chatted for a while.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The nurse looked back just as she was about to leave the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can I come again next time to talk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like he had become more popular.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then shall I begin?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used Spying to scan the whole hospital.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used the range expanding attribute that could only be used once a day and started to draw the place using the automatic function of Forgery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now that he was fully accustomed to the skill, he could complete it easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hospital consisted of three levels.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">While looking around, he had felt the unique atmosphere of an old building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It really seemed like there would be secret rooms hidden somewhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes shone as he looked at the blueprint.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was something that only Tae-hyuk could obtain with his crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere really are hidden rooms.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There weren\u2019t just only one or two rooms, but three.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWasn\u2019t this built by the Japanese?

Do you know what I mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! Hunminjeongeum?\u201d (Google Link. Hyun-ho is probably referring to the 28 letters of hangul, the Korean alphabet that was created)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"And words are created. In the end, this sentence points to King Sejong. And the next words are bank, learning and Confucian scholar. That means Sungkyunkwan University.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhh...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The sentence itself is roughly a middle school grade inscription pun. The important thing is that at least three or more words per paragraph point to the same thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-That's right. Then the bomb is hidden at Sungkyunkwan University? Do you know the exact position?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The university was incredibly large.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, it wasn\u2019t in one place but spread across various regions.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was the humanities and social sciences campus of Sungkyunkwan University in Myeongyun-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The natural sciences campus was in Suwon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it was the latter, then it would be hard to cope with the problem from Seoul.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They needed to know the exact location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a word in the middle of the sentence \u2018the wind blows, the tree blossoms in spring.\u2019 It looks to be pointing to a tree, but it is actually talking about the blue dragon. Among the five attributes, blue means wood, spring and wind. And as a symbol of Sungkyunkwan University\u2019s bank is a blue dragon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik\u2019s eyes widened at Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s tremendous reasoning power.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A police officer heard it and asked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But isn\u2019t that also referring to Sungkyunkwan University? So there is no change.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The blue dragon clearly meant Sungkyunkwan University, but there was something different.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, we can also see it like that. But to be precise, it is the symbol of Sungkyunkwan University\u2019s bank. There is a legend related to the blue dragon. Therefore, it is considered symbolic to have a blue dragon statue. It is a symbol but isn\u2019t a symbol, but that isn\u2019t what it means. The place with a blue dragon statue. The bomb will obviously be there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-Where is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wait a moment. I don\u2019t know everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho laughed and pulled out his smartphone to look it up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It took 10 seconds for the information to appear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have sent the exact location to your phone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik saw the result of the search on his phone and issued orders in a loud voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Call the Myeongnyun personnel right now! The bomb is in the blue dragon statue at the front gate!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was ready to move.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">By the way, he couldn\u2019t see Joo Hyun-ho, who usually followed him like a puppy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Hyun-ho. You\u2019re not following.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho had taken off his coat and was sitting in a corner with the tape recorder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, Sunbae. I think I have to take individual action this time. I want to try an analysis of the tape.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk nodded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unlike himself, who specialized in jumping in, Hyun-ho was an expert in analyzing the opponent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had to do what they did best.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll let you know if there is anything else. I\u2019ll call you on your phone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, yes. Please do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police moved in search of the bomb.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Everybody, please evacuate according to the instructions!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hundreds of police officers came to Sungkyunkwan University.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a frenzy among the university students walking around the school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What? Evacuation? A-All of a sudden...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is this some type of army reservist training?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then armed police rushed through the hall and told the students.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is real. Please evacuate now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha... What, is this a war?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is similar. I can\u2019t tell you anything else. Please hurry up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Yes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how weak the public perception, the dignity of the uniformed police officers was enormous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no student who resisted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although it was a little cluttered, the evacuation was carried out without any problems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, now, there is no need to shove. Please stand in a row over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reservists who shone at this time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Using their experience in evacuation training that they received in the army, the reservists took action and led the other students.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk sighed with relief as he watched the scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026No students will be damaged. It is fortunate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually in movies, the people in the area would be evacuated if there was a bomb threat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">By the way, an explosion would occur even before the time limit was reached.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Did this bomber have some conscience remaining?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, due to Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s reasoning, there were still 10 minutes until the scheduled explosion.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was enough to deal with the bomb.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He hoped that there would be no damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the SWAT team started approaching the blue dragon statue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is a bomb!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All he had to do was catch the criminal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would leave the bomb to the professionals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik looked at the SWAT team with an expression of trust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can you do it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. We are professionals. Leave it to us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a bomb was found in movies, there were often wires that needed to be cut.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, that was only to increase the tension.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In fact, if a bomb was found, it was to be put in a state where it couldn\u2019t explode with liquid nitrogen or shock absorbers, then moved to another place to be handled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That\u2019s why they were called the disposal squad, not the disassembly squad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, Inspector! This bomb has no primer!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? It is a seedless watermelon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fuck, again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik spat on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bomb installed here was the same as the one delivered to the police station.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a bomb that had the power to destroy a whole building if it exploded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the primer had been removed, as if the bomber was teasing them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like an armed demonstration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik approached the SWAT team leader and asked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is there a tape recorder?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please wait a moment. Is there perhaps a tape recorder in the box?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? There is!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The SWAT team leader pointed at the tape recorder that was where the primer should be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the same as the bomb delivered to the station. It would be best to listen to the contents of the tape recorder at once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik handed it over to Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Should Detective Cho listen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, you want to listen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was burdensome but everyone knew about Kang-suk\u2019s achievements, so the SWAT team leader gave it up to Kang-suk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The SWAT team leader carefully pressed the switch of the recorder.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-By listening to this message, you have found the safe bomb.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Isn\u2019t the tutorial fun?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people who were listening spat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He mobilized hundreds of police for what?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Practice?</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-I showed you this much to make you realize that I\u2019m not joking.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then I\u2019ll give you the next mission.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">This time it is real so you better hurry.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t training anymore.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik instructed Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tell Joo Hyun-ho to come here right now.

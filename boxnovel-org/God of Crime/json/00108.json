The security is based on fear of their lives. The Chinese criminals are eligible.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now Tae-hyuk knew why the warden was acting so strangely in regards to the Park Sung-yul case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He didn\u2019t want the detectives to find out this information.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Drugs were being harvested from seven farms.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Obviously, they would use the connections with numerous criminals to trade it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The warden was trying to prevent it from being exposed, at the expense of Park Sung-yul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'His expression at the time meant this.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The missing pieces of the puzzle were slowly being found, but not all of the problems were completely solved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The warden is using the Chinese inmates to grow drugs. What\u2019s going on with the Japanese prisoners then?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Perhaps there were other crimes besides drug trafficking in the Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After a few days of searching, Tae-hyuk found the place where the Japanese army buried their gold.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As if it was a joke of fate, the drugs were growing on top of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk muttered quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I call the police using the name Phantom and uncover the drug farm, the warden can be sent to jail. But what\u2019s the fun in that? Besides, I still have two weeks left,so it\u2019s best if I can handle both the Park Sung-yul and the drug cases at once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He came up with a perfect plan to solve both cases simultaneously.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyway, I\u2019ll have to talk to Shin Chang-ho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been almost two weeks since Phantom left for Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was organizing the files of the victims killed by Park Sung-yul at the Central Investigation Headquarters.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were dark circles under the eyes of Joo Hyun-ho, who was sitting opposite of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was in charge of several additional cases and was unable to leave for a few days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is still no contact from Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. I would like it if he gives one or two pieces of useful information.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Doesn\u2019t he have to get in touch with you first?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Then there will be something big later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha! Big? Sunbae, that word is always associated with Phantom now. Won\u2019t there be some big corruption?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey! Don\u2019t say that!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Dururu-</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, Kang-suk\u2019s phone on the table started to ring.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho wanted to know who was calling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I'm sorry. It\u2019s just a little brother I know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Hyun-ho dropped his head and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ahh, Phantom... Why isn\u2019t Phantom...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk ignored the grouchy Hyun-ho and answered the call.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a call from Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Kang-suk hyung, it\u2019s been a while.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yeah, have you been studying well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Ah, I\u2019m studying hard at my\u00a0one month short-term studying\u00a0course.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Anyways, Noona asked me to tell you that she was thankful for the food last week.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha-ran... She should tell me something like that directly. Um.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s sister, Seo Ha-ran, was staying in a dormitory academy on weekdays and only returned home on the weekends.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, both of Ha-ran\u2019s younger brothers were away from home.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was uneasy about Ha-ran being left at home alone, so he went and met her every week, bringing along her favorite foods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I can feel comfortable about her safety thanks to Hyung.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Thank you.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is this? I didn\u2019t do anything. And thanks to this, I get to have a date with Ha-ran every weekend... Huhu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Then please look after her for the last two remaining weeks as well.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. Study hard and don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk smiled and hung up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Hyun-ho, who was listening to the call, said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess that is Sister-in-law\u2019s younger brother?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey! How many times have I said that she isn\u2019t your sister-in-law? Hup hup. He is very good at studying, so a foundation sent him to a program abroad. Thanks to him, I have a date with Ha-ran every weekend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So that\u2019s why you disappear every weekend. Don\u2019t you feel sorry for me, who has to work the night shift every weekend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Okay, I understand. Do you want to go for dinner this evening? At any rate, don\u2019t I have to work hard so that my little brother isn\u2019t ashamed? We\u2019ll have a break at the end. Let\u2019s get back to work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk scratched his head and turned his attention back to the papers piled on the desk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are so many reports that I have to write. Ah, yes. I have to go to the aquarium this weekend with Ha-ran. Doesn\u2019t she like dolphins?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The piled up fatigue disappeared as he imagined her happiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The next puzzle should be this one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul was very happy about his game with Cho Kang-suk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even he struggled to solve some of the puzzles created in his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were still 10 puzzles remaining.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How long could he enjoy this in the future?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just imagining it caused a smile to form on his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be interesting to watch the detective be perplexed by his gifts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the more expensive and delicious the food, the more slowly he needed to eat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhuhuhu... Detective, you should be my best rival, like how the Joker is the foil to the Batman.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These thoughts gave Park Sung-yul the greatest pleasure, and before he knew it, Park Sung-yul realized that he had a strong erection.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like he was the protagonist of a movie.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The thought of being more special than everyone else stimulated him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul realized that he was transformed when killing someone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But now, the confrontation with Cho Kang-suk was the only way to relive his desires.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhuhu... Then I\u2019ll give you the best puzzle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He smiled and took out the sketchbook kept under his bed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a strange poem that couldn\u2019t be easily interpreted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he sent this along with the letter, what would be Cho Kang-suk\u2019s expression?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first puzzle was a tutorial.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The difficulty was easy and it was simple to deduce the elementary school where he went.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But now it was different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had spent a month preparing the best puzzle, and it absolutely wouldn\u2019t be easy to solve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Detective Cho Kang-suk... I think about you all day - \u00a0is this love? If so, I definitely love you. Ohuhu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul\u2019s twisted affection exploded towards the detective who had caught him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if only three people gathered together, there had to be a leader among them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same with the inmates in the prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If someone asked for the name for the leader of the Korean inmates, everybody would recall the same face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho, part of one of the three major crime organizations in South Korea, \u2018Gallery.\u2019\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a human beast with a stocky, large body, giving him the nickname \u2018Brown Bear\u2019.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The reason why he was imprisoned despite his power was simple: the boss was in danger of being caught by an enemy\u2019s trap.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In return, Shin Chang-ho was promised the number three position in the organization after his release.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was already three years ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After four years, he would return to the ranks of Gallery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In Blue Dragon Prison, there were several inmates belonging to Gallery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He told them that he would be a high ranking official in Gallery after his release.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No one was able to ignore Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I just need to think of it as a long vacation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho made full use of the one hour of exercise time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t because he wanted to show off a strong look to the other inmates, it was just that exercising was part of his life.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Around Shin Chang-ho, some criminals from Gallery guarded him with menacing glares.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were like bodyguards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, someone approached Shin Chang-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A bodyguard threatening him with a scary voice,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who is approaching?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho received a towel from another bodyguard and wiped the sweat from his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He confidently looked at the person approaching.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A half shaved head and a rotten face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the newcomer who became well-known in the prison in only two weeks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tobacco Seller Newbie, what do you want from me? I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t smoke.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shin Chang-ho. I have something to suggest to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bodyguards growled at the newcomer,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis bastard...! Do you know who you are talking to?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You guys should know better than me. Shin Chang-ho, 37 years old. The boss of Gallery is known to have raised him, but he is actually from a small orphanage in Seoul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Shin Chang-ho\u2019s lips twitched.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t say a lot, only a few people in Gallery knew this information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...How did you know?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The method doesn't matter. Let\u2019s just focus on what we each need.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh. It sounds like the newbie has something I want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. You have a sister that is two years younger than you named is Shin Seo-yeon. Of course, you aren\u2019t actually siblings. You were just in the same orphanage. However, once you left the orphanage together, it was like you were brother and sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How did the newbie know about Seo-yeon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe hid herself after you went to jail. Don\u2019t you want to know where she is now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho glared at the other person for a moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Newbie. Who the hell are you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know? Why she had to disappear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I want to know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I will tell you if you give me what I want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed as he looked at the puzzle piece that could solve both the Park Sung-yul and drug cases at the same time.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, today is the special meal day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were grilled ribs on Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s plate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a meal that only appeared twice a year.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho picked up the meat with a spoon and placed it on the plate of the man who was slobbering.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cG-Giving this to me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m not hungry right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHah... But it is grilled ribs. Well, if you are giving it to me then I will eat it well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He moved the spoon and started eating at a tremendous rate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho chuckled in a low voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The ribs were so thick that it felt like chewing roots.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, this was still a luxurious dish in prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he would soon be able to get out of here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yes, this evening he would eat sirloin!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His smile stretched from ear to ear at the thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he looked at the clock, it was time for the afternoon work.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He went to the restroom, shaved neatly, and put on the cleanest clothes he had.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After grabbing the detergent and a few camouflage tools, he was ready for the escape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As today was visitation day, so the number of guards overseeing the work was much less than usual.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho could roam around more freely compared to other inmates so that he could keep an eye on Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who would think I would use it for escaping?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho muttered and headed to the place where he promised to meet Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were already people waiting when he arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. I was a little late preparing some things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It is hard to keep the promised time in prison. You don\u2019t have watch or a phone to check.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho felt some doubts as he answered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how he looked at it, Phantom... He seemed strangely familiar with prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Surely he hadn\u2019t been a prisoner?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Aish, it couldn\u2019t be.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom had the abilities to avoid getting captured by the police.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then show me what you brought.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Here it is.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho pulled out a bottle of water.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It looked like paint had been released into the water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung asked in a trembling voice after seeing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I have to drink this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom can change his face, but that won\u2019t help us get out of here. You don\u2019t have to drink if you don\u2019t want to leave.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho wasn\u2019t interested in Kim Tae-sung and looked at Phantom instead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but can I check the face? Oh, I don\u2019t doubt your abilities. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to make sure?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Just wait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk changed his voice and face to the guard that he had targeted during lunch time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard was someone who treated Kim Byung-gun as his\u00a0master.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow is it? Is it the same?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh, oh my god... I wouldn\u2019t have believed it if I hadn\u2019t seen it with my own eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an amazing ability, no matter how many times Yoo Cheol-ho saw it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He touched the face, but the texture was correct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But it is hard to get out of here just with a guard. At the very least, the doctor\u2019s medical certificate and the warden\u2019s permission...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a piece of paper and showed it to Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...White paper?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"For now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he moved his palm over the paper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had clearly been a blank piece of white paper, but now there were words written on it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a medical certificate stamped with the seal of the doctor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We will leave on the ship today. And if the person in charge tries to check, I will copy the warden\u2019s voice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow, wow, it is perfect!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho looked at Phantom with respect.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho only gave a brief overview of the operation, but Phantom was able to see through it and prepare a step further.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is your expertise, so you can check it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Wasn\u2019t this clearly blank just now? But how...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed more real than the real one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s review the plan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s eyes were shining with the hope of getting out of here soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A transport ship for visitors was docked at the port.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was strictly managed as a ship for visitors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard in charge of the ship raised his hand as a familiar face approached.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a guard in uniform.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kim Sang-jin sunbae? Who are these prisoners?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, two people suddenly had epileptic seizures, so they are being sent to the hospital for treatment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see. They are clearly suffering. Is that foaming I see at their mouths? Their eyes are also completely unfocused. This is truly...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard clicked his tongue.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk prepared to board the ship with the prisoners who were tied up together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the guard asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but I didn\u2019t hear about this in advance. Can you show me the official document and medical certificate? Ah, I\u2019m not doubting Sunbae, but I will be punished if I ignore official procedures.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk extended some papers to the guard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard, who thought his senior was about to scold him, sighed with relief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you want me to call the warden?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, the warden is busy. This is okay. Two prisoners suddenly having epileptic seizures... If there was one more, then wouldn\u2019t it be a complete curse? They came in separately, but will leave together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that so? Haha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put the two people in the prisoners quarters of the ship and locked the door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After some time, people started to board the ship.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were civilians returning from their visits.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, four extra guards boarded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time of departure, one of the guards started checking the passengers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh? These people are?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I allowed them on. They are being transported by Kim Sang-jin sunbae. I also got confirmation from the warden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is awkward to have prisoners in proximity of the guests. Make sure the civilians are unaware of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then tell the captain to depart.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 31 civilians, four guards, three sailors, and two criminals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the boat carrying Phantom started to sail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the ship sailed without any problems, an incident occurred.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho and Kim Tae-sung, who had been locked inside, suddenly slipped out with hoods covering their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho shouted,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This ship has been hijacked!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The atmosphere wasn\u2019t clear so the passengers left their rooms to look.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"F-Fight?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What just happened?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then someone discovered Phantom carrying a gun and screamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaaack! G-Gun...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I won\u2019t do anything so please don\u2019t shoot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was currently Phantom wearing the opera mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He entered the steering room and told the sailors inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you follow my commands, then no one will be hurt! All of the ship\u2019s crew members and guards will gather in one place!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was broadcasted all over the ship.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The scattered guards panicked at the sudden incident.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They didn\u2019t think that Phantom had been hiding among the civilians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cS-Sunbae. A gun. Phantom is armed with a gun...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know! Fuck, he looked like a nice guy on TV. Hijacking a ship...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A white mask appeared before the two people who were talking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who is the cool criminal? He is just a criminal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP-Phantom!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are armed with taser guns. It is a weapon that can be used against unarmed people. But I have this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He aimed the gun towards the guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-Hik!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a bit cliche but it is fun. Hands up! If you move then I will shoot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom easily defeated the guards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He gathered the passengers, guards and sailors in the middle of the boat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, everybody is here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-What are you going to do with us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cS-Spare me...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you listen to what I say then no one will get hurt. I guarantee it in the name of Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The passengers inwardly sighed with relief.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the guards were different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If someone had to die then it would clearly be one of the guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everybody on board was gathered here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there was someone missing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"S-Sang-jin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They started to look for Kim Sang-jin who was responsible for transporting the prisoners.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two hooded people were clearly the prisoners...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One guard asked with a despairing expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom turned towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, Kim Sang-jin? I'm sorry, but I threw him into the sea for trying to rebel. Right now, fish are probably feasting on him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN-No!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, right now the real Kim Sang-jin was eating chicken and drinking cold beer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was forbidden to drink alcohol on the job, but sometimes it was necessary to survive on the island.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guards on the ship didn\u2019t know this and were in shock.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They decided to follow Phantom\u2019s words and didn\u2019t rebel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho followed him around like a dog chasing after its owner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom. I\u2019ve tied everyone up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Good job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the captain tied to the pole with the navigator shouted,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Release us! If the ship continues this way then it will be completely off route!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but I will be deciding the route from now on. By the time we arrive at the port, then the police will already be there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Then...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will steer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho asked him,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can you steer a ship?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I've never done it before, but I\u2019m sure I can do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"As expected from Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had the Vehicle Theft skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It allowed him to steal anything with an engine and drive it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk left the hostages to Yoo Cheol-ho and went to the steering room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ship had followed the currents and was floating aimlessly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung was unfamiliar with this situation and asked with an anxious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The engine is off. Is it okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The ship is mine now. Can\u2019t I freely control it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Crime skill: Vehicle Theft has been triggered.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-This ship is now yours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was one drawback to the Vehicle Theft skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was that an embarrassing remark needed to be said to trigger it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? What did you just say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I just felt like I needed to say those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, Tae-hyuk stole the ship and headed somewhere else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a frenzy at the port once the scheduled ship didn\u2019t arrive.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The radio in the steering room started making loud sounds, so Tae-hyuk completely cut off the line.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the maritime police were dispatched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the three criminals had already fled after abandoning the ship at another port.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It worked like a charm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Vehicle Theft wasn\u2019t just about stealing the vehicle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After stealing the car, the person had to escape and avoid being detected by the police.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, there were two attributes attached to Vehicle Theft.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'One attribute can temporarily camouflage the stolen vehicle and the other one will boost the speed. With this, I would be able to escape from an army.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used 20 points to raise these two attributes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In no time, he only had 30 affinity points left.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The points were difficult to earn, but he used them so quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'But it is worth learning them if I can arrive safely, so I won\u2019t begrudge it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho kissed the ground after succeeding in the prison break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hahaha! Freedom! I am free!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You look like someone who has been locked up for 30 years.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! I am just happy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung looked around blankly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t seem to believe that he had escaped from jail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho moved first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He approached Phantom and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hehe, Phantom. Isn\u2019t it a shame to split up here? This is now a relationship. Shall we continue working as a team in the future? With my brains and Phantom\u2019s abilities, we will be able to eat up South Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled at Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, he still had to take care of this guy.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

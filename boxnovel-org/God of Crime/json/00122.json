It is Semon. I brought what we spoke about.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon walked into the office and spoke like a butler.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The weather is quite cold. If you keep the windows open like this then you will catch a cold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros had long silver hair that completely covered his shoulders.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he felt a cold touch at his fingertips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems to me like the wind is coming from South Korea. I want to see what it feels like.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon answered with a big sigh,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Open your eyes. Stay still for a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like I am still a young child in your eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But Kataros closed his eyes and let Semon work.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Semon brushed at Kataros\u2019 shoulders with careful gestures, like he was handling a delicate piece of glass.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he placed the materials he was holding on Kataros\u2019 table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hum hum. By the way, it seems like Boss really likes Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBeing Arsene Lupin was the dream of any child who watched him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Did I hear that correctly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It\u2019s a joke. I just feel like I need this person\u2019s abilities in order to survive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon looked at his boss with a strangely grim expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In his eyes, the boss\u2019s dazzling silver hair shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros started to read the neatly arranged data about Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mister did a better job than I thought.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon nodded as he heard the name of the spy he planted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I wasn\u2019t expecting Mister to become so close to Phantom. It seems to truly be god\u2019s work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom. The more I see, the more I like. He really has unpredictable abilities. He managed to defeat the fully armed Big Brother. He even used the press and government freely. In addition, he has a strange magic that can change his voice and face. It is like he is the second coming of Lupin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon smiled and remained silent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. By the way, look at this. Phantom was also involved in the collapse of Blue Dragon Prison?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a well-known place for Kataros.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was one of the four prisons modelled after Alcatraz.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Inside the Blue Dragon Prison, the Japanese Yakuza and Chinese Triads were each working in their own interests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros looked at Semon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Semon was looking back like a parent gazing at their child.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How much information does Mister have?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is watching out for the mafia in South Korea. It will be easy for him to act as a spy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat would you like to do? Should I instruct him to move more aggressively?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, just watch him for now. There is a possibility that Phantom will confront the Triads and the Yakuza.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think I know what Boss wants.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It means we might be able to cooperate to face the same enemy. Tell Mister to keep an eye on Phantom. If Phantom is the enemy of the Yakuza and Triads...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros looked down at the photograph of Phantom with grey eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I will go and meet him directly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been thinking about the proposal since the Christmas he spent with her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk went on a date and then suddenly volunteered at the orphanage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even the good girls in dramas would frown at that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Ha-ran smiled brightly and thanked him for introducing her to the cute children.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that moment, Cho Kang-suk once again set his heart on Seo Ha-ran.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the direct decision was made after the Park Sung-yul case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh Hyung! It isn\u2019t ready yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh. Originally beef should be cooked like the meat is alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't just eat meat, have vegetables as well. Oh, Kang-suk shouldn\u2019t just watch. I\u2019ll make a wrap for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran started putting all sorts of delicious things into a lettuce wrap.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The finished product was larger than expected.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the size of Kang-suk\u2019s fist, a size that was impossible to eat in one bite.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Kang-suk wasn\u2019t the type of person to give up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After clearing his throat a few times, he opened his mouth widely and put the lettuce wrap in.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He leisurely tasted it and said it was delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk and Tae-min started clapping from where they were sitting on the sidelines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wah. He ate it in one bite.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is almost an art form.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Ha-ran\u2019s eyes widened and she said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOmo, I\u2019m sorry. I made it too big.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After that small incident, Tae-min started to grill the meat with tongs and scissors.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A few pieces of meat were on top of the hotplate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had already eaten meat, rice and cold noodles so their chopsticks were slowing down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this wasn\u2019t the end for Kang-suk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He spoke with a dignified tone, like a commanding officer speaking to soldiers who were about to go fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We can\u2019t eat this much at our age. This won\u2019t work. Auntie! Add four more servings here please!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Both Tae-hyuk and Tae-min raised their thumbs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was always more room in their stomachs for meat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The eyes of the warriors started to burn at the appearance of a new enemy.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhh! Game two!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I loosened my belt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk made a fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let\u2019s eat until we die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUgh! Ugh! Ugh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the four people ate 12 servings of beef and literally collapsed to the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even breathing was painful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh... I think I will die...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t think I can eat anything for the next week...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran, the only one who seemed fine, held out a tray with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Does anyone want to drink tea for dessert?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk and Tae-min, who were lying on the floor, lifted their tremblings hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk smiled happily at the sight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His job wasn\u2019t just catching criminals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For a while, he had forgotten the reason why he had become a police officer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Ha-ran.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I love you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s face turned bright red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO-Oh my... Kang-suk really... It is foul to say it in a place like this!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to protect that smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are they tired since it has been a long time? It will take some time to get home. They are already sleeping.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran and Tae-min were sleeping in the back seats.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled from where he was sitting in the passenger seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So where do you plan to do the ceremony? You know that you can\u2019t do it by yourself like this time right? I\u2019m looking forward to helping you organize the best wedding.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm hmm. Was it better to make it a bit more romantic?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah. Did you only realize that now? Aigoo... I really want to ask you again to cancel it. Well, Noona didn\u2019t dislike it so I will let it go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk cried out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t act like a mother-in-law!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! Kang-suk hyung! Focus on driving! There might be an accident.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I only just bought a car but I have driven many police cars.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk watched Kang-suk bang his chest with a confident expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">On the road, the only light source was from the car\u2019s headlights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked out the windshield and thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t been revealed what fate had changed due to Kang-suk\u2019s decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I need to find out why.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the future, he would need to gain a large amount of affinity points to fight the mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, he had to figure out the exact mechanism behind gaining them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018First of all, I should compare the blacklist members with different tendencies. Then should I catch another person to check their affinity points?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had fought the killer Big Brother, sent by the Triads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used Damage to Both Sides to destroy him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk was able to gain eight affinity points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant that he could gain points by catching criminals that weren\u2019t on the blacklist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apart from Big Brother, Tae-hyuk had dealt with a considerable number of criminals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, not all cases gave him affinity points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wondered what the difference was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The most likely hypothesis is that I can acquire affinity points by changing the determined destiny.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk knew a criminal that he could use to confirm this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Cho Min-hyuk!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the leader of the pseudo-religion, Sun, and had thousands of followers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he destroyed the religion then thousands of fates would surely change.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But it wouldn\u2019t be an easy fight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the first place, the scale itself was different compared to what he had done so far.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The leader committed all sorts of illegal acts but was never judged by the law.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nevertheless, Tae-hyuk had knowledge about Sun due to one of the top executives being imprisoned in Blue Dragon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He brainwashed his followers and tried to sell them abroad.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used an incense that made the people light-headed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Perhaps...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had encountered something similar.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the hypnotic incense used by Choi Sung-yeol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Before leaving Blue Dragon Prison, Tae-hyuk had gained all sorts of information from Choi Sung-yeol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Yakuza were behind the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then there were those who would use the hypnotic incense beside Choi Sung-yeol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026Maybe the Yakuza is behind Sun.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The chance of that wasn\u2019t zero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smirked wickedly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Whether he liked it or not, he had to fight the mafia in order to win this game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he could gain points from changing fate then he would gain an enormous number by smashing Sun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Furthermore, the opponent was the criminal on the blacklist that was most likely to be associated with the mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I need to smash them even more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t have been able to fight them right after obtaining the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, now he was a Noble with various crime skills and connections.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sun, a religious cult with thousands of followers in South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were Tae-hyuk\u2019s next target.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

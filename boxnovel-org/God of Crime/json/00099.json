I didn\u2019t kill anyone. I\u2019m innocent and was wrongfully locked up in prison.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you think I was such a monster? If so, you are mistaken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk stared at Park Sung-yul with an absurd expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he was a rookie then he would be confused if he encountered such an opponent, and wouldn\u2019t be able to interrogate him properly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But now he was a detective who caught many horrible criminals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t show any panic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he did then he would be playing right into Park Sung-yul\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk instantly returned to his usual calm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that so? By the way, have you eaten lunch yet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul\u2019s mouth twitched at the calm answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I knew you were coming so late then I would\u2019ve eaten beforehand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You didn\u2019t eat while \u00a0you were waiting? Would you like jajangmyeon to be delivered? Oh, they don\u2019t deliver here. In other words, I\u2019ll have to ask the kitchen. Is ramyun okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It is good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then some ramyun please. Bring a pot with lots of water. There should be enough for three to five people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk called the guards and asked them to boil ramyun noodles.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After 10 minutes, three pots were delivered to the visitation room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you know? This ramyun is exactly to my tastes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems like it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul was hungry and isntantly emptied the pot full of noodles.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk asked as he ate the food,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Since you are so far away, I guess you don\u2019t have many people visiting?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if I was on land, no one would come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that so? Weren\u2019t you close to the daughter of your old boarding house landlord?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but I don\u2019t remember since it was so long ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. I understand. At any rate, tell me if you want more. I\u2019ll have them boil extra.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is okay, I\u2019m full.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since then, the detective and criminal talked like they were old friends.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk didn\u2019t ask anymore about Park Sung-yul\u2019s letter and soon, the one hour of visitation time was over.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk got up and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs there anything else to talk about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I had a great time meeting a person after a while. See you next time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Next time? Yes. Well, I\u2019ll see what happens first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes Detective, take care.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho, who was sitting at the table next to Kang-suk, also got up and gave a thumbs up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant that Kang-suk was as good of an interrogator as he said beforehand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk sighed slowly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This really didn\u2019t suit him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the interrogation, the detective and investigator talked about it in the waiting room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is it truly the boarding house?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think it is obvious from his reaction. By the way, your brain is very good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t even say it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two men had decided in advance what direction to take the conversation, based on Park Sung-yul\u2019s answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was well aware of what he was lacking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, he left the thinking to Joo Hyun-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After reading the letter from Park Sung-yul, Hyun-ho had investigated everything about him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In particular, he looked for any people who went missing in the vicinity of Park Sung-yul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one who caught Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s attention was the daughter of the landlord of a boarding house \u00a0where Park Sung-yul stayed for a while.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho read her profile and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Her age at the time of her disappearance is consistent. It was found that she had an argument with Park Sung-yul a few days before she went missing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then why was the incident buried when Park Sung-yul was arrested?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There was only circumstantial evidence, no physical ones. Furthermore, he had a decisive alibi.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time she went missing, Park Sung-yul was in China.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyway, I requested a DNA test so we should figure out the correct identity in a few days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This makes it more likely that Park Sung-yul\u2019s words are true. But why did he suddenly change his words?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m not sure what Park Sung-yul is thinking. Besides, I think he also wanted to slip into the conversation that he killed the landlord\u2019s daughter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk quietly groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhem...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A criminal had confessed his sins in a letter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He threw clues one by one like puzzle pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe Park Sung-yul is enjoying playing with the police. In addition, the first puzzle was based on things about him. It feels like he gave us the easiest puzzle first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn. So now we have to wait until he throws us another puzzle?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are 12 people left...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It will never end this way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he didn\u2019t want to give up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want the 12 murders committed by Park Sung-yul to forever remain as hidden cases.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk discovered that Hyun-ho was making a strange expression, meaning that he had a secret plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you thinking?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho licked his lips and his eyes lit up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It looked like he was enjoying the puzzle made by Park Sung-yul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Park Sung-yul wants to play with us. Sunbae, do you know how to unconditionally win in poker?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. Don\u2019t you win if you can read your opponent\u2019s face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...There is such a thing. Well, there is something simpler. There should be a spy to tell you the opponent\u2019s hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk realized what Joo Hyun-ho wanted: It was to have a spy monitor Park Sung-yul\u2019s movements in the Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk folded his arms and frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a little bit like cheating but... The method isn\u2019t bad. The problem is finding someone to spy on Park Sung-yul in Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was best to use a prisoner as a source of intelligence.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guards were considered public enemies by the monitored and controlled prisoners.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">So there was a strange sense of fellowship and they often exchanged stories in secret.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other prisons, there were people imprisoned for three to six months for misdemeanor crimes such as theft.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of them could be used as sources of information.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If they were discovered as a spy then their lives could be in danger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the ones who would be stuck in jail for a long time wouldn\u2019t act as spies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I think it will be fine if Hyung approaches them with the offer of reducing their sentence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk spoke in a strong tone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Absolutely not!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then do you have a good idea?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If we can\u2019t get it from the inside, can\u2019t we get it from the outside?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, imprison someone in Blue Dragon Prison who would act as their spy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh, that is good. It's definitely possible to do that if we get the permission of the warden. Ah right, no police. Criminals have a really sensitive smell towards the police.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If they are discovered as a spy then they might be lynched...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, it needed to be a person who wouldn\u2019t be unnatural in prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, in order to become familiar with other criminals, they needed a special crime that would grab attention.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Someone who looks like a criminal, has courage, and also has strength... I think a masked superhero would be needed to satisfy all the conditions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuoong... The right person...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk desperately thought about who could fit into the Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, someone popped into his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoof...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was nauseous as he entered the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A dark aura of death was pouring out from it. There was no need to activate the Spying skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As he walked to the center, something stuck to his shoes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When he checked his foot, he saw something like crushed meat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was one of the two secret rooms in the basement of the hospital.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The place where the relics of the Japanese military would be somewhere that hadn\u2019t been touched for decades.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, this place showed evidence of being frequented by somebody.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026The result is a boom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt a cold chill like he was in a freezer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the plastic bags piled up in the middle of the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was something small in them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He brought his hand to a bag to see what it was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a strange illusion emerged in front of Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heok!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same as when he entered the bathroom that the hippo had killed in.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, unlike then, he didn\u2019t see anybody being killed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Instead, he heard a conversation.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-I need a liver.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">The shape can\u2019t be broken.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">You don\u2019t want finely chopped pieces?</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Yes, that's right.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Of course, all organs are extracted as they are.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">You don't have to be worry.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">If you wish then we can do a wholesale trade.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I would like to do it if the price is worth it.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Is 10 possible?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He figured out what they were trading.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the organs of the aborted fetuses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The words of Jung Eui-do momentarily popped into his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Our clinic does abortions up to 36 months.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had seen a similar sight not long ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">T Medical Centre had kidnapped children and extracted their organs for transplant surgery. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the purpose of the ones buying the fetuses here...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sheesh, I can\u2019t unsee this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bags were filled with the bodies of those who weren\u2019t born.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were piled up in a frozen warehouse like pig and cattle meat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk captured it all on camera.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once this was revealed, the media would become heated up for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk left the room and pulled out the blueprint in his back pocket.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the last remaining place was definitely where the Japanese army hid the treasure map.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know why it went unnoticed for decades.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The entrance was the bottom of an old well in the backyard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a passage to enter from the basement, but it seemed to have been covered over with concrete when a boiler room was made.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, it was either go down the well, or smash the concrete floor with a pickaxe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was one of the reasons why he left it for last.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Everybody in the building would come running if I use a pickaxe. I have to use the well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk walked towards the backyard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The well wasn\u2019t difficult to find.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t been used for a long time so there was a rusty chain around it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Weeds were growing around it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anyone who didn\u2019t know there was a well here would mistake it for someone\u2019s grave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk equipped the iron pipe using the Violence skill and struck the chain surrounding the well.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was rusty so the chain was removed more easily than he thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s go down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was completely dry or filled with water, the depths of the well looked like an abyss.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk held a flashlight in his mouth and climbed down.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After 10 meters, he reached the bottom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t it okay if I am a little noisy at this depth?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He placed the iron pipe between the pipes and put strength into it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The stones cracked and the well wall collapsed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The result was a passage leading somewhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk widened the hole so that his body could fit through and entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn. Rat pellets...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk rubbed the foreign matter on his hands against the wall and straightened his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a small space that was only one pyeong large.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Several wooden boxes were stacked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. These are canned foods.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t the one pull type that appeared these days, but cans that required a special opener.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bingo. This is a shelter created by the Japanese.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spat out some dust and started to search the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I found it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a small room, so he could easily find what he was looking for.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the document with joy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhuhu... I imagined something like a rolled parchment paper...

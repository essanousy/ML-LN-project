Then everything was manipulated...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik sighed as he listened to Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s report.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He never thought that a criminal organization would have planted a spy within the police.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like someone unseen was pointing a gun at his back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But you are truly amazing. How did you know that Lee Shi-hyun was lying? I was also tricked.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is because I am a genius.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then why are you broken by that Phantom bastard?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik\u2019s words caused Joo Hyun-ho to tremble.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had a showdown with Phantom over the bombs and was fully defeated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, isn\u2019t that the same for everyone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On that day, the police had been puppets dancing on the stage prepared by Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho had been so mentally wounded by the event that he couldn\u2019t eat properly for a while.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he had such an optimistic personality that his childhood nickname was Beagle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thanks to that, he recovered quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But Phantom is being surprisingly quiet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right. He hasn\u2019t appeared after the broadcast.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is a possibility that he might\u2019ve gone overseas.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpeaking of overseas... The place that Phantom blew up...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho was thinking about T Medical Centre that Phantom broke. </span><span style=\"\">They were in business with the Chinese mafia, the Triads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. The Chinese mafia.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik raised his finger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, there was a Red Mafia crime shortly after that incident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If Japan\u2019s Yakuza show up here, then all three forces will gather in Korea. If there is a fight against Phantom... If this continues, something huge will happen in Korea.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is our job to prevent it. I have obtained the complete cooperation from Incheon International Airport. I am worried.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, if Phantom shows back up then I will surely catch him this time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha... I wish that would happen. The pressure from above to catch Phantom is no joke right now. Have you gone to take a look at the Phantom of the Opera?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm... Why? I already know it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, you are the main investigator. Aren\u2019t you responsible for it now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then try to profile the people working at the police station. Make up some excuse for it. Perhaps a rough psychological counseling? Normally it would cost 100,000 won, but it would be nice if you offered it for free. Come to think of it, I don\u2019t think you have a psychologist license.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confused Joo Hyun-ho stuttered out,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-That is because I graduated from another course at university.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was good at profiling, but there were over 100 people working at this police station.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would take 50 hours to talk with them for 30 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why, don\u2019t you want to do it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho sighed,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it. It is true that a competent person is too busy to breathe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seems that it will be hard to go home from work on time for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, I found a trustworthy person so you just focus on the profiling.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUmm... I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik spoke confidently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time, he made sure that he selected a very competent appraiser.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, the new appraiser that Kim Do-shik selected was also a Red Mafia spy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it really okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do looked at the opera mask that Tae-hyuk was wearing with an uneasy expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI showed you my skills.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pointed to the Rubens hanging on the wall of the director\u2019s office.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Before fully embarking on the mission, he had copied the Rubens painting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he showed the final product to Kim Hyun-do.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although Kim Hyun-do had no professional knowledge, he had the experience of living and working with paintings all throughout his life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even though it is a fake, sometimes the fake can seem\u200b real.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do nodded quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s plan was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Red Mafia would once again send a spy as the appraiser, and the painting displayed here would unconditionally become authentic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After that, the Red Mafia would release their fakes onto the market.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Those who thought they bought the genuine one would flock to compare it to the Rubens painting on display at S University\u2019s museum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was what Tae-hyuk was aiming for: to paint his fake on top of the Red Mafia\u2019s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, there would be very small changes to the composition of brush strokes and oil paint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If the fake I made becomes real, then the Red Mafia\u2019s plan would be completely smashed.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said nothing as he looked at Kim Hyun-do.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Sometimes silence was more convincing than 100 words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. If you are able to thwart the Red Mafia\u2019s plan then I will cooperate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded with a satisfied expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to do that, he first had to recover the fake hanging in the museum.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Guards patrolled the museum 24 hours a day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if the security device was released using Kim Hyun-do\u2019s master key, he had to avoid being seen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the forgery of the Rubens painting that he had already drawn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well. You can hang that instead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is painted on drawing paper. Won\u2019t it be noticed when touched?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A security guard would know not to get close to the painting due to the security devices.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do nodded with a convinced expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The fake that Tae-hyuk was hard to distinguish from the original without touching it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guards couldn\u2019t get close so it was perfect to deceive them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard about the guard\u2019s patrol route so I will take care of that. Then exactly seven minutes later, turn off the security system for one minute. In the meantime, I will switch the paintings.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s plan progressed smoothly and he was able to obtain the fake made by the Red Mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do opened his mouth once he saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou succeeded. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t have a bad heart. If you did, all the museums in the country would be wiped out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I will start.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made his own studio in the director\u2019s office.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The estimated work time on the Demon Revealing Mirror was 120 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Forgery has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Analyzing the specified artwork.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[A forgery of \u2018Descent from the Cross\u2019.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-A craftsman with great skill has copied and painted Rubens \u2018Descent from the Cross.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The detailed information is hidden because the rating is too low.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Tools needed: Pigment, colour, soluble oil...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The opponent is someone who is superior to me in forgery. Perhaps even more than Big Mama... The Russian mafia has huge monsters.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk admired the opponent\u2019s skills, and couldn\u2019t help wondering who made this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If his rating was higher then would it be possible to know that information?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t even know the conditions to upgrade to a \u2018King\u2019.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the future, he would definitely have a confrontation with the mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The criminals on the blacklist were heinous criminals, but they were mainly just individuals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the mafia was a criminal group that boasted tremendous power.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A hint to become a \u2018king\u2019 might be hiding in the fight against them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once the crime skill was activated, Tae-hyuk\u2019s body started moving at a tremendous speed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh god... Is that the movement of a human?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do stared at Tae-hyuk with a blank expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s hands moved at a tremendous speed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there was no change in the painting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a great thing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was putting pigments on the painting but the place where his brush passed was still the same.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do wouldn\u2019t have believed it if he wasn\u2019t seeing it with his own eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom... You...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After two hours, Tae-hyuk looked at his work with a satisfied expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t touch the things that the Red Mafia\u2019s artist used to make it look like an old masterpiece.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the color of the Phantom was coming out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was now the work of Phantom instead of the Red Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Demon Revealing Mirror popped up in front of Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[A great work of art has been completed.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Dexterity has increased by 1.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You have exceeded the 100% limit and a new attribute is born.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Hawk Eyes attribute can be learnt.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hawk Eyes?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like something new had been added to the attributes that formerly could only be raised by affinity points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When he checked, the Spying skill was shining.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hawk Eyes]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Able to see the abilities of the specified target in detail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-If the other person is using a pseudonym then you can confirm their true name.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Necessary affinity points required: 10 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Hawk Eyes attribute could increase the number of details that he saw.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he learned it, then the uses for it were endless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Is this DLC (downloadable content)... Shouldn\u2019t a great ability like this be the default? By the way, I didn\u2019t know that Forgery would strengthen Spying.

Now a new Spying added. What the hell is the criteria?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As Phantom stared into the air for a while, Kim Hyun-do asked in a quivering voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-Is it completed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.

Her mother is also at the hospital for treatment.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She said that her father only came home around once a week.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He understood why the two people weren\u2019t visible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the problem was her older sister.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Runaway...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quietly looked at An Eun-young\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She talked casually, but he could see the deep darkness within her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEun-jeong unni doesn\u2019t get along with my father. She isn\u2019t interested in studying, and goes out to play every day. Therefore, he forced her to enter a boarding school. That was the beginning of the incident.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sensed something and asked in a small voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did your sister go to L high school?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It is a prestigious school with a high placement rate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnd your sister is 25 years old this year?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-that\u2019s right. How did you know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk closed his mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t thought there would be a relationship like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had memories of the next 14 years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of his memories were about criminals and the prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then there was the moment when he was about to receive the death penalty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the day before the death penalty.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that time, he had met something that wasn\u2019t human.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had gaping holes for eyes and a mouth that was ripped up to the ears.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Whenever it laughed, red blood dripped down its\u00a0face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t know who\u00a0it was.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He just remembered that he had made a deal with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It\u00a0had talked about the deaths of Ha-ran and Tae-min.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-min had become a lawyer to save Tae-hyuk, but he struggled to find evidence until the end, where he was murdered and sunk under the sea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Ha-ran was fired after it became known that her brother was a murderer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had become involved in a multi-level marketing scheme with a friend.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The result was her ruin.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She lost everything and committed suicide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the future that Tae-hyuk remembered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The reason he didn\u2019t want to be reminded of this was because the multi-level marketing scheme had caused the destruction of Ha-ran.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran was 25 years old this year, and she also went to L high school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was all of this simply a coincidence?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a scary expression without saying anything, causing An Eun-young to wave her hands in front of his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, sorry I was thinking of something else. Continue the story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said with a casual expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY-Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young resumed the explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her sister Eun-jeong thought of the school as a prison and went outside to play everyday.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she met the leader of a bad group and they fell in love.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Unni left a letter saying she was sorry and vanished. She even took all of the gifts at home. Dad went crazy and removed Unni from the family register. It was the first time I\u2019ve seen Dad so mad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But how did you learn that she was involved in a multi-level scheme?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm, that was a few days ago. I was coming home and a man on a motorcycle came with a note for An Eun-jeong\u2019s little sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you see the man\u2019s face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young shook her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He was wearing a helmet. This is the note.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took the piece of paper that An Eun-young gave him and confirmed the contents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'An Eun-jeong is in danger of falling into a multi-level scheme. Tiwai International.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was suspicious, no matter how he looked at it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you tell your father?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo... He tore it up as soon as I give it to him...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had a strange feeling when he looked at An Eun-young, who didn\u2019t care about her own safety.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She believed in herself more than her parents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt like he was chewing a mouthful of sand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe this is better left to the police.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s hands started shaking at Tae-hyuk\u2019s firm answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">T-that's right... S-Sorry. I-I just wanted to consult with Tae-hyuk so, don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to be a burden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt a knot in his chest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was it possible to end it this way?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A multi-level company was a seemingly legitimate business with no problems showing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If there was a report to the police, then they would say that it was wrong.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What would happen if a full-fledged investigation was started? There would be little difference.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A few people in charge would be sent to prison, but they certainly couldn\u2019t get a hold of everyone in the multi-level scheme.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They would just move on to another company with a different name and sign.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sighed slowly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Yes. This is the deal. If An Eun-jeong is really Noona\u2019s friend, then I will plunge into this case. If there isn\u2019t a connection, then I will consult Kang-suk hyung.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out his phone to send a message to Ha-ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Noona.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Did you have a friend called An Eun-jeong in high school?</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Beep.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He pressed the Send button.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What answer would come back?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">30 seconds passed before there was a reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Yes.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Noona\u2019s friend.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">It has already been a few years since I\u2019ve met her.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Did she contact you on my old phone?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Tell her to call me.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk's mouth trembled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As expected, Ha-ran and An Eun-jeong were friends.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong had drawn Ha-ran into the multi-level company world.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he helped An Eun-jeong now, then he could shatter the future of Seo Ha-ran, who fell into ruin due to the multi-level marketing scheme.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at An Eun-young, who seemed like she was about to cry.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What if he suddenly changed his mind and said he would help?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Oh. Wait. There is that method!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk was reminded of a game that could be called a man\u2019s romance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eun-young, I\u2019m bored. Do you want to play Rock Paper Scissors? If you win, then I\u2019ll help you with this case. Instead, if I win, help me with my newly developed magic...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young turned red with anger and threw out her hand to play Rock Paper Scissors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk, who was trying to lose intentionally by using the \u2018Gambling\u2019 skill, felt like crying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the door of truth that he never wanted to see!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTiwai International... \u00a0it\u2019s a multi-level company that was created 10 years ago, and will continue to operate for the next 14 years.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk muttered as he looked up at the 15 story building in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This building was all Tiwai International.</span><span style=\"\">Usually, a multi-level company had around 1,000 members, and had billions of won in assets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That\u2019s why it had such a great building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At least 10 times... No, more than 100 times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a cardinal rule. If you don\u2019t make other people your co-worker, then don\u2019t bother going out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe they were half trapped in the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It isn\u2019t a building but a dungeon.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The inside was illegally modified like a maze. People wouldn\u2019t be able to get out fully without knowing the way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, he came to look at the situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But it seemed like he had to prepare properly before entering.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There are janitors and security guards going in and out.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk suddenly came up with a good plan to infiltrate Tiwai International.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would pose as a janitor to go inside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to do that, he needed clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is when the Internet marketplace is useful. Let's see... The janitor uniform...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the old days, his guard uniform was commissioned from a uniform company.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It took a lot of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Compared to that, Internet deals were easy and quick.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A secondhand store selling janitor uniforms that boasted five million members caught his attention.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018... Should I trade with Wang Grandmother Uniforms? It has a truly unique flavour.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He travelled a few stops on the subway in order to make a direct deal with the person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made the right deal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After 30 minutes, he was able to get his hands on exactly what he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Then I\u2019ll change in the toilets.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He dressed as a janitor in the subway toilets and made his head damp with water.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used cream to appear haggard and now looked like a janitor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he went back to the entrance of the building where he was stopped by a security guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used Voice Modulation to sound older.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kim-ssi\u2019s body isn\u2019t good so I came to replace him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard looked Tae-hyuk up and down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. I didn\u2019t hear about such a thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That\u2019s why I came to tell you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, is that so? Then go in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, keep up the good work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a building of this size, there were at least 10 janitors going in and out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At least one of them would have a surname of Kim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shrugged and entered the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The beginning is good. The problem is where to find An Eun-jeong.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The building appeared to have many rooms on each floor. But there were 15 floors.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would take a few days to search through each room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a loud noise from the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I-I'm sorry. I\u2019m late for a new employee seminar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A woman in a suit was talking to a security guard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as he looked at the scene from afar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018An Eun-jeong has showed up in the wild.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He found the person he was looking for.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a more mature face than the one he saw in the photo.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was wearing a khaki suit and had makeup on his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She literally felt like a new employee.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But when he looked closely, he could see some similarities to An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong took the stairs on her high heels.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Surprisingly, this building didn\u2019t have an elevator.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was so that the members couldn\u2019t run off easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slowly followed behind her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The seminar sat down the new people that the employees had brought and explain the company\u2019s system.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A middle aged man turned on a projector and was giving a speech.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk snuck through the back door and casually sat in the back.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had changed from the janitor clothes to normal clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the seminar room, dozens of men and women of various ages were sitting. An Eun-jeong was among them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Is she a frivolous person?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A person with this type of mentality. Everyone in the room responded together, even if they didn\u2019t understand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Obviously, more than half the people in this room had frivolous characters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The middle-aged man spat out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Remember the IMF in 1997? Do you know what caused it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">People raised their hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"People buy and sell foreign goods.

But what will happen to them? All those who work are forced into early retirement. Their business goes into debt and they commit suicide. Your siblings living at home will have to clean the kitchen.

How will you get your hands on these?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people in the seminar room were all quiet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So, you have to put survival above other people\u2019s lives.

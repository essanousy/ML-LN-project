I definitely know her whereabouts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho made gestures for his bodyguards to withdraw.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, he didn\u2019t 100% trust the other person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he was desperate enough to grab a rotten line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s hear the story in detail.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk opened his mouth after a pause that was long enough for rice to cook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSooner or later, a war will break out in here.

You will be treated as an equal partner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Shin Chang-ho\u2019s lips twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...So what benefit can you get from this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI just want you to do some simple things for me.

However, it is difficult to reject your proposal. If you confirm one thing, I will accept it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho had an unbelievable authoritative aura after being stuck in prison for three years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He slowly approached the other person and whispered in his ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Prove that you aren\u2019t a spy planted by a cop, and I will listen to your proposal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled, pulled out a notebook and handed it to Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Read it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho accepted Tae-hyuk\u2019s notebook and started reading the contents without saying anything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no need to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho stared at the other person like he was spellbound.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Something huge was written in the notebook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know a lot that will help with the war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...A-Are the words written here true?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. His voice was shaking with excitement.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was natural that he reacted in such a way.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The contents of the notebook were huge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was information on the businesses entering and leaving Blue Dragon Prison, the shift table with the working hours of the guards, and the route they took to get here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, there were numerous secret documents about the Blue Dragon Prison filling the small notebook.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If this was known to be in the hands of criminals, some of the heads of the people in charge would fly away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou know that I am gathering information here. Of course, I didn\u2019t start just two weeks ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The notebook contained information that was collected inside and outside the dungeon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he was giving something this important to Shin Chang-ho?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just to help him stalk Park Sung-yul?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho gulped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I understand. I don\u2019t believe that you are a spy. But I want to ask what you are going to do with this? Are you planning an escape?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I told you. It is still a secret.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho slowly nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other person was bigger than he thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just before, Shin Chang-ho thought he was a spy planted by the police, but the chances of that being true was low, now that this information was given to him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho could do anything in Blue Dragon Prison is he had the information in the notebook.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be a tremendous help in the war against the Japanese inmates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This much information, why are you giving it to me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I gave you\u00a0only 30%.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At the very least, there should\u2019ve been a relationship between us in the beginning.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk just smiled instead of answering.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Based on his memories, he would imprisoned here four years later.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The man in front of him should\u2019ve been released four years later.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Nevertheless, Tae-hyuk knew Shin Chang-ho because he caused an incident and a few years were added to his sentence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then for now, tell me how I can help you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho was Tae-hyuk\u2019s mentor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wouldn\u2019t have survived 10 years in this place if it wasn\u2019t for him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Shin Chang-ho like he was seeing a friend after a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-How great. Did you think of this all by yourself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho exclaimed with wide eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Cheol-su didn\u2019t just have information, his ability to plot and intimidate the enemy was enormous as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I learned everything from you. Brown Bear.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I boast the best connections in the prison, so this should be enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho said in a trembling voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was someone scouted by a high-ranking executive of Gallery.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But Newbie, if you get out then come work with me. If you join \u2018Gallery\u2019 then you won\u2019t have a job anywhere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thanks for the offer, but I can\u2019t. I have already made an appointment with another place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had promised to go to university with An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha, I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho said with a dissatisfied expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the newbie entered the gang, then Gallery would get someone huge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Shin Chang-ho wasn\u2019t like the hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, who visited someone\u2019s home three times just to recruit them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, there were many opportunities in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I'll get started this evening.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Tae-hyuk left, Shin Chang-ho convened his loyal men and gave them a few simple commands.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of Shin Chang-ho\u2019s men was called a human copier.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used to make forged artwork out in society.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho gave some instructions to the human copier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand Hyung-nim. I just need to go to Park Sung-yul\u2019s room and draw everything I see?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. In the evening, some kids will keep an eye on Park Sung-yul. During that time, you will look around Park Sung-yul\u2019s room.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will handle it. Please leave it to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The human copier nodded as he received Shin Chang-ho\u2019s command.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At dinner time, the cell doors opened and the prisoners headed to the dining room to eat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul could feel someone\u2019s eyes on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are people staring at me today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a person who didn\u2019t have any close friendships and stayed by himself reading books or writing things in his notebook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Is there something on my clothes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul never imagined that he would be the Brown Bear\u2019s target and started to eat at the place where he normally sat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a few oversized people came up to him with their plates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is it okay to sit here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The big people were gangsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul looked at the people before him with a puzzled expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even though the dining room didn\u2019t set them apart, there was a certain area for the gangsters.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Naturally, the gangsters occupied the best place, but why were they sitting next to a serial killer like himself?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Something was strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Park Sung-yul was alone and there were several people in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t politely refuse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sit down.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then three or four oversized people sat around Park Sung-yul.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed as though they were threatening him not to escape.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He calmly placed rice in his mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As Park Sung-yul enjoyed his meal, the human copier quietly entered his room as Shin Chang-ho ordered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, I shall start working.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The human copier searched Park Sung-yul\u2019s room and found a few sketchbooks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were many images and poems that couldn\u2019t be identified.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t have a lot of time, but he could make copies of more than half of the present items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The human copier put all of Park Sung-yul\u2019s things in their original position with a satisfied expression and headed to Shin Chang-ho\u2019s room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heheh, Hyung-nim. Here it is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After confirming the goods, Shin Chang-ho slowly nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You went through a lot of trouble.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The human copier acted politely towards him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After a few years, Shin Chang-ho would be a high-ranking official of Gallery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Acting like this wasn\u2019t a loss for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is nothing. Please call me again if you need anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the human copier left, Shin Chang-ho started to look in more detail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were some paintings that looked like the scribbles of elementary school students, as well as some mumblings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Why does the newcomer want these things?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho never dreamt that they would be codes pointing to the places where Park Sung-yul had hidden the bodies of his victims.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he had received the payment for this in advance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Sung-yul delivered the puzzles as promised to the newcomer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you Brown Bear. There are people waiting for this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That evening, the newcomer wrote a letter to someone.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

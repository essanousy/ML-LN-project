That reminded Tae-hyuk, he hadn\u2019t come to school for the past few days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Jung Nam-ho found out the reason and helped him without anyone knowing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Obviously, it was a crime to receive a bribe. However, the Demon Revealing Mirror hadn\u2019t reacted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was a complicated feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk moved to a spot where he couldn\u2019t be seen by Jung Nam-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The criminal</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0wasn\u2019t Jung Nam-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">If so, that meant the criminal was among the remaining two candidates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He was sure of it.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">* \u00a0 \u00a0 * \u00a0 \u00a0 *</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The next day, Tae-hyuk started to monitor what An Eun-young and Park Sung-kwang did all day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">An Eun-young looked like a frog facing a ghost every time she saw Tae-hyuk, which made him feel bitter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018This is my own fault...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The magic was a bit too much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The first thing he figured out was that An Eun-young studied all day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It seemed like she was possessed by a ghost of studying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">She went to school at seven in the morning and prepared for everything they would learn that day. Even at recess, the English words never left her hands.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Then after school, she would stay until late to study.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">If other students came to ask about something they didn\u2019t know</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0she would teach them kindly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There was no sign of even the slightest annoyance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Really great.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk was full of admiration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">If there was a chance, he wanted to apologize and ask for help studying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">However,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0he needed to find the criminal first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018And Park Sung-kwang...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He was the exact opposite of An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Park Sung-kwang</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0only played all day.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He came to school just in time to avoid being late.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">During class, he would chat with someone on his handphone without studying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Still, his grades were very good, so the teachers pretended not to see it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">At the end of school, a driver in a deluxe foreign car would come to pick him up. He would take it to places like clubs and bars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was difficult to enter such places w</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">ith</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0a uniform, so he would change to plain clothes.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">However, everything on his body screamed luxury.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Is the son of a politician that wealthy?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Clearly, they shouldn\u2019t earn that much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk laughed bitterly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Even though they were in the same class, Park Sung-kwang\u2019s world was completely different from the one that Tae-hyuk and Jong-min lived in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk confirmed that Park Sung-kwang played with a woman until his face turned red. It was dawn when he got home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Does he study at home?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was strange that he was able to keep the position of 2nd place in the whole school despite all of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Underage drinking was a crime, but there was still nothing in the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'Well, it isn\u2019t like I wanted to learn a drinking skill.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He still couldn\u2019t find a clue regarding the crime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">However, he noticed something suspicious three days before the big test.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

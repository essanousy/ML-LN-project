There were many hiding spots to place the camera.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t even a changing room in the first place, so there weren\u2019t many people who would ever think that cameras would be installed in such places.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That is the psychology of the voyeur.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk searched through the special activities classrooms and looked for hidden cameras.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he found more than 30.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were high definition cameras, and were no longer recording because their memory was full.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Tae-hyuk wasn\u2019t recorded on the cameras.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Can I use this?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, one thing had become clear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The person who installed the hidden cameras knows the inside of the school perfectly.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They knew which classroom was used for which purpose.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The cameras were hidden in places with good angles.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The voyeur had calculated all of this, which was an impossible feat unless they were an insider.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'If so, it is a problem.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this situation, Tae-hyuk was an outsider. If he did something wrong, then he could be mistaken as the voyeur.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, collecting the evidence alone didn\u2019t mean Tae-hyuk would catch him. </span><span style=\"\">He had to find the crime scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The difficulty level was much higher than usual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"By the way... No matter how much I think about it, X-ray Vision is way too good to pass up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a chance that X-ray Vision could be obtained again later in the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t just give up Forgery that he had invested two weeks into.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Don\u2019t be so instinctual, Seo Tae-hyuk! I need Forgery right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to regain Rosario that Big Mama had, he needed the fully mastered Forgery skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was necessary to first find out exactly where the voyeur worked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cameras didn\u2019t have a long range transmission feature, so recorded content had to be directly collected.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk placed the cameras back in their original positions and installed a timer that could only be checked by him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were state of the art technologies that could notify him when it was touched. </span><span style=\"\">Of course, Tae-hyuk had no such abilities, which was why he took full advantage of his skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk placed common items like a glass cup or a book near the places where the cameras were hidden.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If someone touched the items, then they would fall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if there were only one or two items, then they might not be touched. However, there were more than 30 cameras, so the voyeur had to make a mistake at least once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was aiming for that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I didn\u2019t know that Spying had such a feature.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Spying could see the titles and abilities of the target, which didn\u2019t just apply to people, but also to objects.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he registered a glass cup in advance, then he could check its status.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Well, I won\u2019t be able to tell if it is just touched. Destruction is different.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would get alerts through the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For example, [Glass Cup] would transform into [Broken Glass Cup].</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By taking advantage of this, he could use things commonly seen as a security device.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a hidden use of the Spying skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Now, the installation is done!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk set up traps in locations that he had unknowingly touched while collecting the hidden cameras.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This would tell him when the voyeur was active.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he just had to wait quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then, should I go to Eun-young?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A few days ago, he scored 80 points on a mock exam that she had given him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Compared to the first time, his score had risen by more than 20 points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 10 days left before the retest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His preparations were slowly progressing.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Today, he was in a good condition and his intelligence increased by three, making a total of 28.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was almost seven times higher than when he first received the \u2018Spying\u2019 skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Well, I don\u2019t think my head has improved by seven times.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he recently felt like things had been going well so far.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The new use of the Spying skill was also a by-product of his increased intelligence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One worry was that the voyeur would be too cautious and wouldn\u2019t get caught in the trap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Then I would have to go to plan B...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his worries were groundless.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Out of a total of 30 traps, six gave him notifications.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The glass cup broke. The receipt was torn. The tissue... Ugh, it is now dirty.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the common items told him about the actions of the voyeur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Isn\u2019t this better than I thought?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just installing it let him know his opponent\u2019s activity time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He also knew the route the voyeur walked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Based on his speed, he definitely spends longer inside the rooms.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk confirmed that all the voices required for the Voice Modulation skill were registered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed the voices of girls A, B, C, and D to catch the opponent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The security guard\u00a0was also necessary.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And finally, Cho Kang-suk\u2019s voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voyeur started his activities in the late evening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to practice painting until that time. The proficiency of Forgery increased rapidly as he thought about what he learned from Lee Hana.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Not only did he copy Lee Hana\u2019s landscape painting, he also copied various other things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The important thing was to figure out the mindset of the person who painted it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if he painted the image with the same technique, there would still be a difference in understanding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a comparison between the two pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at what he painted before Lee Hana\u2019s lesson, and what he painted after it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were obviously works created with the same proficiency in the Forgery skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, after understanding the thoughts and feelings of the original artists, he could feel a strange vitality exuding from the painting. </span><span style=\"\">It seemed that it would come alive at any moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uhuh! It is difficult, difficult!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The profound world of art!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk yawned and stretched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The proficiency of Forgery was still over 50 points, so his technique had noticeably improved.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could now almost completely copy high school level paintings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... I have to get ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He pulled out a bromide photograph from his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a compelling photo of the back of a girl changing clothes from a nude magazine popular with soldiers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk triggered the Forgery skill and started to copy the nude photograph.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a way, this was also an artwork.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was the first time using Forgery on a photo to transfer to a painting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He also had to draw it four times bigger for it to be mistaken as a real person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Think of the mindset... As much as possible! He has to be excited to see this! Therefore, it has to be as sensual as possible!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-It is finished!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After more than an hour of work, a painting depicting the back of a girl changing clothes was finished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[A great work of art has been completed.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have perfectly understood the artist\u2019s mind.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It seems as though it is alive.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your Forgery skill proficiency has increased tremendously.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhem... I\u2019m ashamed...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, it was like catching a moth. The mindset of the person who took a photo like this was obvious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn\u2019t the same quality as the photo. </span><span style=\"\">If someone looked closely, then they could tell it was a painting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the atmosphere of the painting was more tangible than the original.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt dirty.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk\u2019s face was red. He was excited to see the painting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk blocked his nose and muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-Why does it feel like blood is dripping down?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could now understand the feelings of the original photographer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHum hum. Then, I will have to install this on the voyeur\u2019s established path.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a premonition that there would be more to the trap than he thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s plan was simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Install the painting of a girl changing clothes in an empty classroom. The curtains were covered, creating a breathtaking situation where only the silhouette could be seen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would then use Voice Modulation to mimic a female voice and give a sense of presence.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This scene was just too amazing for the voyeur to pass up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Naturally, he would concentrate on that place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then, Tae-hyuk would use the voice of the guards and Kang-suk to start hunting a rabbit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the hallway, he painted wall paintings with the Forgery skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">People wouldn\u2019t be able to make a normal judgement if they were embarrassed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the police suddenly entered, then the voyeur would start to freak out. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk changed the structure of the special activities building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He painted hallways on the walls with the Forgery skill.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Under normal circumstances, the voyeur would never be fooled. However, that would change if situation was urgent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The voyeur would be moved along Tae-hyuk\u2019s desired route.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The special activities building turns off the lights after school. In a confused state, it would be hard for the voyeur to tell if it was a painting or if it was reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the piece of paper on his desk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On it were detailed instructions about the route that he would drive his opponent down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then, let\u2019s start with plan \u2018I\u2019m alone in school!\u2019\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

The guards\u2019 nerves are tight since they are on duty on the weekend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see. Please tell me more about the nature of the guards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. Guard Kim Chang-su... Ah, he is the smiling one who always smooths back his balding hair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know who he is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is particularly sensitive about the hygiene inside the cell, so it is good to be careful about cleanliness when he is on duty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh. Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No information was too trivial.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk showed interest, Anchovy became more excited and started telling more stories.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He heard a married guard talking on the phone, etc.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He told Tae-hyuk all sorts of trivial matters regarding the prison guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After hearing all of Anchovy\u2019s stories, Tae-hyuk made a simple evaluation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019d prefer a bit more detail.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t you like it? Still, can I have some settlement?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anchovy smiled and rubbed his palms together.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, isn\u2019t this foreign tobacco?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the cigarettes circulating Blue Dragon Prison were paper cigarettes, which were made with thin paper and domestic tobacco.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no taste and the cigarette was so compressed that it felt like one was sucking poison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the volume was small so not much could be smuggled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It became harder to get, so other methods were used to increase the quantity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cigarettes would be mixed with tea leaves at the kiosks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At the beginning of admission, the ratio was 1:1. However, as smuggling became harder, the ratio of tobacco decreased. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Recently, they were able to produce 10 cigarettes from one.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, it didn\u2019t have any taste, but it was better than nothing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a long time, it was possible to smoke a cigarette.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you smoke that fake cigarette? It is like putting steak into a blender and turning it into porridge. Like dog food.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite his words, Anchovy reached out towards Tae-hyuk\u2019s cigarette.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hit the back of Anchovy\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I can\u2019t you one pack just on your previous stories.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sheesh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He slowly pulled out a cigarette from the pack and placed it in \u00a0Anchovy\u2019s hand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joy filled Anchovy\u2019s eyes as the cigarettes piled up on his palm.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, seven cigarettes were given to Anchovy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He brought a cigarette to his nose and sniffed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He pulled a battery from his pocket.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the prison, matches and lighters were forbidden.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had to use a battery in order to light a fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is necessary to use tricks to light a fire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anchovy extended the spring of a ballpoint pen and connected it to the anode of the battery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It started to generate heat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He carefully brought the end of the cigarette to the spring and sucked in several times. Smoke rose and the cigarette caught on fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHah... That is fantastic. Cheol-su. Can\u2019t you give me one more?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you tell me a fun story then I will give you a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anchovy groaned because he had run out of things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk realized that the fish had started to bite the bait.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In the beginning, I would give a pack for minor things. However, I\u2019ve gradually reduced the amount to 10 cigarettes for most stories. Then what will happen?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The answer was to tell a secret story that couldn\u2019t be told to outsiders.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if they felt reluctant at first, they couldn\u2019t endure the sweet temptation of foreign cigarettes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't worry. I\u2019ll won\u2019t tell anyone else what you told me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These words ended the indecision.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anchovy started to tell an even more secret story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026These days, the attitude of those Japanese bastards seem strange. They seem to be hiding something. They are always confident because they have connections to Japan\u2019s Yakuza and they smoke too much. So, there are a lot of people who look at them badly... It exploded a few days ago and an incident occurred.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The trigger was trivial.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Japanese prisoner eating in the dining room was accidentally hit by the plate of a Korean.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As a result, the kimchi soup covered the clothes of the prisoner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Rather than apologizing, he provoked the Japanese bastard by saying that his clothes were beautifully dyed red like blood. In the end, other people gathered to fight. However, it was all the Koreans who ended up in solitary confinement.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes shone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like he had found a piece of the puzzle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Japanese criminals were associated with the Yakuza, and the guards gave them privileges.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I find one more piece, I think I will complete something big.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, he decided to be satisfied with this much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But the person who was taken was the leader of the Koreans, Shin Chang-ho. In the end, he couldn\u2019t bear it and is preparing for war with those Japanese bastards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">War...!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those trapped in confined spaces like prisons couldn\u2019t relieve their stress or overcome their dark feelings.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t uncommon for fights to occur between prisoners or for them to riot against the guards, especially in Blue Dragon Prison, where all the terrible criminals were gathered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk remembered that big and small rebellions took place every year in the 10 years he was here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is almost like an annual event.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shin Chang-ho. It was a very pleasant story.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk handed a whole pack of cigarettes to Anchovy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCheol-su, thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Come again if you have more interesting stories.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yep!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anchovy disappeared with the cigarettes like a miner who struck gold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Little by little, the pieces will fall.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In no time, his 20 packs of cigarettes had almost run out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was time for a restock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fuck, I\u2019m not a goat! Why is there only grass!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are on a diet. If you don\u2019t let it then don\u2019t eat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, that\u2019s not it. This is fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The worker in charge of the food was arguing with a big person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The big person was grumbling about the distribution of the food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sheesh, he could spare a chicken leg.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk, who was waiting for his turn, approached the worker and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI need more cigarettes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAlready? How bad is your habit to go through 20 packs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you selling? Or not selling?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, I am selling. Ohuhu. 20 packs again?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This time I want 40 packs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t even think about raising the price just because I am buying a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was natural.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was 100,000 won for one pack, which was a huge rip-off.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The worker\u2019s voice trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then it will be four million won in total. Do you have that money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk handed over a thick envelope under the tray. Once again, it was paid in advance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The worker\u2019s eyes changed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a tremendous amount of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But clearly the limit is two million won. How did you get such a large sum? Do you have a great banker?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is a large sum so make sure that everything is ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, okay. Tell me if you need anything else.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cigarettes could move ordinary prisoners.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was something that he could spend money on.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Right now, Tae-hyuk\u2019s bankbook contained a huge amount of 200 million.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t mind investing all of this money to gain gold bullions worth billions of won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two reasons why Tae-hyuk purchased cigarettes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The cigarettes were bait to get information from prisoners.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Right now, they were only miscellaneous stories.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eventually, he would get secret stories, like he did with Anchovy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It also deepened his relationship with the worker.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t try to decrease the price of the cigarettes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once he returned to his room after finishing the meal, 40 packs were on his bed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The next day, Tae-hyuk bought 40 packs again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWahh! Thank you!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Within five days of entering the prison, Tae-hyuk had become the worker\u2019s largest customer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shin Chang-ho is collecting ironware to fight against the Japanese scum. Ah right. This will really be kept a secret?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gave two packs of cigarettes to the other person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the meantime, there were inmates waiting for their turn.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The tacit agreement was to stand at a distance where they couldn\u2019t hear what Tae-hyuk and the other person were saying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That way, the other prisoners couldn\u2019t hear the story that the person was telling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ones who received the cigarettes always said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It will really be kept a secret?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then they would cross the building with an expression like they had the whole world in their hands.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once Tae-hyuk checked the time, exercise time was almost ending.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stood up and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but business will end here for today. If anyone else has a story then tell me at dinner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sighs were heard from some places.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sheesh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t this too competitive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn. It has been a few days already and I feel like I\u2019m going to collapse!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk ignored them and approached the worker cleaning the corner of the yard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a person he was familiar with, thanks to seeing him for the three meals a day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was also responsible for trading more than just cigarettes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk approached, the worker smiled and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Would you like to buy cigarettes again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I need something other than cigarettes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sketchpad and pencil. My hobby is drawing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hah. With that face? At any rate, you can buy it at the store.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, I need one with a spring.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The store inside the prison didn\u2019t sell anything that could be a weapon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The springs on the sketchpad were made of iron, and could be used as a weapon to choke someone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Because of that, only pages were sold at the store.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t know why you need it, but if you give me money, I will sell it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will give 200,000 won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t a weapon like a knife or something sharp, so the worker sighed with relief.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A spring was much less risky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'My stomach is at its limit. I need to take this out as quickly as possible.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would prefer to have cutlery or glass, which would make it easier to take out the things in his belly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, more time was needed to get things like that.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even though it was dirtier, he decided to take it out of his stomach with a pencil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gave money to the worker who said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Once you go to bed this evening, it will be there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I will contact you again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After dinner, the sketchpad and pencil were under his bed. He put the pencil in a pencil sharpener and sharpened it by turning it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho, who was lying on the top bed, extended his head and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNewbie. These days, you often get things delivered to this room. What are you hiding?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are we lovers? What does it matter what I hide?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough. At any rate, I like you because you sleep very well during the night. Ohuhu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk deliberately pretended not to know that Yoo Cheol-ho was digging a tunnel every night and acted like he was deeply asleep.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho even confirmed the state of Tae-hyuk\u2019s pupils using a LED light that he obtained somewhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Usually, a person wouldn\u2019t be able to control the movement of their pupils when pretending to sleep.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk had the Counterfeit skill and it was easy enough to produce a sleeping face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Last time you slept really well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk swung the hidden iron pipe at Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuhak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once again, he fell unconscious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk tsk. Then I will start.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk rolled his blanket and put it in his mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now his screams wouldn\u2019t leak out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'First, sharpen the pencil as much as possible.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He made a sharp awl using the pencil sharpener.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he pulled off the spring from the sketchpad and connected it to the end of the pencil.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All the preparations were finished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Illegal Surgery...!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used the crime skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk\u2019s right arm moved at a tremendous speed and the pencil tip pierced his belly.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Puok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kkuck...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a creepy sound and blood splattered everywhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was also enormous pain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The sky was spinning and he almost lost consciousness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Damn, this really hurts.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had a knife then he could do it so that the important parts weren\u2019t hurt.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t do such a careful operation because he was focused on not breaking the pencil lead.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Blood constantly flowed from Tae-hyuk\u2019s belly. It would be dangerous if he dragged this out for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finish it as quickly as possible!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuook...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clenched his teeth and slid the pencil to the other side of his belly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the spring at the end entered the belly sideways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Now it is time to finish this!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk grabbed the end of the spring tightly and moved his hands.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Gruk!</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Gruruk!</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Gruuuok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a strange sound as the spring inside Tae-hyuk\u2019s belly started to gradually come out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At the same time, Tae-hyuk\u2019s belly split apart.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Crunch!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His intestines emerged from the completely cut stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeok...

He did it with a pencil and spring.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the most important thing still remained.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put his hand in his stomach and found the silicone pack kept near there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuoock, keeeok, kuaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Muffled screams emerged from his mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If it wasn\u2019t for the cloth blocking his mouth, then it wouldn\u2019t be strange for the guards to immediately come running.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he was able to safely retrieve what he was looking for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s stomach contained the Demon Revealing Mirror and silicone bag.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the only way to bring in a mirror from the outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can\u2019t lose my mind here!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk manipulated the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror with a trembling hand and used Cancel.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kuooooong!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His ears rang.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like someone was drilling at his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The intestines that emerged started to be sucked into his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His sliced belly was restored, and the wound disappeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the blink of an eye, Tae-hyuk\u2019s belly had returned to its original state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out the blanket blocking his mouth.

My identity absolutely can\u2019t be revealed, so it is something to be unconditionally defended.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Next was the queen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the strongest piece that he could move freely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The loss of the queen would play a huge part in the king\u2019s resignation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Both ends of the chessboard were for the rooks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen Big Mama and Moonlight Flower.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were chess pieces made before he started acting as Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When he met them, he had to hide that he was associated with Phantom as much as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama's intelligence network.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower\u2019s hacking and stealing skills were necessary to deal with the Sun Cult.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk held a bishop and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t like it but the bishops will be Shin Se-ho and the Bomber.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were difficult to use, but had the ability to reverse the situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The pawns were the members of Nuclear Bomb that could be freely mobilized with money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Finally, there were the knights.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk placed the knights on an empty space and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is Detective Cho Kang-suk and Investigator Joo Hyun-ho.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had the authority to investigate and arrest the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to meet the rooks and pawns as Seo Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would meet the knights and bishops as Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He imprinted this firmly in his mind and reached out towards the white king, who could be called the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow, let\u2019s go slay the king.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have been promoted. Why are you still eating noodles?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk heard a familiar voice as he was organizing the investigation headquarters.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was his junior, who was smirking while eating spoonfuls of butter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a busy day. Have you come to help me clean up?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho placed an ice coffee in front of Kang-suk and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oho, avoiding the answer means that something is going on. The suspect will answer the investigator.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk thought about what happened yesterday and cleared his throat a few times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Actually, I proposed to Seo Ha-ran.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! You finally made a decision! Congratulations Sunbae! Aren\u2019t you moving at the speed of light?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow! A ring that I never thought I would see on Sunbae\u2019s finger! It is somewhat modest, but made of platinum, a symbol of unchanging love! Judge, this is definitely an engagement ring!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk couldn\u2019t help laughing as Hyun-ho made a fuss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who would have ever thought that he was an investigator from Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, he had returned to Korea after half a year of working there, stating that it didn\u2019t fit him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he was considered one of the top three investigators in South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho was delighted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo when is the wedding?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think May would be perfect. I want to give Ha-ran the happiest day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, the inspector will be glad...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe inspector?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When I saw him, Inspector-nim was worried about when Sunbae would finally get married, so I asked him what he would do if it happened. He said that he would bow deeply to the bride. I just want to see that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk felt dizzy at the thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Such a bet was going on without him realizing it?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then why?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t hate it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm, so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I\u2019ll sing the congratulatory song.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That\u2019s okay, you can just emcee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Kang-suk desperately waved his hands in rejection, Hyun-ho looked at Kang-sk with wide eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kang-suk doesn\u2019t want Phantom to emcee?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why would he be interested in emceeing my wedding?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are best friends.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What? Who would want Phantom as the emcee of his wedding?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk looked at Hyun-ho with a perplexed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but I don\u2019t want the special troops as guests for the wedding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhu. Won\u2019t it be spectacular?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho took off his trench coat and placed it on a coat hanger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he sat in his chair and started to whisk the whipped cream in his coffee with a strange face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince then, have you been in contact with Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. No? He just took the money. He is strangely quiet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then, does Sunbae know a way to contact Phantom separately?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. There is no way to contact him first. It\u2019s a burner phone. The number is changed every time, and the one time I tracked the location, he appeared to be in Sichuan China.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite the interest of the police commissioner, Phantom\u2019s identity was still veiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is like 007. But if you have a chance to meet Phantom again, will you take me with you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk narrowed his eyes at the other person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho had started to show a large interest in Phantom not long ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It might not be for a big purpose.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like he wanted to play a game against Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a strange feeling in his mind, but he couldn\u2019t say what it was.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk couldn\u2019t help laughing at the thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom was someone that even people from other sides of the earth were interested in.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was no wonder that Hyun-ho was interested in him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you want to embarrass yourself like last time you met Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAish, surely not. At any rate, you said you recorded it the last time Phantom contacted you. Can you send it to me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI already sent it to the main office. Can\u2019t you go and look directly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI wanted to listen while writing a few reports. Well, it doesn\u2019t contain anything important. In addition, an investigator like me will be bombarded with things to do if I go to the main office.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was always a desire to ask his opinion on new cases.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, he wasn\u2019t in a position to refuse.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, the work would steadily accumulate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk looked at him with a sympathetic expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are also suffering a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, that was the trouble with being too talented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Not much had changed about Big Mama\u2019s pawn shop.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk deliberately built up trust by trading her forged artwork that was worth several million won at a time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two types of criminals that stolen goods brokers dealt with: Those who were lucky enough to get lucky and sell many goods, and those who would bring in a small, but consistent profit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, it was the latter that stolen goods brokers wanted to trade with for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOmo, did Tae-hyuk come?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama smiled as she checked the door and rose from her seat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were no other customers inside the pawn shop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they first met, Tae-hyuk had felt a prickling on his skin.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, after some steady trading, her voice was soft, like they were old partners.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but I won\u2019t be selling anything today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you know the group \u2018Sun\u2019, active in Z City?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm, that is an emerging religion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama narrowed her eyes and said some neutral words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t know what he had to do with that place, so she refrained from any negative vocabulary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and revealed his relationship with Sun in one word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. That cult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh. You know. Do you need information about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The more information there is, the better. I also want to know some family members who have gone missing due to the cult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This seems quite lucrative.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard that they have some of Gauguin\u2019s oil paintings there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama\u2019s eyes changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Paul Gauguin was a French painter that was the representative of post-impressionism.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He left numerous oil paintings behind that were traded at a price of over 100 million won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn\u2019t know that they had such a classy hobby.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah right. Once I get the goods, I will make a deal with Big Mama. Can\u2019t we profit from each other?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama looked down slightly and laughed,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhuhu... I welcome such a good deal. By the way, can you do it by yourself? If necessary, I can introduce other experts to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll ask you at a later time if I need it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big mama wrote message on her tablet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait two days for the information. And the price will be this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She showed Tae-hyuk the number she had written on the tablet screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">10 million won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In the past, it would be 20 million won. Is this a regulars discount?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I hope for your support in the future and will be giving you a special service. And even if you don\u2019t have any work, you can always come by to play. I will make you delicious tea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough... Maybe after this is over. Then this is a deposit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk handed over a bundle of 50,000 won bills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, the information deal with Big Mama ended without any problems.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he bargained a big more, then he would\u2019ve received free information on the condition that he turn over Paul Gauguin\u2019s paintings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this deal with Big Mama was just right, since he might get damaged if he went too far.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to always keep an eye on the other person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t forget that fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sun\u2019s nest was on the outskirts of Z City in Gyeonggi Province.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They purchased a ruined university and built their own kingdom on that vast site.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was sitting in a cafe and drinking coffee while reading the information that Big Mama gave him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How much did he read?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stood up and cried out,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, this is too much for half-price information!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Indeed, there was no free discount in this world.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The amount was only 1/3 of the other information he bought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This lady...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, he had expected it to some extent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Sun was a strictly closed off religious group.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Finding out information about such a place would be difficult.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The amount was small, but it was better than nothing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apart from the owner sitting at the counter and looking at a photo book, no other person could be seen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk approached the cafe owner and asked slowly,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but can I ask for a refill?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cafe owner stood up with an embarrassed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aigoo, that\u2019s right. I was lost in thought for a moment. I will come straight away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This cafe has a good atmosphere. But there doesn\u2019t seem to be too many customers...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha... Is that so? In fact, when the store first opened, many people came from the nearby university. However, it eventually closed down and people left for the Seoul campus.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt must\u2019ve been hard for Boss-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, there are occasional customers from nearby factories. By the way, did you come here for a business trip?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had transformed into a white-collar worker with the crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The misunderstanding was natural.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk lied easily,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Actually, my family member fell into some strange group. I came to meet someone from the Internet to come up with some countermeasures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, it is like that. Hu... There really are things like cults in this country...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk avoided the gaze of the cafe owner and confirmed the location of the hidden cameras installed in the shop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I didn\u2019t say anything and he is already talking about a cult. Isn\u2019t this too amateurish?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was true that he came here to meet someone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk knew that this cafe was one of the traps created by Sun.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

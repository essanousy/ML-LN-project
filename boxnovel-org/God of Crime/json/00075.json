(</span><span style=\"\">TN: AD = audio/assistant director, I think? If it is something else, let me know in the comments)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"PD-nim, did you have a late night yesterday?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bah! I\u2019m so numb that it feels like my bones are breaking. Originally, I tried to sleep until the afternoon but it couldn\u2019t be helped. We are hyenas searching for a scoop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho was suffering from the life of being a part time worker, so he had to go to the interview with an AD instead of a proper cameraman.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wanted to be in charge of a popular current affairs program one day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That opportunity might be surprisingly close.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho rose from his seat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was time for the investigators to go to work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStraighten your spirit. From now on, we are going into battle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The AD rubbed his hand on his shirt and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut PD-nim. What incident are we going to now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... I need to restore my spirit. I didn\u2019t explain. Amputated body parts were found yesterday morning, and the arms and legs were used to decorate a Christmas tree. It was already reported on the airwaves. I think it will probably be on air tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah, jackpot... A completely psychotic bastard. By the way, I haven\u2019t seen it on the news.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho clicked his tongue with a regretful expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know how the AD could get this job if he didn\u2019t know how the press worked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course not. What day is it today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Christmas.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But what would happen if there was such drab news? On a day like today, the contents of the broadcast should only be delightful and warm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The AD nodded with an expression of understanding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Shin Se-ho laughed and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, that is just for the big stations. We don\u2019t have to worry about public opinion so we will broadcast it today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you get permission from the chief?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course. This evening, we will be the first ones to report on this incident during the golden hour. So shoot it properly. There is no time to edit it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c</span><span style=\"\">Yes! I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for the interview.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho and the AD tried to enter the crime scene, but the police stopped them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They showed the ID of the broadcasting station and searched for Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDetective Cho! This is a coverage from ABS Station.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk walked out of the crowd with a dignified expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have another coverage. Aigoo, you were sent again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho laughed at Cho Kang-suk and waved,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow, who is this? If it isn\u2019t Detective Cho Kang-suk! You always seem to be busy. Haha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Cho Kang-suk wasn\u2019t feeling very pleasant towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"An interview will be tough right now. I can only give you a brief overview.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a perfect response from the manual.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Shin Se-ho wasn\u2019t satisfied with that much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can\u2019t we see the bodies? They will be covered with a mosaic during the broadcast.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Sorry, I\u2019m afraid that isn\u2019t going to happen, as they have been transferred to the morgue.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s voice was smoother than when they last met at the cafe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk didn\u2019t like it, but he was on duty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho covered his mouth with his hand and whispered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I really can\u2019t see it? Ah right, there is a rumor that you have an important position right now. If you don\u2019t mind then please tell me about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk confirmed that the man holding the camera also had an audio recorder.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he made even one small mistake, then it would come out in the newspaper.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The fatigue from staying up all night seemed to pile on him instantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Where did the PD get the scent?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Rumors were surprisingly scary.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe he even knew the existence of the [God of Crime].\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even so, he had to avoid letting that name out of his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but it is out of my purview. I\u2019ll give you the interview and let you film the scene as much as possible. Although it is impossible to take you directly to the crime scene, you can draw a picture of the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho smiled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He knew that the police were hiding something.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But right now, he wanted information about the case.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He needed to draw the line precisely to get it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s go to a coffee shop nearby and talk. I\u2019ll buy the coffee. In addition, I have a corporate card. Haha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Shin Se-ho gave a secret signal to the AD.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As previously discussed, the AD disappeared from other people\u2019s eyes into a nearby building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk saw it and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where is the cameraman?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He needed to go to the toilet all of a sudden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho inwardly laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What? They wouldn\u2019t show the scene of the incident?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had brought a camera equipped with a telephoto lens that cost several million won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be like capturing a vivid scene in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could do anything dirty in order to pick up a scoop.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was Shin Se-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, I have a call so just give me a minute.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk hurriedly looked at his smartphone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho noticed that Kang-suk\u2019s expression changed as he confirmed the caller.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It smelled like a scoop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His prediction was accurate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The caller was [God of Crime].</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, this is Cho Kang-suk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Hello, Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">No, should I say Merry Christmas?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time, it was Kim Do-shik\u2019s voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was strange, even if Kang-suk knew the identity.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How did that person change their voice?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is going on? I don\u2019t think you would call just to say hello.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Don\u2019t be so pushy.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I am a little timid.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Rather, I prepared a special Christmas gift for the police.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I want to return the bomb that I couldn\u2019t bring back the other day.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...W-Where is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">You\u2019ve already received the \u2018dolls\u2019 as a present from someone else, but I haven\u2019t started playing yet.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Doll? Ah....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s eyes widened as he realized what the other person meant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The God of Crime was talking about this crime scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Shouldn\u2019t a party have firecrackers?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">So I\u2019ve placed a bomb in there with Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-Wait a minute. D-Don\u2019t tell me...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">You should hurry.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">It will go off in five minutes.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuook...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk gave a strange groan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this revenge for the attempt to arrest him?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was confusing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After that, the person hung up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk rushed over to the police and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-We have to run away from here! There is a bomb! Tell the people nearby to evacuate right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"B-Bomb?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police moved quickly at Kang-suk\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was fortunate that there was a blockade near the area, and civilian access was controlled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho whistled as he grasped the atmosphere and walked up to Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huiyu. What is happening all of a sudden? You received notice of a bomb attack near here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk made a mistake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had forgotten about that person during the call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but Shin Se-ho PD should also evacuate. There was a tip that a bomb was installed here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoa! Who was that call from just now? It seemed like you knew the person. Do the police have a type of inside contact with a terrorist organization? Can I think that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to talk! Does this look like a prank? Bomb! Do you want your head to fly away?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Kang-suk lost his temper.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho quietly retreated, like a dog with its tail between its leg after being kicked.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, his body was shaking with joy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His senses were telling him something.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Something was happening here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be a scoop that surprised the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The AD, who set up his camera on the roof of a building that was 200m away from the crime scene, couldn\u2019t help sneezing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... It is cold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was much colder than he expected because he was so high up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, that damn Shin Se-ho. Who wants to be an AD? Once I get promoted...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He grumbled as he adjusted the camera\u2019s focus, but then he noticed something strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The situation of the police gathered at the scene wasn\u2019t ordinary.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed as if they were running away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The AD was puzzled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, a message came from Shin Se-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Jackpot.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">There is a bomb threat at the scene right now.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">If you find the culprit then this will be an enormous scoop!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Get a close up of the scene.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA bomb...? No, then I...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The AD was stunned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if he was 200 metres away, he didn\u2019t know how strong the blast was.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He might end up being killed by the explosion, but Shin Se-ho wanted him to shoot the scene of the bomb exploding?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, people needed to take risks to get a scoop.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t a dedicated cameraman, but he had been holding it for five years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His journalist\u2019s heart started to blaze.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like being a reporter in a war zone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, a man only lives once. Today I will take the best video of my life!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The AD focused on the scene and waited quietly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In no time, the police had evacuated so the street was empty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh? That person...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was strangely dressed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was wearing an opera mask on his face and a leather jacket.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One hand was holding a long iron pipe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me...! Terrorist?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The AD swallowed his saliva.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe this really was a great scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a strange thing happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The unidentified man in an opera mask looked up at where the AD was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA-A coincidence?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was 200 metres away.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Without the telephoto lens, a person would look smaller than an ant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yet he was looking over here?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A drop of sweat dripped down the AD\u2019s nose.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Ssik-</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it wasn\u2019t a coincidence. </span><span style=\"\">The man in the opera mask smirked and his thumb across his neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hiiik!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That person knew he was here!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The AD sat down in fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, this scene has been cleared of police.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said with a satisfied expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But what about that fly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used Spying to check if there was anyone around.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Expanding the scope of Spying had a limit of once per day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He noticed that someone was shooting this place from the roof of a building that was 206.2m away.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe it was a journalist or someone similar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smirked and drew his thumb across his neck in a threatening gesture.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like he would have to handle that after looking around the scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He planned to debut the [God of Crime] to the media sooner or later.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe this was a good opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s draw a picture.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he drew the scenery using Forgery, he could draw the powerful image that was contained in it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was basically like psychometry as he drew what happened here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could see traces of the past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk walked over to the tree that had been decorated with body parts and murmured,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The bodies were taken away but the tree is still here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood was still remaining in some places.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would draw the remaining image based on that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Easel OK, sketchbook OK, paints OK.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After all the preparations were finished, Tae-hyuk triggered the Forgery skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He started drawing in a relaxed posture like he was a landscape artist.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that moment, a strange illusion emerged in front of Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUgh...

This means...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bombs had a wide range of explosion.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, that was only if the bombs were installed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gathering a large number of guards here was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Mister Park put pressure on the prosecutors to catch the Bomber before turning this place into a fortress.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, if Tae-hyuk crushed this place, then he would be able to cut his fate with the Yakuza, which had continued since his previous life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yakuza members poured from the other side of the hallway and fired their guns at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tutututu!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Loud noises filled the air that were enough to burst his eardrums.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cM-Monster!

How many people have you killed in the meantime? Personally, it is a little unfair.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He activated Bullet Time as they fired.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thanks to this, Tae-hyuk\u2019s perception of time was reduced by dozens of times.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like the world moved in slow motion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk moved quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Two people behind the wall.

I need to turn their gaze away from the Bomber towards me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to do that, he had to act very loudly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">By scanning the map, Tae-hyuk could tell that the Bomber wasn\u2019t far from his location.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was one of the points where a bomb should be installed to blow up the laboratory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The next two!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">1/3 of the Yakuza in the institute were already cold bodies on the floor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he was approaching his limit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how overwhelming the abilities, even the crime skills weren\u2019t invincible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bullet Time had a duration of one minute and Machina didn\u2019t have endless durability.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he couldn\u2019t go to the centre of the institute where Mister Park was.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The key to this operation was the Bomber.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk concealed himself in the darkness and watched the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opponents were already overwhelmed with panic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What the hell is this?! Why won\u2019t he die? Wasn\u2019t he clearly shot?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-The opponent is a g-ghost...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAck! I ran out of bullets! You, do you have any spare mags left?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The opponent is obviously the Bomber! This doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Call for reinforcements!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Yakuza members did something they should never do.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They tried to confront the enemy away from the important defense points of the fortress.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If someone had a good understanding of tactics and strategy then it was something they would\u2019ve never done.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Come to think of it, maybe one of them are the descendants of the Japanese who invaded Korea during the Joseon Dynasty? If I think about that time, their decisions were pretty cute.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he attacked the place where the Yakuza were busy servicing their equipment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Truly easy opponents!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a water pipe on the ceiling.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He aimed the pistol at it and water started to pour down with a thunderous sound.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Hwaaaaack!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you are in the basement then you should be careful of flooding!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A masked gunman attacked from behind the water.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a terrible predicament!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Yakuza were soaked in water and randomly fired their guns.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. If you shoot me like this then you won\u2019t have enough bullets left.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was more difficult than when they were aiming properly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was hard to avoid all the random bullet lines.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to defend himself against a few with Machina.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Despite the diamond like strength, the Machina couldn\u2019t withstand the hail of bullets and started breaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I'm sorry. I was trying to relax. This is the time limit. Now I\u2019ll go faster.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Yakuza were shocked after hearing Tae-hyuk\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had been relaxed until now?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen showtime.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk grabbed a pistol in both hands and pulled the trigger.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tatang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bomber, Kim Tae-sung, grabbed his shaking right arm..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the preparations were finished.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He succeeded in installing the bombs in all the places indicated on the map.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now he could blow up the institute at any time by just pressing the detonator.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPant... Pant... Pant!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bomber leaned against the wall and breathed roughly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to run for almost two hours through the institute to install the bombs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He heard fighting from a place not far away from him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like a war zone with gunshots and shouting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then somebody died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew who did it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The masked man, \u2018Phantom.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Miracles were always created from his fingertips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung couldn\u2019t do anything but make bombs.

Goodbye Bomber.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jang Ik-sam motioned to his bodyguards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Apart from the bulletproof glass, he coldly closed the door of the shelter completely by pressing a switch.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then no matter how many bombs exploded outside, the dust wouldn\u2019t be able to enter here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Plus...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I almost forgot.

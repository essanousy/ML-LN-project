Such an amount means that he will have an overwhelming lead over the wolf. However, that isn\u2019t the case. In fact, the game hasn\u2019t even started yet.

Each brother has 90 million. They always go against another person and win. It might be the same in this situation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-soo was known for his poker face that never lost its calm, no matter the circumstances, while Dae-soo had a keen eye for reading the opponent\u2019s cards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, dexterity was a basic thing for both of them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the two of them combined their strengths, they became a team that no other card shark could compete with.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a confrontation between the sheep who took Cha Soo-hyun\u2019s money and the gambling brothers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A huge battle was about to happen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opera mask manipulated the monitor towards the viewpoint of the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The game seems to be started straight away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A time limit existed in the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, all the games were fast paced.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Bluff Poker needed a dealer so a man in a black suit came and started to mix the cards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was two sets from 1-10.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was a total of 10 games.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The number of cards meant it was relatively easy to count the cards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Tae-soo who participated in the match.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The lion mask sat on a chair and stared at the screen in front of him as he spoke.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opera mask next to him was in charge of commentary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This match is important, so the brother with the good poker face emerged before the other one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The basic bet is 10 million.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh. Isn\u2019t it usually one million?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They know that the opponent has a lot of money.

It will be a really exciting match.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The card was placed in front of Cheol-su and Tae-soo.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two men put the card on their forehead.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They could see the opponent\u2019s card but not their own.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Betting or withdrawing would now begin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Cheol-su has a 3 of spades, and Tae-soo has an 8 of clubs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cheol-su bet 10 million, even though his opponent\u2019s card was quite high.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-soo maintained his poker face and followed the call.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Tae-soo won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In a time that was shorter than a minute, Tae-soo had won 20 million.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Indeed, a professional gambler. He figured out his opponent\u2019s playing style, and is playing calmly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next game immediately started.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The masked people sighed as they saw the cards on both foreheads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cheol-su had a 10 of spades.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The strongest card.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would win no matter what card the opponent had.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, this was Bluff Poker.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Only the opponent could see the card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my god...

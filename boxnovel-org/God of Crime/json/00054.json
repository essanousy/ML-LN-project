However, in here, it wouldn\u2019t even keep him alive for an hour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So instead of getting revenge on Choi Sung-yeol who lied to him, 20 minutes later he would be challenging the attraction of death.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just when Yoon Jong-hyun was in the midst of despair, someone spoke to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess you don\u2019t have enough money to pay the fee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoon Jong-hyun replied in a loud voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. Are you asking that after seeing the badge on my chest? Stop joking...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoon Jong-hyun trailed off as he saw the badge on the opponent\u2019s chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c3...300 million!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If his eyes were wrong, then 360 was clearly written on there.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The money needed to get out of here was 200 million.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A huge amount of 160 million would remain after he escaped.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoon Jong-hyun realized that the young man in front of him could save his life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoon Jong-hyun literally fell to the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he grabbed the pants of the other person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP-Please. Can you give me a little bit of money? No, please help me. 30... No, if you lend me 20 million then I will pay back double the amount. Please...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His life was at stake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoon Jong-hyun looked at the person\u2019s badge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It stated that his name was Lee Cheol-su.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeacher Cheol-su...! It is a request!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed a few times and said as smoothly as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don\u2019t need to do this. First of all, listen to my words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-what...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you do a few things for me, then I will pay your fee. How about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoon Jong-hyun didn\u2019t answer right away, since Cheol-su could be trying to trick him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, even though he didn\u2019t have any money, he might be a bait to deceive others.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was the Death Circus after all.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t easy to trust a person in a place like this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But even so, there was nothing else he could do in his rotten situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know what you are thinking. You can listen to my words and not do it if you don\u2019t like it. I want you to collect all the people who are in danger because they don\u2019t have enough money. Of course, we don\u2019t want them to play the final game.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis means...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I will pay all of their fees. If you look at the money I have then you know that it is possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"O-Oh my god... God...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, there isn\u2019t much time remaining, so please hurry. I will explain more once the people are gathered here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You can treat me as a scammer, but there is no other choice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoon Jong-hyun nodded as he looked at the face of his saviour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! I-I understand!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoon Jong-hyun thought about it as he ran around.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the other person had used more plausible words then he wouldn\u2019t have trusted them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the man called Cheol-su said that Jong-hyun could doubt him as much as he wanted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It strangely gave him a sense of trust.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the opposite of Choi Sung-yeol\u2019s method of luring people with sweet words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk confirmed the time as he was left alone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had said the same thing to three people apart from Yoon Jong-hyun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If they moved in a hurry, then it wouldn\u2019t be too late to gather the people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Every minute and second was precious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the camera and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">10 minutes ahead of the payment time, six people were gathered in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were all people in danger because they didn\u2019t have enough money for the fee payment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They looked at Tae-hyuk like he was their saviour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You were deceived.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a huge uproar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you deceiving us now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-This bastard...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk\u2019s 360 million didn\u2019t change.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They couldn\u2019t do anything but count down the minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk replied with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I had decided to give the fee to you. But in the end, that idea isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What do you mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, let me tell you my purpose.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk briefly looked at the six people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of them were men in their 30~40s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had little or no money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They swallowed their saliva and waited for Tae-hyuk to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want to escape from the Death Circus with everyone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had collected six people using the bait of 10 million won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Right now, there shouldn\u2019t be a wolf hiding in this group.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a collection of specifically selected people.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two conditions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They should have no money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A person who couldn\u2019t do anything before the thought of death.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people who satisfied these conditions absolutely couldn\u2019t be wolves.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only woman among the gathered people raised her hand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was a timid-looking woman in her early 30s.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-Will you really save us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That will be the result.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... Thank you... Thank you very much...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The woman bowed until her head was touching the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018...Ugh. H-Her chest all of a sudden...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk\u2019s conscience showed itself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t simply through goodwill that Tae-hyuk wanted to help these people escape. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was so that he could break the Death Circus and Tiwai.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He gathered this crowd as part of his plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'You are being used! Don\u2019t look at me with such expressions of respect! I\u2019m a bad person!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wanted to shout those words, but he stopped himself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The rules that Kim Joon-young created for the Death Circus were absolute.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were many masked witnesses watching.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, if the death penalty ended and all guests disappeared, then this promise would be discarded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how much money he made here, he wouldn\u2019t be able to take it outside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would just turn into a piece of data on the badge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he had to finish everything while the guests were still here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those who didn\u2019t know that Tae-hyuk was plotting a wicked conspiracy spoke with touched expressions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I really want to escape from here...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBringing out all the participants...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoon Jong-hyun, who was mixed among the people, opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If this succeeds then it will be a miracle like the Exodus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExodus?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. The Exodus from the bible. Moses received a revelation from god and took those who were slaves to escape from Egypt. He took them to a land of paradise.

Who is this for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then an officer returning to work spoke to the policewoman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t it Detective Oh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, good job Sunbae-nim! Detective Oh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. He receives orders here because he can\u2019t get them at home.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was one of the good things about not being married.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Speaking of which-</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Detective Oh was walking down the hallway when the new policewoman waved her hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDetective Oh! Did you order something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Detective Oh stopped with a confused expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you mean? My wife found my savings so I couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to. Aigoo. That fishing rod...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The courier package wasn\u2019t for Detective Oh.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The policewoman looked at the courier box with suspicious eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSomething is fishy...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Looking at the details, the recipient seemed to be Team 2 of the Kangdong Police Station.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The sender address was written, but it wasn\u2019t an actual address when they searched it up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The name written on the package was also fake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police officers groaned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Perhaps they had discovered something immense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The policewoman\u2019s eyes widened as a man\u2019s voice was heard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A recently popular detective, Cho Kang-suk was glancing at them curiously.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, Detective Cho Kang-suk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the biggest celebrity at Kangdong Police Station.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He threw his body at Yoo Cheol-ho, the escaped prisoner, who had the whole country in an uproar.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Not long ago, he played a crucial role in arresting the hippo.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, he had recently been paying attention to his appearance, and was now like a wild detective from a \u00a0movie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The policewoman couldn\u2019t understand why he was still single.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he wasn\u2019t meeting anyone...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her face turned red at the thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can I take a look at it for a moment?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes! Take a look!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police officers raised their voices, as if they had met a famous celebrity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk coughed and eyed the courier box suspiciously.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The size seemed to be the smallest one available among the post office boxes, and the edges were slightly crushed from the delivery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He sniffed it but there weren\u2019t any smells coming from the package.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was all that could be seen from the outward appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk looked serious when he was told that this was left behind by a courier.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant that moving it wasn\u2019t dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Something heavy?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He carefully lifted the box and noted that it had a considerable weight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Something is shaking. Is there liquid inside?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk thought back to the devices that he learned of back at the police academy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He might be making a fool of himself, but it wasn\u2019t bad to be careful.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk put the box on the table carefully and called Kim Do-shik.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Inspector, it is Kang-suk. It seems like a bomb might have been delivered to the police station. Can you call EOD?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk asked Kim Do-shik to officially dispatch the explosives squad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">What?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I understand.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Don\u2019t touch it!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A lazy afternoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was an uproar among the police officers working in Kangdong Police Station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">IED.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A bomb was delivered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Be careful! Be careful...! If there is any wrong shock or jostle, then the entire police station could go flying away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik gave instructions to the crew who specialized in handling explosives.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were various tools ranging from liquid nitrogen to shock absorbers on the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were various forms among the homemade bombs, such as exploding when a certain impact was given or exploding when the box was opened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The most famous was the time bomb that was connected to a clock and exploded at the appointed time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is opened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well done!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lid of the courier box was carefully opened so that no vibrations would be transmitted inside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik\u2019s eyes widened in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-This...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a plastic bowl filled with red liquid, with wires intricately connected to it like blood vessels connected to a heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik\u2019s eyes flashed at the sight. He knew what this was all too well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Liquid bomb!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The explosives agent started to carefully explore what the liquid was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem to be methyl nitrate. It seems to be nitromethane.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik\u2019s expression changed slightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Methyl nitrate exploded by mixing with other liquids, even if there wasn\u2019t a detonator.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, nitromethane didn\u2019t burst unless there was a very strong impact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The agent said carefully,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This amount is enough for an entire street to fly away. However, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a detonator.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm? Detective Cho, did you find this? Is there another?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Cho Kang-suk scratched his head and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. The two who found it were from the traffic department. I just found it suspicious.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. You aren\u2019t an expert, yet you realized that this is a homemade bomb.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It was also taught at the police academy... It was because I had a feeling.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"As expected from Cho Kang-suk\u2019s senses. At any rate, process that with the utmost care. Detective Cho will be responsible for finding the source and route of the courier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk scratched his head as he heard Kim Do-shik\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk wondered about the intentions of the perpetrator who sent this bomb to the police station, but he wasn\u2019t Hyun-ho who majored in psychology.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He just needed to catch the culprit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like he would have to work overnight again for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, one woman came up in Kang-suk\u2019s mind.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had his first date with her a while ago, and soon, they would meet again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although it would be difficult for a while.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would confess at that time...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, can I see the courier box for a moment?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk noticed something strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sound recorder...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was an old voice storage device placed in a corner of the box.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk asked the explosives disposal personnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is it okay to touch?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. The detonator is removed. Even if there is a device that responds to vibration, it won\u2019t break.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk carefully grabbed the tape recorder.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He tried to check for the culprit\u2019s fingerprints, but it had been wiped clean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The homemade bomb looked mysterious to Kang-suk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like the culprit was an IED expert, which was rare in Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, if they provided a tape recorder then they were clearly planning something.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk discovered the cassette tape in the recorder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cInspector. Let me check the content.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He clicked the button and heard a noise.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Hello, police officers who are trying to implement justice today.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voice sounded ridiculous, like the person had inhaled helium gas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">You have seen my work.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">If you have the right experts then you will understand how powerful the bomb is.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the moment, all eyes were focused on the explosive ordnance disposal personnel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The agent said carefully.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If the bomb explodes in the city then I think there will be at least a few dozen deaths.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk pressed the recorder that had been stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I have prepared a fun game for you.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">From now on, I will hide nine identical bombs all over the city center.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">If you can find them all, then it is your win.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Of course, you know what will happen if \u00a0you miss even one.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Crazy bastard...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk punched the wall.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t a game to him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The culprit was literally declaring that they would bomb the city center.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They also sent a bomb to the police like it was a challenge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I hope that the courier didn\u2019t arrive too late.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">The first bomb is scheduled at 10 a.m. on December 2nd.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">The place...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck! That was four hours ago! Call and ask what the situation is like at Atlantis right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But there was no need to do so.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A person who had been speaking on the radio approached Kim Do-shik with a pale face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-Inspector. There was a support request from Gangseo-gu right now\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Wait a minute, that is where Atlantis is!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-That... A huge explosion occurred at the marine theme park and hundreds of guests were using it...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik couldn\u2019t resist hitting the table with his fists.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As the tape said, one bomb exploded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the serious thing was that there were still eight remaining.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Then I\u2019ll give you a hint about where the second bomb is hidden.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">If you want to give up the game then deposit 15 billion won into the designated account.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then I will tell you the location of all the bombs.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then I wish you luck.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Kangdong Police Station was turned upside down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as Tae-hyuk and Ha-yang got out of Atlantis, they headed for a family restaurant in a remote location.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once there, they had a simple meal and discussed future plans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you know how upset I was? I was really prepared to die.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, and you almost died. If someone hadn\u2019t saved you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed as he looked at Ha-yang.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Ha-yang\u2019s face and ears turned red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, anyway. In return for my help, you should tell me everything this time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like she didn\u2019t like the fact that he didn\u2019t tell her about the fake blueprint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have to fool my allies to fool my enemies.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cB-But!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-yang was too embarrassed to speak and wriggled her fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I am different. It isn\u2019t the same.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk answered with a small sigh.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed the clumsy thief had misunderstood something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. I will tell you as much as possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took out a notebook and wrote down Kim Tae-sung\u2019s name.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is the culprit that caused the bombing. A crazy bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUmm. By the way, I was wondering something. How do you know this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The question emerged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to tell Ha-yang something to explain all the strangeness.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a sincere expression so she didn\u2019t think his words were a joke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He raised his hand and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is because I am a tremendous genius.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"G-Genius?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have an IQ of more than 200 that surpasses Einstein and with my tremendous sense of reasoning, I can penetrate into the present and the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...The present and the future? Reasoning?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Can I open the door of truth? It is simple to analyze human psychology and study the pattern of criminals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wah. Amazing. If you have that ability then it is natural to hide it. I\u2019m sure that there would be many people who want to use Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shrugged. It was a plausible lie, even to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. So Ha-yang noona should also keep it a secret.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-yang blinked and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I see... Then that is how you know my name?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out his phone and showed his address book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I asked you to give me your number and you wrote it down. There was no need for any reasoning.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyway, Yoo Ha-yang. I think it is a name that really suits Noona.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHehehe... Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-yang shook her head and started to twirl her fingers with embarrassment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Only Yoo Ha-yang would be deceived by such an obvious lie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is a perfect name for Noona, who is a fool.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Either way, I\u2019ll go over Kim Tae-sung future movements with you. This isn\u2019t the end of his bombs. There are eight more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cE-Eight?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"And Kim Tae-sung asked for 15 billion won to prevent it. Of course, there isn\u2019t an easy amount of money to give.

T-Too much... Why did you tell me such things... Aaahhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stroked Ha-yang\u2019s back as she started to cry like a child and spoke in a soft voice that seemed to calm Ha-yang down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll ask Noona once again.

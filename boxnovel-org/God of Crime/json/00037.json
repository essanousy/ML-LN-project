I should have been paying more attention.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk bowed from where he was sitting at the kitchen table, a heartfelt expression of regret on his face.\u00a0</span>Although Kang-suk had the face of a friendly neighbourhood hyung, he was actually a homicide detective.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He had been too busy these past three weeks.\u00a0</span>He only said that he had a case, and that he hadn\u2019t been able to catch the culprit yet.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk put the cutlery down in front of Kang-suk and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hyung doesn\u2019t need to be sorry, because I know that you are busy with work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cStill! Hu... No. I couldn\u2019t receive phone calls properly because I was in meetings every single day. I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk became aware of the events that happened to Tae-hyuk and Ha-ran after everything was resolved.\u00a0</span>He truly seemed to be suffering at the fact that he was no help.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk turned and looked at Ha-ran\u2019s back who was cooking food in the kitchen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... Ha-ran said that she wanted to go back to university.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"If I knew this, then I wouldn\u2019t have donated all of my monetary rewards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk laughed. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He felt like he was looking at a puppy that wanted to help its owner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Why don\u2019t you confess? I'll help you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"W-What does that mean?! How could I say that to Ha-ran!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHyung likes Noona, it\u2019s written all over your face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk\u2019s face turned beet red. The hulking bear easily became a simpleton.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"T-T-That isn\u2019t it! I have decided to first start as friends!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cF-Friends? What is Hyung doing?!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was easy for even Tae-hyuk, who had no experience in dating, to know that Kang-suk was taking the wrong approach with Ha-ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Anyways, have you been studying well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Wow, what a change in subject!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk realized something after the Rosario theft and the SY Capital incidents.\u00a0</span>He couldn\u2019t take care of Ha-ran and Tae-min alone.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018In addition, I will have to start fighting the blacklist members in earnest.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk was a protector, who he could ask for help when things got dangerous. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk believed that was enough, but it turned out that wasn\u2019t the case. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Therefore, Tae-hyuk prepared a big plan to change the future, which was to decrease the gap between Kang-suk and Ha-ran.\u00a0</span>He could trust Kang-suk with Ha-ran. At the very least, he was a man who would shed his own blood before making a woman cry.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Besides, he likes Noona.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Even Tae-hyuk could tell that his sister was nice and pretty, so it wasn\u2019t unusual for Kang-suk to fall for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Hum hum. Will he actually become my hyung?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> According to Tae-hyuk\u2019s memories, Kang-suk was an old bachelor in his 40s.\u00a0</span>Kang-suk wasn\u2019t a popular type among women. In addition, he spent most of his youth running around, catching criminals. In the end, he attended a matchmaker to find a marriage partner; however, his dates would run away upon seeing Kang-suk. A big bear sitting down in a suit. It was quite a shocking sight. Kang-suk started to say that he was married to crime. In the end, he abandoned dating.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Hyung is charming when he laughs...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk lowered his voice to avoid Ha-ran hearing and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cKang-suk hyung. This is a gift.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk handed him an envelope with a smirk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cEh? Are these planetarium admission tickets?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Go with Noona when you have some time on the weekend, she likes to see the stars. Say it is between friends. Can\u2019t you go and play with that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk coughed unnecessarily loudly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cCough. I appreciate it. I have work this weekend though...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Then go next week! These tickets last for a month anyways.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I\u2019m sorry, but my weekends won\u2019t be free until this incident is over! Sob... I like the stars as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk lowered his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk felt a strange protective instinct emerge as he saw the hulking bear with a dispirited expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'While Hyung looks after Noona... I feel a strange maternal instinct!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk knew the truth about the two people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Ha-ran would be entering a dormitory cram school next month.\u00a0</span>Prior to that, Tae-hyuk wanted for her to go on at least two or three dates with Kang-suk.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018In order for that to happen, I need to solve Hyung\u2019s murder case.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk had been working seven days a week recently. Even if he wanted to get closer to Ha-ran, there was just no time to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk asked in a small voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cBy the way, Hyung. What case is it now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well, I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t say. Now that the mass media has caught wind of it, special instructions have come down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Special instructions?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk mimed zipping his mouth closed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk found out a few facts from Kang-suk\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> First of all, there were at least two possible incidents if it needed to be kept secret.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The media was more likely to make a fuss about a serial murder case.\u00a0</span>Or, if they didn\u2019t want the media knowing, then it might be a terrorist attack that would cause a huge blow to the economy.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Obviously, Kang-suk was responsible for one of two things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Anyway, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> In front of the two people, there was the delicious smell of cooked mackerel.</span></p><br/><p>@</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have to do this for Kang-suk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk grumbled as he used the \u2018Violence\u2019 skill on the roof of a house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> In order for Kang-suk and Ha-ran to go on a date, Kang-suk\u2019s serial killer case had to be resolved.\u00a0</span>He wouldn\u2019t have any time to spare before it was resolved. Tae-hyuk was going to use his crime skills to help Kang-suk.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> In the end, Kang-suk\u2019s job would be to take care of Ha-ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"First of all, let's check the performance of this skill.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The previous criminals that he met \u00a0until now hadn\u2019t been all that dangerous.\u00a0</span>He had to figure out exactly what he could do. Cho Kang-suk, a homicide detective, had been struggling for a few weeks, so it obviously wasn\u2019t an ordinary criminal.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cMaybe it is one of the blacklist members.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk organized the list of criminals that he had written down.\u00a0</span>He memorized the dangerous criminals\u2019 names, what they were doing, and how they got caught.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was all listed in the blacklist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHrmm... So far, I\u2019ve met five?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> But one day, he would meet all of them. Tae-hyuk was sure of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He had met Yoo Cheol-ho on the day he received the future memories. Tae-hyuk had then helped put him in prison.\u00a0</span>Less than three weeks later, he got involved in the incident with Park Seong-ho\u2019s son, Park Sung-kwang. Not long after that, he met the thief Moonlight Flower and Big Mama.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> They were all criminals that Tae-hyuk remembered.\u00a0</span>Wasn\u2019t this too much to be dismissed as a coincidence? It seemed like they were pulling him towards them.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Either way, this criminal isn\u2019t a joke. Who is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The prosecutors wouldn\u2019t be so desperate to conceal it if he wasn\u2019t a cruel person.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p>Anyway, Tae-hyuk felt confident now that he had acquired the Violence skill. Unlike in the past, he could now physically overpower the opponent.\u00a0<span style=\"\">It gave him a strange confidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk grabbed the iron pipe created by the Violence skill.\u00a0</span>It allowed him to use his strength and agility.</p><br/><p>Tae-hyuk wielded the iron pipe on the roof to rest how strong he was.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Certainly, my body moves well, but I still don\u2019t think it is enough to fight 17:1.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk was obsessed with the number 17:1.\u00a0</span>Among Tae-hyuk\u2019s current stats, the lowest one was agility at 24 points.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Therefore, the movement of the iron pipe didn\u2019t appeal to his spirit.\u00a0</span>If he could attack a little quicker...</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Anyhow, I can summon an iron pipe any time I like. Isn\u2019t this surprisingly usable?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The pipe was dented, and there was a handprint on it.\u00a0</span>At first, he was worried that moving it incorrectly would cause the pipe to bend. \u00a0 However, testing showed that it was very hard. It didn\u2019t get any scratches, even when he pit all his weight into it. He would be able to use it as support in emergency situations.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk put the iron pipe on his shoulder and pulled out the smartphone in his pocket.\u00a0</span>It was a phone that he had newly acquired after the last incident.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The time for restoring is almost over.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He checked and there were still a few minutes remaining.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The smartphone used by Kang-suk stored most of the data on its own server.\u00a0</span>If he had the ID and password then he could download it to his own smartphone. He could see everything from the contacts to the messages Kang-suk sent.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk asked Kang-suk for help with purchasing a new phone.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p>In the meantime, he had been using Ha-ran\u2019s old folder phone. In other words, it was a natural monument compared to the advanced technology of the smartphone.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk made an enlightened expression, like an American missionary visiting Korea, and started his lecture.\u00a0</span>In the meantime, Tae-hyuk grabbed Kang-suk\u2019s smartphone and obtained the ID and password. It was that simple to obtain Kang-suk\u2019s personal information.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019d like to see some information about the investigation. Please don\u2019t let me get nudes by mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> First, he decided to be satisfied with this much.\u00a0</span>After a few moments, the restoration of the phone was completed perfectly. A smartphone with the same information as Kang-suk\u2019s was born.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThen shall I check his messages?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk skillfully navigated the touch screen to check the messages and mailbox.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cWah. I feel nervous when there are no apps. By the way, he hasn\u2019t linked his mail account yet? He uses a smartphone like an old phone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue. Kang-suk acted like a primitive person. But Kang-suk was like a caveman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk only used three things on his smartphone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Telephone calls. Text messages. And the map.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Anyway, he was able to get a clue about this case.\u00a0</span>Then he muttered with a blank expression.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cWait a minute. Is Hyung part of this bastard\u2019s case?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He was one of the five worst criminals recorded in the blacklist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The watering hippo.\u00a0</span>That was his nickname.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk stared at a bathroom from far away.\u00a0</span>One officer was standing guard. (TL: Bathroom in this case seems to refer to the public baths or sauna in Korea, not toilets)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Perhaps this is where the incident happened.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk referred to the blacklist as he chased after the trail of the hippo.\u00a0</span>But there was one strange thing.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The hippo he remembered didn\u2019t start now, but three months later.\u00a0</span>Then why were there already victims? But looking at the method and frequency, the criminal was clearly the hippo.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018There are already two victims.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was a common point about the days when the hippo committed a crime. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was a day with a full moon.\u00a0</span>He murdered every 29 days.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk looked up at the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was a round man with a slight dark edge in a corner.\u00a0</span>There was three days to the next full moon.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Before that, he had to find the trail of the hippo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cLet\u2019s make a connection.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk took out his phone and called the officer standing guard.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Eat! Eat! I'll follow you!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the woman just watched Tae-hyuk\u2019s face and didn\u2019t eat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An awkward silence flowed between the two people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Doesn\u2019t it suit your taste?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The woman opened her mouth and spoke pretty good Korean.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like watching a foreign film being dubbed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I just wanted to have a meal with you. Surely it is delicious? I\u2019m just not familiar with it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk and Caterina were sitting in a French restaurant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a three-star Michelin restaurant so it was very expensive.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a popular place to have dinner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018She rented out this whole place. She must be rolling in money.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly clicked his tongue.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In fact, the three-star restaurant had their headquarters in Paris.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the atmosphere and chefs were similar, so there was almost the same satisfaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the price was the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Omo, then should we leave this place?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, he would eat at a Chinese restaurant or at home.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was a commoner who didn\u2019t often eat outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If she asks then jajangmyeon is Phantom\u2019s favourite food. Still, when will I get to eat? Um. Can I get chopsticks?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the first time I\u2019ve eaten in a restaurant like this with a beauty like Anne.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-Is that so? I was wondering... You wear those clothes with such ease that I thought you were familiar with these types of places. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina apologized and bowed her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was the godfather of the Red Mafia that contained thousands of members.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, she was showing him a submissive attitude.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was possible because she felt favourable towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was dressed in a neat suit due to the dress code.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It fit properly, and was from a high end brand, costing at least five to six million won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In fact, it was a fake made from Counterfeit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so? I saw the suit in a magazine and made it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha! You are speaking like you made it yourself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI did make it myself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Omo, what a good joke.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina covered her mouth and gently laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she took the spoon on the outside and explained,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It goes from appetizer to the mains so you use it in this sequence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is hard so can\u2019t I just ask for a fork?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fork? What is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could she not know the thing that he had loved during his two years of military life?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that time, Semon brought in a tray of food while dressed as a waiter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYoung Lady. Please enjoy your meal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, Semon. Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He really seemed like a butler at that moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Caterina spoke after Semon left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Once the meal is over, we are going to see the Phantom of the Opera at the theater. Isn\u2019t it a great trend in Korea right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The more active Phantom was, the greater the number of theaters that started showing the Phantom of the Opera.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a big trend among the university students.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, thanks for lending me your subordinates.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had received Caterina\u2019s help to deal with the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He obtained information about the Yakuza that the Red Mafia had and asked to borrow some men.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In exchange, Caterina had wanted a date with Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Investing half a day on a data in exchange for the Red Mafia\u2019s help wasn\u2019t a big deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina spoke with thrilled eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is nothing, since I was originally planning on helping out this way. Anyways, I wanted to eat with Phantom like this. Thank you for pampering me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a little burdensome to have a woman who was 10 years older acting like this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Well, it was cute but...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Cough. At any rate, I was able to easily deal with the Yakuza thanks to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes! But I have a question!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina asked while wriggling her fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I only gave you approximate information about the Yakuza. How did you know the enemy\u2019s base and production areas?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All information was organic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he found a small clue, then he could track it down the line to see the big picture.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t much different from putting together a jigsaw puzzle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It started with a Yakuza executive who entered the country a fortnight ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was able to get a lot of information by chasing after him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is great that I was able to get Mister Park\u2019s voice and face.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was able to disguise himself as Mister Park, one of the higher ups in the Yakuza in South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used this to gather information about the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was truly hard work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and continued.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It is a trade secret.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, please~\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina grabbed his arms and acted cutely, but it didn\u2019t work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyway, Phantom is doing well. You truly are bright, I like it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina said with shining eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut I didn\u2019t think that Phantom itself would be used as a symbol.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was something that Tae-hyuk prepared to fight the mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anyone could become Phantom with an opera mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was Phantom who installed the bomb at the enemy\u2019s base, Phantom who knocked out the guards, and who was seen by lookouts.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He made Phantom itself a symbol by introducing numerous Phantoms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first one was the Bomber.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was the Phantom in charge of manufacturing bombs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The former Red Mafia members took charge of enemy surveillance, intelligence gathering and installing the bombs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even now, there were people gathered on the Internet who wished to become Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter if there was a spy among them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Masks and some missions were given to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are welcome to wear the mask at any time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ahaha~ I want to be Phantom\u2019s girlfriend instead. Am I lacking in any way?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wondered why there were only strange women around him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018But she likes me. I can use this.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, it was Phantom she liked, not Seo Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no need to feel any remorse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk cut into the steak and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s do the next deal. This time, give me information about the Triads. Then...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, the next date will be at an amusement park!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk started sweating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This girl was the boss of the Red Mafia?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was worried about the future of the organization.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'They will be ruined.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina smiled softly as she checked her calendar for an appropriate date.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s talk business.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The young girl turned into the mafia boss.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly muttered as she gave off a strange pressure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don\u2019t know what tune she is dancing to.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She truly was a difficult woman to deal with.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk once again realized the truth of the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was fairly happy with his deal with Caterina.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he promised to go with her to an amusement park date two weeks later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'She is also desperate. If she doesn\u2019t have Phantom, then she won\u2019t be able to walk the tightrope for much longer.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used his tablet PC to check the people who wanted to become Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">By sending them masks and giving them commands, the number of Phantoms in the world would increase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. This uncle...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He muttered as he looked at the profile of Shin Se-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was the level of falling in love with a girl.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, there are many places where I can use him. I\u2019ll send him a message.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every person on here would jump with joy if a Phantom mask was sent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was able to give that much fan service.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What, a police officer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The names of police officers were mixed up among the applicants.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how he looked at it, they were spies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could see how big Phantom had become in South Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Actually, I was going to use the Nuclear Bomb people. However, don\u2019t they know my real face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Therefore, he thought of the temporary measure of selling Phantom\u2019s name.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it had a greater impact than he had initially thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even now, articles about people who had become Phantom were appearing on the Internet every five minutes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The police couldn\u2019t ignore it and would be hitting someone\u2019s house right now.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Clouding the eyes of the police.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could do several different things at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom\u2019s popularity was literally exploding.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk recalled the information he got from the Phantom in charge of watching the Yakuza.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The president of Taesung Group is the Yakuza boss. Will the rats step back due to this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had set up some bugs in the Yakuza\u2019s offices.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a Phantom responsible for monitoring it 24 hours a day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the contents were important then it would be sent to him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Since there were several Phantoms in charge of this, Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t have to worry about any information being missed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything was a system created by Sun\u2019s Cho Min-hyuk</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It isn\u2019t difficult once I view Phantom as the leader of a cult.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, the Yakuza were being attacked by their own system.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The head of the Yakuza here is dead. Then what opponent will come out now?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two likely outcomes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A newly promoted person will come from Japan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Or someone already here would be promoted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The most likely possibility is Mister Park.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the organization\u2019s right hand man and directed the important tasks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no one else fit for the position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Maybe the end of the mafia game will be a confrontation with him.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Ding dong!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Delivery!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The things Caterina sent him had arrived.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how close they were, he couldn\u2019t tell her where the Bomber was hidden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Therefore, Phantom was the direct contact.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had several hideouts so there was no need to worry about being caught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe life of a fugitive was difficult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the information prepared by the Red Mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a lot of information about the Triads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Triads is a harder opponent than the Yakuza.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Yakuza\u2019s default business in South Korea was the hallucinogenic drug.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used that as a small clue to find out where the Yakuza were at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But the Triads was different, as they participated in fetal organ smuggling, organ trafficking, kidnapping, etc. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They did the worst crimes that weren\u2019t even possible in China in South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to find the core and work backwards from there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are 10 more places like T Medical Centre.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There would obviously be a leader operating this, but there was no way for him to find it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, would they pop out if I keep on shaking?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk approached the man making a bomb in his workshop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow much bombs is in stock?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung took off his safety goggles and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Including today\u2019s one, 13 bombs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Toad, toad.

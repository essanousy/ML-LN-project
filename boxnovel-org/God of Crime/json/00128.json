I get affinity points for changing someone\u2019s fate.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was rare for people to lose their lives after getting involved with Sun.

I should use the points to learn a few new skills. Preferably, something that increases my attack power.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only skill he could use for fighting was Violence, using the iron pipe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was confident that he could win against any opponent using Damage to Both Sides.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was too weak to be used in a one versus many situation. </span><span style=\"\">In order to fight the mafia in the future, he needed a better skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk thought that and carefully pressed the button.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The roulette on the Demon Revealing Mirror started spinning.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were cheerful sound effects as he received the message that he got a new skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Crime Skill: Vehicle Theft has been acquired.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Anything with an engine can be freely used by holding the handle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The ability will be affected by your dexterity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-It is subtle...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a skill that could be utilized in various ways, but it wasn\u2019t the ability that he desired.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...One more draw.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to gain another skill by consuming 100 points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I could do more if I had 1,000 points.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was, what skill would he get next?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wanted a decent combat skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk once again tried the platinum challenge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time, he clicked the button very carefully.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A huge 100 points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could\u2019ve invested this in Voice Modulation or Counterfeit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gulped nervously as he looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were cheerful sound effects as he received the message that he got a new skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Crime Skill: Shooting Spree has been acquiring.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You can handle various firearms freely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-For 100 affinity points, you can learn the attribute Bullet Time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What?

It is a named attribute.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Among the attributes, there were those with unique names such as Hawk Eyes, Damage to Both Sides, and Sixth Sense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unlike other skill attributes, a large number of points were consumed, but the performance was enormous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to check the description of Bullet Time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a buff-type skill that could only be activated with firearms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Accelerated thinking?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Bullet Time was cast, everything except for Tae-hyuk\u2019s consciousness moved 100 times slower.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One moment could feel like eternity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoa...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He unknowingly exclaimed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had a limit of only one minute a day, but it was a tremendous skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In particular, it would show great synergy with Sixth Sense that allowed him to read the enemy\u2019s attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the Bullet Time attribute.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could get it by moving one finger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although he had to spend 100 points on the attribute, it was worth it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This isn\u2019t a worker\u2019s salary, but one that should be used immediately.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once he learned the Bullet Time attribute, he would have 107 points left.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would leave 50 points and spend the rest on the features he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Increase the duration of the Counterfeit skill.

So everybody, listen carefully.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun looked anxiously at Pungbaek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The words that came from his mouth would decide the future of \u2018Sun\u2019.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, the leader wasn\u2019t a fool, so he would give up his position if he had to.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The believers in the auditorium listened to Pungbaek\u2019s speech with tense expressions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"After thousands of years, I am able to appear in front of you thanks to Hwanin. I...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The faces of the believers filled with surprise.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Clouds rushed around Pungbaek, creating a mysterious atmosphere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The appearance of a man who literally controlled the wind.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It couldn\u2019t possibly be a trick or gimmick.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, he was talking to half-brainwashed believers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to break them, Pungbaek would have to announce that he was a fake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Pungbaek laughed and said words that no one expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...am a fake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The believers showed a violent reaction to Pungbaek\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooooof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk, who was drinking tea in the audience with a calm expression, spilled the tea he was drinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-W-What?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Jin-woo and Park Bum-ho fell down where they were standing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun maintained his calm and tried to fix the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa, ha, ha. Pungbaek really... Even in this situation, you don\u2019t lose your wit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and placed his fingers at his chin.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the special makeup that had been fully assimilated to his skin was peeled off and his original face revealed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The believers who saw it shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-What the? A costume?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The face behind the special makeup clearly looked like a criminal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the appearance of Kim Cheol-su from Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His face was scary enough to cause the believers to shrink back.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was reasonable since the believers didn\u2019t have immunity to such things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke into the microphone with a relaxed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhuhu... My conscience is pricked by those who are pretending to be gods. My face was changed due to special disguise makeup. The clouds are nothing but a superconductor that binds water vapour.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even after hearing such words, one of the faithful believers shouted,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If everything is a scam, how did they know my history? Hwanin can obviously see the past, present and future. How else can you explain it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used the iron pipe to stop the bishops and pressed something.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then on one side of the auditorium, the projector screen descended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-T-This bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The embarrassed bishops headed towards Tae-hyuk but the believers were staring at the screen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was showing videos from the secret cameras installed in the cafe and convenience store.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Among the recorded footage, there were videos of believers who were here now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-Isn\u2019t that me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is the story of my childhood!

Shit. That bastard hit us in the back...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to stop Tae-hyuk but the water had already been spilled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his colleagues didn\u2019t reply.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun gulped and slowly looked back.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Jin-woo and Park Bum-ho couldn\u2019t be seen at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Those bastards ran away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other bishops and the leader had escaped the auditorium in the turmoil.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun looked at the believers surrounding him with a flustered expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have scammed us.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? I brought all my possessions to you. That was a trick?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I won\u2019t be able to close my eyes if I don\u2019t hit you now. Everyone pounce!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Chi-hyun was stunned and lost consciousness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sweating Park Bum-ho opened his eyes in the darkness.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He told Kim Jin-woo who was sitting next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunbae... I had an unbelievably strange dream. Pungbaek appeared in my setting, then Pungbaek revealed to all the believers what we did.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk, who was sitting behind him, aimed a high kick towards Park Bum-ho\u2019s side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This brat fainted in the middle and thought it was a dream? What? A dream? Dreaaam? Fuck... I hope it is all a dream...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Bum-ho realized that it wasn\u2019t a dream, but something that happened a few hours ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Jin-woo said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLeader.

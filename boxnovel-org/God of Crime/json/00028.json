He then proceeded to install the traps at the marked locations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, let\u2019s check it out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the map, he had carefully written down directions on how to direct the voyeur.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he followed those exact directions, then he would be able to put his opponent into a corner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, some unexpected variables could occur. </span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk began visualizing several different situations, and how he deal with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the meantime, it was time to start self-studying at night.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All sound disappeared from the special activities building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow... is it 7:05 p.m? It\u2019s around the time for the voyeur to move.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was also time for Tae-hyuk to take action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lastly, Tae-hyuk confirmed all of his equipment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Everything he needed was currently gathered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll go and get ready for the guests.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">B High School\u2019s self-study started at 7:00 p.m, which was when the supervisor would wander around to check attendance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All the students were supposed to be in the classroom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once attendance was checked, the supervisor would loosen up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Some students would the special activities building to do other things or even to run away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voyeur was aiming for this short gap in timing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now is the time to do something in secret.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the main building had the latest security systems, the old wooden building didn\u2019t even have a common CCTV one.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If it wasn\u2019t for the geographical advantage of being close to the playground, no one would ever change clothes here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was hiding in the A-17 area, the place of the first trap. He also spotted a window that was slightly open, which was where the opponent would probably enter through here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">7:07 p.m.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The opponent moved.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kkiiik-</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no need to check the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the sound of a window opening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A black shadow was revealed by the backlight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk minimized his sound as much as possible as he watched the movements of the opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He isn\u2019t collecting the cameras.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voyeur merely took out the memory from the camera and checked its contents.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He made a small sound, as if he didn\u2019t like the content shown.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He reset the data and reinstalled the camera.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Everything took less than 10 seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If this was a sport in the Olympics, then would he get a gold medal?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black shadow finished his work in an instant and left the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t something he had done only once or twice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the voyeur would have never imagined that someone else was hiding in here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The binding trap is installed in area A-12. Let\u2019s move right away.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk left his hiding place and chased behind the voyeur.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opponent had stopped at a place 20 metres away.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had activated the binding trap and his feet were tied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After confirming it, Tae-hyuk moved to the A-13 area.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Now is the most important part.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used the Demon Revealing Mirror to activate Voice Modulation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He chose female student A that he had prepared in advance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Tae-hyuk confirmed that his voice was changed, he spoke loudly enough for the voyeur to hear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What do I do? I was tired from exercising and forgot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he changed voices to student B.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The seniors saw me sleeping and just left! I have to change clothes and go straight to the classroom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He changed it back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY-yes. Hurry!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Voice Modulation could only imitate people\u2019s voices. He had to create the other sound effects himself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For example, the sound of clothes being taken off.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Sururuk.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of clothes rubbing against skin was heard in the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voyeur swallowed his saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt disgusted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'D-Do I really have to do this?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took off his uniform, leaving him in only short-sleeves and shorts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Student C will emerge at this point!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk ducked out of the classroom and crouched down in front of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He shouted. It sounded like he was speaking from outside the classroom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunbae-nim! Big trouble! There\u2019s a frenzy outside because the voyeur entered the school!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt a presence in the hallway. The voyeur was aghast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Ugh, what is this?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk felt dizzy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His body almost collapsed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stabbed his thigh with a stick just to keep conscious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could feel his consciousness coming back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is it because I used the skill too much?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time. Now was the most important part. Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth and imitated the voice of student D with Voice Modulation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The guard said that the police are coming! Come out quickly!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018... I can\u2019t miss catching the fish. Just a little more...!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He heard the sound of the voyeur rushing away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk forced his legs to move and chased after the opponent.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to use his skills, stamina was consumed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had particularly used a lot of it over the past few days.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the burden came rushing in at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I think I used more last week... Ah, perhaps...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In that moment, Tae-hyuk recalled An Eun-young\u2019s healthy food. His hands clenched at the thought. Surprisingly, it had supplemented a lot of his stamina.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After not eating it for a few days, his body sent out a few signals...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did he have to eat her food for the rest of his lifetime?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that moment, he had an ominous feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Anyway, the target is in area B-4. Shall I give it a try?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk imitated the voice of a guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The police officers are here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confused voyeur fell down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he got up through superhuman willpower and started to run.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, a wall appeared in front of the voyeur.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he had looked closely, then he would be able to see that it was just a painting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, in such a panicked state, such a cold judgement was impossible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he ran to the other side of the hallway to avoid the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A smile flashed on Tae-hyuk\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'As expected, he ran to point C.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time, he imitated the voice of Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will arrest the criminal who violated the Special Sexual Violence Law! You can remain silent, and any of your remarks can be used against you in court. You can appoint a lawyer and have the lawyer speak for you when asked a question. If you don't have money for a lawyer, you will be appointed a public defender. Do you recognize your rights?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk imitated what he saw in movies as much as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The opponent panicked as Tae-hyuk read his version of the Miranda Warning in Cho Kang-suk\u2019s voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Originally, they were words that the police would say only after arresting the criminal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But it was still enough to panic the opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voyeur heard Cho Kang-suk\u2019s cry and started to run faster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Now, go straight. Then you will be very happy.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took a deep breath as he watched as the opponent ran in the direction planned.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t get any merits from catching this criminal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he was happy since he could spend the rest of his time practicing Forgery here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That in itself was satisfying enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Anyway, this time I can\u2019t get any skill...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how he thought about it, X-ray Vision was a good skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If only...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Someday, I might get a chance again. At any rate, haven\u2019t I solved the case?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt bittersweet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the end of the B High School voyeur incident.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, something Tae-hyuk hadn\u2019t imagined occurred at this moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kyaaaaak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A female screamed from the place that the voyeur was running to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-who? Aren\u2019t all the students in the main building?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Students A, B, C and D who remained in the special activities building were hypothetical people created by Tae-hyuk. Did they suddenly pop out in reality?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a minute. This is the second time I\u2019ve heard that voice... Ah, Hana sunbae!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk realized that he had forgotten about her. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana went to France after graduating. Due to that, she could live a leisurely life without attending the self-study at night.</span></p><br/><p>'If I have time then I will come back to teach my cute junior.\u2019</p><br/><p>She had obviously said that.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk ran forward with a sick expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Lee Hana was in danger.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The situation had gone seriously sideways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voyeur saw that a witness had suddenly appeared and pulled out a weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a middle-aged man wearing a suit, and gave off a meek and intelligent atmosphere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Such a person was a voyeur...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To Tae-hyuk, he was a stranger; however, Lee Hana might know who he was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana alternated her gaze between the criminal and Tae-hyuk with a pale face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voyeur asked in a trembling voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I-I, right now, chased by police, stay quiet, don\u2019t get hurt, hostage.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Hana closed her mouth and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth. This situation was even more dangerous. He didn\u2019t know when the confused opponent would use his weapon against Lee Hana. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rabbit was cornered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Damn. It is entirely my responsibility if Sunbae gets hurt!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk released the Voice Modulation skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he approached the two people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ajusshi. Don\u2019t get excited and listen to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-Who are you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A student just passing by.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"G-Go away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have a lot of camera equipment, so I can tell what your hobby is. According to Article 14 of the Special Sexual Violence Law, a person who uses a camera or other similar methods to film an unaware person\u2019s body for their own sexual desires is liable for imprisonment up to five years, or a fine of up to 10 million won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"However, the punishment is double that if you threaten or injure a person with a weapon. \u00a0So, why don\u2019t you have a conversation with me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I know! Fuck! I\u2019m going to kill both of you! No one will know if I run away after killing you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The voyeur had now turned into a murderer with a weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the blade was now aimed at Seo Tae-hyuk instead of Lee Hana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Thus far, it is as planned.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Plan A to catch the voyeur had failed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Plan B still remained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slowly reached out to his opponent and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?

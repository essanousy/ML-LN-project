But no matter how I think about it, I picked a losing ticket.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk checked the crime skill while An Eun-jeong was taking a break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had invested 10 affinity points to receive a random skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The ability that emerged was Counterfeit, a skill that was similar to the Forgery skill that he already had.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there was a crucial difference between the two skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, he didn\u2019t need to make anything with the Counterfeit skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Forgery was basically making something that already existed, and materials were needed to activate the ability.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The more he knew about the original, the more complete the result.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Counterfeit was a skill that made something look different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He cut a piece of paper that was 154x68 mm and activated the Counterfeit skill, giving birth to a counterfeit bill of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is a big hit up to here...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had yelled with joy when he first saw the skill description.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A perfect fake!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he used it well, then he could get a tremendous amount of wealth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a problem.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were a few constraints on the Counterfeit skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018... First, the duration.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could make a counterfeit bill with the skill, making it look like ordinary money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The holograms and ink were perfectly converted, and there were even many anti-fake devices included on the bill, such as hidden images.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, it was fluorescent when looked at through an X-ray.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All counterfeit money makers would want his method of production.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, once it left Tae-hyuk\u2019s hands, it would return to its original state after five minutes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">So no matter how perfect the counterfeit money, he couldn\u2019t even use it to buy a pack of gum.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, there was a limit to how many times he could use the skill. He couldn\u2019t use it often, like he did with Gambling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'But it is the best skill to deceive a person in front of me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had perfectly tricked Cha Soo-hyun using the Counterfeit skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The method was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk first received the badge from An Eun-jeong and transferred all the money to his badge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then, he used An Eun-jeong\u2019s blank badge to create a fake badge with the number 115 on it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used Robbery to take away the opponent\u2019s badge and agreed to transfer the money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun was covering his badge with a thick coat because he was reluctant to reveal his name and current revenue.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That ended up choking him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He never noticed the important moment when his badge was stolen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had acted the part of a boyfriend until the end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The result was a complete success.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Isn\u2019t it a surprisingly usable skill? But X-ray Vision...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk kept lamenting about his missed opportunities to obtain X-ray Vision.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Eun-jeong who had been sitting on the table for 10 minutes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t do it directly, but she had cooperated in deceiving someone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She seemed to have received a psychological shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk exclaimed like he suddenly thought of something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah right. That reminds me, Noona\u2019s badge should have melted with Cha Soo-hyun by now. But I don\u2019t want to give you the money I borrowed. Then if Noona isn\u2019t next to me, then you can\u2019t pay the fee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong flinched at his words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a fact that Tae-hyuk hadn\u2019t mentioned 20 minutes ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong understood the point that Tae-hyuk wanted to make.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her life was now in Tae-hyuk\u2019s hands.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If she did anything that was even a little annoying...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think that is enough rest. Would you like to gain some money? I have to pay for two people so I need to get 200 million won in an hour.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026 Yes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I will be going to Bluff Poker.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk turned and started to check the map.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong had goose bumps as she looked at his back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man called Lee Cheol-su felt worse than any criminal that she had ever met.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The atmosphere permeating throughout the room was not dissimilar to one of a masquerade ball.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were brightly shining chandeliers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The tables were filled with a variety of luxury foods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Many guests dressed in colourful clothes were laughing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They wore a wide variety of masks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A woman in an opera mask asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho will survive this time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then a tuxedo wearing man with a lion mask replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This stage has a small number of general participants and many wolves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were told that the wolves were experts in various fields that were prepared by the organizers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were hidden among the general participants.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow many people have fallen into the pool?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFive people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Omo, omo! Then it will just be a one-sided massacre!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reaction of the opera mask was natural. Wolves had experienced the Death Circus several times.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the general participants competed with them then it would just be a one-sided massacre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. Do they know how much money we spent for this one night? There shouldn\u2019t be more than two wolves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion mask sat on a chair and yawned like he was bored.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Dozens of monitors were showing the Death Circus at the party.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The crowd was gathered here to watch the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opera mask said with a sigh,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess it can\u2019t be helped. I wanted to see a fierce fight for survival... Today I just have to drink champagne while listening to the dying screams.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I don't dislike that either. Haha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Circus was a very enjoyable spectacle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Humans killing humans. They questioned each other and took away what the person had.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a primitive pleasure that couldn\u2019t often be enjoyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They couldn\u2019t help but admire Kim Joon-young\u2019s attractions.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They could see such a fun show, a privilege of the select few.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The opera mask and lion mask drank champagne while listening to the screams, not even bothering to watch the monitors.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then someone said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, there was a tremendous ruckus right now. Is it okay not to watch it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion mask turned his gaze towards where the voice was heard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a young woman wearing a butterfly mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was in her early 20s or so?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Long hair fell to her waist and her dress exposed her chest and shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA butterfly...?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha. Is the mask cute? It is one of my favourites.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The butterfly mask saw that the lion mask was in his 50s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, that was the extent of information that was allowed to her by his mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t a CEO in his 50s, but a person wearing a lion mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Um. Well, it looks good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion mask looked at the face, where the butterfly mask only covered the eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The reason that guests wore masks was to hide their identity.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Visiting the Death Circus wasn\u2019t a hobby that they could talk about proudly, which was why it was necessary to cover their faces.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was even more enjoyable if they could visit a place where they felt like extraordinary existences.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young created a party that borrowed from a masquerade ball.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no problem seeing the other people in masks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chaebols made up 0.1% of the population of South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They often knew who a person was by the voice or shape of the body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In such cases, they pretended not to know the other person, and called them by the name of the mask they were wearing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a type of tacit rule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Circus had been going on successfully for two years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, this was the first time that a person had worn a butterfly mask that barely covered their face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Wasn\u2019t it the same as going unmasked?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion mask looked at the appearance of the butterfly mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was a considerable beauty. In addition, her chest was big. It seemed like she could be an idol singer right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Um. This is a big deal. Was there such a young girl?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion masked person laughed. Unknowingly, he started trying to figure out the identity of the butterfly mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was a place where it wasn\u2019t necessary. He could just refer to the person by the name of the mask and leave it to his desires.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion masked asked with a confused expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A ruckus? What\u2019s going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been a member of the Death Circus from the beginning, and had seen countless situations that could be considered extreme.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A young lady brutally killing others.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Someone embracing the person who betrayed them, and jumping into the acid pool together.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Numerous incidents remained in lion mask\u2019s memory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But a ruckus?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No one would be surprised if a wolf was about to eat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The sheep ate the wolf. It was a great scene!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion mask woke up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Such a momentous occasion had happened while he was drinking champagne?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-Who?! No, did they win by chance? Still, a sheep can\u2019t beat a wolf!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Butterfly mask laughed smugly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t recorded.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"S-Sob!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had missed such a great scene.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The lion mask groaned unpleasantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is it that disappointing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-It is natural. A sheep ate the wolf. This is the first time that it has happened in two years.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is still a lot of time left before closing, so do you want to watch it now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion mask shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, this is a miracle that won\u2019t happen again. They are going against pros. The miracle that allows ordinary people to win won\u2019t come easily.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that really the case?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, it\u2019s a good bet that the sheep will die. Butterfly Mask, do you know the name of the sheep?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. Tae... No, Cheol-su.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahat! Cheol-su? That is a name that appeared in a Korean book. Yes. I have to see how long he lasts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion mask slowly walked to the monitor and searched for Lee Cheol-su.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was playing poker with someone at the table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The lion mask saw the face of the opponent and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. This is interesting. Is this the revenge of the wolves?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sheep Cheol-su was confronting another wolf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe has bad luck. I never imagined that he would meet two wolves consecutively.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the butterfly mask said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t the sheep winning?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lion mask\u2019s eyes widened and he looked at the monitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t see the moment that the first miracle happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he saw the second one.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Shall I borrow this face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hid the gun and canceled Illegal Surgery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then it was like time reversed as all the blood and substances on the floor returned to his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Next, the stomach that was visible to the naked eye disappeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It only took five seconds to repair his belly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk\u2019s vision clouded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like he had opened his belly too large and had put a large strain on his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...This is the limit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Using the pain blocker didn\u2019t just mean that he wouldn\u2019t feel any pain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant that he wouldn\u2019t notice if the body\u2019s condition was worsening.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the future, he had to be careful when doing such a thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hid Kim Byung-gun in a corner of the warehouse and turned into him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Byung-gun was quite muscular but there was a superficial similarity when covered by clothes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk had to be careful when taking off his clothes and showering.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk exited the warehouse and pretended to know the other guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKim Byung-gun sunbae. Did you properly punish the rookie today? He screamed like he was dying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI need to do this sometimes or else he won\u2019t listen to me well. You should also be careful. The rumors these days aren\u2019t very good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUgh. U-Understood. By the way, the rookie?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is still blubbering in the warehouse. Don\u2019t pull him out needlessly. Maybe it is better if he is stuck in there for a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! U-Understood.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had fed him a sleeping pill, so he should be out for at least half a day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had verified the efficiency using Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he didn\u2019t forget the security card that Kim Byung-gun had.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was now free to roam around the interior of the prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then shall I gather everyone together?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho scratched his ears and murmured,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who is talking about me? Why do my ears tickle? Fuck, why do I need to wash poop-stained underwear here? If I had escaped Blue Dragon Prison as planned, then I would be sticking a knife in that cocky detective right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he was in Blue Dragon Prison, he had strangely slept all day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">By the time he woke up, the prison was crushed and he was being moved to Red Phoenix.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the tunnel that he dug for nearly six months was useless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think I will give up just from that? I\u2019m Yoo Cheol-ho! I will also escape from here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho muttered as he loaded dozens of prisoner uniforms into the washing machine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A new escape plan was created in his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Phoenix had one distinctive feature compared to the other three prisons.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The medical facility was much worse than the other prisons.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In particular, the special ward for mentally ill patients is operated by another prison on land.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was what Yoo Cheol-ho was aiming for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I wanted to be the first person to escape from Blue Dragon Prison. If I am in a hurry then can\u2019t I pretend to be crazy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Yoo Cheol-ho noticed a familiar person who was working alone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a middle-aged man wearing thick rimmed glasses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I forgot about him. I was supposed to watch him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason why Yoo Cheol-ho was in a rotten place like this was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He made some type of deal with the warden of Red Phoenix.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As he was always preparing to escape from prison, he acted quietly, which caused him to be treated well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what that person did in society that caused him to be imprisoned. Am I just supposed to watch and report if he does anything unusual? I\u2019m lucky that I can be rewarded for doing such a simple job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho finished doing the laundry and started to watch Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then something strange happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of the guards with a dirty and bad personality called Kim Tae-sung over.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was he trying to make Kim Tae-sung run an errand?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he couldn\u2019t ignore the smell that something was going on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho quietly followed Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk became Kim Byung-gun and called Kim Tae-sung behind the laundry.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung asked with a suspicious expression,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you have something for me to do? I\u2019m sorry, but I still have things to do, so can you tell me right away? If I don\u2019t wash all the clothes before lunch then they won\u2019t be dry until tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have a task. I came to keep the promise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? What do you mean...?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had made a promise with Kim Tae-sung in Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would break Kim Tae-sung out of prison and help him get revenge, in exchange for being provided with bombs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It has been more than a fortnight since then but had he already forgotten?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was because Kim Tae-sung wasn\u2019t expecting it at all.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Feeling hope would just lead to despair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you remember this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk turned his face sideways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-Heok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the face of the criminal Kim Cheol-su, not Kim Byung-gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I\u2019ve return to the original appearance for a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk changed back into Kim Byung-gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA-Are you P-Phantom...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you wondering what I want from you?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...T-That.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is simple. It is because I need the bombs that you can make.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung gulped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At first, he had no idea who caught him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was attacked by someone wearing a leather jacket but couldn\u2019t remember the face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once he gained consciousness, he was handcuffed by the police.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the seasons changed while in prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Quite incidentally, he heard a conversation between two guards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Bomber being sent to jail was the work of Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Kim Tae-sung was locked in thought, Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The Bomber is the only person who met both Seo Tae-hyuk and Phantom.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had caught Kim Tae-sung before he became a Noble.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that time, he couldn\u2019t change his face with \u2018Disguise\u2019, or hide his identity with the opera mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After meeting with Kim Tae-sung and confirming that he was indeed the Bomber, Tae-hyuk knocked him out with the iron pipe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What if he remembered Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s existence?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Something had to be done.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk confirmed Kim Tae-sung\u2019s psychological state with Hawk Eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'He doesn\u2019t remember my face. However, he knows that he was caught by Phantom. Did he hear it from someone?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Due to the Hawk Eyes attribute, he had a great advantage in psychological warfare.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Then you will help me escape?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course. That is why I came. I\u2019ve secured the escape route and hideout.

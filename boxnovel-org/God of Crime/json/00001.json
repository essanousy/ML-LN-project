Now, he was doing to die without seeing anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The guard had a strange thought that he found amusing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Ah.

It had already been over a year since he last saw them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">What would they talk about? He wanted to thank his younger brother for believing that he was innocent until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Did his sister, who took over as a mother when their parents died when he was a child, live happily every after?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk looked at the clock on the wall. The kimchi stew on the table was already cold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>Thump.</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk tried to make his expression as casual as possible as he heard the door opening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">forgot</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0what he was going to say when he saw the person who came in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Aigoo, Your Majesty. I\u2019m not the one you have been waiting for. I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was the familiar guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He sat down on a chair in the visitation room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"You look very uncomfortable at my appearance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t deny it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Your family.

He decided to be satisfied with this thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Then the guard smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cSeo Ha-ran ssi, Your Majesty\u2019s older sister, Seo Ha</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-ran,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0committed suicide last month.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cIs this surprising?

Oh dear, oh dear. In the end, she was fired. Furthermore, I was told that she had quite a large debt. She eventually lost her remaining assets in a multi-level marketing scheme. Thus, in the end...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\"><em>Kek kek!</em></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The guard pretended to strangle himself.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"T-that is ridiculous!\" Why would Noonim do that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Anyways,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0what happened to your younger brother?

Not long after, he disappeared. I guess he thought he was a detective. He should have known not to overrate himself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"My guess it that he is encased in concrete in a barrel drum at the bottom of the Yellow Sea.

You, who has never even killed a single ant in your life?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was the right answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">At th</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">at</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0moment, Tae-hyuk thought it was strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Until now, he thought that\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">this</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0was the guard\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">that</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0he had known for 10 years</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">; however,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0that was</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0not</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0the case. There was no such guard here. In the first place, there was no way a prison guard could know that much.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">W</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">hy did he ever think that the person before was a prison guard?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"...

In the end, I was sentenced to death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk certainly didn\u2019t kill anyone. However, the evidence was perfect. There was the CCTV taken at the crime scene. The weapon with Tae-hyuk\u2019s fingerprints on them. An eyewitness also saw him escaping the crime scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"This, damn!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">His body started shaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cWait a minute.

It felt like he really had been confined in prison as a death row inmate until yesterday.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">If it was a dream then who was he now?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk looked around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was a three pyeong room with a bunk bed and two desks. There was also a small bookcase with a simple structure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The unique dampness and mouldy smell was still the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was the room he shared with his brother Tae-min before he graduated from high school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018What? It feels like I\u2019m reminiscing about a memory that is more than 10 years old. Crazy. This is all due to that realistic dream.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">15 years had passed by in his dream</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">But in reality, only a single night had passed. Then what was this sense of incongruity?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Anyway, I am still a\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">high school</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0student, right? Not a death row inmate?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk calmed his chaotic mind and wanted to check.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Yes, a mirror!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk mindlessly searched the room for a mirror. He would resolve things after confirming his appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">If he didn\u2019t look like a high school student but a man in his 30s... Just thinking about i</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">t</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0caused him to have\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">goosebumps</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Eventually, he was able to find a small handheld\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">mirror</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cUgh. A bad taste.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The demon carved on the mirror gave off a bad feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Did we ever have a mirror like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It might belong to his younger brother.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The place where he found it was in the bookshelf used by both of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"... Phew. Fortunately, I\u2019m still a high school student.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The man in the mirror seemed to be in his late teens.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cWait a minute. What is this?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk looked around with a strange expression. However, there was nothing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He looked at the mirror again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There were a lot of strange letters on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">[Seo Tae-hyuk]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Title: God of Crime</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Rating: Commoner (Lacking conditions for upgrade)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Skills Possessed: None</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">In addition to this, a status window filled the mirro</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">r</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk laughed to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"This is a well made toy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The contents were commonly seen in popular online games.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">A person who liked things like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Inside the house, there was only Tae-min.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Either way, he was indeed a high school student.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk sighed with relief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He wasn\u2019t a falsely accused death row prisoner. He was Seo Tae-hyuk, a high school student in the 2nd grade who li</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">v</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">ed with\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">his</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0older sister and younger brother. Then he started to remember some things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Unlike his brother, who was a good student, he had a slightly delinquent appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He sometimes missed school and he couldn\u2019t exactly say that his grades were good.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Thus, he was treated as a troublemaker.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Still, at least he wasn\u2019t a high school gangster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Um. Has Tae-min already left?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He could smell\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">the scent of rice cooking from somewhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">I</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">t seemed\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">that\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">his sister, Seo Ha-ran, was preparing breakfast. He started to realize that he was hungry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Tae-hyuk! Come eat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">His sister\u2019s voice was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and headed towards the kitchen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">* \u00a0 \u00a0 * \u00a0 \u00a0 *</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes turned red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Ha-ran asked with surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"What is it? Did you have a scary dream or something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-min, who was sitting opposite to Tae-hyun, stared at him before shifting his gaze back to the English words in the book befor</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">e him</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">There wasn\u2019t much time remaining for his exam, so even the preparation time while eating was precious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Dust entered my eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The menu for breakfast was kimchi stew. There was only a little bit of tofu</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">, and</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0didn\u2019t contain a single piece of meat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Ha-ran hesitated before saying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201c... I\u2019m sorry, Noona will cook you one with meat when I get paid.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cIt really is because dust entered my eyes. A</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">lso,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0Noona\u2019s kimchi stew really is the best in the world</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">s</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">o delicious that I would want to eat it before I die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was a sincere statement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He put a spoonful into his mouth and could taste his sister\u2019s kimchi stew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was a dish that he couldn\u2019t eat in his dream, after all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Oh my, this child. You\u2019ll be late. Eat quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Ha-ran laughed as she moved her spoon. She didn\u2019t dislike Tae-hyuk\u2019s praise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Their parents had both died in an accident</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">, so</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0Ha-ran became the sole guardian of Tae-hyuk and Tae-min. Despite being a flower in her early 20s, she was working double shifts at the factory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">She didn\u2019t wear any makeup but to Tae-hyun, she was more beautiful than anyone else in the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018I\u2019ll have to get a job straight after graduating high school so I can help Noona.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Then he was startled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">A memory from his dream of being a death row prisoner popped up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018I graduated from school. I obtained a job with a private security company because I had nothing useful,\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">save</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u00a0my body. And I worked there for two years. Then...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He was framed and went to jail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018No! It's a dream, a dream! Damn...!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk turned on the TV to shake off the memories of the death row prisoner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-The prosecution is looking for the whereabouts of Yoo Cheol-ho, a prisoner who escaped from Central Prison on the 9th...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Ha-ran shook her head and made a fuss as the news of a horrible criminal was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cOmo. He still isn\u2019t caught. It was said that he might be near he</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">re</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">. Tae-hyuk, if you go outside, then only go when it is still light. If someone goes up to you then don\u2019t follow them. Do you understand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cNoona. I\u2019m grown up. And why don\u2019t you say something to Tae-min?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Tae-min is steady.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Then I\u2019m bad?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Ohuhut!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk and Tae-min were already high school students, but Ha-ran still viewed them as children.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk smiled at his sister\u2019s worry and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cBy the way. That person still hasn\u2019t been caught? He was clearly caught...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Yoo Cheol-ho. A familiar name.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He had stayed in the room next to Tae-hyuk\u2019s for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">In order words, a neighbour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Of course, that was just in my dream.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk knew why he had such a dream. It was because he kept hearing these things in the news every day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Hyung. Did you eat something bad? Yoo Cheol-ho was caught after committing seven murders three months ago, and broke out of prison just last week. So he hasn\u2019t been caught.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-min, who was eating rice quietly, interrupted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk frowned. Tae-min was interested in such things. This time, he was wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">For sure...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"What are you talking about? Yoo Cheol-ho escaped for six months and was caught after committing three more murders.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-min sighed and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Phew, Hyung. Don\u2019t just read manhwa. You should watch the news as well. Yoo Cheol-ho was caught? They are completely clueless. There is also a pretty good reward.. You must have dreamt about catching him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Wait a minute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Didn\u2019t Yoo Cheol-ho clearly get caught after his escape?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">He was a complete psycho and quite talkative.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Furthermore, he didn\u2019t sleep so he talked about his story until dawn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">After two successful breakouts, he gained the nickname \u2018King of Jailbreaks.\u2019 The place he went and how he escaped were all vivid in Tae-hyuk\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cSo Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s nickname isn\u2019t King of Jailbreaks?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-min moved his index finger to the side of his head and moved it round and round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"Hey. That isn\u2019t something you should do to your hyung!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cAh. It's already 8 o'clock. You should hurry if you don\u2019t want to be late. The student manager said he would break your legs with a paddle if you are late again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-min got up and ran to his room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Indeed, a terrible dream.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Not even the Pirate King but the King of Jailbreaks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"If the dream is correct then Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s accomplice should be caught in S City by now. But he isn\u2019t.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk unwittingly said the thought that came to his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cYou must be half-asleep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Ha-ran laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">A few minutes passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"T-Tae-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Ha-ran, who was eating while watching the news, starting shivering like she had seen a ghost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201c...

Why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\"L-look at that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Ha-ran pointed to the TV with a trembling hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">-Breaking news. The accomplice to Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s escape was caught in S City.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s mouth gaped open. He was so surprised that he didn\u2019t notice the falling spoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u2018Wait. What is this? What is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The content of the news was the same as his dream. The evidence was the same as Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s first escape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">'A dream. It's a dream! Then why is it happening in real life?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201c... Noona. Is that a rerun? This actually happened yesterday, or the day before, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cThat... a live broadcast...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">The words stabbed at Tae-hyuk\u2019s chest like a dagger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">It was a dream, so what was this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">A foresight dream? Returning to the past? Or was it just a coincidence?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Ha-ran gazed at Tae-hyuk with worried eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Tae-hyuk tried to look bright.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">\u201cHaha!

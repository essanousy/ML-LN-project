And they found us.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Visiting South Korea without anyone knowing actually made it easier for her enemies.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If she died here, it would be the end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had worked her entire life to become the boss of the Red Mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But at the end of the day, she would put her life in the hands of someone else.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a person who she didn\u2019t even know what he looked like.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne bit her lip as Semon handed over his weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon asked with a determined face,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but my top priority is protecting the Young Lady. Is it really okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It looks like you are prepared to die, but I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t have immunity to such embarrassing dialogue. You can say those words after I finish this. However, I\u2019ve only held a gun a few times.

Prove that you are a man fit to be my companion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he heard her words, Phantom walked to the window with the submachine gun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Madness was in the eyes hidden behind the white opera mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow, Bullet Time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His weapons were a PPSH-41 and a pistol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The drum cartridge was filled with 71 bullets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it would fall in 10 seconds in a shooting spree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The ammo is scarce. I need to spread it out among the targets.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hid behind a wall and used Spying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could see the detailed data of the approaching assailants.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thanks to that, he could see what they were armed with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018PPD-34s, Thompsons... It is like someone is filming a mafia movie.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were weapons used by the Soviet army during World War Two.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now they were a favourite among the Red Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hawk Eyes meant that he could read the opponents\u2019 fragmented mindset.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Phantom is inside.

These are the bullet lines? If I use the two attributes at the same time... Aren\u2019t I completely invincible?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he saw the bullet lines, his body wouldn\u2019t respond, and it would be impossible to avoid the bullets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, what if he used Bullet Time as well?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Moreover, Tae-hyuk\u2019s agility was now more than 60 points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was possible for him to move beyond the limits of a human.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once everything was combined-</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-00:00:00\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u0432\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0430 (Rush)!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone cried out and the group burst through the cafe door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk used Bullet Time.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Chiing!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a ringing in his ears and the world turned grey.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In\u2014he\u2014re.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon\u2019s scream, as he dragged Anne behind the counter, slowly reached Tae-hyuk\u2019s ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk moved his hand first.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It moved like he was within a turbulent torrent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Is it because time is slowed?

First, just concentration on avoiding the enemy\u2019s bullet lines.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t even wearing proper body armour.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t triggered Damage to Both Sides, so he should avoid being hit by the guns.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018First one!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk fired his gun towards the mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he aimed for his next target.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Dududu!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nine bullets penetrated four bodies.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Every shot hit the target.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk hid himself behind a table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hu... Bullet Time off!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once the ability was activated, time became dozens of times slower.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Moving in an accelerated state consumed a lot of power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018First of all, I have to deal with the enemies with bullet lines.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne shouted excitedly from where she was hiding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\u2026\u2026.

Then there are three bullets left in this pistol.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne and Semon ran through the gap that Tae-hyuk created.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The enemies were divided between the front and the back to narrow down the siege.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They thought it would isolate the people inside, but it just ended up dispersing their power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is an honor to be killed by me. Besides, didn\u2019t you strike first?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk once again used Bullet Time and ran out the front door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he heard a buzzing sound, like a mosquito.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An RPG-7 was being set up to attack the cafe dozens of metres away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Anti-tank rocket? As expected, they are planning to blow away the whole building. Aren\u2019t there other mafia members inside?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk aimed his gun at the person putting together the RPG-7.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2015\u2015\u2015.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The mafia was confused by the unexpected attack and looked around for Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is too slow; I almost feel like yawning. By the way, what will happen if I shoot at that missile primer?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was worth a try.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled the trigger as he avoided the bullet line by moving to the side.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Flames burst as the RPG-7 exploded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That roughly dealt with five people. Now it is time for the rest.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The mafia members rushed away as the RPG suddenly exploded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was easy to suppress them by using the rest of the bullets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk released Bullet Time and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I recommend studying from Zhuge Liang in Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After checking for any additional bullet liens nearby, he quickly headed towards the back of the cafe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The people there never dreamt that their allies at the entrance had been destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If we wait here, then the targets will come out. Make sure you don\u2019t miss a shot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk aimed at the leader who was giving instructions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-Where is the attack coming from?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard the sound of an explosion.

He will kill us all!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk deliberately didn\u2019t attack the people who were running away.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They would go home and tell of the fearsome Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he saw a number of bullet lines then he would trigger Bullet Time to avoid them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With that alone, the bullets weren\u2019t able to hit Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cM-Monster...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone cried out as he was shot in the leg.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMonster?

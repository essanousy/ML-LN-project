He wouldn\u2019t escape from her hands just yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was what she had thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled off the cloth and showed Big Mama the painting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-This...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama\u2019s eyes showed astonishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had been looking for it for several years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... The Trail of the Sunset.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama started to check if the painting was authentic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, no matter how much she looked, it was genuine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where on earth did you find this?

Tae-hyuk is right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was a stolen goods broker.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She bought stolen goods at a reasonable price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So, how much will you buy it for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama was confused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...

Isn\u2019t this worth at least two billion?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stolen goods can\u2019t receive their original price.

No matter how I think about it, I am losing profit. I will be satisfied with this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahah... Is Big Mama really damaged by this?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of a sudden, Big Mama dragged Tae-hyuk into an embrace.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A rich fragrance wafted out from her body as it became dark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Didn\u2019t you fall in love with me at first glance?

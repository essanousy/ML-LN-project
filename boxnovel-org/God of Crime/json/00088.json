I am Lee Shi-hyun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Inspector spoke to me. I am Investigator Joo Hyun-ho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Shi-hyun felt like his face was strangely familiar, despite meeting him for the first time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had definitely seen him somewhere...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you participate in the Mafia Game before?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Shi-hyun as well? It was a cable broadcasting show that did have even 1% audience ratings so not many people would recognize me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! There are some surprising fanatics. Even now, people are still asking for a second season.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see. But it is better seeing it in person instead of on the TV.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t like flashing lights so...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you want to see it now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Shi-hyun laughed at Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You won\u2019t be able to get anything out of this ajumma.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aye, what ajumma? You are now single.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Shi-hyun\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had divorced three years after her marriage and now lived alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How did you know?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho laughed and pointed to Shi-hyun\u2019s left finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is a mark on the finger of your left hand, a sign that you were wearing something there for a long time. Isn\u2019t that the finger for the wedding ring? But it has almost disappeared so you didn\u2019t just take the ring off. It means you haven\u2019t been wearing the ring for a month. In other words, Lee Shi-hyun has recently divorced and is now single.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is right. How amazing. In addition, it has been exactly a month since I got divorced... Investigator-nim needed just one look to tell?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. This is my hobby.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the basis of criminal profiling to look at a person\u2019s appearance or attire to guess their situation or psychological state.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But there was no one who did it for everyone they met on a regular basis like Joo Hyun-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho wasn\u2019t simply a genius because his head was good.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a result of his habit of analyzing everyone due to his aesthetic and paranoid tastes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s go. I\u2019m sorry for the director but he can\u2019t help being a suspect. Will it take a long time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt won\u2019t be that long.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I\u2019ll be happy to take your bag. Are they the tools required for the appraisal?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Yes, thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho took the bag and started walking, Lee Shi-hyun smiling as she gazed after him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t as much of a genius as she thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t notice that she was a spy planted by the Red Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry to see you again for something like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. If there are any doubts then it is better to make sure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can you turn off the security system so that Lee Shi-hyun can enter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes... Please wait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After arriving at the museum, Joo Hyun-ho and Lee Shi-hyun explained the matter to Kim Hyun-do and asked for his understanding.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the Rubens painting in the museum was a fake, then he would be held as a key suspect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo-Hyun-ho said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDirector, you seem very nervous. Do you know something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Kim Hyun-do\u2019s fingers shook for a moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnybody would be nervous in this situation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Is that right? Even if Director-nim was only used by the Russian mafia, you could be framed. At any rate, just trust me and watch quietly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Hyun-do...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, Tae-hyuk who changed his face using the Disguise skill, inwardly sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Psychology truly isn\u2019t a joke. I think I did well. If this was Kim Hyun-do then he might have already given away that he met Phantom.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police had come here to investigate the artworks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After becoming aware of this face, Tae-hyuk immediately wore Kim Hyun-do\u2019s clothes and used Disguise.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although there was some difference in height, that was solved by putting in some insoles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The police moved faster than I thought.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know how great Lee Shi-hyun\u2019s skills were.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if she didn\u2019t notice that the painting was a fake, she should see the initials.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she would know it was a forgery, and would undo the Red Mafia\u2019s plan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe this incident would end up with the police\u2019s victory, even if he watched from a distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, then Kim Hyun-do\u2019s position as director would be troubled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A forgery was being displayed in the museum that he managed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would be suspected as an accomplice of the Red Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was given permission to touch [Machina] that was displayed in a special area in exchange for stopping it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the police exposed the fact that the painting was a fake then he wouldn\u2019t be able to see Machina.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t help the Red Mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the painting was a fake then the police would laugh, but it would be a little difficult for Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the result was that it was real, the Red Mafia would gain enormous profits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had purchased some information from Big Mama a few days ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In four years, Tae-hyuk would be framed for killing Park Jung-hwan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But Park Jung-hwan actually died two years ago, which didn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to reveal the truth of the incident, he created the virtual criminal called Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By the way, foreign criminal organizations might be involved in Park Jung-hwan\u2019s death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Russia\u2019s Red Mafia, China\u2019s Triad and Japan\u2019s Yakuza... The real culprit of the upcoming war is hiding among them.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had smashed one of the businesses of the Triad.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe everything that he thought was a coincidence was actually a unified event.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, he didn\u2019t want to do anything that would benefit the Red Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Still, do I have no choice but to cooperate with the Red Mafia here?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s worry was solved in a strange manner.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Lee Shi-hyun, who was looking at Rubens\u2019 work with tools from her bag, had taken out a strange object.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a pair of red sunglasses, a fashion item with a primitive design.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The lens were covered with scratches from where it had been carelessly placed in the bag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk approached Lee Shi-hyun and asked her,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is the result?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think it will take a little longer to find out. However, the parchment paper is actually 500 years old and the ink is exactly the same as the original. I think Director-nim can rest assured.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the real painting?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then are those your red sunglasses? They look colorful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha. They are mine. I\u2019m a bit careless with them right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is her job to manage things like that... It smells fishy.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk knew that the hidden initials on the fake could be identified with red lenses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But why would she carry something and not use it?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, he had been watching her work and she seemed to have concluded that it was an original from the beginning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is a high possibility that she is a spy planted by the Red Mafia.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk finally figured out the Red Mafia\u2019s plan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Perhaps they allowed a smuggler of forgeries to be arrested in order to make the police move.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After the police found the fakes, they would start an investigation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The police would act to appraise the paintings.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the spy they planted would judge it as genuine and attach a certificate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After that, it could be traded for a vastly higher price.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But it would only work if the appraiser was a spy planted by the Red Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'They intended for there to be an investigation so that an authenticity label would be placed on their fakes.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk got goosebumps.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The boss of the Red Mafia was very smart.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that moment, Joo Hyun-ho interrupted Tae-hyuk and Lee Shi-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So this painting is the real thing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It isn\u2019t 100% but the possibility is high that it is real.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk worried about whether he should inform the investigator wearing a trench coat that this woman was a spy, but there was no need to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am convinced after your answer. You are a spy planted by the Red Mafia.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? W-What are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Shi-hyun exclaimed with a flustered face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In 1991, a large number of forgeries were manufactured in Russia and spread throughout the world. The way they did that was to put spies in other countries to make the fakes seem real. The level of perfection was high, but as the operation became more complicated, they were caught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no. I don\u2019t know who the Red Mafia is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho explained with a confident look.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I was suspicious from the moment I met you. No, to be precise, I live with the suspicion that everyone I meet is a criminal. First of all, Lee Shi-hyun made two mistakes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a short amount of time, Joo Hyun-ho had asked the investigations department to secure a copy of her resident registration.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had submitted it to the department after becoming an adviser.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">On it, Lee Shi-hyun had written that she had never been married.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have never married, but you said you went through a divorce? That means you weren\u2019t married in South Korea. Then from where? Moscow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnd the second mistake. You worried about the bag for 0.2 seconds before handing it to me. I\u2019m sure it was to give me your tools in order to avoid doubts... However, isn\u2019t it the same as asking a soldier for the gun?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tools for an artisan were like children to them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Who would leave it to someone else to carry due to being a little tired?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Shi-hyun sat down on the spot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAha... Ahaha! Did you say that you are Joo Hyun-ho? It seems you really are a genius. This was a perfect reasoning. By the way... Did you mention 1991? That\u2019s why you found me so easily. Remembering that far back... Really amazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho spoke while handcuffing Lee Shi-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I'm sorry but what I said about 1991 was a lie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI needed to create doubt to make the suspect easily confess.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-This demon, you tricked me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho smiled and brought Lee Shi-hyun\u2019s fingers to his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am a bad guy whose specialty is lying to women.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, the Red Mafia\u2019s spy was caught in Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s trap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, Director. Sorry for the disturbance. I will report to the inspector and come back with another appraiser.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You will come again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I have to make sure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Joo Hyun-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a man wearing Detective Columbo\u2019s trademark trench coat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The technique of reading the opponent\u2019s psychology was his best aspect.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Either way, the Red Mafia spy was arrested.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In a few days, another appraiser would come and this would be discovered as a fake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then could he use this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait... Can\u2019t I do that?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Mafia\u2019s plan had been destroyed, and he thought of a brilliant way to save Kim Hyun-do, a decent person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If it was successful then he would be able to get his hands on Machina.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slowly opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can you please listen to what I have to say?\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

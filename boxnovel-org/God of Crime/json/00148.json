I\u2019m truly very sorry about this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng\u2019s funds, which started at 1.14 billion won, suddenly increased by 200 million.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Yamaguchi and Caterina\u2019s money had been reduced by 100 million each.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi clicked his tongue as he looked at Li Zheng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I had a lot of confidence in this game, but it seems like you came up with the best winning strategy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a face that Yamaguchi badly wanted to slice apart with a samurai sword.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The fact that he couldn\u2019t do that was really unfortunate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina was also watching the game with nervous eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had to do something, but it was a situation where her head would be blown away if she did anything wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a sniper rifle outside the door, so what could she do?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It is my mistake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why didn\u2019t she notice such a simple trick?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The subordinates she brought were waiting outside the building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The rule was that only the boss and their lieutenant could enter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Finally, a weapon couldn\u2019t be brought into the casino.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This applied to all teams.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At first glance, it seemed to be a rule that aimed for competing in pure skills rather than force.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But in reality, there were gaps in the conditions that would lead to foul play.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she had been thinking calmly, then she would\u2019ve read Li Zheng\u2019s intentions when he wanted to send out their lieutenants.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Caterina and Yamaguchi had gotten carried away with their winning strategies.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, they didn\u2019t think of the simple method of \u2018threatening the opponent with a gun.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A mafia boss shouldn\u2019t use such a lowly trick.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina glared at the man aiming the gun from outside the door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He fired a bullet and destroyed a table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If Caterina didn\u2019t follow Li Zheng\u2019s words, then she would end up like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuohh, huhuhu... I won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng swept up the chips with a cheerful expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Caterina asked with a humiliated look.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can you finish it quickly? Yes. You won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A laser pointer was aimed at her head while playing the game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a horrible feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019d love to, but I can only bet a few chips at once. Still, if it continues like this then I can become first within the time limit. Oh, Girlie. You seem quite good at calculating in your head. Calculate how long it will be until I want a drink.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng smiled at Caterina with a relaxed expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was nothing she could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t blame me too much. I just brought the most useful subordinate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An emotionless dealer gave a card to Yamaguchi and Li Zheng.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thanks to the incense, the dealers would follow Yamaguchi\u2019s orders.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it was impossible for the dealers to overpower the opponents armed with guns.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, what a shame. You picked a 10. Will you forfeit straight away? You can save some time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Cough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi narrowed his eyes and coughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the Yakuza boss, who had thousands of subordinates, was just a weak old man.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would be lucky if he didn\u2019t lose his life.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, being deprived of Phantom was a very painful thing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The initiative of being active in South Korea would be passed to the opponent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In particular, the Yakuza still had something to do in South Korea so they absolutely wanted to prevent another organization from obtaining it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes. There was that number.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi closed his eyes and tried to come up with a plausible plan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a saying in Japan about turning over the table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would happen when there was an unpleasant situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Overturn the table itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">More than this...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng grabbed the chips again and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are a lot of complaints because I keep winning. Sorry. Then let\u2019s replace the players. Next, I should obtain some chips from the girl.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina swapped places with Yamaguchi silently.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Up to this point, it seemed like the fight over Phantom would end with Li Zheng\u2019s complete victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk waited for the perfect timing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bosses who participated in the mafia game didn\u2019t notice the most important condition.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was decided with mutual agreement that the game would take place in three rounds.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Regardless of the middle ranking, the person with the most chips at the end would get Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what would happen if the game ended and all of the mafias had the same amount of money?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The answer was that nothing would change.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom would continue to operate freely without belonging anywhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The mafia would have a subtle war of nerves in South Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the mafia game itself that Tae-hyuk was aiming for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEverybody has prepared one winning strategy for the mafia game. It is the same with me as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The third round was reaching its end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Right now, the mafia\u2019s money was perfectly tied at 1.43 billion won. And there was a 10 million won chip on the table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The winner of this round would be Phantom\u2019s owner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I have to go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put on the opera mask and headed to the casino.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP-Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Cough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, have you come to celebrate my victory?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng laughed as he played the last game at the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now we are on the same side. Despite the past, we should get along now! There is still something I want from Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Li Zheng would dispose of Phantom after a year or so.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Before that, he wanted to know the secret of Phantom\u2019s abilities.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">While hiding such darkness, Li Zheng welcomed Phantom with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk approached the table and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But didn\u2019t you notice one strange thing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Strange?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why is everyone in here, except for you, wearing a mask?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-That is because they are your fellow Phantoms.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is a preconceived notion. Why didn\u2019t a person with a similar victory strategy notice it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a plastic sheet folded under the opera mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After some manipulation, it became a good gas mask.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom wasn\u2019t using a plain mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, do you all understand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sent a signal and the cameramen all turned their masks into gas masks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The spellbound dealers just stared into the air blankly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Damn! Phantom deceived us!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should always be aware of the situation. Gas! Gas! Gas!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Tae-hyuk\u2019s orders, the cameramen took something out. Gray smoke poured out from it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng tried to escape the smoke but couldn\u2019t because it happened so quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow have a good sleep. Everything will have ended once you wake up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"G-Greenhorn...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom... W-Why...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi and Caterina stared at Phantom with confused eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it didn\u2019t last long.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The powerful sleeping gas put them to sleep in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng was fast asleep without being able to protest the unfairness of the situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk placed the remaining red chip on the table into his pocket and muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"After the game is over, the chip left on the table is a tip right? There is still a little bit until the end. It will be tough to break them before that, so I will use the tip well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng, Yamaguchi and Caterina all had 1.43 billion won in chips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there were still 10 minutes until the mafia game finished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes. Shall I play doctor while I am bored waiting?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom brought out a surgical tool.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk alternated between looking at it and at the mafia bosses collapsed on the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he laughed like a criminal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Illegal Surgery.

But what should I do? The game time ran out while you were sleeping.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y-Y-You put us to sleep with a gas!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled gently at Li Zheng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can you say that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a reminder that he had threatened the other bosses with guns just two hours ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He never thought he would be the one tricked.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Li Zheng\u2019s anger boiled up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s do the final closing. The Triad has 1.43 billion.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Yakuza has 1.43 billion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cK-Kuhuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Red Mafia has 1.43 billion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk declared proudly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnbelievable! Coincidentally, all three teams have tied. The game is null and void.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi and Li Zheng dropped their heads after realizing they had lost the game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They never thought that at the last minute...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Caterina quietly said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN-No Phantom. The game can\u2019t end in a tie. Clearly, the total betting amount if 4.3 billion. Once divided between teams, there should be 10 million won left.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, that 10 million won? The chip left at the table is the dealer\u2019s tip. I am grateful for it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina had the most desire for Phantom among the three people so she stuck to it until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t that just the case in a regular casino?

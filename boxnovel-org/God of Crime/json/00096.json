They thought that despite the fact that he had a gun, he was still a human, and could be beaten. When they failed, I really thought that I would die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A reporter holding a microphone asked from next to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen he appeared?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. He emerged from a place that the terrorist never expected.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporter knew the outline of the case, but shivered and pretended ignorance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did he break through the ceiling?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNope. He was mixed in among the hostages. The person that the culprit thought was ordinary suddenly pulled out a phantom mask and put it on his face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhu... Then did you see the Phantom\u2019s face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t think it is his original face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The woman hesitated for a moment before replying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That...there was a man who was groaning next to me, and Phantom had the same face as him. They obviously aren\u2019t twins... Maybe Phantom has the ability to disguise himself with another\u2019s face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Perhaps it is special makeup or something like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t know. Then he suddenly pulled an iron pipe from somewhere and started fighting the terrorist.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe fought that monster with an iron pipe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is certainly a famous weapon, but using it to fight a terrorist armed with powerful weapons... It sounds a little reckless.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI thought so as well. No matter how great Phantom is, I thought that he couldn\u2019t beat a gun with an iron pipe. Then an amazing thing happened. The terrorist shot Phantom\u2019s face... Blood appeared on the face of the shooter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Changing his face could be explained with special makeup.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, not only did he survive a gunshot, but he also wounded the opponent?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a mystery that was impossible to prove with modern science.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporter finished the interview with some last words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you for the good words in the midst of the confusion. Then, let\u2019s connect to a correspondent who will take you inside the building where the incident took place. Now, shall we see how the Phantom fought the terrorist? Come out!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The screen faded out before changing scenes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho turned off the TV from where he was lying down on the ICU bed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn. Phantom came to my rescue, but I couldn\u2019t interview him properly... I\u2019m not qualified as a journalist.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwon Joon-hyuk, who was lying on the next bed, raised his body half-way up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems so. It would\u2019ve been a much more plausible scene if you were there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, didn\u2019t Phantom know my heart? He risked his life in order to protect me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha? Really?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwon Joon-hyuk barely refrained from saying the words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ugh... There is no time for this. Ask the doctor when I can be discharged. If I can just get an exclusive interview then the ratings...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t changed despite almost dying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was still Shin Se-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwon Joon-hyuk sighed and quietly muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo... It is the same as you smearing dung on the wall. Can you really catch that guy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately for Shin Se-ho, he wouldn\u2019t get the desired interview with Phantom for some time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When I think about it again, this skill it too crazy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was lying on a bed and looking at the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t aware due to the anesthetic, but he had suffered serious injuries.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if the damage was decreased by half, he was still shot at close range.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His shoulder bones were broken and the muscles had ruptured.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After an X-ray, the doctor said that it was amazing that he was still alive.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk recalled the situation at that time and shivered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I was definitely shot in the head... If it wasn\u2019t for the skill then I would be riding the express train to hell.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The doctor said that his skull was cracked and the optic nerve shocked.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For the time being, more medical treatment was needed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just lying still would cause him to feel dizzy and nauseous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When he closed his eyes, he would see something like flashing lights.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For a while, it felt like he was treated as a dead rat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hospital where Tae-hyuk was resting in didn\u2019t have any signs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a place for criminals who couldn\u2019t go to a proper hospital, or those who needed illegal treatments.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The facility was unexpectedly very neat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Despite\u00a0the lack of signs, it was better than a general neighborhood hospital.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSeo Tae-hyuk. It is time for your regular checkup.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door opened and a man with thick horned glassed entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was Tae-hyuk\u2019s primary doctor, Jung Eui-do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is there any particular place where you are feeling pain?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A nurse with a brusque expression untied the bandage wrapped around Tae-hyuk\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Jung Eui-do asked with shining eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You said that you rolled down the stairs right? You weren\u2019t shot with a gun?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk replied with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I really did roll down the stairs. I thought you didn\u2019t ask that type of thing here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo... I\u2019m sorry. I have been working here as a doctor for a long time, but I can\u2019t help my curiosity.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you normally do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I am a specialist in abortions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was surprisingly easy to find unlicensed doctors in South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of them did simple cosmetic surgery or abortions.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In South Korea, having an abortion was an illegal procedure, so a back alley doctor was required for it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The reason why the facility is so well-equipped...'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung Eui-do was a really chatty doctor, which was why Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t need to ask anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is okay until 10 weeks. The fetus starts to swell as arms and legs start forming, and after 25 weeks, it almost feels like I am killing a person instead of doing an abortion. Ah right, our hospital will do abortions up to 36 weeks. If you know anyone who needs one then please contact me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung Eui-do smiled and pulled out a business card.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk accepted it with a laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201836 weeks is almost murder.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe this doctor had killed more people than the murderer he fought a week ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Since the medical treatment would take some time, Jung Eui-do continued to talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When I\u2019m here at night, I think I hear the sound of babies crying. Don\u2019t you think that is strange?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk ignored Jung Eui-do and looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the contents of the story couldn\u2019t be ignored.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In fact, it has been 100 years since the building where this hospital is was built. It used to be the headquarters of the Japanese army. In the basement, prisoners were tortured and killed every day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...The Japanese?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. After Korean became independent, they rushed away in a hurry, leaving something great hidden here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It might be dismissed as a ghost story told about an old building, but Tae-hyuk had heard this somewhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was clearly a memory from the future...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So maybe he might find a clue in Jung Eui-do\u2019s story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put the Demon Revealing Mirror away and focused on the doctor\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is hidden?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. The Japanese gathered gold in South Korea and turned them into gold bullions. Then they buried them somewhere... This place...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Surely the gold wasn\u2019t here?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When considering the Japanese army, that gold would be worth tens of billions of won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGold...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I guessed there were clues leading to the hidden location, so I hired people and searched all over the place. But it looks like I was duped by the person who sold me the building. Ahahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, it is a common ghost story. At any rate, it was interesting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung Eui-do finished the examination of Tae-hyuk and explained the results with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you eat any wild ginseng? The bones are already almost restored. I think you can be discharged in two weeks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am better than wild ginseng. I can\u2019t die that easily.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, you have a great resilience.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was really fortunate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Jung Eui-do made a few more jokes before leaving the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was left alone to think quietly with a very serious expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be nice if it was a story that could be ignored.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Japanese fleeing without their treasure.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They left clues behind to where it was buried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The old Japanese army... Wasn\u2019t there something like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk had memories of the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were definitely something about the Japanese army in it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Was it two years later?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some gold that the Japanese army hid was found, causing the whole country to become noisy for a while.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The full amount was returned to the nation\u2019s treasury, with the finder only being given 50 million won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I forgot the spot where it was discovered...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Jung Eui-do\u2019s story was true...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe Tae-hyuk could find something enormous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWasn\u2019t the original finder only given a pittance? But if I were the one to find it...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could swallow it up alone without the government noticing!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He never imagined that his future memories would help in this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am going to be here for a while anyway... Should I start searching for a treasure map?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gold was said to be discovered by chance when the building was renovated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If so, the clue was hidden in a place with no light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A treasure map that no one else has found. Isn\u2019t this amazing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes lit up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, there would be no damages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Jung Eui-do said he searched this area but couldn\u2019t find it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was obviously quite disappointed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was probably why he told his patients the story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk had the crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn this case, I can use the Spying skill.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every day was so idle that hospital life seemed very enjoyable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk gathered at Kim Do-shik\u2019s call.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wondered if Kim Do-shik wanted him to contact Phantom again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. Now I dream of a phantom mask every night... Isn\u2019t this terrible?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the fight against the terrorist, the pressure from above to catch Phantom had increased, but they were unable to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, Detective Cho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but there has been no contact from Phantom...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like you\u2019re going to have a nervous breakdown. I'm sorry but this time it isn\u2019t because of Phantom. A letter came for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA letter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was baffled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t part of the general affairs section, so why would someone send a letter to him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. Park Sung-yul sent it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Park Sung-yul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first heinous criminal that he caught.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for brutally murdering a woman in her 40s.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Read it first.

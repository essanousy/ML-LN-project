That is scary. How can I even go to school tomorrow...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, you are both wrong. Isn\u2019t that statement more believable when applied to the gangster Seo Tae-hyuk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, perhaps. I heard that he had an offer to join an organization after graduating...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA-A gangster?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rumours snowballed into something bigger and inconceivable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The main party involved, Tae-hyuk, was in the library and not in the classroom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was impressed by An Eun-young\u2019s effort.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEun-young, really, thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dark circles could be seen behind An Eun-young\u2019s thick glasses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had obviously spent the night trying to make this happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-It is nothing much... It is nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this well without you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk now had 47 intelligence points, the result of focusing solely on studying after he regained Rosario from Big Mama.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how hard he had tried, it could still be said that this really was a period of rapid growth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would have happened if he hadn\u2019t met An Eun-young?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His intelligence had \u00a0climbed even faster than it had in the beginning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The retest was in two hours.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the meantime, he had to memorize many things in preparation of the test.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018In my most recent test, I had an average of 90 points. If I memorize all of the things that Class President brought up then...'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It might really be possible to get close to the first ranked in the school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... T-then. This is the last study session. Try your best! Fighting!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young cheered with a raised fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, she looked so cute that Tae-hyuk felt his heart pounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm hmm. Yes. Isn\u2019t it somewhat unsatisfactory that this is the last time? Then, please look after me well, Class President.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young pouted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"C-Call me Eun-young.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at her with a bemused expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, okay... E-Eun-young. Is this it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Thank you. Then, let's get started.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The student sessions of Seo Tae-hyuk and An Eun-young were ending.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSeo Tae-hyuk. Did you study a lot?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The student supervisor asked with a strangely irritated tone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed that he didn\u2019t like the fact that Park Sung-kwang dropped out while a problematic person remained.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He got a bribe from Park Sung-kwang\u2019s parents based on his graduation results. </span><span style=\"\">One of his precious money sources had disappeared because of a gangster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Therefore, there was hatred in the student advisor\u2019s eyes as he watched Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am a little busy. Just do it as usual.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCocky brat... Teacher Jung believes in you, but I am different. Frankly, it was hard to believe that you got that grade legitimately, so this retest is to make things certain. Do you have any objections?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If there are any doubts, then it has to become certain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, right. You haven\u2019t received any lessons for a month. The test range is the same as the last test. I told the teachers to pay special attention, so I think this will be a very interesting test.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Inside the classroom, there was only the student advisor and Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have decided to supervise all of your tests today. Do you know what will happen if I see your eyes looking around? Well, I don\u2019t think that someone who was first place in the school would do that. Hahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk placed his pens on the desk and prepared for the test.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the student advisor approached with gleaming eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let me take a look.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The student advisor confirmed that Tae-hyuk hadn\u2019t hidden any cheat sheets in his desk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he carefully looked at the pens and clicked his tongue.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a complete criminal treatment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sheesh. Then, the first one is Korean Language. The time limit is 50 minutes. If you write even one word after the time limit is up, then you will get a zero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course. Then I will start.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk accepted the test paper with a very relaxed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rather, it was the student advisor who cared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had received a bribe from Park Sung-kwang\u2019s parents. It was a moderate sum.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, this fact was already noticed by Seo Tae-hyuk. He wanted to kick Seo Tae-hyuk out of school somehow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to do that, everything hinged on this retest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The student advisor didn\u2019t know what method Seo Tae-hyuk would use to raise his grades. </span><span style=\"\">However, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything as long as he was monitored closely. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The student advisor laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In fact, this test was much more difficult than the last one.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were many traps, and the problems were completely different from the last test\u2019s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he only got 80 points this time, then the student advisor would be able to transfer him to another school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk waited for the test with a bored face, like he didn\u2019t know what the student advisor was thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then, let\u2019s start the test!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The student advisor announced the start of the test.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk once again admired An Eun-young\u2019s ability after seeing the test paper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wah. Wasn\u2019t Class President right?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young predicted that this test would be a lot harder than the test a month ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the right answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problems were at least a level greater in difficulty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Ah, don\u2019t I know this problem?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, almost all of them were already given out by An Eun-young.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like he knew all of the problems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018... As expected from the owner of the Studying skill.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk started to solve the problems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed as if he would be able to get a higher score than he thought.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tests were all finished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The student advisor sat at his desk with a blank face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-How did you do all of this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Skimming through the questions, he could see that most of the answers were correct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The student advisor screamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-This test is invalid! Tell me! How the hell did you cheat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stretched his neck that had grown stiff from sitting around all day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he looked at the student advisor and sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You were looking at me the whole time while I was testing. I didn\u2019t cheat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-This bastard!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The agitated student advisor tried to hit Tae-hyuk with the baton that he was holding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, the firmly closed door opened and Teacher Jung Nam-ho entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSeo Tae-hyuk! You better hope that you did well on the test! I came to score it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Teacher Jung Nam-ho greeted Tae-hyuk and then looked at the student advisor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStudent advisor-nim. You did a really good job. From now on, I will take care of the scoring.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The student advisor flopped down with a dumbfounded expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He repeatedly opened and closed his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wait a minute. Isn\u2019t it unfair with Seo Tae-hyuk in here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled at Jung Nam-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I will go out and wait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He left the classroom and saw An Eun-young waiting with an anxious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had done everything she could. The only thing left was to wait like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tae-hyuk... The test?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a \u2018V\u2019 sign with his fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Waaaaahhhhh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young was as delighted, as if it were the fruits of her own labor.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Jjak!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people laughed and high-fived.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The results of Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s test were released to the whole school the very next day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant that he attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-That is ridiculous...!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people who saw Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s results attached to the bulletin board were confused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had an average of 92 points, and had moved up to second ranked in the class.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was also seventh ranked in the school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, other students didn\u2019t realize that Tae-hyuk\u2019s test was more difficult than usual due to the student advisor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nevertheless, it really was an excellent grade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The students at the front of the bulletin board left, and Seo Tae-hyuk and An Eun-young approached to check the score.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a surprised expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young spontaneous asked a question, as if she suddenly had a thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If this test was at the same difficulty as the other one... what rank would you be?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk answered confidently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First.\"</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was an uproar once it was announced that Seo Tae-hyuk was really a model student.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Seo Tae-hyuk really was a good student...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Besides, to achieve a rank of seventh in the school...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then Tae-hyuk is good at studying, and his face is also pretty good...

Next year is our third year, so this winter is my last chance at love!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The girls who stayed in the classroom talked and exclaimed joyfully.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, there were quite a few people attracted to Tae-hyuk\u2019s poor appearance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, their eyes didn\u2019t dare to actively gaze at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It turned out that while his appearance that looked villainous,he was actually good at studying?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was like the protagonist of a romance novel! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as class ended, Seo Tae-hyuk headed home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young remained in the classroom due to her position of class president, and could hear the girls talking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s evaluation had changed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was obviously a situation worthy of congratulations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then why was she in a bad mood?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young remembered the treatment that Tae-hyuk had received up until yesterday.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was the only one who knew that he wasn\u2019t bad at all, unlike the rumours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his test results were good, and this seemed to change his status.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She felt strangely lonely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the classroom, the girls were arguing about who was going to first make contact with Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was at that moment that An Eun-young rose from her seat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She walked over to the female students and said loudly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't be mistaken. Seo Tae-hyuk doesn\u2019t have time for a relationship with any of you, as he has decided to go to university with me.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone in the room fell silent at An Eun-young\u2019s declaration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It sounded like a declaration of war saying that they shouldn\u2019t touch her property. </span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The day that Tae-hyuk received the remaining balance from Big Mama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk was dressed in a slightly different style than usual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Today was the day that he had to go to school, something he hadn\u2019t done in a long time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, Tae-hyuk was still wearing his uniform.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have to go into the back alleys so...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, he decided to buy clothes from a store that mainly sold vintage styles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He asked the clerk to give him a recommendation and changed in the store.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Viewed separately, they weren't strange clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes shook as he saw his reflection in the mirror. </span><span style=\"\">He wore skinny jeans with a black leather jacket. </span><span style=\"\">Adding the shoes to the outfit really made him look like a biker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What the hell is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he bought it at such a low price that he couldn\u2019t get a refund.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, it was style that fit in naturally with the back alleys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, Hyung!

But why? I strangely feel like I\u2019ve met you somewhere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was the one who put him in here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, Tae-hyuk had no intention of telling that to the Bomber.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis world is very small. Perhaps we met in passing somewhere?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm... Indeed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched his chin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">TV was also available in prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it didn\u2019t mean that they could see the latest entertainment programs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Only one \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 channel was broadcasted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of them were documentaries and cultural programs selected by the Department of Justice\u2019s correctional program.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They could also only watch it for a certain period of time before going to bed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the only news from the outside world were sometimes edited news on the Enlightenment channel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The man who bombed Taesung Group for revenge didn\u2019t know the ending of his story.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was what Tae-hyuk was aiming for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are a really interesting person. You are the only one crazy enough to do such a ridiculous thing to get revenge on a big company.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung\u2019s mouth twitched.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An emotion appeared for the first time on the middle-aged man\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Kim Tae-sung wasn\u2019t the type to come alive over such a thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I am finished eating. I will get up first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I just arrived in this place, so I know some information about the outside world. You will become motivated if you listen to me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung, who was about to rise from his seat, looked at Tae-hyuk with a cold expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What could possibly change his heart?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He put the tray back on the table and pulled canned peaches out of his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I ate rice and now I feel like eating fruit. Would you like one?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will eat it thankfully.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung placed the peach on Tae-hyuk\u2019s plate with no expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk cut it in half with a spoon and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Taesung Group was developing a new virus. You would be more familiar with this fact than anyone else.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A variety of expressions crossed Kim Tae-sung\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You didn\u2019t mean to expose it in the first place. You had to give up everything you built as a senior researcher. However, the finished virus was more of a monster than you thought.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke the truth about the Taesung case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then you went through a change of heart. You risked your life to expose the truth of what Taesung Group did to the media. I'm sorry but I don\u2019t know what happened in the process; I just know the results.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Taesung Group realized Kim Tae-sung\u2019s betrayal and tried to stop him by taking his family as hostages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But there was an unexpected event in Taesung Group. The virus used to hold them hostage had mutated. In the end, the prepared vaccine didn\u2019t work and your family died.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung\u2019s hands shook.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how many years passed, the anger still remained in his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Correct. Thus, the Bomber was born, and I killed innocent people to get revenge for my family. In the end, this happened. I don\u2019t know why anyone would be interested in the story where everyone was wounded and destroyed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBomber. You're mistaken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is still too early in the story. You thought you succeeded in your revenge but then you went to jail...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stopped for a moment and looked into Kim Tae-sung\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the look disappeared as he started speaking again,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I know what happened to the Taesung Group after that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you know then I would like to hear it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the first time, longing appeared in his voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said with a satisfied expression,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the world. It is never fair. You sinned and got stuck in here. However, not all criminals go to jail.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It can\u2019t be.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. The data that you risked your life to get, disappeared due to the carelessness of a manager.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-That...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung had created a bomb to smash Taesung Group.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, that wasn\u2019t enough to make a Korean conglomerate crumble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"And Taesung Group\u2019s president, Song Won-jin was released a little while ago. A senior researcher committed suicide, leaving a suicide note stating that he did everything on his own. In the end, the arrested Taesung Group officials only had to pay a fine. How much would that amount be?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c200 million. That is the value of the lives of your family and the researchers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Ahhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung suddenly screamed, causing the prisoners nearby to jump.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why is he doing that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPeople become crazy after staying here a while. Leave it alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk whispered to Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen what should you do? You can\u2019t get out of here until you die. The executives of Taesung Group have already returned to the company like nothing happened, and the mass media didn\u2019t report it so the interest of the public gradually disappeared. They just dimly remember that there was a crazy bomber. Is it okay to end it like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I, what...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour revenge failed because you thought this world was just. You thought the opponent would be judged before you exposed their sins? But this is South Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuhuuuok...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t you want to take revenge for their actions? This time, don\u2019t rely on the media and police and judge them directly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung bit his lip.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he could, he would\u2019ve laughed and died on the spot rather than going to prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Kim Tae-sung wasn\u2019t stupid enough to just believe the other person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it possible?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. To make a deal, I will show my hand first. I will tell you more tonight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? We are in the cells at night...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So then wait for me there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit the other half of the peach.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His tongue enjoyed the sweet taste of the sugar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That night, Kim Tae-sung opened his mouth and looked at the other person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Cheol-su entered the cell dressed in the clothes of a guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This is a long-term use.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung promised to cooperate with Tae-hyuk in return for breaking him out and help in getting revenge on Taesung Group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He can make a big bomb that blows up buildings.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The four bombs he left behind had been very useful in the past few months.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But could he supplement it?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was enough with the crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the note given to him by Kim Tae-sung.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It contained the ingredients needed to make a bomb.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung promised that he could create a significant explosion in the prison with these things.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was aware of his skills more than anyone else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It will be busy tonight.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk checked on Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s state, who was completely asleep, and entered the tunnel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t forget to take the keys hidden by the entrance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had snatched it away from a new guard a few days ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard would be suffering after knowing he lost it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After leaving the cell, Tae-hyuk grasped the position of the guards with Spying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had a lot to do tonight. First, he had to collect the bomb materials and then steal the faces of the remaining guards for a full-scale war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Up to now, Tae-hyuk could imitate the faces of five guards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was impossible to completely disguise as them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guards walked around when they weren\u2019t working, so something could go wrong if he accidentally ran into them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A greater variation of disguises was needed to ensure his safety.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would double the number tonight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk changed his clothing with Counterfeit and disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Four days have passed since the meals had first changed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The complaints of the prisoners became severe enough to pop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was currently the fun exercise time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Exercise time was for only 60 minutes a day, and was a very precious time for the prisoners.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the only chance for them to experience the cool air and move their bodies freely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As usual, people with similar minds gathered together to play badminton or basketball.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, they hadn\u2019t been able to eat a proper meal for days.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only inmates jumping around were the foreigners.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The South Korean inmates huddled in a corner and swore at the guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes this make sense? We are the only ones being starved.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That guard over there is about to throw his food away. Can\u2019t he sprinkle some leftovers on my rice?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow, those evil bastards. Isn\u2019t this too much?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I was sniffing around the kitchen and discovered a guard eating. Fuck... I thought all the corn was gone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I will get those bastards fired as soon as I am out of here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen are you going to finish? Take me as well. I just extended...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bloody conversation was over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, the anger towards the guards would\u2019ve already subsided.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But since yesterday, the behaviour of the guards became especially bad.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The warden had issued an order a few days ago not to agitate the nerves of the prisoners, yet some crazy guards still continued their tyranny.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho looked at the agitated prisoners with serious eyes from a corner of the playground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His bodyguard said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Cheol-su was right. The guards are acting ridiculous and the complaints of the prisoners are skyrocketing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho muttered with a groan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt more like a war with the prison guards instead of the Japanese.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There really might be a war, but it still lacks the fire. Three days... We just need to wait three days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guards were armed with stun guns and gas guns.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If Shin Chang-ho made a mistake here, then he would be punished with solitary confinement.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But no matter how angry the prisoners were, they wouldn\u2019t explode without a trigger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Please keep quiet...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho closed his eyes and begged.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the fires of war broke out from a very small place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for dinner, and the menu was once again the same old porridge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now it was too exhausting to even complain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck, again? Then I should eat the one I was saving.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Prisoner 974 pulled out the sausage he had been hiding.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the precious emergency food he got from the store.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He started to peel it in order to eat it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But with perfect timing, one of the guards struck his arm.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The sausage fell and rolled on the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Number 947\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cM-My sausage!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, the skin area was touching the ground so he could still eat it if he cut a little bit off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I'm sorry. The precious sausage is gone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard laughed and stepped on 974\u2019s hand that was stretching to pick up the sausage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">974 screamed as his hand and sausage were stepped on at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, sorry... I wasn\u2019t expecting you to pick it up to eat. Well. I think you can still eat it if you clean it well. Haha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, 974 couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and exploded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFucking bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Bam!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He punched the guard who stepped on his fingers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the watching guards ran over with their rods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou over there! What are you doing now? Put him in solitary!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah? Solitary? I don\u2019t care about that anymore! Just let me kill this bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Number 974 slapped at one of the guard\u2019s rods.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It struck the face of the prisoner sitting next to him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the inmates nearby joined in the fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKill them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaaack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fuuuuuckers!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the guards who ran over to stop them got involved in the struggle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the war between prisoners and guards started with one sausage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard who stepped on the sausage had a nosebleed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he smiled and licked his lips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guard muttered in a small voice,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2014As planned.\"</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

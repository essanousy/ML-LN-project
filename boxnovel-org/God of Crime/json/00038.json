Therefore, his contacts were organized by category.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"A total of 19 people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was more than he thought.\u00a0</span>First, he had to find out who was protecting the entrance to the bathroom.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018I would be nice if he had a badge with a name on it. Do I need to check them all?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk called the cops in Kang-suk\u2019s contacts.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Dururu-</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Who is it?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Is this Hae-un\u2019s phone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-No.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAh... I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk repeated the same thing 10 times before he found the right cop.\u00a0</span>As the phone signal rang, the phone of the cop in front of him started ringing.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018He is Kim Jong-wook!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk imitated Cho Kang-suk\u2019s voice using Voice Modulation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Kim Jong-wook? It\u2019s me, Detective Cho Kang-suk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">Eh!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Detective Cho Kang-suk!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">What is going on?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk inwardly cheered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Indeed, a cop should know the police officers in charge of this case.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I think I left my phone behind while investigating the crime scene, can you take a look at the counter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Yes, I understand.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I will do so straight away!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kim Jong-wook followed Cho Kang-suk\u2019s instructions and disappeared in the direction of the bathroom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He was holding a flashlight. It looked good from a distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Then, let\u2019s go!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk avoided the cops\u2019 eyes as much as possible as he stealthily crept up to the crime scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'By the way, their salaries... What about their pensions?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He moved on to thinking about happy things for Ha-ran\u2019s future.\u00a0</span>The bathroom where the murder took place had crime scene tape all around the entrance.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He was wearing a leather jacket and skinny jeans, with an iron pipe in one hand.\u00a0</span>He had the perfect appearance of a criminal.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Once the \u2018Violence\u2019 skill was activated, his physical abilities increased according to his physical stats.\u00a0</span>He couldn\u2019t help but wonder what would happen.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Uh, I don\u2019t want to be arrested as the criminal right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Despite having little to no knowledge of criminal profiling, Seo Tae-hyuk knew one fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was something frequently covered in crime novels and movies: a criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!\u00a0</span>This was why the police were stationed at where the second murder took place. Therefore, he had to hide if he didn\u2019t want any unusual misunderstandings to take place.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk looked at the iron pipe that he was holding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well, hopefully I won\u2019t have to use this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The body was found was in the women\u2019s bathroom.\u00a0</span>There was a strange atmosphere, due to it being a place where a person had died. The evidence collected by the police left a dust trail.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> However, according to the blacklist, there was definitely one thing remaining.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The bathroom was empty of water.\u00a0</span>Instead, the shape of a person crouching down was drawn with a white spray.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk felt goosebumps as he saw it.\u00a0</span>Three weeks ago, someone had died in the exact same position as the picture.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk took out a notebook from his pocket and used the Forgery skill to draw the crime scene as a reference.\u00a0</span>At that moment, a strange illusion emerged in front of Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cUgh... W-what? Aaaaack!\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was a naked woman with her arms tied behind her back, her body was trapped in a bathtub full of water.\u00a0</span>Her neck was tied up, and she couldn\u2019t move her head. Still, she was able to breathe due to the long tube in her mouth. And the tube...</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHeok... Keok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk started breathing roughly. He couldn\u2019t even understand what he had just seen.\u00a0</span>He had just used the Forgery skill, so why did that image appear?</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The Forgery skill has found an intense image.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [The work has been completed through automatic mode.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at his notebook, as if he was enchanted by something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was a picture of a dying woman that had been created by the Forgery skill in less than a minute.\u00a0</span>The picture was drawn with a pen, and yet it seemed so real.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Uck...!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> At that moment, Tae-hyuk bent over as he felt some nausea.\u00a0</span>Fortunately, he hadn\u2019t eaten dinner yet. He just felt a little sick.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk knew extrasensory perceptions were similar to this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It was psychometry...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The ability to see images from objects and places.\u00a0</span>The Forgery skill was similar to that.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> However, he couldn\u2019t rejoice.\u00a0</span>The image of the person dying was intensely burnt into Tae-hyuk\u2019s brain. It seemed like the scene would emerge every time he closed his eyes, like a curse.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He had come here to confirm if the killer was truly the \u2018hippo.\u2019\u00a0</span>It wasn\u2019t to see a woman dying.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> This had happened almost one month ago, he wouldn\u2019t be found right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018... First of all, let\u2019s finish up here.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk shook his head to forget the scene he just saw.\u00a0</span>He entered the bathroom. If the killer was truly the hippo, then it had to be here.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk leaned down towards the floor.\u00a0</span>He started to carefully search it. Sometimes there was a white powder visible in the water. It was creepy, but he licked it.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cThis...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was salt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> No matter how good the police were, it wasn\u2019t easy to find it mixed in with the water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The murder tool is salt water...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk was reminded of that person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... The hippo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Originally, he was a serial killer who would start his activities in three months.\u00a0</span>He was one of the worst five criminals in Tae-hyuk\u2019s blacklist. He had awakened earlier than scheduled.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk then had a sudden realization: he was currently the only one in the country who knew the Hippo\u2019s identity.</span></p><br/><p>@</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk looked at his watch with an anxious expression.\u00a0</span>15 minutes had passed since the promised meeting time.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"This is why punctuality is a problem in Korea!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He pulled out his phone and checked the message that had arrived 30 minutes ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">Sunbae.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I am leaving now.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I\u2019ll be there in 10 minutes.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"That was more than 10 minutes ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk finished his lukewarm coffee and went to the counter to get a refill.</span>Thanks to his younger brother, he realized that this cafe was a very good place for meeting people. He had been using it often since then.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk took out the envelop that Tae-hyuk gave him as a gift.\u00a0</span>It was a planetarium admission ticket that was available for one month. On the back was the phone number of a French restaurant with a good atmosphere. It meant to eat here after seeing the stars.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk couldn\u2019t help laughing after seeing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Who wouldn\u2019t want to go? If only I didn\u2019t have to catch this criminal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk said and put the tickets back in his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Who knows? Maybe the serial killer would suddenly be arrested and he could go out with Ha-ran.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"There is time left. If I send a message to Ha-ran... But what if I am an annoyance? Ohh...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk grabbed his head as his body trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The other guests at the cafe started looking at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">Ah, doesn\u2019t he look like a gangster?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">Looking at his phone and then trembling...</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Don't tell me?'</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Shhh! Be quiet!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">He will hear!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk laughed. Today, he had come to meet a guest. Therefore, he was wearing a suit that didn\u2019t fit him well.\u00a0</span>He had a large muscular body and was over 180cm tall. He had dark sunglasses. At first glance, it was natural for others to misinterpret his strength.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then the man sitting near Kang-suk spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Excuse me, excuse me... Cho Kang-suk hyung-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk looked at the person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The man was wearing casual attire and had glasses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Who?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Oh, sorry for introducing myself so late. I am Shin Se-ho, a PD at ABS Station.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Shin Se-ho pulled out a business card from his wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You are a new PD.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHaha. You don\u2019t need to emphasize it. I\u2019m familiar with you. Detective Cho is very famous among my colleagues. The detective who caught Yoo Cheol-ho. This meeting was due to chance. Then can I hear the story about that time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk clicked his tongue. What chance? He knew the PD had been following him for a few days. \u00a0Shin Se-ho seated himself in front of Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk knew why the PD was following him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He smelt the hippo case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I'm sorry, but today I came to meet a junior, not to work. If you want an interview then please fill out the official forms.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Aish, don\u2019t be like that. Anyway, I\u2019m here as a customer. So I will just drink hot chocolate from the sidelines.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk noticed the microphone in Shin Se-ho\u2019s pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He suddenly felt fatigued.\u00a0</span>It was hard to fight crime. Now he had to pay attention to the media as well.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk whipped his hand like he was killing a mosquito.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He would receive media persecution if he tried to kick the reporter out of here. He needed to be careful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well, do whatever you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHaha. Yes. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then the door opened and someone entered the cafe.\u00a0</span>The person was a little taller than Kang-suk, with an intellectual air about him. He was wearing a Rolex watch and an Armani suit. A BMW key was hanging from his fingers.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk clicked his tongue. He was wearing at least 20 million won, and had their air of a rich person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Joo Hyun-ho! Over here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Uh, Sunbae. Aren\u2019t I a little bit late? I'm sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cWhat is a little bit? I refilled my coffee five times while waiting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Aish. I was only a few minutes late. There was nowhere to park.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho smiled and sat down in front of Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho had the appearance of a celebrity in a high class suit so the eyes of the females sitting nearby started to light up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> They wanted to talk to him but stopped themselves when they saw Kang-suk sitting opposite him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho was a junior from Kang-suk\u2019s university days.\u00a0</span>He majored in criminal psychology and worked in the criminal behaviour analysis team.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The so-called profiler.\u00a0</span>In this field, he was one of the three most influential profilers in the country.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk muttered in a small voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"There is a reporter next to me, so speak softly. I know that you are busy with a lot of cases right now. There is a crime scene that I want you to look at.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You know that I don\u2019t handle straight murders.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He would only take the cases that attracted his interest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk hit him on the head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hey. This is a mystery that we have no clue about. Be serious. Just listen to me. I didn\u2019t want to call you. But he is a completely crazy guy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He was a man who became a profiler because he liked things like this.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

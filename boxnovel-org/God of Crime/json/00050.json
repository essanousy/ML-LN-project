Or should I pick up a new skill...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stood at the crossroads of choice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He thought for a while before coming to a conclusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. This is a man\u2019s romance! This time I will draw X-ray Vision!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a skill that he had missed gaining.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He decided to invest 10 affinity points in order to obtain the man\u2019s romance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pressed the START button and saw the roulette turn around on the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were cheerful sound effects as he received the message indicating that he got a new skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-wait a minute. This skill is...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes widened as he gazed at the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The stage was at Tiwai headquarters where the Death Circus was being held.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The time left until the closing-\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">310 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a winning strategy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun said with a confident expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? A winning strategy sound really appetizing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes flashed as he gazed at Cha Soo-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It has been less than an hour since the two of you participated. Um. You\u2019re Lee Cheol-su and An Eun-jeong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those who attended the Death Circus had name badges on their chests.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a simple digital display that had two things written on it: the owner\u2019s name and the amount of money they possessed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The participants had to always wear it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun confirmed the money of Seo Tae-hyuk and An Eun-jeong.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two people had a combined value of 115 million won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll try to keep it simple. I currently have 85 million won. Do you want to check it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Indeed. The three of us have exactly 200 million. There are two major types of games in the Death Circus. You might already know after looking around for a while... There are various attractions where you risk your lives to win prizes, or you can gamble with other participants. These two types.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun watched Tae-hyuk and Eun-young before asking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, are the two of you lovers?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you notice? I won\u2019t deny it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen you will surely want to escape from here together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made an exaggerated glum expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026 The problem is that we need 400 million to do this. I didn\u2019t know it was such a crazy game. Nevertheless, I should at least send Eun-jeong out of here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh...! You are prepared to sacrifice yourself for your lover! However, there is no need to do this as my winning strategy means that all three of us can get out of here safely. I can get 200 million won per person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cG-Great!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun licked his lips and swallowed his saliva.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His prey was already halfway there, and all he had to do now was eat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had come to this place two times already, and knew how to eat people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That was how he managed to obtained 85 million won in two hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let me explain the blind spot in the Death Circus\u2019 system. The ultimate goal is to get 200 million won and escape from this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm... We can definitely get out of here if we get 200 million won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. In a nutshell, no one here has more than 200 million won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun started to explain with a serious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His aim was to make money easily by taking it away from the other participants.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t risk himself with the dangerous attractions.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">By default, the majority of the participants wouldn\u2019t be able to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were approximately 30 participants in the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The total amount of money circulating throughout the circus was nearly two billion won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, every time an hour passed, 10 million won would be taken out as the participation fee.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the total amount of money of all the participants would keep decreasing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was literally a zero-sum game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to increase it, participating in the missions was necessary in order to get money from the organizer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In other words, there was still two billion remaining.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he continued to win at PvP, then he could reach 600 million, enough for three people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe most typical gamble here is Bluff Poker. If you lose the ante, then you will pay with money or a corresponding amount of blood. It is a rate of 10 million won per 100ml. If a human loses two litres of blood then they would die, even if they are a strong adult male. If we combine our assets, then it is 200 million won. When looking at the odds, we can draw two litres of the opponent\u2019s blood before losing all our money. I am confident in a fight against anyone. Will you believe in me and entrust me with your money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 200 million was a carefully calculated amount that would create a dominate position in any gambles conducted inside the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would literally be a one-sided slaughter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The problem was that the audience didn\u2019t want to see such things.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They wanted a fight where they didn\u2019t know who would die.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, anyone who collected 200 million would get a platinum membership and would be sent out of here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun\u2019s winning strategy was simple: an alliance between three participants.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All the money would be given to one person who would play against the others.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If so, they would be able to win at Bluff Poker.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Bluff Poker was a game played with money at first.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After the money ran out, then the game would truly begin in earnest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The audience could watch as blood was drawn and as the person slowly died.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But if someone had 200 million won, then they could boldly play without fear of drawing their blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bluff Poker is literally a game of deception. It can best be described as Indian Poker. Either way, if you have 200 million, then you can win.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a famous card game with the nickname Bluff Blindness.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There would be a deck of 20 cards ranging from 1 to 10.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a\u00a0card would be placed on their forehead.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The participant could only see the opponent\u2019s card without knowing their own.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In that state, they would make bets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Watching a calm person lose their money and then start to draw blood was very funny.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That\u2019s why it was one of the most popular games for the audience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk listened to the explanation before opening his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This money represents our lives. How can we believe you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun smiled and pulled a business card from his wallet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Written on it was the name of the famous poker player, Cha Soo-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can you keep a poker face when betting against a person holding a 2 of hearts? I can do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCough! Still, I can\u2019t completely trust Cha Soo-hyun. This is a place where our lives are on the line.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun nodded with a grave expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, that\u2019s right, so I prepared this contract. Do you want to check the details?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk received the piece of paper from Cha Soo-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Um. The person who signs the contract will share all funds. If the person violates the agreement, then legal action will be taken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. If this exists then I can never betray you. How about it? Do you want to work together to escape this crazy game?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made a worried expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong muttered in a small voice that she would leave all the decisions to him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun didn\u2019t miss this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded and held out his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve come to a conclusion. You are a poker player, and will do a lot better than someone like me. I will trust Cha Soo-hyun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hahaha. An excellent choice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three people signed the contract prepared by Cha Soo-hyun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun smiled at them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Na\u00efve people would end up deceived in a place like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The contract he prepared was certainly legally valid.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, that only applied on the outside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In here, it was just like a piece of tissue paper.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Entrusting their lives to such a thing...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were a really stupid couple!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But how can we hand over the money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Didn\u2019t the person who gave it to you explain? They were probably busy and forgot. It\u2019s simple. The badges have a tiny microphone built in that allows the audience to hear all of the conversations here. You can pass over your rights by handing it to someone else. If you agree, then the money will be passed onto to the other party.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun made the motion to hand something over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! Indeed.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, Eun-jeong dropped the badge that she had been holding. Tae-hyuk bent over, picked it up, and bumped into Cha Soo-hyun\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I'm really sorry. Eun-jeong is a little clumsy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. It\u2019s okay. Then, shall we exchange?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk first received all of the money from Eun-jeong.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The badge on his chest now said 115.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now it was Tae-hyuk\u2019s turn to hand everything over to Cha Soo-hyun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026 I will take care of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun smiled after seeing Tae-hyuk\u2019s badge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now he had to wait to receive permission from Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun made a satisfied expression after Tae-hyuk handed over his badge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Everything was going as planned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. With this, the funds will be transferred to the other party. Do you agree?\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s expression, that had been blank until now, suddenly changed as he asked the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Cha Soo-hyun swallowed his saliva.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He thought that this guy was a little bunny, but he was currently giving off the atmosphere of a predator.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It couldn\u2019t be...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was Cha Soo-hyun mistaken?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the other person\u2019s badge was in his hand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was the one holding the knife, and there was nothing the other person could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I agree. Then we are on the same team... As if! Hahaha! You were tricked by me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The calm and rational appearance that he had showed for a while disappeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This place was a jungle of deception, and blindly believing in someone was akin to jumping off of a cliff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? What are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you still not understand! You were deceived! Now all of this money is mine!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"B-But the contract...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It will be time to pay the fee in a few minutes! If you don\u2019t have 10 million won then you will be forced to cross the Bridge of Pain! Ahaha! Your bodies will melt into nothing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sank down with a blank expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-We were deceived?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"N-No! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong shrieked with a desperate expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahahaha! The dealers are coming to catch those who can\u2019t pay the fee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun chuckled and waved towards the men in black suits.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were wearing masks to hide their identities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, why are you so late? Finish off this couple. What type of scene will occur in front of the Bridge of Pain? Hahaha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, there was an announcement inside the Death Circus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Informing all participants.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">In a moment, 10 million won will be deducted from the money you are carrying.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">If you can\u2019t pay, then please accept that you will be forced to pay.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">This is the third hour out of the eight hours of the Death Circus.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">At that time, anybody who doesn\u2019t have the money to pay will be publicly executed.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha! It is time for a fun execution! W-Wait a minute. What are you doing now? You should be...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Three black suited men grabbed the laughing Cha Soo-hyun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of the men in black suits said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCha Soo-hyun. Your current balance is zero. You can\u2019t pay the fee, so we will enforce it. Take him away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun couldn\u2019t understand and started screaming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you talking about? I have money! It is 200 million!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black suited man explained with no emotion in his voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You handed it to Lee Cheol-su\u2019s badge six minutes ago. Five minutes ago, you agreed to the statement that the funds would be transferred to the other person. It all belongs to Lee Cheol-su now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-wait a minute. What the hell?! I-I obviously...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun\u2019s face distorted as he looked at Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smirked as he pulled a badge from his pocket and placed it on his chest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It now had the number \u2018180\u2019 written on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I obviously received your badge! This bastard! Shit! What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, you mean that? It was a fake. For reference, I stole yours earlier. You definitely agreed to transfer ownership to me. Is there a problem?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWaaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha Soo-hyun screamed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had accepted the badge of the opponent and agreed that money would be handed over to the other person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the badge he received was a fake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had definitely checked it a few times...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In addition, Tae-hyuk said that he stole Cha Soo-hyun\u2019s badge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When on earth did he do that?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then when Cha Soo-hyun agreed...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. You agreed to hand me your money. This money will be very useful. Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck! I was tricked! This bastard tricked me! What are you doing? Get that bastard! Catch him!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black suited men gagged Cha Soo-hyun before literally dragging him elsewhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would probably be forced to cross the Bridge of Pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke to Eun-jeong who was shivering behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you want to go and watch the Bridge of Pain?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, I don\u2019t... But even if he is a scammer, trying someone and killing them...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke casually.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Anyone who wants to eat somebody should be prepared to have it happen to them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong got goosebumps at that moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She felt a deep abyss in the eyes of the man in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026 I thought you were Prince Charming who came to save me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk answered naturally.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPrince Charming? I'm sorry I didn't live up to your expectations. I'm not such an upstanding person.

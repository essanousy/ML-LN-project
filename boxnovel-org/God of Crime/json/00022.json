In Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes, it was hard to distinguish between the original and the fake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes lit up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower had disappeared into the warehouse in order to find a stick to use. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was his chance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk organized the information he had about Big Mama in his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The details had been written down in his blacklist, but he was still able to come up with some important points on the spot. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He remembered something very unusual. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, Kid. What did you need?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama asked with the smile of a salesperson.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hello, I am Seo Tae-hyuk. There are many rumors about Mama. It is an honor to meet you. Then, I\u2019ll speak bluntly. I want to make a deal with Mama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama made a surprised expression while her eyes sharpened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh. You aren\u2019t an ordinary kid.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aren\u2019t you always saying that the appearance on the outside isn\u2019t important?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... You know me very well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are famous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What type of deal do you want to establish?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wanted to know what he wanted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had no intention of showing all the cards in his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you happen to know the thief who stole an item called the Rosario in this neighbourhood yesterday? The appearance looks roughly like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk showed a picture of Rosario that he drew in advance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama replied in a relaxed tone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I trade in many stolen goods in one day, and I can\u2019t remember all of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know that Mama has such a good memory that Mama can even remember a piece of merchandise from a week ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama was famous for her tremendous memory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh. Not many people know about my specialty... You are a kid that I really can\u2019t look down on. No, shall I call you Tae-hyuk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The title coming from Big Mama\u2019s mouth changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk knew what that meant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I would like to deal in information. If you give me information about the thief who took Rosario, then I will give you one piece of information.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will listen first and decide.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke casually, as if he was ordering jajangmyeon from a Chinese restaurant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Trail of the Sunset.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt like time had stopped. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama froze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... How do you...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two implications.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled gently. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He said it because he knew the future of Big Mama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a piece that all art collectors desire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama\u2019s hand trembled in response.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was an expression like she had been hit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is very important that the information is reliable. There is no guarantee that you won\u2019t lie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk knew that Big Mama would say this. The answer was also prepared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aren\u2019t you in a position to look through straws right now? If my information is unbelievable, then it can\u2019t be helped. I will give up on the deal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said boldly. If the box wasn\u2019t opened, then the person wouldn\u2019t know if they had received what they ordered from the Chinese restaurant. Of course, it was the same for the other person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the risk with trading information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTae-hyuk is telling me to betray the money making game. Do you know that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Trail of the Sunset, or money. Select one of the two.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no need to even weigh it. No matter how many ping pong balls were stacked up, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to beat a bowling ball.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama was still smiling, but her eyes were burning with a strange fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you are lying then be ready, for I will give you a very painful punishment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then, I\u2019ll tell you the location of the painting. Mama, please tell me the name and phone number of the person I am looking for.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Mama said to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t gamble, but I will try to believe Tae-hyuk just once. The thief...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was able to get the information he desired by trading with Big Mama.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you going to do now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have to make a trap that he can\u2019t run from, so I will have to prepare something to tempt him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ahum~\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower spoke in a strange tone and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke in an apologetic voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but I\u2019ll have to leave you here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bah. You ate everything, and now you want to discard me like a used tissue?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Instead, I promise to talk after catching K.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">K was the initial of the criminal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You promise?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower extended a finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cI will add one more thing. Go to the aquarium with me on the weekend sometime. There is something that I want to discuss with you there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Well. Ok, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time, Tae-hyuk owed a big favor to Moonlight Flower, so he decided to listen to her request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower continued waving until Tae-hyuk disappeared from her sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I never thought I would meet two blacklist members in one day.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower and Big Mama.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like they were attracting each other.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were 120 people on the blacklist. It was impossible to think that he could go against all of them, even with his crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'First of all, I have to watch the situation...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t know much about Moonlight Flower, he knew that Big Mama was as sly like a fox.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it possible for him to leave her alone?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s mind became complicated. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Let's just think about catching K for now.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk dialled the number given by Big Mama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The plan for catching K was already in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a few beeps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hello?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The call was connected.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun didn\u2019t feel good in the morning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know how many days it had been since he had found something good.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yesterday, he went to collect from a newly discovered prey. There was a family who recently moved into his area.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Usually, in such cases, there were large amounts of money in the owner\u2019s house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they were already diligent and entrusted it all to the bank, so he had to resort to taking various miscellaneous things around the house.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There wasn\u2019t even a single gold ring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun spat on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChe! Ara, you bastards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to move on to another area, but the situation wasn\u2019t right.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe there was already someone else...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He pulled out a cigarette and put it in his mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had just bought a new pack, but it was already the last one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrazy. I have no cigarettes left.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was dangerous if he couldn\u2019t hit the jackpot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was enjoying his cigarette when the phone rang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know the number.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Perhaps it was a spam call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun suddenly came up with a good idea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would swear at the people on the phone to relieve stress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sang-hyun pressed the call button and brought the phone to his ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He first had to check who the person was. If it was someone he didn\u2019t know, then he would curse at them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sang-hyun concentrated on the other person\u2019s voice. </span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Sang-hyun, it is Mother.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun couldn't believe his ears. Mama was calling him directly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, Mother. What's wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Well, I am calling because I thought I should bring something to your attention.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Earlier, some kid was looking for you.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I don't know who he is, but you ought to be careful.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">He asked about you.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"For me? What did you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">How long have we been working together?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Of course, I gave him the wrong number.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha... Thank you, Mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He heard a soft laugh over the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Well, there is a fee for the information.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wouldn\u2019t hand over false information for free.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun felt sweat flowing, as Mama wasn\u2019t just a simple stolen goods broker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I know what you are thinking.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I\u2019m Mama, I\u2019m not that cold.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I got free income thanks to Sang-hyun.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Sang-hyun should also receive a prize.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I received some very good information, so</span></i><i><span style=\"\">how about it?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Do you want to give it a try?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Kim Sang-hyun wanted to cheer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a great opportunity for thieves. A place that held a lot of valuables.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I accept! No, I will do it! Please let me do it!\"</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Hoho!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I understand.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Indeed, Sang-hyun.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">You are dependable.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Stolen goods brokers often handed over information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If so, there was an implicit rule when doing business with that person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun barely refrained from laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mama\u2019s spot was rumored to be a jackpot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then what should I steal?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-There will be lots of diamonds.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Please help Mama steal all of them.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Just believe in me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun combed through the information given by Mama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Diamonds?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hahaha! I will be rich! Rich!\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spot wasn\u2019t far away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun did a final equipment check. HIs equipment variety ranged from locksmith tools to levers for lifting heavy objects.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like he was going to rob a bank, not a house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen... This isn\u2019t my area. Is it okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He came here under the name of the greatest information broker, Mama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the owner of the territory wouldn\u2019t be able to have any complaints.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spot was a two-storey house with a spacious courtyard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In recent years, expensive security systems were often found in homes like these.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was really hard to eat and live in this world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It doesn\u2019t look like there is one common CCTV. A big jackpot!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun cheered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected from Mama. He wondered how she found information about this spot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was late at night, so there was no one in the house.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The fireplace was turned off, and no loud sounds could be heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A golden opportunity to steal!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hum of a song came out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun was a thief with considerable skill. He was even able to get into a safety deposit box in five minutes because he was the child of a locksmith.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened a locked door using his skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">According to Mama\u2019s information, the diamonds were in the bedroom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He walked towards the destination while visualizing the structure of the house in his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Here!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun excitedly opened the door.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Pang!</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Pang pang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, there were the sounds of firecrackers popping.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dark room lit up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people hiding in the darkness cheered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Surprise~!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCongratulations!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Happy birthday, Chief-nim!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Chief-nim, I love you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Milk-coloured Chief-nim!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Sang-hyun stopped moving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Diamonds.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were a lot of diamonds.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Three representative diamonds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kim Sun-kyung.

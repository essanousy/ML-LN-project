But... It really hurts!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He pretended that he was fine, but he was actually covered in cold sweat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Originally, he should\u2019ve been dead.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even though it was reduced by half, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual if he was stunned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to fulfill several conditions for Damage to Both Sides to be used.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First, he had to touch the opponent for a certain amount of time, and exchange questions and answers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The range of Damage to Both Sides was determined by the content.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was told that there was someone the opponent wanted to protect, the opponent would become linked to that person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then their wounds would be shared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">On the other hand, if he answered that only himself was important, then a different effect would occur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is the problem with bad guys. They talk too much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the opponent had fired the gun before Damage to Both Sides was triggered, then it would\u2019ve been over.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to prevent such a situation, Tae-hyuk made Big Brother think that his plan was to take off the reinforced suit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That alone reduced his defensive capability, but it allowed Big Brother to move much faster.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he deliberately allowed himself to be caught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Looking at what he did with the hostages, this killer is the type to play with his opponents. It is easy to buy time if I create a suitable atmosphere.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, Damage to Both Sides was completely triggered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pointed a finger at his chest and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now you can't kill me. Fire one more shot if you are curious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuock, do you think I won\u2019t do it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother aimed at Tae-hyuk\u2019s body and pulled the trigger. However, his target was the shoulder, not the heart.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The gunshot rang out and blood simultaneously appeared on both Tae-hyuk and Big Brother.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuhak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The one shooting is the one who is suffering.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-How? Did it do nothing? Wasn\u2019t it a clear shot?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Only you are hurt, you clown.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s taunt stunned Big Brother.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He attacked the opponent only to get wounded himself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, it seemed like he was the only one feeling pain.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time Big Brother felt fear since he was born.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Thank god for the medicine.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people suffered the same damage due to Damage to Both Sides.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The reason why Big Brother\u2019s suffering was overwhelming was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">While hiding among the hostages, Tae-hyuk had injected medicine into his body to reduce the pain in advance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was an anesthetic that he got from T Medical Centre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thanks to it, Tae-hyuk was able to bluff like he didn\u2019t get hurt at all.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It worked very well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuook!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother was in a panicked state.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how he attacked the opponent, he would only get hurt himself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know what witchcraft was used, but he couldn\u2019t attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, Tae-hyuk was the same.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was literally Damage to Both Sides.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he attacked Big Brother now, then the damage would return to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018But he doesn\u2019t know that. Then my bluff will work!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Big Brother with mocking eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was an elite killer with the best skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When had he ever received such humiliating treatment?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, all of Big Brother\u2019s patience disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother glared at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Still, I'm glad. I was able to protect my precious people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Precious people?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk turned and looked at Min Soo-young and Min Soo-yeon, who were shaking in place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he muttered in a soft tone,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I came to save these children. It is impossible to allow a killer to murder them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two sisters looked at Phantom with wide eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The whole reason Phantom was here was in order to save them?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was so surprising that they couldn\u2019t say anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother looked between Phantom, Min Soo-young, and Min Soo-yeon. He then started laughing like crazy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know what magic Phantom was using to protect his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Still, the reason he came here was to protect those children.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuahahaha! A criminal trying to save someone is funny. Then, let\u2019s see if you can save them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother laughed and pointed his gun at the two sisters.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He no longer hesitated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First, one foot forward.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a </span><i><span style=\"\">tang </span></i><span style=\"\">and blood emerged from Min Soo-young\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And another foot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Blood covered Min Soo-yeon\u2019s chest as she held her sister\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people, who the Phantom was trying to protect, were killed at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How about this?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His purpose...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">P...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"K-Kuheok... T-this... Keook!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, blood spurted from Big Brother\u2019s head and chest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the floor approached Big Brother\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, to be exact, Big Brother\u2019s body was collapsing towards the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the last moment, Big Brother realized it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom didn\u2019t use strange magic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was the strange thing himself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And he probably created...</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Flop.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother killed two people at the same time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The effects of Damage to Both Sides triggered, causing him to die.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue as he looked at Big Brother\u2019s corpse on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou. Your skills were too good. If you didn\u2019t kill them both at the same time, then you would\u2019ve lived.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom killed the killer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The hostages realized this and cheered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-We\u2019re saved!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWaaaah!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people started crying as they realized that they had survived.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One hostage went up to the fallen children.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou bad person... You killed these children...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quietly reached out and touched his fingers to their necks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was marginal, but there was still a pulse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are still alive. However, it would be better to call a doctor as soon as possible. Go outside and tell the police there there are two severely wounded people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cM-Me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cU-Understood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hostage nodded after receiving the instructions and ran out of the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the two sisters who were unconscious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t resent me too much for giving you half of the pain. This was for the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he felt the pain that had been suppressed by the anesthetic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A crying hostage bowed to Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Thank you for saving us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then like dominos, the other hostages also gave thanks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom-nim. Thank you very much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took a deep breath and told the hostages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let\u2019s get out of here. The killer seems to have set up bombs. Take these children as well. They are seriously injured, so be careful not to shock them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Leave it to us!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spirited hostages left the room one by one.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A few people remained and gently lifted the stunned children.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once all of them left the room, Tae-hyuk was suddenly alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, he couldn\u2019t forget about Big Brother\u2019s weapons.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were things that weren\u2019t readily available in South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just taking the guns would be the reward for today\u2019s work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Big Brother\u2019s corpse and muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is literally Damage to Both Sides.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk, who was disguised as Kwon Joon-hyuk, mingled with the people in order to leave the building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The hostages were so relieved that they survived that they didn\u2019t even notice that their numbers had increased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police shouted with joy as the people came out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The hostages are coming!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe the culprit is dead!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the special units tried to enter the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are bombs installed in the building!

Somehow catch him!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The men gulped.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom killed an opponent with a huge firepower that couldn\u2019t be matched.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now they might have to fight him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people who survived Big Brother swarmed everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA-Any wounded, please come over here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several ambulances were carrying injured people from the scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sir, over here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A nurse shouted as she saw Tae-hyuk, who was bleeding from the head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As it happened, the ambulances belonged to the hospital where An Eun-young\u2019s father was the director.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had suffered a gunshot wound to his head and shoulder.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had somehow hung on due to the power of the anesthetic but he was at his limit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would be able to get treated by pretending to be a hostage, but he wanted to avoid even a 1% chance of detection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be better to ask for help from Moonlight Flower.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She would introduce him to an unlicensed doctor who worked in the back alleys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The nurse held out her hand to grab his bag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Give me the bag.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t give it to her since the bag contained guns.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The weight was 80kg so he couldn\u2019t hand it over to others.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-That...

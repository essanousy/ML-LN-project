These days, his rankings have been very high.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But can he overcome the wall that is An Eun-young? On the last test, she got an average of 98 points. ...The god of studying. Totally.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But it seems that Eun-young didn\u2019t prepare much for the test because she was teaching Seo Tae-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, Class President is eternally....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Park Sung-kwang!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...An Eun-young!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a fiery argument in the classroom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey! Be quiet! The results you\u2019ve been waiting for have come out!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The front door of the classroom had opened and Teacher Jung Nam-ho had entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a big smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Teacher Jung Nam-ho started to give out the report cards in the order of the attendance number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">People who got the desired result were cheerful. </span><span style=\"\">Those who got lower than they had expected sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPark Sung-kwang.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Park Sung-kwang\u2019s turn.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was confident that he was first in the school, so he walked forward with a smiling face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the atmosphere was weird, and Teacher Jung Nam-ho had a concerned expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Is something going on at home?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang asked with a puzzled expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAiyah. We need to do something about this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang felt like something was unfortunate as he returned to his seat with the report card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he cursed as he opened the envelope.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Shit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Seventh overall.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a person who had only ever been first or second. It was a satisfactory achievement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If there was a problem, it was that he had always been behind someone.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Wooduk!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang grinded his teeth together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one reason for this outcome:</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That bitch had backstabbed him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had copied An Eun-young\u2019s answer sheet. So, it seemed like she had sacrificed her own grades.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An Eun-young would be seventh place as well.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang glared at An Eun-young, thinking about how to get revenge.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young soon received her report card.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Teacher Jung Nam-ho\u2019s chest puffed up like he was proud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAn Eun-young! The first in the school! You\u2019ve worked hard! Go home and rest!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young smiled gently and bowed toward Teacher Jung Nam-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018First in the school?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It couldn\u2019t be.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had obviously copied An Eun-young\u2019s answer sheet exactly. So, why was there a different result...?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"And there is someone else I have something to say to. Tae-hyuk! Come out!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk, who had been sitting quietly in his seat until then, walked forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Teacher Jung Nam-ho embraced Tae-hyuk enthusiastically.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I was really surprised! Another first place student came from my class! Tae-hyuk! What did I say?

Still, it was the first place in the school.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a gangster who was soon to be expelled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, the problems came from the parts that Class President taught me. I was lucky.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey! Well done! Really well done! But what is with that face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Teacher Jung Nam-ho pointed to the bandage stuck to Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, this? You will soon find out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like someone had injured him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Seo, Tae, Hyuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang rushed toward Tae-hyuk with a demonic expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He grabbed Seo Tae-hyuk by the collar and dragged him out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You guys! Hey! Park Sung-kwang!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Teacher Jung Nam-ho moved forward, but it happened so quickly that he couldn\u2019t stop Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang dragged Seo Tae-hyuk to the school rooftop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know exactly what had happened.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, one thing was for certain\u2014that bastard Seo Tae-hyuk had a hand in it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How dare you fuck with me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk cocked his head with a puzzled expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Denying it until the end! Dog scum. I don\u2019t know how you did it, but you changed my answer sheet to yours!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke while peering at the wristwatch on his right wrist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You were sitting behind me when doing the test. Wouldn\u2019t you notice if I did anything weird?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It made a lot of sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Obviously, Seo Tae-hyuk hadn\u2019t done anything suspicious when he took the exam.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Wait. You clearly fought with the student who was collecting the papers. I thought you had just gone crazy from the stress. My answer sheet was taken at that time!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke like it was unfair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you see me lay a finger on the answer sheets?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No! It had to be then! Tell me! What did you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk once again looked at his watch to confirm the time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI really didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis dog scum. Do you think you will be safe if you do this? My father is a politician!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang was sincerely heated up. He was irritated that Seo Tae-hyuk was acting so calmly in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would use a group of gangsters under his father\u2019s influence. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would ease his heart to aim them at Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well. Is it that time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat, time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang realized something strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since earlier, Seo Tae-hyuk had seemed to be wasting time. He had also been checking the time with his wristwatch.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Additionally, Seo Tae-hyuk had a bandage on his face. It seemed like someone had injured him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Park Sung-kwang never touched Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So, who did it...?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk licked his lips and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, this cut on my face?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He peeled back the bandage to reveal a bruise like someone had beaten him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I had to concentrate on playing the role. Is this called method acting?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cActing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, it will be starting soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s watch was pointed at exactly 9.30.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, something was broadcasted around the whole school.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Seo, Tae, Hyuk!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">You son of a bitch!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang\u2019s angry voice was heard from the broadcast.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then there was a noise like someone was fighting.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Peok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were the sounds of someone being beaten.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-I\u2014I won\u2019t cooperate with your cheating no matter how much you beat me up!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time it was Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The human imagination was great. They only heard a few voices and some sound effects, yet the scene appeared vividly in front of their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang\u2019s fist slammed into Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk certainly heard it this way.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He muttered with a satisfied expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, Eun-young did it correctly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Broadcast? Why is it my voice? What the hell?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang panicked. It was his voice and not someone else\u2019s that was being broadcasted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I told you to change your answer sheet with mine.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Are you resisting now?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I\u2019ll kill you!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">S-still.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">My grades have been low since doing this for you!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Additionally, framing me for that beating...</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I can\u2019t take it anymore!</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Stupid bastard.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I am the ruler of this school, yet you\u2019re rebelling against me?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I will make this your memorial day!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang was stunned as he listened to the broadcast from the roof.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It detailed that he had changed his grades by intimidating Seo Tae-hyuk, who was very good at studying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he did something similar, but it wasn\u2019t with Seo Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Additionally, he had tried to kick Tae-hyuk out of school by framing him for a fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Such contents were being broadcasted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke with a face of admiration,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, this part! I did it, but it doesn\u2019t seem real. \u2018For the sake of justice, I can\u2019t endure your wickedness any longer!\u2019 Wah...

Don\u2019t you know that my father is a politician? Stop the broadcast and explain that everything was a misunderstanding. Otherwise, I will turn you and your family into mince meat with my father\u2019s gang.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a violent threat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, Park Sung-kwang had the ability to carry it out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why, are you feeling regret?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, your words are truly amazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror.

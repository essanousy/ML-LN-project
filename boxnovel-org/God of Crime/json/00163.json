I have to complete my research that will bring a new prosperity to mankind!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk sighed loudly and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You might have been that before, but now you are just an ugly criminal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"C-C-Criminal? Me?!

Can you help me with the kidnapped woman over there? I will definitely pay it back. Well, my actions might be a little bit illegal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk seemed to perfectly think that Tae-hyuk was Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded and went over to Ha-ran.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The pierrots didn\u2019t receive any orders so they just gave a low moan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran was tied up but he couldn\u2019t see any . It seemed like she had taken something similar to a sleeping pill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He shook her body a few times before she started blinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow you regained consciousness?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...T-Tae-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said with panic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am Phantom. I'm sorry but I think you mistook me for someone else.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-Huh... No matter the situation, do you think I wouldn\u2019t recognize you, even if you were wearing a mask? Oh, t-this place is dangerous!

It is hard to untie you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk would worry about what to tell Ha-ran after successfully rescuing her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But first, they had to get out of here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk, who was confronting the Clown, shouted with a loud voice,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"D-Director Go Ah-tae, don\u2019t run away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, the Clown started running towards the Core Drive in the centre of the lab.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The confused Kang-suk pulled the trigger of his gun.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Cough!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a culprit was trying to escape then the first place to shoot was the legs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Clown ignored the blood dripping down his legs and headed into the Core Drive.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It happened so quickly that Kang-suk couldn\u2019t respond properly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Clown manipulated a panel and triggered something.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kuooooong!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The inside of the Core Drive turned red.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The plasma started to rotate around around the Clown\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKiik!

It will be a step towards evolution!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown danced with joy behind the tank made of tempered glass.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The situation inside the Core Drive wasn\u2019t clear so Kang-suk fired at the Clown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stop what you are doing and get out of there!

Drag that clown out! He wants to blow this place up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk made a horrified expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Damn! I can\u2019t die along with that bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took Ha-ran to the entrance of the laboratory and gave her the route to get out of here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he ran to the Clown and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Clown! What will happen if the Core Drive explodes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKikikik! That is impossible! My research was a success! Just stay there and watch the birth of the best invention in human history!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tell me just in case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuk, kukuk. The Core Drive is an antimatter that generates infinite energy. If it explodes, then it will have the energy of one or two hydrogen bombs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...You were studying such a dangerous thing here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry! My research! Definitely! It is successful!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was dangerous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This place was dangerous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was why the study was frozen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Damn! I will make you stop this!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSt-op? Stop? Stop?! I won\u2019t do it! I won\u2019t let anyone interfere with my research! Kuhahat! Kuhahahat! The Core Drive is a success! It is successful!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s face turned pale as he heard the story from the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom... Is that really what Director Go Ah-tae said?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It seems so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Damn! I will call reinforcements right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are only 10 minutes left. We have no choice but to resolve this by ourselves.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I don\u2019t know how much damage the blast will cause. Can we stop the bomb? Damn... Turn off that machine right now! Or else I will kill you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown ignored Kang-suk\u2019s desperate words and declared triumphantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKukuk... It seems like this is the only thing I can do to prevent the Core Drive from being stopped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Clown closed his eyes and stabbed his chest with the iron skewer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Clown laughed even when he was dying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy research is definitely a success! A success! Su...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a pointless death.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s eyes filled with despair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He sat on the floor and knocked against the tempered glass with a bitter face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn...

If you go outside, then Seo Ha-ran will be waiting. Get her out of here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk nodded slowly with a firm expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom was a criminal, but he didn\u2019t seem the type to lie.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once Kang-suk left, Phantom... No, Seo Tae-hyuk muttered in a small voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, what can I do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, he sent Kang-suk and Ha-ran out of here, but the problem was from now on.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he didn\u2019t stop the Core Drive then serious damage might occur.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he didn\u2019t have any luck then the Psychotropic Incense might leak outside the lab.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then it would literally be like a zombie movie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk first collected the remaining Psychotropic Incense left in the institute and gve it to the pierrots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Get out of here right now. Head to the nearest hospital.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Un-der-stood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pierrots started to move according to the orders that Tae-hyuk gave.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, Tae-hyuk was left alone in the laboratory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If I use the Machine then I can break through that tempered glass. However, if I install a bomb...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk was in distress, someone approached him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at them with confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What, you went outside...

In addition, there were underground facilities such as convenience stores, car parks, shops, and restrooms.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> However, area two was meager compared to area one.\u00a0</span>The hippo was in the performer\u2019s waiting room in area two. It was where the murder would take place.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Isn\u2019t this turning out well?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk had installed more than 10 small cameras in three places.\u00a0</span>The hippo\u2019s work was being recorded in 1080p high definition. It would perfectly prove that the Hippo was the serial killer.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The safest method was to retrieve the cameras and then help Jung Yuri escape.\u00a0</span>The police would then take care of the rest.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'The problem is that Yuri noona will be uncomfortable.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was no wheelchair in here to transport Jung Yuri.\u00a0</span>He would have to carry her somehow as he escaped. It was much slower than running alone, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to run away from the Hippo that would chase in pursuit.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Even if he had the \u2018Violence\u2019 skill, there was a possibility that a dangerous situation would occur.\u00a0</span>If things went wrong, then Jung Yuri could possibly be used as a hostage.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> That\u2019s why Tae-hyuk lured the House over to his prepared stage with a plan to win over him there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk pulled a bunch of keys from his pocket.\u00a0</span>This was the master key for the aquarium. He would be able to open any door and go anywhere in the aquarium with this.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk licked his lips in anticipation as he looked at it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Yes. \u2018Robbery\u2019 was originally used for things like this!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> At first, it was a useless skill that just stole underwear. However, after the cheating incident occurred, it strengthened and he could steal the things he desired.\u00a0</span>Thus, this was possible.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk stole the master key from the guard patrolling during the day.\u00a0</span>He quickly made a copy frame using clay and plastic. He was able to do it without much difficulty due to both the \u2018Forgery\u2019 skill and his dexterity.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Then I picked up the keys that had fallen to the ground and received the duplicate key.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The material had changed from metal to plastic, but other than that, it was exactly the same as the original.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Dururu!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hik!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> As Tae-hyuk was lost in thought, he received a phone call.\u00a0</span>He pretended to be unconcerned, but he was going to have to fight a crazy killer soon. It was strange not to be nervous.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The caller ID read \u2018Seo Ha-ran.\u2019\u00a0</span>Once she saw that Tae-hyuk was gone in the middle of the night, she became worried and called.\u00a0Tae-hyuk sighed and picked up the phone.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cUh, Noona. Did you wake up?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">Yes, where are you?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I got up and went to check on you.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">You weren\u2019t there.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, so I went out for a walk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">I see...</span></i><i><span style=\"\">It\u2019s good because I can hear Tae-hyuk\u2019s voice.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Hehehe.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk realized that he almost never talked to his sister over the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I\u2019ll be back soon. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -...</span><i><span style=\"\"> You aren\u2019t doing anything foolish are you?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Was this a woman\u2019s intuition?\u00a0</span>Ha-ran was always showing her siblings a smiling face. However, she would occasionally say piercing things.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cDon\u2019t think too much. Ah right, will you be free this weekend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">Yes.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"There will be something good soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -</span><i><span style=\"\">Really?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">What is it?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Should I look forward to it?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t say anything as he inwardly thought.\u00a0</span>That smile couldn\u2019t disappear from his sister\u2019s face. Therefore, the Hippo needed to be caught.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Ha-ran suddenly said in a serious voice.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Don\u2019t forget that I am by your side no matter what you do,</span></i><i><span style=\"\">so don\u2019t get a cold from staying out too long.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then, I will hang up.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk closed his phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> His sister\u2019s words were still ringing in his ears.\u00a0</span>His sister was always on his side.\u00a0Tae-hyuk had heard the same words from Ha-ran when she came to visit him in jail.\u00a0He was able to endure the desperate situation due to those words.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk coughed and slapped both of his cheeks.\u00a0</span>He could be emotional after catching the Hippo. He decided to only think about this right now.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> After finishing the call with his sister, Tae-hyuk went to the broadcasting room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'First, I need to make the Hippo leave his spot. Then, I need help Yuri noona to a safe place.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk imitated the voice of a security guard with the \u2018Voice Modulation\u2019 skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He changed the settings\u200b so that it would only be broadcasted to the area where the hippo was, and turned on the microphone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"All guards. There is an abnormality in the drainage pipe today, and an inspection is scheduled. Please don\u2019t use any water if you are in the building.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> He threw the bait, and now it was time to wait for a bite.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> If things went as planned, he would be able to catch the hippo without anyone getting hurt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho was surprised as he arrived at the entrance of the aquarium.\u00a0</span>A familiar shadow stood in the area where his headlights shone.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho parked his BMW and waved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cUh, Sun-bae!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Cho Kang-suk replied with a face that showed he was tired of waiting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201c... You came. At least I don\u2019t have to enter alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"As expected of Sunbae. You thought of the same thing as me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Joo Hyun-ho explained why he came here and asked for Kang-suk\u2019s opinion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"No, my detective senses just told me that this place was suspicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHahaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"At any rate, I don\u2019t think anyone else is coming. Let\u2019s go. By the way, did you send a request for support?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"If we catch him then I\u2019ll buy all of you dinner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHahaha! Then it needs to be a beef dinner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cWah. There are 100 people. Furthermore, don\u2019t you eat a lot?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well, I have a lot of money. That reminds me, there was a cute new girl in the traffic department earlier. Please introduce me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho said with a smirk.\u00a0</span>Even though he was going to arrest a murder suspect, he acted like he was going to an amusement park. Kang-suk made a disgusted expression and put Hyun-ho into a headlock.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cCough! S-Sunbae! Spare me! By the way, what if the Hippo is in the aquarium right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk laughed and pointed to his waist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was a gun in a holster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I see.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho raised a thumb.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The two men entered the dark aquarium.\u00a0</span>Then they stopped at a fork in the road.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"... What do we do?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> H Aquarium was divided into area A and B.\u00a0</span>It was too wide to search through the whole thing.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I'll check the aquarium side. You will take the venues.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yep. Should we use our phones?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cIs that possible? My battery died so I ended up buying a portable charge from the convenience store to charge it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> That\u2019s why Kang-suk stood at the entrance without going inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHahaha! I understand. Then I will contact you if I find the Hippo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hyun-ho felt his heart beat faster.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had been almost seven years since he worked with Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It is the return of the strong alliance after a long time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The two of them had won a program called Mafia Game.\u00a0</span>Whenever they teamed up, they would be called a strong alliance and would become an object of fear. The one who captured the criminal in the Mafia Game was always Kang-suk. Even after seven years, Hyun-ho was still dissatisfied with this. Thus, he decided to catch the Hippo by himself this time.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Let\u2019s start the Hippo Hunt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kang-suk hit Hyun-ho on the head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hey. If you don\u2019t move then I will catch the Hippo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Then I\u2019m going to hunt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oooh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jung Yuri\u2019s temperature was going down due to the ice cold water.\u00a0</span>The current weather was cold, even when she wore clothes. She had been in cold water without any clothes for almost an hour now. It felt like she would freeze to death at any moment.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hu... \"Hah...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> A narrow tube was in Jung Yuri\u2019s mouth. It was her only lifeline since her entire body was covered in water.\u00a0</span>She could barely breathe using it.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cOof!!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> But that was it. The kidnapper was probably blocking the tube at one minute intervals, preventing her from being able to breathe.\u00a0</span>The terrible thing was that the time intervals where he blocked the tube was different.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 10 seconds. 40 seconds. 5 seconds. Sometimes it would be over a minute. At that time, her head would turn blank, and she really couldn\u2019t think.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was something even more terrible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cOhuhu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Someone was watching her suffer.\u00a0</span>They would often laugh at the sight.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> She had goosebumps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jung Yuri was covered in water with her hands and feet bound together. She couldn\u2019t even scream out.\u00a0</span>She was going to be killed. She was going to be murdered by that man.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It happened just when she found the courage to walk alone.\u00a0</span>She had decided to live for her sister who died miserably, but all of that was now wasted.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tears welled up in her eyes as she thought about it.\u00a0</span>However, she desperately fought to hold the tears back. If she cried, then it felt like she would be broken.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cOof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Once again, her breathing was stopped.\u00a0</span>How long would it be this time? 30 seconds? One minute?</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Or...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jung Yuri was going crazy with fear at the thought of the death that would approach her at any moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Unni... Unni...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> However, she didn\u2019t get the help that she hoped for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Puah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> After 70 seconds, she was able to breathe again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'D-Die... This is really...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was at that moment.\u00a0</span>Jung Yuri heard the sound of a broadcast.</p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-All guards.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">There is an abnormality in the drainage pipe today, and an inspection is scheduled.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Please don\u2019t use water if you are in the building.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The man, who had been laughing, clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Sheesh. There are still people left? Well, I guess I have to kill them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jung Yuri was blindfolded, but she realized that the man was looking at her.\u00a0</span>He was licking his lips.</p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Ddubeok ddubeok.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There was the sound of footsteps fading away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'Kill me now... I said to kill me!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> How many hours would he keep her alive? When she thought about it, the tears that she had endured came pouring out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018I\u2019m sorry Unni... I\u2019m really sorry.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Had her sister felt like this when she was killed by Yoo Cheol-ho?</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Ddubeok.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Ddubeok.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Once again, someone\u2019s footsteps were heard.\u00a0</span>This time it was getting closer, not further away.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018Did he already kill them? Then this time... Ah, p-please!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The footsteps stopped. Then she felt someone touching her body in the water tank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> A soft touch.\u00a0</span>It didn\u2019t feel the same.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Then she heard a different voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cC-Cough! I have no choice but to do this to pull you out. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, I\u2019m not touching because I want to.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cOof! Oof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cAh, I\u2019ll release the restraints.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jung Yuri realized that he was pulling off the restraints one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Was she being rescued?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"E-Even taking off the clothes... Ah, I'm going crazy. \u00a0I should\u2019ve thought about bringing a towel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The unknown voice didn\u2019t seem that old.\u00a0</span>At most, he was in his early 20s or so?</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Y-Yuri noona. I closed my eyes. I didn\u2019t see Noona\u2019s naked body!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Why was the voice so familiar?\u00a0</span>Who was it?</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Yuri slowly opened her eyes and looked at the man who saved her.\u00a0</span>Black hair and a leather jacket. One hand was holding a thick pipe.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jung Yuri remembered where she had seen him before.\u00a0</span>The high school student who came to collect the bounty on Yoo Cheol-ho.

P-Please wear this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk took off his leather jacket and handed it to Yuri.\u00a0</span>He was unable to look straight at Jung Yuri due to her nakedness.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Yuri turned red the moment she realized that she was naked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cH-how?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> She never imagined that he would come to her rescue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Tae-hyuk was still looking away from her as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I captured Yoo Cheol-ho last time and got a reward.

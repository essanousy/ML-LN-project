I want to see more tangible evidence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so? I know people like you. You can\u2019t help but feel envious when you see someone doing well. In the end, you will ruin everyone because of your pride.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jun-tae\u2019s face distorted at Mina\u2019s acidic tone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I saw all of you moving together!

Jun-tae. Both of you calm down. First of all, listen to my plan before you make a decision.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jun-tae looked at him and shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So that plan can kill all of us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you so suspicious? You should trust someone for once. Cheol-su used his own money to save those of us who were in a life-threatening situation. Let's see... Omo. Do you have 70 million right now? That is why you are so relaxed. Ah, perhaps...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mina eyed Jun-tae suspiciously before walking over to Tae-hyuk and whispering something in his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t it obvious that there would be a wolf planted by Tiwai here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen isn\u2019t he the most suspicious? He has a lot of money and he\u2019s also planting suspicion. No matter how I look at it, he has to be the wolf.

While there are definitely wolves among us, if we are suspicious of each other then it is what the wolf wants. First of all, I am thinking of taking everyone with me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, then the wolf...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I said I would take them all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mina\u2019s protests died down at Tae-hyuk\u2019s strong will.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes... I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk activated the Voice Modulation skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You can imitate the voice of Kim Bum-soo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Bum-soo was an actor who often appeared in historical dramas.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He mainly played the role of the king.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the charismatic voice that really made him seem like a king of the Joseon Dynasty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two groups in front of Tae-hyuk\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to bring them together, he would use Kim Bum-soo\u2019s voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please pay attention. Right now, there are those who believe in me. There are also those who feel doubt. The two groups exist, and I can understand both. I was afraid after entering the Death Circus. All of you can\u2019t be sure that the path you are walking on is correct. Therefore, I will walk in front. Right now, I am going to challenge the \u2018Puzzle House.\u2019 After that, you can decide whether to follow me and clear it, or to give up.

All of a sudden, your voice has changed, making it seem like a god!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone suddenly called Tae-hyuk \u2018Boss\u2019.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk released the Voice Modulation skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha.

Oh, yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bearded man replied with a stunned expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had been responsible for the Puzzle House for two years, yet this was the first time he saw a person clear this place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was sure that it would never occur again in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slowly walked out of the Puzzle House and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow is it?

I am a sunbae in your department, and this isn\u2019t a particularly difficult request.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bowed and spoke his appreciation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you, Sunbae-nim!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"By the way, you are part of the political science department at K University, correct?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I am student number 15.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! A freshman. At first glance, I thought you were a high school student.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk awkwardly scratched the back of his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sunbae-nim also looks very young. I heard that you were student number 97.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I am but a complete fossil. Then, shall we start the interview?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk approached the secretary as a political science university student seeking an interview.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was all in order to obtain the secretary\u2019s voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to imitate a voice using the Voice Modulation skill, he had to meet someone and directly listen to their voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The skill couldn\u2019t be activated through a recording or a phone call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The interview took around 20 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secretary was currently showing a very pleasant expression, an aftereffect of meeting a hoobae from his university.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had one final question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Finally, there is something I always wanted to know. If the politician did something morally wrong, what should the secretary do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secretary\u2019s eyes widened in response, as if he was surprised by the unexpected question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He sat in the chair and thought hard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A secretary is a senator\u2019s hands and feet. Even if he commits any wrongdoing, it is still right to follow him silently. In some cases, senators will amputate their arms if need be. However, I am talking to my cute hoobae who wants to become a secretary, so that isn\u2019t a realistic answer. I\u2019ll try to mix in my own opinions as well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secretary took a sip of his sugarless, bitter black coffee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He seemed to be looking somewhere into the distance, instead of at Tae-hyuk who was currently sitting in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, a secretary is the senator\u2019s hands and feet; however, I think secretaries should also have a conscience that is able to judge wrong from right. If the senator is walking down the street in the wrong direction, it is the secretary\u2019s job to inform them so. Anyways, that\u2019s just my personal opinion. A secretary\u2019s words might just fall on deaf ears.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secretary laughed softly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I have definitely learned a lot from you today. Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bowed, fully displaying his gratitude.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The secretary laughed, and seemed to like it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then, should I buy you dinner this evening?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made an apologetic expression and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Really, I must thank you very much, but I still need to submit my report by tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see. It has been a long time since I\u2019ve even thought about university. It was great to see you. Please call at the next opportunity and I\u2019ll be sure to have a drink with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secretary left the cafe with a regretful expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk remained in his seat and took out a notebook from his bag.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The word, \u2018blacklist\u2019, was written on the front cover in neat handwriting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a book that contained the names of 120 criminals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The book depicted the crimes they committed and detailed how they got caught. Tae-hyuk wrote down all of the things he remembered from those 15 years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A book that contained future events.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was one of the two weapons that Seo Tae-hyuk had.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well. Let's see...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk found the page he was looking for near the end of the notebook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blacklist NO.117, Park Seong-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A politician who committed numerous wrongdoings since becoming a senator.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would happen approximately two years from now.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Due to the secretary\u2019s declaration of conscience, most of the senator\u2019s crimes were revealed, and he went to prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The charges ranged from bribery to the instigation of murders. Still, Park Seong-ho only received a jail sentence of four years, of which he only served one. He was released on parole for the other three on good behaviour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had never met Park Seong-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Seong-ho had a great deal of prestige within the prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was less like he was staying in a prison, and more like he was staying at a luxury hotel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk clearly remembered the day that Park Seong-ho was caught.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Not only did he commit numerous acts of corruption, he also did not hesitate to use gangs to eliminate any in his way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eventually, all of his sins were revealed by his secretary, who couldn\u2019t stand doing the dirty work for the senator any longer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The raised dog had risen to bite his own leg.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Park Seong-ho\u2019s secretary... No, student number 97 of K University\u2019s political science department, Lee Ki-hwan. You will commit numerous evil deeds in the next two years, until you can\u2019t tolerate the weight of your sins, and make a declaration of conscience in the end. Before that happens, I will make you a loyalist.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk changed his voice to Lee Ki-hwan\u2019s using Voice Modulation. </span><span style=\"\">He then pulled out Lee Ki-hwan\u2019s phone that he had stolen during the interview.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a number that he called and hung up on several times a day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What was Lee Ki-hwan thinking as Tae-hyuk now held this?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All Tae-hyuk was doing now was profiting off of Lee Ki-hwan\u2019s efforts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hello. I was to make a report to the press director. Yes, I am Park Seong-ho\u2019s secretary, Lee Ki-hwan.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was just doing what Lee Ki-hwan would\u2019ve done several years later.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang flopped onto the ground with a flustered expression, a smartphone with DMB functionality in his hands.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All channels were broadcasting about Park Seong-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The current situation was like an onion. The more someone peeled, the more that was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-This can\u2019t be... F-Father...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah, he played very nicely with the leader of a crime syndicate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No way, perhaps...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang stared blankly at the sky, unable to believe the reality revealed in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a spark formed in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Seo. Tae. Hyuk! This was all done by you! \u00a0I will kill you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow? Will you do it directly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang called out to his subordinate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kim Jin-soo! Where are you? Come out right now...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He broke his leg, so why are you looking for him so urgently?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuook!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang made a sound that was a cross between a moan and a scream, and charged towards Tae-hyuk in despair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. Be careful, this place is the roof.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He lost his temper and tried to hit Tae-hyuk with his fists, who narrowly dodged them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They slightly scraped Tae-hyuk\u2019s side, triggering the Robbery skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Please select the item you want to steal!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror and chose Park Sung-kwang\u2019s waistband.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed that he was lucky, or that his opponent just had bad luck. Robbery had succeeded on the second attempt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of a sudden, Park Sung-kwang\u2019s pants fell down.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t move properly because his legs were trapped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think you should give up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Park Sung-kwang didn\u2019t give up, and forced his body to move as he aimed at Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaaaaack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But in the end, his body lost its balance and he fell onto a fence that was set up around the perimeter of the roof.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kung!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fence was unable to endure the weight of a human and started to fall.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It should have been able to endure the weight of three or four humans.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was the result of bad construction due to politicians being bribed.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kiiiiik!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaaack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang shrieked as his body started to fall to the ground along with the fence.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he fell, then he would die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He grabbed Park Sung-kwang\u2019s collar and pulled him up onto the rooftop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You haven\u2019t paid your dues yet. You shouldn\u2019t die like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had received only one million won from Park Sung-kwang. The rest would be paid after the test results came out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you will be able to give it to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang\u2019s legs had collapsed out of the fear of death. The area around his groin had become damp, and he was literally stunned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">News about Park Seong-ho was spewing from the smartphone dropped onto the roof.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An arrest warrant was issued and a full-scale investigation had begun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk formed a finger gun with his hand, and pointed towards Park Sung-kwang, who had fainted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBang!\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Tae-hyuk, are you okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young asked with a concerned expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOuchh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was sitting on a bed in the infirmary, holding an ice pack to his swollen face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although the situation was somewhat clear, it didn\u2019t exactly end well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang was rushed away in an ambulance. </span><span style=\"\">Despite the opposition of Jung Nam-ho, a disciplinary committee was held for Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The result was a one month suspension and 40 hours of community service.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Causing a disturbance in the broadcasting room. School property damage. Committing violence. These were his crimes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026 Well, I didn\u2019t think I would be proclaimed innocent even with the broadcast.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cB-But...! Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t do anything wrong!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rather, things had worked out pretty well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk had achieved first in the test results. Almost all the teachers, except Jung Nam-ho, suspected that there was cheating going on.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, they decided on a retest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, if he took the test now, then his average would be around 70 points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk was suspended from tomorrow on. The retest would be taken a month later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, it is okay since I got revenge for Class President. Instead, I want to ask you something. Please help me study in the next month and in the future.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young tearfully said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO-Of course!

My mother got out of the house early, and by the time I grew up, I had bruises all over my body. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. When I recovered my spirit, I was in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her voice was calm, as if she was telling someone else\u2019s story.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Hye-mi arrived at the Emergency Relief Centre a year ago, where other children with similar situations were gathered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The treatment I received there wasn\u2019t that good. Well, that\u2019s the mindset of the Korean people. It is the role of a parent to punish their child. I was seen as a troublemaker who ran away because I didn\u2019t like my home. Up to now, my explanation seemed like a rough morning drama.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They absolutely weren\u2019t pleasant memories.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Still, Hye-mi continued to speak with a serene expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like her sorrow had already become weathered down in the passage of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is strange isn\u2019t it? That place seemed to have gathered all the misery in the world in the same place. When I was there, happiness felt like an illusion that I couldn\u2019t have. And then I met Unni. Despite what she suffered, Unni was always the one taking care of the crying or depressed children.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk visualized An Eun-young and nodded,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are people like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi\u2019s frozen expression slightly softened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think it\u2019s easy to talk to you. Normally I only get one of two reactions when I tell my story, but you don\u2019t have either of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk seemed to know whether what she was saying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She either received sympathy or contempt, feelings that made a person feel miserable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt any rate, I will continue the story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi\u2019s story continued.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people suddenly became friends as Soo-bin looked after Hye-mi like an older sister.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Hye-mi always followed along behind her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only uneasy thing was that they didn\u2019t know when they would be separated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Emergency Relief Centre was just a temporary residence for people affected by domestic violence.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The children there would either return home or go to a facility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi and Soo-bin would be separated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a small miracle happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two people were sent to the same orphanage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a one in a hundred chance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once it was decided, they were so delighted that they hugged each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Many things happened after we came to the orphanage. Sometimes, my drunk dad came and asked for his daughter to be returned. There was a thief in middle school, so I received a nighttime punishment. However, Unni was able to help me successfully overcome everything and anything that came my way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi and Soo-bin were family to each other.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They fought against the discrimination of the world with their slender bodies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But there was one mistake. It wouldn\u2019t end with living at the same orphanage. For Unni, she only had two years left to live here, so we made a promise. As soon as possible, we would make a lot of money so that we could live together. This is the token.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi pushed out her left hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was something like a copper ring on his little finger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was bumpy, like it wasn\u2019t properly made.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Contrary to appearances, Tae-hyuk was well versed in art and quickly noticed what it was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, is that a bearing?\u201d (Refering to the ball bearing that reduces friction between moving parts)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Unni got it. She didn\u2019t want to be in school and got a job as soon as possible. That is where Unni first made this. There was no money to buy a ring.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Putting a ring on their little fingers meant fulfilling their wish.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Soo-bin was obviously filled with the desire to live with Hye-mi away from the orphanage as quickly as possible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was another meaning to the ring, however.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEither way, do you understand now? This is a token of my promise with Unni. I will continue wearing this on my finger as I promised. Unni didn\u2019t run away. I\u2019m sure she was scouted into a company and got a good job. Once she makes a lot of money, she will come back for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi looked at the ring on her left little finger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">To her, this ring given by Soo-bin was more precious than a gold ring that was worth a hundred, no a thousand times more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After hearing Hye-mi\u2019s story, his doubts changed into conviction.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Soo-bin didn\u2019t run away, and was involved in this case.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The problem was that it wasn\u2019t exactly clear how.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk started organizing things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Right now, three different cases are happening at the same time.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, the disappearance of the famous actress Ryu Myung-hwa.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then girls started disappearing like they were following her example.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The final case was the mutilation murder that Kang-suk went to investigate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How were they related to each other?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Indeed, this case is too complicated. In the end, the killer didn\u2019t get caught.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk knew the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It also meant that he only knew about what happened in the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had no information about the culprit behind this case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Truly. Isn\u2019t it all the same? So far, I have been fouling.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had to dig into the truth of the incidents with just his crime skills and Tae-hyuk\u2019s own abilities.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, the reward was huge, compared to what he had seen so far.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Either way, Tae-hyuk squeezed out as much knowledge of the future as possible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he remembered one useful thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wasn\u2019t Gangdong Police Station the headquarters of this doll case? And the coroner is...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, he wanted to identify the body that was found this time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And maybe...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put on as good of an expression as possible and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hye-mi. Do you want to go to a place where Soo-bin might be?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? What are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure. No one knows if Soo-bin is there or not. So I wanted to check. Perhaps in this world, you are the one who knows the most about Soo-bin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi looked at him with a bemused expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You want me to help you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the adults treated Hye-mi as a poor child, yet he asked for her help?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time she had received such an offer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Hye-mi didn\u2019t dislike it so she nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I can help since you asked me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a need to pay for the transaction.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to buy a meal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll treat you to a delicious meal. How about burgers?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Beef rib eye.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a cheap citizen who ate spicy pork stir-fry on a date with Moonlight Flower, but beef?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, solving this case required Hye-mi\u2019s cooperation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He felt regret, but it couldn\u2019t be helped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...Okay. The negotiations are concluded.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi used what she had surprisingly well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk added one last thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah right. Maybe I\u2019ll do something a bit bad. Keep it a secret from the adults.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled with a downright villainous face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are a bad person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk, who received another call from Coroner Park Min-soo, didn\u2019t say anything for a while.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His fingertips were slightly shaking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It ended up spreading to his whole body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t normal, like a person suffering from a high fever.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho asked as he drank warm coffee next to Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunbae. Didn\u2019t you just receive a call from Coroner Park? What new information did you get? Have their identities been revealed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not in the mood for jokes. Can we just sit for a while?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho whistled and pulled out a notebook to write down what he had learned about the incident.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The file name was untitled since the nickname of the criminal hadn\u2019t come out yet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, almost 20 minutes passed and he managed to clear up his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk slowly opened his dried lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They are alive.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? The victims?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. He said they were alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...What does that mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLooking at the state of the body, the coroner can see how long they have been dead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Indeed. That is the coroner\u2019s job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But this incident...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Please say it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This case. Cutting off the arms and legs... He told me that the victim was alive when they were mutilated.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All expression disappeared from Joo Hyun-ho\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm going to cut apart this bastard alive!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk howled like a wounded beast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The arms and legs of the doll were cut off.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The man looked at his work with satisfaction.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was almost like an artwork, but something was lacking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Hey. Please don't look at me with those eyes. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll give you even more beautiful things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The doll was looking at the man with a mixture of contempt and fear.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The man couldn\u2019t stand it and pulled the doll\u2019s eyes out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The arms, legs and eyes should come out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was thinking about the very pretty eyes of a doll that he passed by chance a while ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he wanted, then he could get it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man hummed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll give her arms to hold me tightly, legs to run towards me, and... eyes so that she can only look at me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man\u2019s insanity overflowed in the dark room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know how much time was remaining.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, if he hurried then he would be able to finish all the work before it was too late.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The man went looking for parts to give the doll.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had Kang-suk\u2019s phone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a copy, but he could still get a glimpse of the call history and email.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used it to clearly understand the people around Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were many things that could be done with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, let\u2019s try it for the first time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You can directly imitate the voice of Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk called Coroner Park Min-soo with a satisfied expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, Min-soo. Are you doing well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He heard a tired voice over the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I told you my lead.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">10 minutes ago, I called and reported the situation.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">It is obvious that the victims were still alive when the mutilation occurred.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Have you already forgotten?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha, sorry. Actually, I called because I have a favor to ask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">What is it?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have an important witness in this case, so I want to show them the bodies. I'll send them\u00a0to your location. Please.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Hey, that's illegal.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is why I am asking you. It will just be between us.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Hrmm...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Min-soo hesitated a little before replying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Will this help you solve this case?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I understand.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I am here alone now so I will secretly let them in.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you. Oh right, you know this is confidential?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I understand.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I won\u2019t write it down and will take it to my grave.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I'll pretend I don\u2019t know about this. You will do the same. At any rate, thank you. Then work hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The call ended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Min-soo seemed surprised that Cho Kang-suk had made such a request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then a disguise... No, there is no need.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was still wearing the Rudolph costume from the Christmas party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I can say that I came from a part-time job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had an accurate grasp of Park Min-soo\u2019s character.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t care about trivial things, and once he concentrated, he only looked at the corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think there are only strange people around Hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took a taxi and headed to the Gangdong Morgue.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, it was with Hye-mi.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Hye-mi got off the car and looked around with a perplexed face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The atmosphere was unusual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-Where is this? It isn\u2019t a hospital...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched the back of his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hye-mi. Don\u2019t you want to find Soo-bin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. I have to. Unni didn\u2019t come to pick me up so I have to go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I\u2019m sure that Soo-bin is here. Is it okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although Hye-mi was familiar with violence, it was different from death.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t know that the scent of death was blowing here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow do you know that Unni is here? Have you been kidnapped?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, it is similar?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They moved to the side door of the morgue, where someone was standing in front of a chained door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was Park Min-soo, whom he had contacted in advance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed a few times and walked over,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Detective Cho Kang-suk sent me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Aigoo. She is a kid. Is this okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Min-soo looked at Hye-mi with anxious eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t notice the Rudolph costume that Tae-hyuk was wearing at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi shook her head vigorously.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not a child. I am big.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I see. I understand. At any rate, I\u2019m secretly letting you in. Please come quietly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk and Hye-mi went inside with Park Min-soo.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The place where the bodies were kept was floor 1B.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll be on lookout so the both of you go in. I\u2019ve put them all out so make sure you check it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was in order to keep the bodies from rotting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once they entered, the storage was so cold that it was like a refrigerated warehouse.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was an autopsy table covered in plastic in the middle of the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It looked like doll arms and legs were arranged on top of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Doll...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi\u2019s eyes trembled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The fluorescent lights blinked as if they had reached the end of their life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Unfortunately, they aren\u2019t from dolls. Do you want to take a closer look?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi nodded silently and moved closer and she realized what was lying there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cB-Body...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShh.

Just a little trouble. The opponents at best only have a few kitchen knives... If a properly armed squad moves then all of them can be put in solitary confinement.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he looked at the phone on the table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A phone number was showing on it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he pressed the call button now, then he could ask for support.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it was something that he absolutely couldn\u2019t do.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could lose everything that he had done in the meantime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden unknowingly sighed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He drank what was left of the coffee and leaned back in his chair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for his subordinates to report.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kwang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, someone opened the door and came rushing in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-Warden-nim!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The deputy took deep breaths to recover from his run.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Have you finished assembling the squad?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-That isn\u2019t the problem right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What other problem has occurred?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The deputy paused like he was afraid of the warden\u2019s reprimand before speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The prisoners have occupied another area.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?! No, how is that possible...? This is a prison. They have to go through a lot of security to get to another area! How are those bastards...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Depending on the security level, all access to other areas were strictly controlled in Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even the guards who managed the prisoners weren\u2019t allowed to freely enter unauthorized areas.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now the prisoners had managed to pass through into another area?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t make sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It has been confirmed that the prisoners have escaped from the dining room and have occupied other areas. Maybe an excellent hacker is among them...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that a joke? Hacker? Are we filming a 007 movie?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The security of Blue Dragon Prison consisted of an access card, iris recognition and password.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if one was leaked, it was impossible to go to another area because they didn\u2019t have the remaining two.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But what was this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden rubbed between his brows and suppressed his boiling anger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had already happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he found that it was due to a mistake by a guard then he would severely penalize them later.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The most urgent thing was to solve the problem in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I understand. So where are the prisoners now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden\u2019s chest tightened as he saw the deputy\u2019s face turn darker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I won\u2019t be angry at the answer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That, r-right now, warehouse two...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cF-Fuck! What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden flipped out within five seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He banged his desk with his fist and shouted,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...The warehouse was robbed?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It truly didn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Warehouse Two contained things that the inmates absolutely couldn\u2019t touch.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The security level was much higher than anywhere else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The deputy gulped.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the words that the warden didn\u2019t want to hear emerged from his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, the prisoners have armed themselves with weapons from there. Around 30 people are involved... That is almost identical to the number of guards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeeeeeugh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Originally, the warden would\u2019ve tried to compromise to some degree.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If two groups with a similar power engaged in a war, then damages would occur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But the warden decided not to compromise.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His eyes were bloodshot and filled with madness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Deputy. I just came up with a good operation. Stop all ventilation in the prison right now and fill it up with tear gas. It is best to light a fire at the entrance to catch the raccoon hiding in a cave. How is it, my operation?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat You don't like it? Then tell me if you have a better idea!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry, but all the tear gas was kept in Warehouse Two.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, the tear gas was in the hands of the prisoners.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In the end, we have the disadvantage in firepower.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The deputy nodded without saying anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warden sighed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the situation was this bad, he should ask for support from the outside, even if it meant revealing his guilt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t do that.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">These drugs needed to be delivered to the Triads in China.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If this failed...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the warden made a choice that should never have been made.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik returned to the control room while twirling the bloody scissors around his fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung-nim, I\u2019ve completed what you ordered safely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Um. You went through a lot of trouble. It took longer than I thought.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ahaha~ I wanted it to be certain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik handed over some notes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho skimmed through it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm. The identity of the victims and the killing method. Even the place where the bodies were disposed... it is all here. Well done.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you. There were 14 people so it was hard to write it all down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"14 people... I knew he was crazy, but this is a little much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho smacked his lips together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Joon-shik had written down the memoir of a serial killer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know why Cigarette Seller wanted this but he was very interested.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho licked his lips and moved his gaze to the notebook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let\u2019s see who the poor people were. The first victim was the daughter of his boarding house owner who he had a grudge against. And...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kwang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of a sudden the door, the door of the warehouse opened and an agitated person ran in.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho put the notebook away in a drawer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although he was curious about the contents, that wasn\u2019t important right now.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He waited for the report of this subordinate as calmly as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim! There is a problem!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think the warden has gone crazy. He is preparing for an all-out war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHah... Crazy... Does he want to die together? It is the worst choice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho had been a prisoner here for a few years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, there were those who were well-versed in the environment of Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Right now, there are only 30 guards on duty... We have an advantage just looking at power. Moreover, there is the information that the Cigarette Seller passed on.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The prisoners didn\u2019t lack anything compared to the guards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shouldn\u2019t the warden be preparing for negotiations rather than war?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like pouring oil on a fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...After one or two armed conflicts, the war will return to a lull again. Then the situation will be on our side...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, his subordinate interrupted him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat isn\u2019t all. The warden has brought the Chinese inmates to his side. There are at least 60 of them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck! He must be crazy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He tried to stay as calm as possible, but he couldn\u2019t do that.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The warden was making a gamble.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The prisoners had robbed a warehouse so now he was arming prisoners to fight on his behalf?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There would be massive repercussions if this leaked out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho\u2019s hands trembled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if the armed forces were the same, there was a difference in power due to the participation of the Chinese people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even Yi Sun-sin, who led a legendary victory in the Japanese invasion, wouldn\u2019t be able to win.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho\u2019s brain moved quickly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no time to hesitate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter who won, both the prisoners and guards would be left with huge wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Should I bring in other prisoners?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apart from the prisoners who followed Shin Chang-ho, a massive number of criminals were imprisoned in Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he joined hands with them to fight the Chinese inmates...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...No. There are no benefits we can give them to fight with us. Damn. Is this the end? I\u2019m guessing there will be at least three years added...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Time passed by without a solution.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a prisoner standing outside screamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is a group of armed prisoners on the drill grounds! It seems like this area is their goal!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho muttered with a desperate expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The guards and prisoners are holding hands so it is impossible to cope with out power alone... Hah! We can\u2019t even fight properly...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The prison war created by the sausage seemed to end with the defeat of the prisoners.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, just like in any war, there was always a reversal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, should I prevent that guy from entering here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCigarette Seller?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He appeared in front of Shin Chang-ho after completely disappearing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and pulled out a cigarette from his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you tell me an interesting story, then I will sell it. Oh, the fire will be a bonus along with the cigarette.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho gulped and looked at Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His words didn\u2019t make sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"For reference, don\u2019t use anything like a lighter. If you\u2019re a man then you should use this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk indicated to the large plastic case next to him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Inside there were several cans, electrical wires and plastic bags with liquid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat, this? A bomb.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wind up this wristwatch and the bomb will explode after 30 seconds. Turning it off is impossible, so please avoid doing so unless you\u2019re absolutely sure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is the blast force?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t know exactly, but it can blow away this area.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho gulped and looked at Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a bomb that would deal considerable damage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t miss even the smallest of information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The allied forces will start soon. The installation of the bomb shouldn\u2019t be too late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...Then I will ask you one last thing. Is this safe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's see?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they installed the bomb incorrectly, then they would die.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The prisoners standing nearby gulped as they heard the conversation between the two.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, if they were ordered to install the bomb then they would do so.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, they didn\u2019t want to do it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho opened his mouth like he read the atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You guys. I'm sorry but I don\u2019t want to concede such a wonderful role. I will install the bomb.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-Hyung-nim!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Boss!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk ignored the people filming a noir movie in real-time and quietly escaped.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho would use the bomb to buy time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Meanwhile, he had other work to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...I\u2019m so busy that there should be two of me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used Spying to confirm that no one was nearby before using Disguise.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he looked in the mirror, then he would be the perfect image of the warden.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was simple to change the clothes he was wearing using Counterfeit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but I really don\u2019t care which side wins. I just wanted the warden to come out of his cage.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Upon arriving at the room, the deputy greeted him in a loud voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-Warden-nim! Didn\u2019t you leave? Why are you suddenly...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I forgot something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, is that so?

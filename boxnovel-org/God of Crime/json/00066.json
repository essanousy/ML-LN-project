(</span><span style=\"\">TN: A large gate that is a the entrance to a park\u00a0in Korea. Named after the March 1st Movement, one of the earliest displays of resistance during the ruling of Korea by Japan)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fourth bomb was installed in Tapgol Park, Jongno-gu, Seoul.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The hint mentioned a park and the 3.1 movement, so it wasn\u2019t too hard to locate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The problem was the rest of the situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The sun had gone down while he was running hard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Perhaps this would be the last bomb installed today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh really. Once I make enough money then I should buy a car.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk scratched his head as he thought of something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. That reminds me, I don\u2019t even have my license yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if he needed a license then he could make it with the Counterfeit skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, public transportation such as the bus and subway was still comfortable.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a citizen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk recalled the contents of the phone call that he made before.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It stated that the contact person had changed to Cho Kang-suk, and that there would be a reward if he cooperated in finding the bombs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI didn\u2019t think they would give the money so obediently. Still, it is strange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By the way, Cho Kang-suk would be in charge of him, which wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed like there was more confidence in him than Tae-hyuk thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t bad for Tae-hyuk if Cho Kang-suk was in a higher position.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he kept stacking up merits like this, wouldn\u2019t it be easy for him to eventually become the commissioner?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That should be enough for Noona. That reminds me, I have to prepare for their second date.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had planned something great for both of them, but it ended up not working.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk had received a call during the visit to the planetarium and had to go to work while wearing a suit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a sad day that allowed them to feel the woes of an ordinary worker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Tae-hyuk and Ha-ran went to the luxurious restaurant that was reserved.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran had enjoyed spending time with her younger brother after a long time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk had to spend 300,000 won for the meal, so he didn\u2019t know if the food would enter his mouth or his nose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, Tae-hyuk had decided to produce the second date.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bomb would be hidden some place to the right after entering through Samilmun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The December evening was so cold that he couldn\u2019t prevent the coat even with a thick coat.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, there were barely any people walking in the park.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if an explosion occurred here, the damage wouldn\u2019t be so great.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wondered if there were any witnesses around and triggered the Spying skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could feel some unseen eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had invested a great deal of affinity points to escape from Atlantis, and now it was possible to check the status and belongings of other people in a wider range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm... There is a cleaner with a broom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt like observing the surroundings through radar.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t use it often due to the serious stamina exhaustion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a minute. Cleaner...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk suddenly realized a strange point.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He took out his phone and checked the time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">6:30 p.m.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was long past the work hours.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cleaners were people who were sensitive to work hours due to it being an occupation that involved their bodies.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But this cleaner was staying up late to work?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a place where the bomb was installed, further heightening his suspicions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched his head. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Originally, the hidden bomb was supposed to be found at H High School around 10 tonight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tapgol Park was tomorrow at dawn.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of the biggest disadvantages of the liquid bomb was that it didn\u2019t perform well as a timer bomb.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, a specially made storage contained was needed to delay freezing as much as possible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But that had a limit of half a day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'In other words, Kim Tae-sung predicted the time that the bomb would be found and set up the next bomb.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a man with a very good mind, and had obviously calculated everything when he started this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The search of all schools in Seoul was also an operation to buy time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But there was something Kim Tae-sung couldn\u2019t think of, which was the presence of Seo Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same as playing a Minesweeper game while knowing the correct answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk arrived at the place where the next bomb would be installed much faster than Kim Tae-sung anticipated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe it wasn\u2019t a bomb but the Bomber hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It saved like he would be giving a present to the police officers suffering in this cold weather.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou must have suffered in this cold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk handed a warm can of coffee to the cleaner having a hard time in this cold weather.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. Of course not, it\u2019s my job. Thanks, I really appreciate this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cleaner was a man in his 50s with wrinkles around his eyes, indicating that he smiled a lot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two men sat down on a bench and looked up at the moon in the sky.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The cleaner grabbed the can of coffee with both hands and carefully raised it to his mouth before saying in an excellent voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"On nights with a bright moon like this, I think of my daughter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Your daughter likes the moon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cleaner replied with a look that said he was locked in his memories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. When my wife had my child, I saw a big moon in my dream. Therefore, I named her Sang-ah (Ivory).\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, isn\u2019t she the goddess of the moon from Chinese mythology?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, also known as Heng\u2019e. So she really liked the moon. She said she wanted to go there one day. Her dream was to become an astronaut.\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">(TN: The common name in Chinese mythology is Chang\u2019e)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk asked a question that was necessary when hearing old stories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The janitor smiled wanly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In the end, she went to the moon, along with her mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So why didn\u2019t you go with them?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cleaner made a serious expression and sighed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was locked in his thoughts.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was he remembering his happy days with his family?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A long time passed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once the hot can of coffee became cold, the firmly closed mouth finally opened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I still have work to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gulped down his cold coffee and said with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It was nice meeting you, Kim Tae-sung. I\u2019ve heard your story well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung\u2019s eyes widened. His expression seemed to ask how Tae-hyuk knew his name.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stepped on the can he was drinking and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I would like to send you to the moon where your daughter is. Well, I don\u2019t have enough ability. At best, I can only show you the stars.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? A-All of a sudden...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have activated the Violence skill.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Muscle strength and agility are strengthened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk swung the iron pipe made by the Violence skill and hit Kim Tae-sung\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeok...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung collapsed at the unexpected attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOuch... I thought I would die from the cold. Why was the introduction so long?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk checked the status of Kim Tae-sung who was collapsed on the bench.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He controlled his power but it seemed like Kim Tae-sung would be out for a while.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Perhaps it would be a few hours before he opened his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Once he wakes up, he will be panicked to see a strange ceiling.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took off the glasses he was wearing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He also tore off the beard that he had put on his chin.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a disguise but he looked quite funny.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk also covered his head with a beanie so he wouldn\u2019t leave any traces behind.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he took out surgical gloves.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once everything was ready, Tae-hyuk started to check Kim Tae-sung\u2019s belongings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, the tape recorder is found.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The recorded tape was in the pocket of the clothes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The content was a riddle about the location of the next bomb, which was found in a garbage-carrying cart.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The effect of the intimidation would fall if he didn\u2019t back it up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Indeed, there is also a primer this time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled bitterly after confirming that his memories were correct.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk tied up Kim Tae-sung\u2019s body after attaching the evidence with gum tape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is cold outside, so you might catch a cold. I\u2019ll have someone come pick you up quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the bomber Kim Tae-sung had made the whole country move for 120 hours with his bombs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had stopped him after 20 hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out Yoo Ha-yang\u2019s phone from his pocket, which allowed him to make calls without having his position traced.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, she had to be a night owl for that to happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but this time the criminal is caught so it is a happy ending! ...Please do this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung could be called a material to be traded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Until now, Tae-hyuk was only concerned about catching criminals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he could get new skills or affinity points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, even though he met new criminals after the hippo case, he didn\u2019t get their skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The reason was probably Tae-hyuk\u2019s low rating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If so, he needed to at least make money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk saw a serious deficit from the Death Circus case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ohh... I once had three billion won in my hands.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was nothing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if he came out of the Death Circus with it, Choi Sung-yeol wouldn\u2019t have paid him any money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a bourgeois game played with fake money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But now it was different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He now had a route to get money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">From now on, he had to move really carefully.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then shall I finish this Bomber case?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police were trying to catch the Bomber.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, they had no idea that Tae-hyuk had already caught him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made called Kim Do-shik\u2019s phone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But it would probably be Cho Kang-suk who picked up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It feels strange to deceive Hyung. Hyung, please excuse me for Noona\u2019s sake.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the call was connected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The call arrived.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho was filled with embarrassment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uhh, has he solved the problem already? Damn! What? What the hell is going on in that head?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been reading all types of history books for an hour, starting with Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was to solve the riddle left behind by the Bomber.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He knew the outline to a certain extent so he could get the answer in 10 minutes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the God of Crime had called.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho kicked the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk was in charge of contact with the God of Crime.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was speaking with a serious expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once the call ended, Kim Do-shik asked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDetective Cho! What did you find out? Did he tell you where the next bomb is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk made a difficult expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat... It isn\u2019t it. He didn\u2019t find the bomb.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aigoo. Then what? He called because he was bored?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho, who had been listening to the conversation between Kim Do-shik and Cho Kang-suk, jumped in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! I thought so. This problem isn\u2019t easily solved! Please wait a moment. I will definitely solve the problem faster than the God of Crime!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk burst out laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat... He found the Bomber, not the bomb.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ehh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people who heard him shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. He really called about that. The Bomber is caught.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-Where?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tapgol Park.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! 3.1, March 1st movement! Damn... Why didn't I think of that before?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk and Kim Do-shik ignored Joo Hyun-ho, who was running around with an upset expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then what are you going to do? Will you really give him money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If he really caught the Bomber then yes. It is a promise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"150 million...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But I still can\u2019t deny that the Bomber and God of Crime might be accomplices. So I\u2019d like to hold both of them. Therefore, I put a mini transmitter in the money bag. The National Intelligence Service is assisting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you going to catch the God of Crime?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Then I will see what tricks he used. Detective Cho, aren\u2019t you curious?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Do-shik\u2019s eyes flashed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His senses, developed from over 30 years as a police officer, told him something.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They told him that the Bomber was nothing compared to the God of Crime.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

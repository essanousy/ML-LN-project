What are you doing? The contract wasn\u2019t finished?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cL-Lee Cheol-su...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guests were completely overwhelmed by Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They had only watched the slaughter on the monitors from a safe place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, now the danger had neared them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like going to the cinema to watch a horror movie and having a ghost popping out of the screen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a crisis that they had never anticipated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guests fell to the ground to avoid the explosion.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No one had the courage to stop Tae-hyuk directly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young kept his composure and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Is that real dynamite?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and detached a stick of dynamite from his body and held it up in the air for everyone to see.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy? Do you want to experience it directly with your body? Ah, I see that there is no fire. Does anyone here smoke?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hiiik!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guests on the ground shook their heads desperately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In anybody wants to experiment then tell me. I\u2019ll let you feel it with your body. Oh, please don\u2019t move carelessly. My coworker has installed the same thing all over the building.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMe, me! I did it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The butterfly mask raised her hand as if to appeal to the audience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeok! Already...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young moaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as he looked at the dynamite around his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a fake bomb made using the Forgery skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Crude chemicals were combined to create something with 1/20th of the original explosive power.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only person who would die was the person holding it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If there was an explosion here, then Tae-hyuk would be the only one killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He increased the realism of the fakes through the Counterfeit skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Fake dynamite was created by combining Forgery and Counterfeit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How many people here could do this?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no one.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how coarsely a fake explosive was crafted, it would still explode if set on fire.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had participated in the Death Circus all night while keeping it on his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His mental state absolutely wasn\u2019t normal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Well, there is no detonator, so the wick needs to be set on fire directly. That is safe enough.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Break the Death Circus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order to do that, it wasn\u2019t enough to get rid of Kim Joon-young.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he didn\u2019t destroy the guests, who were the consumers, then a second and third Death Circus would appear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That\u2019s why he asked Moonlight Flower to steal their information.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When he asked if it was possible, Moonlight Flower nodded with a casual expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an absolute secret that must never be leaked.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was protected by digital security from a professional company with several layers of passwords which unfortunately belonged to her family.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Moonlight Flower... No, Yoo Ha-yang. The 3rd generation daughter of a huge security company...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once coincidences were repeated, it become inevitability. </span><span style=\"\">In the end, Choi Sung-yeol and Kim Joon-young themselves leaked all of the information to the security company that they believed would protect them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well. No one would\u2019ve thought about Ha-yang noona.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Yoo Ha-yang, who was smiling thoughtlessly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I need to pay off this debt.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bowed to Ha-yang who played a key role in destroying the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower just laughed with a strange expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk confirmed the number of people in the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were approximately 15 masked people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Joon-young had five bodyguards in black suits.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were also seven black suits in the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he added Kim Joon-young and Choi Sung-yeol in the count, then it was exactly 29 people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Didn\u2019t you sign the contract? You said that you would participate in the next Death Circus as a wolf.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Betrayer!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. What bad manners. I intend to follow the contract. But unfortunately, I am a busy person. Therefore, I would like to proceed with the next Death Circus today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled happily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aren\u2019t all the new participants gathered here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guests who realized what he meant screamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. Isn\u2019t it enjoyable to be the protagonists of a stage at least once? Ah right. Of course, I'll participate. The contract states that I\u2019ll get 10 million won for killing one person. Furthermore, if I kill more than 10 people, then there will be an incentive. So how much money can I make this time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chairman Sung Won-jin was lying on the ground and he grit his teeth together in anger.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What? They would participate in the Death Circus from now on?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he had a chance then the first thing he would do was to kill Lee Cheol-su.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he worked with all the guests gathered here...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, that lion mask over there. You seem to be plotting something. Is it really possible? Don\u2019t I have this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk tapped the dynamite on his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sung Won-jin screamed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had forgotten for a while but Lee Cheol-su had the dynamite.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be impossible to harm him, even if they attacked as a group.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If so, in a 1:1 match...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wait, they had to fight that monster?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They absolutely couldn\u2019t win!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Before, they had been enjoying his actions through the monitor, but now they had to go against him in reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sang Won-jin\u2019s face distorted with despair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he shook his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was his complete defeat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guests who realized that they would have to fight a monster fainted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s start the second one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until the closing of the new Death Circus -</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">480 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ugh... Tired.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stretched as he watched the sun rise and asked An Eun-jeong, who was quietly standing beside him,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you sorry that they won\u2019t be killed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, it hadn\u2019t been possible to open a new stage with the guests who came to watch the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was due to the police who received a report and arrived on the scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk and An Eun-jeong were able to escape the building safely with the help of Moonlight Flower.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That woman truly ran very fast.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower had reminded Tae-hyuk that he made a promise to go to the amusement park with her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she waved her hand and disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong bit her lip until it was bloody and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...No. I am just lucky to have survived. Then what will happen to them now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey will be judged by the law. I left a lot of evidence behind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see. Then running away like this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had removed all evidence that An Eun-jeong had worked for Tiwai.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The fact that she was involved in this incident would disappear from the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and replied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should thank the fact that you have a good sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Never let tears flow from the eyes of your family because of your actions again. Otherwise I will punish you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk turned and started heading somewhere.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong smiled at his retreating form and shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you so much! Saving my life and my family... Ah! This man! Listen until the end!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong sighed and returned home.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The things she experienced that night felt like a dream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Exactly one week passed by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had a proper job, not an illegal one like the multilevel scheme.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a cashier job to calculate the goods that the customers purchased.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a hard job where she had to stand for eight hours a day, but it felt like heaven compared to life in the Death Circus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At night, she went to a cram school to prepare for her entrance exams.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She wanted to go to university.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she worked hard every day without doing illegal work, would she someday be recognized by her parents?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She would go and greet her parents on New Year\u2019s Day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong laughed at the thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Clothes OK. Gift OK.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong turned around in the mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time she wore a suit since working at Tiwai.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That salary was twice what she was receiving now, but she felt like she had been doing something wrong.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And in the end, she had to participate in the Death Circus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would have happened if she hadn\u2019t met Lee Cheol-su?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is he doing now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, she didn\u2019t know anything about Lee Cheol-su.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had tremendous skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was he using it to capture other criminals?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was apparent that he was doing a big job.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A strange confidence rose now that she was wearing her best clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! Eun-jeong fighting!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-jeong gave a small shouted and headed out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was returning home, where her family was gathered, for the first time in ages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was only her sister and father but she felt full of something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-Is it really U-Unni? Unni!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her tearful sister threw open the door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong embraced her sister and stroked her hair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I can finally see my little sister...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had cried when she thought that she would go to hell without seeing her family.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong remembered the face of that man and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, she was able to meet her family again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was like a hero of justice who beat the villains and then disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am entering. Is Father home?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. But... I have a friend over. I called him to eat because he said he would be alone on New Years...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eun-young mumbled with a strange expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. My little sister. Is he your boyfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Eun-young\u2019s face turned red.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong gently patted her sister on the head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was already big enough to bring a boyfriend home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no! He is just a friend that I study with!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha. I see. I understand. I will trust you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, the voice of man was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eun-jeong came? It\u2019s been a while. It is cold. Come in quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was back after running away from home a few years ago, but her family acted like it was natural for her to come here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong\u2019s eyes turned red.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">From now on, she would make sure to act like a daughter to her father.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She vowed to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong walked towards the room where her father was waiting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? A guest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her father and Eun-young\u2019s friend were playing chess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Eun-young\u2019s friend. This guy. You are very wily. It is a lot of fun playing chess with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her father chuckled with a smile on his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her father was being overwhelmed as he said those words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was over. The opponent obviously had the skills of a semi-pro.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Well, perhaps... He did it on purpose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong looked at her sister\u2019s boyfriend.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He rose slowly and bowed his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hello. Nice to meet you. I am Seo Tae-hyuk who is studying with Class President.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike what Eun-jeong knew, his face and gestures were calm.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he obviously...!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and raised an index finger to his mouth and quietly said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a secret. Noona.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cheol-su...!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong couldn\u2019t understand why that fearsome monster was in her house.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ah, yes. He said that he came because of her little sister.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong sat down with a frightened face and started to cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I\u2019m really sorry...! I was wrong... Please forgive me...!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confused father of the two sisters said, </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...E-Eun-jeong. Father has already forgiven you, so you don\u2019t need to apologize. Yes? Don\u2019t do this in front of a guest. Isn\u2019t our Eun-jeong good?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, that's not it...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Eun-jeong was forgiven by her father.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a happy ending on the first day of the new year.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

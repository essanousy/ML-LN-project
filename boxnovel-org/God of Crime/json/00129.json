W-Whose fault do you think it is?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is karma for deceiving all the believers over the years. You can\u2019t be like a politician and blame others.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis bastard...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Jin-woo gazed at Phantom like he wanted to strike.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He touched the cutlery that was secretly hidden.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The person in front of them was a criminal that even the special forces couldn\u2019t catch.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, according to the Oyabun, Phantom was the one who handled the notorious Big Brother killer sent by the Triads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They wouldn\u2019t be able to live if they attacked him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Damn...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he knew this then he would\u2019ve brought a gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Kim Jin-woo and Park Bum-ho were thinking about how to fight that monster...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk quickly regained his cool and opened his mouth,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You aren\u2019t as big as the rumors. There would\u2019ve been tremendous benefits if you hadn\u2019t destroyed the cult. With those abilities, you could easily be the head of a religious cult. Being called a god by millions of people...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and interrupted Cho Min-hyuk,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t have a particular reason for shattering Sun. I'm sorry but you just caught my eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y-You kicked the pumpkin for that reason?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Actually, what I care about are the pumpkin leaves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...What does that mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk beckoned them to come closer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The cult leaders were overwhelmed by the atmosphere given off by Phantom and quietly gathered around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will summarize your situation in simple terms. The leader gathered a talented magician, a writer, and an engineer to create the pseudo-religion Sun. Your abilities showed a strange synergy and the group increased at a rapid pace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cult leaders stared dumbly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom\u2019s words were all true.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He really seemed to have a technique to read people\u2019s minds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then someone passing by smashed the plate. Well, let\u2019s say that all the accumulated evil spirits exploded.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed as he saw Kim Jin-woo\u2019s face distorting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anyone who had their profit machine broken in front of them would react in a similar way.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk stopped the agitated Kim Jin-woo from rushing towards Tae-hyuk and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You didn\u2019t come here just to tease us. It seems like you want something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He realized that they weren\u2019t a match for Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk\u2019s tone towards Phantom had become quite cautious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You noticed quickly. Is this how you were the leader for several years? Yes. What I want is a deal. Right now, the fanatics are aiming for you. They are searching and will discover you in a few minutes. What would happen then? Personally, I think the correct answer is either an Oriental Express style murder case or the French Revolution.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk started sweating at the conclusions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So let's skip the complicated story. I have a suggestion. I will help you guys escape from here. Instead, answer a question for me. Isn\u2019t it very simple?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...What will happen if I lie?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You can say whatever your like, but there might be a punishment after you are free.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"For reference, I want to know about the \u2018Yakuza\u2019 who are behind you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......!!!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk controlled his expression, but the other two turned white like ghosts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If that was a question then I would\u2019ve read the answer from your expressions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuhuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spread both hands out and declared,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome, choose. The Yakuza in the distance, or Phantom in front of you. Your fates will be changed depending on your choice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk was worried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to accept Phantom\u2019s offer in order to survive.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The issue was that Phantom wanted information on the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he made the wrong choice then he could meet a group of lions while trying to escape a tiger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he couldn\u2019t reject.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Without Phantom\u2019s help, it would be difficult to get out of here alive.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then what should he do?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Cho Min-hyuk came to a conclusion.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First of all, he decided to see what Phantom could do for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It isn\u2019t enough to just escape from here. If the Yakuza finds out that I spoke to you about them then it will be hard for me to survive after leaving here. I\u2019d rather...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There will be an after-sales service. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve already thought about that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk smiled as he answer he wanted emerged from Phantom\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoh, that means...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019ll send you to a place where the Yakuza absolutely can\u2019t touch you. Once there, you can do the same thing that you are doing now. Of course, it can be hard starting from the beginning, so I will go and help you a few times if you want. Is this enough?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The conditions weren't perfect, but Cho Min-hyuk decided to be satisfied with this much.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A lot of their earnings were siphoned off to the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If they took advantage of Phantom\u2019s power, then they could get a lot more revenue than they were right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk asked for confirmation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Will we really be in a place where the Yakuza can\u2019t reach us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I promise for sure. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What about the profits we earn? Do we have to give you a share?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course it is all yours.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike the Yakuza, his services were free.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If that was the case, this might be a huge jackpot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yes, they were simply changing clients.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Didn\u2019t this sort of thing happen frequently?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk slowly reached out his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand Phantom. I will accept the offer. I will be happy to tell you all I know. Then we are business partners.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Business partners. You can say that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled with satisfaction and shook Cho Min-hyuk\u2019s hand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, the cult leaders made an alliance with the criminal called Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk told Tae-hyuk everything he knew about the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The contents that emerged from his mouth was half expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Japan was a country where numerous cults existed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, many of them were backed by the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk was a Korean but he had grown up in a Japanese cult since childhood.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a Yakuza executive saw his talent and made a suggestion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Create a cult in South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">I will give you support for it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goal was to us the followers to do things behind the scenes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, Cho Min-hyuk decided to go to South Korea where he could be the leader of a cult.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And over time, Cho Min-hyuk became the leader of the Sun Cult.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like the Yakuza are planning something in South Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t much different from the Triads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Drug growing, organ trafficking, etc. </span><span style=\"\">Those things couldn\u2019t be done in their country.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk extended his notebook. It was the drawing of the strangely familiar man wearing black sunglasses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk might know who he was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, it is too small so I don\u2019t know if this is correct. That is Mister Park.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMister Park?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes and muttered the name.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same title that he found in the Blue Dragon Prison warden\u2019s notes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was it simply a coincidence?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. An agent of the Oyabun. Most of the orders come through him. I also trade the necessary supplies through Mister Park.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see. Do you know anything else about him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Only that he is Korean... Oh, I will notify you if he ever contacts me. But you won\u2019t be able to meet him unless I contact you personally.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In order words, Phantom wouldn\u2019t be able to meet Mister Park without his help.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-Heok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk felt goose bumps at suddenly hearing his voice from the other person.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once again, he realized how his opponent was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"For your mental health, I won\u2019t take off this mask.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk wasn\u2019t that familiar with the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of his information was useless.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he was a person with contacts to Mister Park.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he used Cho min-hyuk's voice and face, it was possible to meet with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems like we can\u2019t stay in here much longer. Shall we leave?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quietly led them out of the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The encirclement of the believers was imminent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a blueprint of the building. If you follow the escape route that I wrote down then you can escape from here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-We are surrounded by the believers...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will attract the attention of the believers. If the believers follow me in the opposite direction, then the encirclement will be broken. You can escape through the crack.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, Phantom is alive, so how can you be three people... Ah, you will use your skills.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's correct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom was capable of freely changing his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would use it and head in the opposite direction of their escape route. In the meantime, the scammers would leave here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk nodded with understanding.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pointed to an area outside the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A man will be waiting here for you. If you follow him then the Yakuza absolutely won\u2019t be able to touch you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. Thank you Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk, Kim Jin-woo and Park Bum-ho followed the escape path on the map.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We just need to follow this path.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cult leaders started walking towards the destination without knowing what was waiting for them.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

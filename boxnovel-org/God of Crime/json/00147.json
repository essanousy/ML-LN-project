Blackjack.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bosses sitting at the other tables gawked at him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If there was a blackjack, then the player would unconditionally win against the dealer, and they would receive 1.5 times the jackpot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was never a pleasant situation when they were competing against each other.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition to Yamaguchi, Mister Park was also gaining a lot of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng clicked his tongue and said, </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Didn\u2019t he already win a few games?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina spoke from her table in the rear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe completely holds the momentum. I think this will end in the Yakuza\u2019s victory.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Lady Luck is a capricious person. Even if she is laughing now, you never know when she will betray you. It isn\u2019t over until it is over.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He said this, but the momentum was completely on Yamaguchi and Mister Park\u2019s side.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Li Zheng forgot about his own hand for a while as he watched the two people play.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dealer\u2019s open card was a 9. It was a good hand with a high possibility of going completely without bursting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The card Mister Park received was a 5.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He boldly split it and received one more card.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, he bet an additional 10 million won worth of chips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The newly received cards were a 6 and a 9.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, he should take one more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But Mister Park stood firm.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was hard to win unless the dealer got a bust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe dealer\u2019s second card is a 6. If this happens, there will be one more card... Oh my god. The next card is a 10? T-Then isn\u2019t the dealer busted... Mister Park won with 11 and 14? I don\u2019t know about 14, but he should\u2019ve absolutely taken another card when it was at 11 points!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was so strange that he suspected there was a deal with the dealer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The dealer's winning percentage of 50% was deliberately decreased to 20%...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No, it was decreased to 10%.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the meantime, Mister Park made extreme bets that raised his dividend.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was ridiculous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Li Zheng swallowed back his groan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were too many things he didn\u2019t understand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Meanwhile, the number of chops between the two people had reversed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The house has 1.53 billion won and I have 1.1 billion won. And the Japanese 1.2 billion won...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina\u2019s chips were almost intact. However, her chips had swelled a little bit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t lose any chips due to her stable betting. Her meticulousness could be seen here as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng gained 200 million won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had started with 900 million so that was quite good.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He made bold bets and had a clear understanding of when to stop to increase his odds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...But haven\u2019t they doubled their chips in an hour? No matter how I look at it, that is impossible without buying off the dealer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina licked his lips and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Phantom is the one who prepared the things here. Do you understand what I mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Um...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Yakuza might have held hands with Phantom to put together a scam.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All of the people here were playing the mafia game to obtain Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If someone was already working with Phantom, then there was no reason to come here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the Yakuza weren\u2019t winning every game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, when they won, their profits were huge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They won so much that it was enough to be called a gambling god.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Meanwhile, the Yakuza had made another bet and picked up 90 million won worth of chips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was huge sum for such a short period of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But the two people are playing together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Yakuza were gaining a huge amount of money due to both Mister Park and Yamaguchi.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In most cases, if the subordinate was unsure of victory then they would forfeit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This meant...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There must be a secret plan to win.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng squinted as he watched the Yakuza playing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had to be some trick.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he could find it, then he could reverse the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina spoke carefully to her subordinate so that the other teams couldn\u2019t hear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSemon. What do you think?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The time limit for playing this game is 100 minutes, which is already more than half over. If both of you continue making money at the same rate, they won\u2019t be able to surpass you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm. that\u2019s a good thing. So what do you think is their secret to such great odds?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry. Unless the Yakuza are incredibly lucky, I can only think that they joined hands with Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Phantom didn\u2019t ally with the Yakuza. If that were so, then there would be no point in playing this game.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It might be a trap for the Yakuza to kill us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...Hrmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina gave a subtle groan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The possibility wasn\u2019t 0%.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But even so, she couldn\u2019t believe it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Phantom had many chances to kill us if he wanted. Not long ago, on our date...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe might have changed his mind since then.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Either way, I can\u2019t believe that Phantom has joined hands with the Yakuza. Isn\u2019t there a chance that they have psychic powers?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha, perhaps.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon agreed with the ridiculous comment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By the way, it was the right answer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Mister Park gave a sign to the dealer using his fingers, which meant to let him win.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had used the Hallucinogenic Incense to make a puppet out of the dealer and then used the dealer as a card shark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After that, he flipped over his palm.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a sign to stop giving him cards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Using the dealer as a card shark easily led to the Yakuza\u2019s victory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi Takeshi asked in a small voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMister Park. How much do you have in chips now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"730 million.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have 820 million, so if we combine both of our stacks, that is a total of 1.55 billion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"As it happens, it is the same as the Red Lady.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhuhu, we both have exactly 1.55 billion won worth of chips. There are five minutes left so we can\u2019t relax.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If the third game picked requires a dealer...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Our victory.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. You did a really good job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The one who controls the dealer will become the king of the casino. The other teams have also prepared a winning strategy, but it seems like ours is the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a minute. Please refrain from talking. The Red Lady is coming.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmph!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me. I\u2019m sorry but can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina and Semon, who were likely to lose the number one spot, came up to the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The smiles disappeared from the Yakuza member\u2019s faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but can we change seats? It feels like you might have something with the dealer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhu, that isn\u2019t the case. But I will ease your suspicions. I\u2019ll change seats.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The time remaining was five minutes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If she didn\u2019t earn the same amount of chips as the Yakuza then the rankings would reverse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina bit her lip and shifted her gaze to Semon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of Semon\u2019s eyes started trembling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhew...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina sighed with relief.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Semon sent her the signal that she wanted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant he had succeeded in counting all the cards on the table that the Yakuza had been playing at.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to prepare for this situation, she had ordered Semon to watch the Yakuza\u2019s table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Semon, who had terribly good eyesight, was able to see all the card patterns on the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Since the cards have been counted, I can unconditionally make money. I need to at least tie with the Yakuza so that were start from the same point in the next game...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had the ability to remember everything she saw and Semon was a genius at strategy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was confident that she could win any game if the conditions were the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The time remaining was five minutes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The last hand of Blackjack began.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina sighed with relief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hu... There was no support. Still, I narrowed the gap in the game against the dealer....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She has won an additional 30 million won. It was the same with the Yakuza.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, the Red Mafia and Yakuza were tied at exactly 1.58 billion won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the meantime, Phantom appeared and summarized the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will do an intermediate check. The Red Mafia and the Yakuza both have 1.58 billion won, while the Triads have 1.14 billion won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The chips acquired by the three groups totaled to 1.3 billion won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a tremendous return since they started at three billion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEverybody is great. I am good at the games but... I never thought I would be the lowest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina said with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is still the final game. Everybody has their own area of expertise, so why don\u2019t you choose one?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you mean me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't care.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi\u2019s eyes flashed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. What are the young people talking about without me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is about who should pick the last game. I think it should be the one with the lowest amount of money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the Triads had the lowest amount of money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a high probability that they would pick a game that relied on abilities rather than luck.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Caterina was confident about winning in a head-to-head competition.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng would choose the last game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi thought it wasn\u2019t a bad proposal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will listen to what it is first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it involved the dealer then he would absolutely win.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would listen to the game and accept if it was appropriate.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the game didn\u2019t need a dealer then he would use an excuse to play another game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then how about Bluff Poker?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a game where they placed a card on their forehead that only the opponent could see.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The success or failure of their bluffs played a huge role on who would win.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As it happened, Tae-hyuk played this game at the Death Circus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi nodded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to play Bluff Poker, a dealer was required to split the cards.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could ask the dealer to secretly tell him what his card was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is fine with me. Little Lady?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I would also like to play Bluff Poker.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Due to being at the bottom, Li Zheng added one condition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The lieutenants might look at the cards and secretly tell you. Therefore, this time I would like to fight with just the three of us. How about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm... Then send out the lieutenants?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Exactly.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am fine with that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhu... Then let\u2019s get started right away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina's winning strategy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yamaguchi's winning strategy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Bluff Poker was a game where all these winning strategies could be played.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no reason to resist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Li Zheng had a counterattack that could destroy all of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mister Park, Jin, and Semon left once Li Zheng gave a signal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The three remaining were the bosses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In addition, there were the cameramen and dealers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s start the final round of the mafia game.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Li Zheng spoke some strange words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHu, huhu... The game will end with my victory.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It sounded like a prophecy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom watched the mafia game through the TV.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the place where the spectators had watched the Death Circus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom drank coke from a champagne glass and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCoke is cheaper than a bottle of wine that costs hundreds of thousands of won. \u00a0By the way, everyone is very confident. Just looking at their expressions, everyone thinks that they will win.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sure they found their own winning strategy. But did you know? I made it like that on purpose.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew about Caterina\u2019s remarkable memory and included number games.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He knew that Mister Park had the incense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">So he set up a casino where the dealers could be taken advantage of.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">And...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"For Li Zheng, I placed a few game conditions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the TV screen, Jin knocked out Mister Park and Semon with a weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Obviously, I told them not to bring any weapons inside, but sniper threats from outside are acceptable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom deliberately created loopholes for victory.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His purpose was to bring them here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All of this without knowing that it was a trap prepared by Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng implemented his plan.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

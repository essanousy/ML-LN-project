(Zvezda= star in Russian apparently).</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a bloody struggle, he became the godfather with tens of thousands of members.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ivankov recruited Soviet troops, who had been unemployed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, into his large organization.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he acquired large quantities of scattered weapons to make a private army that he would use as mercenaries in the world\u2019s conflict zones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The war came to an end.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Zvezda accumulated tremendous wealth as an arms dealer and mercenary leader.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After Ivankov\u2019s death, the Hydra\u2019s neck that he had cut off, started to regrow.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The people that Ivankov trained aimed their guns at each other and conflict swallowed the Red Mafia again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The difference was that the weapons were guns and missiles, not swords.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the war persisted, only ruin would be left in its wake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ivankov\u2019s legal successor, the young boss Kataros, was well aware of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An old castle, Winter, hundreds of kilometres away from Moscow was Zvezda's home.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As the name suggested, it was surrounded by white snow all year round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Boss. Our plan was completely foiled by Phantom.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros sat on his office chair and looked at Semon, his second in command.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a genius with an IQ of 160 and had three doctoral degrees in economics.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Since Ivankov had been the boss, Semon had managed the organization\u2019s economics and was notorious for weapons smuggling around the world.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were rumors that he could supply submarines, tanks, and nuclear weapons at any time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only one he bowed to was the boss of Red Mafia, Kataros.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon said with an angry face,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRevenge is necessary. The damage he inflicted is millions of dollars.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Killing the Phantom won\u2019t make all that come back, Semon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But Kataros, it is dangerous if you ignore this. The other bosses won\u2019t stand it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apart from the godfather of the Red Mafia, there were nine representative bosses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kataros had legitimacy as Ivankov\u2019s successor, but his forces were the weakest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He only kept his position due to the absolute support of Semon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Mafia dealt with high risk crimes such as drugs, prostitution, trafficking, arms trading and casinos.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Kataros was interested in the so-called brain business.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He supported students who were smart but had no money to study things like law and economics. After graduation, they would work in the Russian mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took a long time to see the results.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, the other bosses objected violently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros and Semon just prepared it silently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The world is changing. I want talent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But it is money that moves the world. If there isn\u2019t a large amount of money available then Boss won\u2019t be able to do what you want. That\u2019s why you started the forgeries...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stopped before pointing out that it was the boss\u2019 failure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"And it failed. I know. Phantom hit us perfectly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So I\u2019ve prepared some extra budget.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon was the man who handled the biggest amount of money among the nine bosses of the Red Mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t understand why Kataros was refusing his aid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros said with a laugh,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I told you. I love talent. It is the same with me. Everything I\u2019m doing is to prove that I am fit for the position of the boss.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros had only been one of the nine bosses for one year.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t have any achievements.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If this situation persisted then Kataros would be forced out by the other bosses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn\u2019t like someone being fired from work. Rather, his neck would be sliced and he would be displayed on the streets of Moscow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That Phantom person is very interesting. It feels like he enjoys having people play in the palm of his hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If Boss commands it, then I will cut off his head right away and decorate it in a well-visible place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros coughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Semon was highly loyal but sometimes it was a bit intense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let\u2019s just watch first. We are not the only ones aiming at him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you mean the Triads?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. The long-term organ trafficking business they were running was blown up. It seems like the damage is considerable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The damage is bigger here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros coughed again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He spoke in a strangely sweet but sarcastic tone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey boasted that they sent their strongest killer to South Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He bought a lot of weapons from us. A high number of explosives... He can fight a war in order to get Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If Phantom manages to defeat the killer from the Triads, then I will go and see for myself. Maybe he is the person I have been looking for.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon narrowed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSouth Korea will be set on fire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. The movements of the Triad and the Yakuza are strange. Soon there will be a war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kataros said prophetically.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Inside the hotel room, \u2018Conquest of Paradise\u2019 was playing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was classical music that expressed the joy of Columbus discovering the New World.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother was moving his body on top of a woman while listening to the music.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeok... Heeeok...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The girl panted roughly before becoming quiet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother, who had been choking her from above, released his grip.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the woman\u2019s body flailed like a broken doll.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So don\u2019t just follow anyone. By the way, what was your name? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother inserted his fingers into an eye and pulled out the eyeball.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He pulled out a combat knife and cut the connected optic nerve.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He always carried a bottle of formalin in his bag.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be okay as a souvenir.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother picked up the phone on the floor and called the janitor.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-W-Why weren\u2019t you picking up?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">What can I do for you?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is some garbage to clean in the K Hotel Suite. She hasn\u2019t died yet, so you can sell her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I guess you didn\u2019t have a favorite part this time.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Just before...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. Just do what your job is. If you have a long tongue then I will shorten it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">H-Hik!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I-I\u2019m really sorry.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I understand.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then please have a shower and I will clean it up nicely.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother went to the shower and turned on the cold water.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His body was hot with excitement.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Chwaaaaak!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The icy cold water poured on his head, but it didn\u2019t cool the dark desires in his blood.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a long trip and he could kill dozens of people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. It is clean.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing out the shower, he found that his room was tidy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The bed-sheet that had been dirtied with something red had been changed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The janitor did a good job.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The table had a report that listed everything about his target, Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother wore a dressing gown and sat down to read it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...He touched the Russian mafia? This brat is putting himself out in the open. I should check him out once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he drank wine in the suite, attendants emerged from the darkness.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They placed various weapons on the table and disappeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother saw the familiar Russian semi-automatic gun Torkarev TT-33 among them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He aimed it at one of the attendants and pulled the trigger.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The head of the attendant scattered like a smashed watermelon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The faces of the other attendant turned white. He was</span><span style=\"\">\u00a0terrified of the man who laughed like killing one person was a fun game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hu... Now I am a little calm. I'm sorry but can you call the janitor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! U-Understood!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The survivor sighed with relief.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tang tang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but I like killing those who think they survived the most.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After killing the two attendants, Big Brother realized that he had no one to call the janitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Was this a little too much?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, his killing spree was just starting.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He laughed like a child receiving a new toy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Triads had dispatched a skilled killer to catch Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was armed with a large number of firearms distributed from the Red Mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An enemy\u00a0different from the criminals so far had emerged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t know this and was handling the enemies in front of him with a serious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No... No matter how delicious you tteokbokki is... Isn\u2019t it a little too much to make it for all the children in the orphanage?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one who spoke was Sister Viviana, a nun who cared for the children at St. Mary\u2019s Orphanage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am always thankful. After Hye-mi ate it last time, she was bragging loudly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, no matter how simple the food, it was more than 30 servings.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put the sauce into the large pot of boiling rice cakes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He grunted as he started to stir the contents with a large spatula that was more like a shovel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The smell is unbelievably good!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I used a good hot pepper paste. And this seasoning...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sprinkled some white powder into the pot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Sister Viviana tilted her head and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you putting in now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a secret. Do you know any chefs who would tell their secrets?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEhhh... Surely it isn\u2019t cocaine or...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This nun...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She had a naive face and harsh manner of speaking,\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t the Red Mafia, who dealt with such things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is Miwon. MSG is good for your mouth, regardless of your body. Ah right, some people treat it as a crime.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOmo. No?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyway, it is now completed so please help me put it on the plates.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I can help.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin said from where she was snooping around the kitchen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sister, be careful. It is hot so you might get burnt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin picked up the pot with her right arm and started to add the rice cakes to the plate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This arm, it is strong. It isn\u2019t hot holding something like this, and is quite comfortable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Kim Soo-bin seemed to like the Machina.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpeaking of the arm. Would it be better to use it a bit more carefully? It is still a machine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A friend gave it to me so it won\u2019t be respectful if I don\u2019t use it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cF-Friend...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sighed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was good if she liked it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin looked around the orphanage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am leaving here soon, so I wanted to give them a last present.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then you should do it yourself!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't cook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin and Song Hye-mi were leaving the orphanage to stay at Cho Kang-suk\u2019s house.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was only a short time until they graduated school and became self-reliant, but there were still freeloaders in Cho Kang-suk\u2019s house.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thanks to the Machina, Cho Kang-suk could now be at ease when going to catch criminals.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran also confirmed that they would have the promised date sooner or later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! Tteokboki!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once dinner was ready, the children entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Sister Viviana spoke as she watched them eating the delicious food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you very much.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you want to eat the tteokbokki?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, for many other things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sister Viviana smiled like she knew everything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then all of a sudden, the expression disappeared from Viviana\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She spoke in a voice that was empty of any emotion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There will be many trials for you in the future, but don\u2019t worry. Your skills will become even stronger in the future. In the near future, someone will appear asking for help. Don't ignore him. You must definitely take care of him...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Sister Viviana?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....Eh? I\u2019m sorry. I must have fallen asleep. Ahaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sister Viviana blushed like she was embarrassed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk asked several times about what she just said but she couldn\u2019t remember anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What...? It felt like someone borrowed Viviana\u2019s mouth to give me a message... I shouldn\u2019t refuse to help?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Viviana\u2019s words were strangely embedded in his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Breaking news.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">In Seoul, a person with guns has taken hostages at a bar.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk suddenly looked at the TV after hearing the report.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was clearly an entertainment program being broadcasted...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A gunman?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk approached the TV and listened to the announcer\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I'm sorry.

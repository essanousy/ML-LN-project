(TL: The name is deliberately written in lower capitals by author)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon looked around suspiciously, like he expected an ambush.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Both of them were suspicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Yakuza are behind this shop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as he watched the uneasy Caterina.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why, do you think I would sell you out? Well, doesn\u2019t this seem surprisingly good? Won\u2019t they give me one of the executive positions if I hand over the head of the Red Mafia?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y-You know...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina stretched out a hand to stop the agitated Semon from pulling out a gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Semon. If Phantom was really planning that, then he wouldn\u2019t have spoken it out loud. Rather, that type of suggestion makes the story easier. I can promise you three times what the Yakuza offered.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed and looked at Caterina.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Then I will listen to your story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina laughed and raised a finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please look at my face now...hmm. Do you think I am just a pretty face? Actually, Semon is the real boss behind me. So please don\u2019t talk that way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina\u2019s words were surprising.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had been suspicious when Caterina had introduced herself as the boss of the Red Mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At this moment, he realized that he took her lightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'She definitely isn\u2019t a normal girl.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time he lost a psychological battle against someone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t worry about being wiretapped. I removed all the surveillance cameras and recorders that were installed inside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let\u2019s talk more over a cup of coffee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they opened the door, the cafe boss was mumbling something while he was counting money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It looked like he was thinking of escaping from debtors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fuck~ I lost revenue due to that Phantom bastard closing my store.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, it has been a while. I thought this place would be full of customers, but it\u2019s already closed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Cough! Y-You...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and summon an iron pipe using his Violence skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he swung it at the boss\u2019 head.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cafe boss fell to the ground with a large sound.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk put the iron pipe down and clapped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now that the witness is handled, we can talk as much as we want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere did you suddenly get the iron pipe from? Are you a magician?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh, this? Trade secrets. Then sit back and wait. Do you want any coffee?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk muttered as he made coffee for three people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo... If I knew this was the case, then I would\u2019ve let him make the coffee before hitting him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they drank the coffee that Phantom made, the three people started to talk in earnest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Caterina stirred the surface that looked like a brownie with a fork and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, I should explain my situation. As you can see, I'm a woman.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, you don\u2019t have to explain that part.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A woman can\u2019t become the boss of the mafia.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Didn\u2019t you say you were the boss earlier?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is the problem.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina was the only child of the Ivankov family\u2019s boss.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He knew that if he died, there would be a battle over who would be the boss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Before my father died, he declared to all the members that he would leave everything to his only child. My father was literally the symbol of Zvezda. If I was a man, then I would\u2019ve been able to take over the Red Mafia without any problem. Even if they didn\u2019t swear absolute loyalty to me like they did to my father, they wouldn\u2019t be able to rebel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded with an understanding expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Caterina's situation is similar to the King of Russia.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Red Mafia, Zvezda is a coalition of various organizations across Russia. Of course, there are eight bosses. I can\u2019t stop them all by myself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In the end, you will die in the fight against them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The end of the Red Mafia that Tae-hyuk remembered wasn\u2019t so different.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of the nine heads, there is only one who follows me. In such a situation, I can only do one thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked into Caterina\u2019s eyes as she told the story.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was speaking a shameful story.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were words that couldn\u2019t be said in front of her subordinates.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was the situation so desperate that she was telling him this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In other words, you have to prove that you have the ability to be the Red Mafia\u2019s boss.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk suddenly had an epiphany.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Mafia had done something in South Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm, by the way. Was it the Reubens business?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Red Mafia had distributed forged artwork through South Korea.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he had completely ruined their plans.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Surely it was the work of the woman in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina gazed at his opera mask with a red face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhu, I didn\u2019t do that due to some malice. It was just a few fakes...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen the damage sustained...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Caterina was unable to bear it and raised her hand to her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Ugh. I didn\u2019t come to talk about that business, so let\u2019s stop talking about it. After analyzing the past events, I realized that you aren\u2019t someone who would help a female in difficulty. You only move due to what interests you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am like that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Doesn\u2019t that mean if the conditions are right, we can cooperate with each other? I have some bad memories but I\u2019ll forget about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, Tae-hyuk had inflicted one-sided damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hrmm... The Red Mafia\u2019s boss is rendered helpless.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She came to see him directly so it wasn\u2019t a simple lie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So you want my help for Caterina to be recognized as the Red Mafia\u2019s boss?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please, call me Anne. I don\u2019t like that name.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you like.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are many who covet your abilities. Japan\u2019s Yakuza, The Triads in China, and the violent organizations in South Korea as well. The name of Phantom is more widespread among the mafia than you think.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So what do you want me to do? Don\u2019t tell me that you are planning to sacrifice the other bosses? I think it would be quicker to ask the guy standing over there. The merchant of death, Semon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC-Cough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon coughed as his name was called.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he didn\u2019t come forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t that simple. Even if I cut off the hydra\u2019s heads, new ones will just grow in their place. However, there isn\u2019t enough budget to do a new business. The only thing left for me is South Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSouth Korea?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is where I need your help, Phantom. You are in a conflict with the Yakuza. Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Triads as well. Don\u2019t you think they are too big to fight alone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It made a lot of sense.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want to touch the Triad unless they acted first.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the Yakuza were different. He needed to fight them in order to obtain Yamashita\u2019s gold and smash Mister Park.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anne accepted it as a positive answer when Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Semon and I will be your allies. You don\u2019t need to do anything for us. Just continue fighting with the Yakuza and the Triads. Then I will be able to build nests in South Korea without them interfering.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Anne, after gaining South Korea, would be recognized as the boss of the Red Mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom would be used as a barrier to block the Yakuza and Triads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn other words, do you mean a non-aggression treaty? That seems to only be lucrative to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If necessary, I will support you with firearms and troops. And once the whole thing is over, I\u2019ll make you the 10th head of hydra if you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, he would be the boss of the South Korean branches.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Obviously, if he entered into an alliance, then he would gain the power to fight both the Yakuza and Triads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he needed to keep in mind that the condition for upgrading to a King was to conquer the mafia game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Could he become a King if he allied with the Red Mafia to deal with the other two?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk hesitated, Anne opened her mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If that isn\u2019t enough, there is one thing left that I can give you. With me...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, Anne didn\u2019t finish her words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Demon Revealing Mirror within Tae-hyuk\u2019s clothes started vibrating violently.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Biiiiiik-!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A warning cry rang in his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Caution!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The Spying skill has detected a danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The special ability has been triggered and 20 affinity points have been reduced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Time remaining until the raid on cafe893.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-00:01:49\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk trembled as he saw the message in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the special feature of Spying that detected the collapse of Atlantis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-What is it? A-All of a sudden, a large sound...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon shrugged like he didn\u2019t know what Anne was talking about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYoung Lady. I\u2019m sorry, but I heard no sound.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You didn\u2019t hear that sound just now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no time to watch the argument.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Meanwhile, the countdown to the attack was steadily decreasing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Fortunately, it wasn't at the level of the bomb exploding in Atlantis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk reached towards Semon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What do you mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have no time to explain now.

D-Don\u2019t tell me the Yakuza...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk raised a finger to his lips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he used Spying to see how many people were approaching.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are around 30 armed gunmen with assault rifles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is fortunate that I have a weapon, but fighting alone against 30 people...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Semon fought against 30 people, then his body would be riddled with holes like a honeycomb.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anne approached the window and looked out using her hand mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she murmured in a despairing voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-We are completely surrounded...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her eyes gazed at one of the attackers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t wearing a mask so she could see his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were the Yakuza.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...The Red Mafia. Maybe one of them didn\u2019t want me to be recognized as boss.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Semon moaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuoong...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI wonder how they knew we were here.

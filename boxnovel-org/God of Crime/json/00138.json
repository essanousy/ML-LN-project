An inmate? That means...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This place was a deserted corner of the maintenance room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No inmate would bother to come to such a place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'A spy planted by someone. The purpose is to monitor the Bomber?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung had the best bomb-making ability in this country.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In terms of public awareness, he was inferior to Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, any criminal organization would drool over him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk touched the gun that he had hidden.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Bullet Time had to be activated with a firearm.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would work even if bullets weren\u2019t loaded or the safety device was still on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Now, let\u2019s check who the informant is.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who are you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The person scratched his head and walked out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did I listen to something that I shouldn\u2019t have?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eh? Yoo Cheol-ho?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s mouth curved upwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Due to the tunnel that Yoo Cheol-ho had dug, he had been able to work freely in Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had forgotten to return the favor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But they met again this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I happened to accidentally hear you talking while working nearby... But I just came and didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Your saliva increases when you lie. I know that there was no work scheduled in this area today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho smiled and whispered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But Guard-nim spoke a very interesting story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a lie that he hadn\u2019t heard anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You really did hear it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! My ears are a little sharp so I couldn\u2019t help hearing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So what did you hear?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, there is no need to hide it. Huhu, aren\u2019t you trying to help Kim Tae-sung escape from here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho spoke slyly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"And that thing bulging at your waist. Isn\u2019t it a gun? It looks like a pistol loaded with bullets, rather than a taser gun. Certainly, I don\u2019t think any guards would carry something like that around. Therefore, you are someone pretending to be a guard in order to help Kim Tae-sung escape.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s reasoning was correct.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As expected from the person who boasted that he was a genius when it came to escaping.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don\u2019t they say that bodies can\u2019t talk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend that method. I wouldn\u2019t do it if I was in Guard-nim\u2019s position.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you shoot a gun here, then the people in the building will hear and come rushing. Then Guard-nim\u2019s plan will be disrupted. In addition, I am also interested in a jailbreak. I know a few bits of information. What is the difference if two people escape instead of one? Besides, I am confident in my hard work. I will be a well-behaved person who listens to your words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to join the team.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, I don\u2019t need to use a gun to suppress you. It looks like you have confidence in your physical strength. But I have this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk reached into his pocket and pulled out a rusty iron pipe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho was surprised to see such an object emerging from a person\u2019s clothes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A moan emerged from his mouth at the seemingly impossible action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huheok! W-Where...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a simple trick. But your second reason is a little interesting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The middle of the jailbreak plan that Tae-hyuk set up needed a breakthrough.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had Bullet Time so he wasn\u2019t worried about getting hurt.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But if Kim Tae-sung got hurt, then the plan would be disrupted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I should check how plausible his jailbreak plan is.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhu... Then can I join?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, first let me hear your plan first, Escape King.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! Escape King. That is a shameful title.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho asked with curiosity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How do you do that? You look like the guard, but your body type is clearly different. Is it a special make up?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk deliberately wore large clothing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But seeing through it meant that Yoo Cheol-ho had pretty good eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This is why Yoo Cheol-ho is later known as the Escape King. Even so, Yoo Cheol-ho is still Yoo Cheol-ho.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A wicked smile appeared on Tae-hyuk\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He came up with a plausible plan to use Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That isn\u2019t it. You can see from this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeok! M-My face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I am Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh, god...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You won\u2019t be able to find God, Yoo Cheol-ho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A bright smile appeared on Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s face, like he had won the lottery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That person was surely Phantom!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Being on his team meant that he could really break out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was how Phantom, the Bomber, and the Escape King formed a team to escape from Red Phoenix \u00a0Prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk returned to his original disguise and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But there is one condition for you to join the team.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is the condition?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is because security is vital. Shouldn\u2019t we trust each other if we are to be working together?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho started nodding at the speed of 50 rpm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO-Of course. I absolutely won\u2019t reveal this to anyone. I will keep the secret, even if a knife was held to my neck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Good decision. Then I want to hear an answer: Why did you follow the Bomber? Don\u2019t say that you were cleaning here. Well, I think I already have a rough guess. Someone ordered you to watch Kim Tae-sung. What if you tell them the story of the jailbreak? So make a decision if you want to be on the same team. Phantom, or the one who gave the command to you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... That...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s eyes started shaking violently.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was evidence of extreme confusion.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had heard a lot about Phantom\u2019s greatness but...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like he was a mind-reader!\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Not only could he change his face at will, but he might be a real psychic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho seemed to be conflicted, so Tae-hyuk decided to push him a bit more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you leave here, then it won\u2019t matter. What do you have to worry about?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyak! That\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho nodded as he made a decision and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI understand. I will tell you everything I know. Yes, I clearly need to explain since we are on the same team now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled at Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho explained why he was watching Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...So that\u2019s what happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. In the end, it was the prison warden?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are literally playing the role of a spy. What would\u2019ve happened if it entered the ears of the other inmates?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha, I could escape from jail so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party moved to a more discreet place before earnestly talking about the jailbreak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNobody will come to this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There doesn\u2019t seem to be a tail this time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I'll listen to Phantom\u2019s plan first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s plan was simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Phoenix Prison allowed one visitation day a week.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It couldn\u2019t be helped since the island was far away from land.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"During the visits, most of the guards will be assembled together. You will use a disguise to break through the main entrance. Then you intend to steal the ship in the port and escape right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think it is the simplest and best way to get out of here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho frowned and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, Phantom will be able to get out using this method. But there is a chance that Kim Tae-sung and I can be hit by a taser gun. Why don\u2019t we do something else instead?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s opinion was definitely valid.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One person could get out easily using that method, but it was a different story if there were more than two people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He should reduce the variables as much as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If there is a better plan, then I will listen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho started to talk about his plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, you should know the main feature of the Red Phoenix Prison. It isn\u2019t equipped with proper medical facilities. So if there is a seizure or serious injury, the person will be taken to a hospital on land to receive treatment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In other words, fake an illness.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have a detergent that I packed in advance. After mixing it with water and drinking it, a person will look like they are foaming at the mouth. But with Phantom\u2019s power, isn\u2019t it possible to do a more plausible act? Furthermore, things will become easier if you disguise yourself as one of the transportation guards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho created a plan in a short amount of time that took into account Phantom\u2019s abilities.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He truly was the Escape King.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe biggest drawback to the original plan is that the transportation would be handled by the guards. If Phantom is in charge, then we can leisurely escape once we arrive on land. You have the face-changing magic. Is it possible to change into anyone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, I need to meet them face to face and listen to their voice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The images of the guards working here passed through Yoo Cheol-ho\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was definitely one guard in charge of transporting patients who was currently inside the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm... If so, I know one of the right guards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGreat. You thought of all this in a short amount of time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. It is an impossible plan without Phantom\u2019s abilities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho felt his whole body shaking with pleasure.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was the first time he felt this way.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was recognized by the great Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When is that person working?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He finishes today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's good. Tell me the name and I will go to steal his face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho gave the name of the designated guard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded and stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It will be lunch time soon, so let\u2019s finish up. We will meet here again in the afternoon when the morning work is over.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cU-Understood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Tae-sung, who had been watching the two people from the side, nodded in response.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He intended to leave the escape to the two experts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBy the way, Yoo Cheol-ho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you going to do when you get out of here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, I need to find the person who put me in here. I also want to find the high school brat who reported me. Then I\u2019ll slowly think about what to do next.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see. I wish you good luck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha, you bet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Humans didn\u2019t change easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Cheol-ho spoke as Tae-hyuk was leaving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want to be prepared.

Oh, you mean when will this jailbreak occur?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Preferably it should be this week...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk cut off Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fast was good, but this was a little too fast!</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

This isn\u2019t an online game where I become more handsome due to an upgrade.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been six months since he first got the crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018\u2026When I think about it, many things have changed.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After gaining the memories of the future, the first thing he did was catch Yoo Cheol-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even now, he couldn\u2019t help smiling as he recalled it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There had been many things since then, such as being involved in the cheating incident of a politician\u2019s son, as well as having his parents\u2019 keepsake stolen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He solved them using skills acquired from the other person and then he became stagnant for a while.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But now things had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Eh? One thing that I saw in the status window...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tae-hyuk... Sorry but please take this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk asked for help with the plastic bags full of food on the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, it seems like he would have to look at the Demon Revealing Mirror later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is soondae, makguksu... Why did you buy so much?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhuhu... I bought food that is suitable to eat with tteokbokki.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran followed after him with a big smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were ready to have a tteokbokki party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah... This is a lot of food.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the prepared food with his mouth wide open.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Far from making him hungry, it was such a huge amount that his stomach hurt at the thought of eating it all.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin also muttered with an embarrassed expression,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t think that even Alibaba and the 40 thieves could eat all of this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bah. If we say Open Sesame, won\u2019t it all go into Detective Cho Kang-suk\u2019s mouth?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Hye-mi spoke to Soo-bin like they were real sisters,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKukuku... If you don\u2019t eat then there won\u2019t be anything left for you!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk threatened with an open mouth, causing Kim Soo-bin to laugh.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Fortunately, she seemed to have recovered to a certain extent from the Doll Play event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, everyone please sit at the dining room table.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran finished setting out all of the food and beckoned towards the party.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin and Song Hye-mi were hungry from the cold winter and started eating.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They consciously didn\u2019t say anything about Kim Soo-bin\u2019s injury.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Therefore, the topic naturally turned to Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn\u2019t know that the person who saved Unni would become so famous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. He felt like a dark hero active in the darkness. All of a sudden, he appeared on TV...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk scratched his head and sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom was wanted for bombing T Medical Centre and aiding in murder.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was now a criminal, but Hye-mi and Soo-bin were treating Phantom like he was a superhero in a movie.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same with the netizens on the Internet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Fan sites for Phantom were growing like bamboo shoots in a bamboo forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He did all types of illegal acts, but it was true that he judged criminals that the police couldn\u2019t catch.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As a result, Kim Soo-bin and four children kept their lives.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Plus...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Omo, Kang-suk. Could you look at me for a moment?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Ha-ran wiped the tteokbokki sauce from Kang-suk\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a cry burst out from the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Both of you, are the two of you dating? There is a suspicious atmosphere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHum hum... Anyway, Soo-bin. What do you plan to do with your donations?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk blushed and coughed a few times before saying uneasily,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-That... I don\u2019t know. It still isn\u2019t mine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin benefited the most from Phantom appearing on TV.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She became a victim of the horrible incident, losing one arm and barely surviving.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, she was the first person that was saved by the dark hero, \u2018Phantom.\u2019\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like the heroine of a movie had popped out in reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, Kim Soo-bin instantly became famous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A considerable amount of money was collected from all over the country for her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The sum was almost more than 500 million.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were even companies that started a scholarship foundation to support her university tuition and those who offered her a job.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was evident that they wanted to piggyback on Phantom\u2019s fame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But to Kim Soo-bin, it was like a ray of hope had started to shine in the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk hesitated for a moment before slowly opening his mouth,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you know that your father came to the hospital?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though the domestic violence caused the police to issue a restraining order, he was persistent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He claimed that he should be able to manage Kim Soo-bin\u2019s money as she was his daughter and she was underage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Legally, he was Kim Soo-bin\u2019s father.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he filed a lawsuit then the situation would become complicated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, Cho Kang-suk proposed a solution.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So I was thinking. I will become your guardian and take care of you until you are an adult. H-H-How about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk stuttered out the last line.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin covered her mouth with her hands at the unexpected suggestion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Detective-nim? W-Why...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk explained his thoughts in a low, subdued voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m a detective. It is my job to catch criminals, and also my mission to protect the citizens. But this time, I couldn\u2019t do anything. Phantom did what I should\u2019ve done. He is obviously a criminal that should be arrested. However, if he was in front of me right now then I would like to thank him. So, I wanted to do something that he couldn\u2019t do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were bugs after the money.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After Seo Tae-hyuk got his first large amount of money, didn\u2019t moneylenders come after him?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, Kim Soo-bin was a soft girl.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, the most important thing to me is Soo-bin\u2019s thoughts. Don\u2019t you become an adult in a few years? If you allow me then I will be your guardian until that time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-thank you Detective-nim...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t know about other adults, but she could believe Cho Kang-suk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had supported the orphanage for several years already.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She also knew that he was the Santa who visited every year.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Such a man being her guardian...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt like she had acquired an army behind her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi, who was busy eating, spat out something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t Phantom calculate this when he came on TV?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me... Then that...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin recalled Phantom\u2019s last words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Live.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin survived like he said.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, she found an unexpected guardian.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was all this Phantom\u2019s plan?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm? Did he say something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Soo-bin told Kang-suk about her conversation with Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His eyes reddened without realizing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn... He is a criminal, but he is a really great guy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk listened to the conversation between Kim Soo-bin and Cho Kang-suk and realized that his plan was successful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'This will make Phantom a symbol.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was fighting to escape the fate of being framed and imprisoned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His weapons were his crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He walked alone while committing crimes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even without being framed, there was always a possibility of going to jail for the crimes he did commit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, the existence of Phantom the God of Crime emerged.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a distinct symbol completely separate from Seo Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the future, he would be able to do things more freely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'In order to do that, I have to hide my identity more completely.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t enough to simply change his voice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk saw new possibilities in his crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Evolution into a top skill...!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was one of the best perks that Tae-hyuk received from becoming a Noble.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pressed on the details of the Voice Modulation skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then an explanation that he hadn\u2019t seen before emerged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[If you satisfy the conditions, it will evolve into the top skill \u2018Disguise\u2019.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Disguise!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The name evidently meant that it was a skill to change his appearance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a skill that Tae-hyuk needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It would be good if I could gain it for free.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was likely that a great deal of work was needed to obtain it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you allow me then I will be your guardian until that time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Tae-hyuk almost spat out the tteokbokki he was eating.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How much had he struggled to get Kang-suk and Ha-ran together.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What? Guardian?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, he had guessed based on Kang-suk\u2019s character but he hadn\u2019t expected this offer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018N-Noona! Then Kang-suk hyung will come with a family. Is this the time to be looking with such a warm expression?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The time for dating seemed to be reduced even further.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He should make Kim Soo-bin able to live alone as soon as possible for the sake of those two.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The first thing to take care of was her arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Well, maybe it would be good to give her another arm?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the early days, a mannequin arm that looked awkward would be used.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, technology was evolving and a number of smart robot technology was being actively researched.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The replacement wouldn\u2019t be better than her original arm, but at least she could live a normal everyday life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The problem is the price.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So far, the technology wasn\u2019t commercialized.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want to invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a mechanical arm that didn\u2019t work well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Then I can steal it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He also wondered if he could copy it with Forgery.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he could copy a number of robots then the utilization would increase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is worth a try.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at Kim Soo-bin like she was an experimental guinea pig.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhh... I am also a student.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a short winter vacation, Tae-hyuk went to school and languished on his desk. Despite\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">his bad looks, the teacher\u2019s heavy hand disappeared after he became a model student.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But human nature didn\u2019t change that easily.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Every time he sat on his desk, a yawn would emerge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere is Class President today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young wasn\u2019t sitting next to him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was uncommon for her personality.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Did something happen?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let\u2019s send a message.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Dururuk!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tae-hyuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young opened the door and entered with a joyful smile.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She ran to Tae-hyuk to deliver the good news first.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An Eun-young approached Tae-hyuk and took deep breaths.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh?

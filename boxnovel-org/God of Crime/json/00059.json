Did I look that bad?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, he didn\u2019t have a good impression of his looks in the past.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, now he felt like he went beyond the \u2018not bad\u2019 level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It feels like more characteristics have arrived. Surely it isn\u2019t a side effect of the crime skill...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he gained more crime skills, Seo Tae-hyuk became aware of his stats.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was directly reflected on his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As intelligence rose, his brain became better, while as agility went up, he could move faster.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Perhaps the crime skills affected his appearance as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAish, it can\u2019t be.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled as refreshingly as possible, forcing out the freshness.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The mirror showed a miraculous reflection of how much effort he put in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm hmm. Handsome.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like he looked the most wonderful after having a shower.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at himself with satisfied eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He himself was aware that his personality had changed considerably from the past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was doing this because he was now going to meet Yoo Ha-yang.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were going out to play, but it was technically a date.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to maintain the basic courtesies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. Noona helped me out this time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smashed the Death Circus exactly 70 hours ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition to that, he got two blacklist members and a huge 20 affinity points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Current affinity points in possession: 20]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just seeing it caused a smile to appear on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gained points if he managed to establish a relationship with a person he didn\u2019t know in his past life, or if he saved someone who should\u2019ve died.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time he got 20 points at once.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It meant that Kim Joon-young and Choi Sung-yeol killed a lot of people in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they were caught, the atrocities of the Death Circus became known throughout the country.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The shocking thing was that dozens of chaebols were involved in the case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Like hyenas finding rotten meat, the media started biting at them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Wouldn\u2019t it be a case that shakes the country for a whole month?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing his shower, Tae-hyuk wore his now trademark leather jacket and skinny jeans.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t clothes suitable for a date with a woman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled with satisfaction and left his house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The plan was simple.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First, they would eat likely before stopping at a marine theme park for a few hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people were eating at a restaurant that Tae-hyuk had previously reserved.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Ha-yang\u2019s expression was strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time he had seen her look like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke as he ate spicy pork stir-fry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, Noona. You don\u2019t like spicy pork stir-fry? Then you can buy something else. There are many things </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">on the menu here. I am paying, so you can eat at will.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then she shook her head with a flustered expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been here. Wah... You can have the side dishes. Let\u2019s go to the amusement park after eating.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The place where the two people were eating was a branch store selling kimbap for 1,500 won.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were dozens of dishes sold at low prices, so it was Tae-hyuk\u2019s main restaurant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Come to think of it, Yoo Ha-yang was a chaebol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She wasn\u2019t well-matched with common places like this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt sorry at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-yang had been a big help in solving the Death Circus case.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In particular, he was able to secure information about the guests with her ability.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Wouldn\u2019t it be better to reward her with a more luxurious restaurant?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'But I don\u2019t have the money.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could barely afford the theme park admission fee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk earned over 100 million not long ago at the casino.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, rumours of a subway being built near his house were circulating and the price of the house had increased by 60%.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were also the living expenses and school expenses for his brother and sister.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he didn\u2019t make any money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had to catch one or two more people like Yoo Cheol-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, he didn\u2019t earn one cent from the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Rather, he had to spend money for Moonlight Flower to enter the masquerade party.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was literally a deficit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ohh. This is really dangerous. First, I need to get some money.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was possible if he used the Gambling and Forgery skills in the right way.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If so, what should he choose?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It needed to be a low-risk and high-return method.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He needed to seriously consider this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people ended their meal and went to the newly opened marine theme park.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was an amusement park that was a combination of an aquarium and an amusement park.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! I wanted to come here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-yang enjoyed the trip like a middle school student on a field trip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then what do you want to see?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Dolphins!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the moment, Tae-hyuk remembered that the hippo incident had taken place at an aquarium.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a completely different place from here, but he couldn\u2019t help but think about it when he saw the water tanks filled with water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Eeit! I\u2019ve been hanging around criminals too much. I just want to relax today. What could possibly happen?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk thought and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then why?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had an ominous feeling that something was going to happen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that time, Tae-hyuk heard the conversation of a couple passing by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you see today\u2019s news? A huge number of chaebols were arrested for watching a slaughter show.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I did! At first I thought I was watching the ad for a new movie!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen did you know that there was a man who saved those who were captured? They were all people who would\u2019ve died, but he used his great abilities to lead them to escape.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow, great! So what happened to him? Did he receive any commendation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. The person who saved them suddenly disappeared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah! How perfect! What is his identity? An FBI agent?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The couple didn\u2019t know that the person they were talking about was right next to them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-yang heard their conversation and paused,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, over here! He is actually he... Oof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk blocked Ha-yang\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN-Noona. You shouldn\u2019t say that!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Ah. Indeed. Sorry. But Tae-hyuk saved everyone. The fact that no one knows this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk answered with a small sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNoona knows. Isn\u2019t that good enough?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Ha-yang smiled widely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used all types of illegal activities to catch criminals, so if he got caught by the police then he would be handcuffed, not rewarded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would also repeat the same thing until he was promoted to the Noble rank.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had 12 people left to catch on his blacklist before he could be promoted to Noble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before that, he absolutely couldn\u2019t go out into the spotlight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was a need to be as careful as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I shouldn\u2019t expose my face now.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would take advantage of it to make a profit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and looked at the huge water tank in front of him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The escalator they were riding passed the tanks towards the basement.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The place where the dolphin show was being held was the fourth underground floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Atlantis Theme Park was a huge dome shaped building, and various rides could be enjoyed on the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The building was over 30 metres tall, so it was incredible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The marine park, which extended all the way to the fourth basement floor, was very popular because it gave the feeling of being under the sea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk got off the escalator and looked around.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were huge tanks holding thousands of tons of water.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was shaped like a donut, and the audience could see various sea creatures in the hole in the middle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tae-hyuk, look at that! Moray. It looks exactly like you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We\u2019re completely different!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s mouth twitched.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He looked just like the fish passing by him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But what happens if all of this breaks?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yoo Ha-yang tapped the water tanks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was very thick, but she still had a hazy expression on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhaha. There is no need to worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A female guide wearing a uniform approached the worried Ha-yang.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-yang replied with shining eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Our Atlantis Aquarium boasts an extraordinary water tank made of a special acrylic that has ultra-fine fibres of 90cm in thickness. It can withstand a water pressure of 500,000 tons, and won\u2019t break, even when shot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I see! Then I can look around with confidence!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is natural to feel uneasy. But don\u2019t worry. As long as a bomb explodes in front of it, the tanks absolutely won\u2019t break.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the middle of the city so there is no need to worry about bombs. Right Tae-hyuk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-yang smiled at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Seo Tae-hyuk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But Tae-hyuk was muttering something with a serious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Water Theme Park Atlantis. The super large tanks...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-yang tilted her head to one side. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk still seemed to be thinking of something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCracked, collapsed, submerged... The cause was a bomb explosion!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk managed to remember.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Atlantis suffered a tremendous accident half a year after it was opened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The water tanks in front of him were destroyed and the entire underground area submerged.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Hundreds of people died and it was a huge disaster.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t a mere accident, but a bomb attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The culprit...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Bomber Kim Tae-sung!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the guide with a serious expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She would know the exact fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How long has it been since the first opening?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Obviously, if his memory was correct, a tremendous disaster would occur here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It also wasn\u2019t too far in the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe this was the source of his ominous feeling.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guide kindly gave an explanation of the history of Atlantis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Three years ago, the Water Theme Park Atlantis started...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk cut in and stopped a long story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So when did you open?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, yes! As of today, it is 91 days. Why do you want to know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is three months. Huu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sighed with relief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid something happen? That reminds me, you said something about a collapse. What relation...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shrugged.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anyway, it was going to happen three months later.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he spoke now then he would be called a fraud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh, nothing. Just a mobile game story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo it is like that! At any rate, what you see in front of you is called the Milky Way of the sea...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guide started explaining as she descended the escalator.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Other guests were listening to the story as well.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But something was wrong.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The disaster would happen three months later.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He knew the criminal was a blacklist member so he would be able to stop it from happening but that uneasy feeling didn\u2019t disappear.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like he had closed his eyes and was walking towards the edge of a cliff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This feeling became clearer every second.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Biiiik!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike usual, the Demon Revealing Mirror started vibrating violently.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed to be a warning.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk projected the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Caution!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The Spying skill has detected a danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The special ability has been triggered and 20 affinity points have been reduced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Amount of time remaining until Atlantis collapses:</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-00:00:29\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk trembled as he saw the message in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">20 affinity points had disappeared in an instant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the danger was right in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk stopped thinking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First, he had to move to as safe a spot as possible to avoid this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNoona.

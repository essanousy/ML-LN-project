Is he late again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShh. Talk quietly. He\u2019s going to hear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat does it matter if he hears? Will he bite my head off? Or beat me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...T-that. Last night...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cV-violent incident? Hiik!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was just at first glance.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Buzz buzz!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Many students on the road were talking about Seo Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like he was a celebrity!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018... That isn\u2019t it. Also, aren\u2019t the rumors about me spreading quicker than I initially thought?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought that at the least, it would take one more day for them to spread.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had become the worst gangster of the school overnight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Conquering all the bad groups in the area. Bullying money from students in other schools. Using violence. Playing naughty pranks on girls passing by. ... I\u2019m not some hero of a manhwa!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of this occurred in around half a day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was ridiculous, but the students believed the rumors either way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk could guess why it spread so quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang had probably used SNS (Korean social media) as a means to spread these rumors.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He probably opened around half a dozen chat rooms, in which he freely slandered Seo Tae-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The rumors would then blow up by themselves as they were reinterpreted and spread to more people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was repeated so many times that most of the students now knew of Seo Tae-hyuk\u2019s bad deeds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed bitterly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He really is the same as his father.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Manipulating public opinion using the media.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although there was no proof behind that claim, it was still a clever use of both technology and psychology.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was doing bad things.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if someone didn\u2019t believe that claim at first, their doubts would soon turn to conviction after hearing several people repeating it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang had many friends, and put the money that came from being the son of a politician to good use.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were at least 10 people involved in this matter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That number was enough to incite most of the students in school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now no one would believe him if Tae-hyuk accused Park Sung-kwang of cheating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I just wanted to be a model student. Isn\u2019t this the opposite from what I wanted?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Furthermore, it was obvious that it wouldn\u2019t end with just this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Oh my god...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A miracle was occurring as Tae-hyuk walked.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Students parted in front of him like he was the plague.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The situation was more serious than he thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once he opened the door and walked in, the loud classroom suddenly became quiet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">People started whispering in small voices; and although he didn\u2019t hear them, he knew what they were talking about.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk walked to his seat and sat down, prompting the person next to him to increase the distance between their seats.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t say anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTae-hyuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young, sitting in the seat in front of him, spoke in a small voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... Is this Park Sung-kwang\u2019s doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wiped at his eyes like he was moved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you believe in my innocence?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"O-Of course! S-sorry. Because of me... Do you regret it now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I\u2019m kidding... Why are you so serious?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was just in Tae-hyuk\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t hesitate as he replied to An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you talking about? If I could travel back in time, then I would still save Class President.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was natural.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t uncommon to form connections with intelligent people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh...? Eu? Yes? Yes... I-I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s face instantly turned red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She tried to answer but couldn\u2019t speak.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then An Eun-young raised her finger like she suddenly remembered something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, right. The student adviser said for you to go see him straight away...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well. Maybe this incident has even entered the ears of the teachers. Either that, or Park Sung-kwang is planning to beat me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cL-Let\u2019s go together...! I will tell Teacher-nim that Tae-hyuk did nothing wrong!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. Recently I have become friendly with Class President.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, yes. Friendly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen would they believe Class President\u2019s claim of my innocence?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young was dumbfounded at Tae-hyuk\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cS-Still!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will go to the office now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I'll be waiting at the door!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite his words, An Eun-young still wanted to come along.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk chose not to refuse anymore.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once he went to the office, the student adviser greeted him more angrily than usual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tae-hyuk! Tae-hyuk! Tae-hyuk! Hey, you son of a bitch. Why did you do it? It has only been a few days since you promised to be reborn. Yes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou bastard! I know. I know it all! Don\u2019t try to lie and deceive me. Tell the truth, and I will consider extenuating your circumstances.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI really don\u2019t know what you're talking about.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis bastard... Denying it until the end! There was a witness, a witness! Did you think no one saw you when you hit a student last night? His leg was broken so badly that he has at least 12 weeks of recovery! I thought you were a good person who got into small trouble. Have I been deceived? Say something, you son of a bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t even laugh due to the sheer absurdity of the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I harmed a student?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHah! It seems I was mistaken about you. Showing no signs of remorse and reflection after brazenly hurting someone. Who? Kim Jin-soo! I went to the hospital last night and saw him. He was beaten half to death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clenched his hands into tight fists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought that it was just a bunch of rumors.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But someone was really hurt?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Jin-soo, who had been fine just yesterday, was now in the hospital. What really happened?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Park Sung-kwang. You really went this far.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had broken the leg of his follower just to frame Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt anger boiling inside of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhyu. This shameless guy. In my heart, I want to make you exactly like Jin-soo. Yet, I\u2019m very sad because I can\u2019t. At any rate, a disciplinary committee will be held after the test tomorrow. This will probably result in a suspension or worse. By the way, I will be strongly arguing that you be expelled.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The smile disappeared from Tae-hyuk\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Expulsion.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If An Eun-young wouldn\u2019t separate herself from him, then would they be kicked out of school together?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt a fierce anger towards the man called Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are still denying it like this until the end! Very well, you can go now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, by the way, Teacher-nim. Have you ever received a bribe from Park Sung-kwang?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? What did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNothing. Keep up the good work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk left the office without looking back.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young, who had been listening to the conversation outside, looked like she was about to cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tae-hyuk... R-really. I\u2019m s-sorry...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smiled and stroked her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, I should be the one to say sorry. In fact, I even wanted to play this little game at first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"P-play?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But now, I think that I should go to war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had planned to steal the test paper submitted by Park Sung-kwang and make him sit in the re-test alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But that wasn\u2019t enough anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a dirty fight where one of the two people had to be finished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Either Seo Tae-hyuk would be expelled, or Park Sung-kwang would be ruined.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. I thought something like this would happen after I threw the bait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shortly after Park Sung-kwang had declared war, Tae-hyuk had called his father\u2019s secretary and laid a trap.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If it worked properly, then it would be very fatal for Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">And...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk explained his plan to An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her cooperation was necessary in order for it to be successful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c... I\u2019ll give it a try. But will it really succeed? It seems to heavily rely on luck...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk replied in a confident voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will do it somehow. Believe in me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, yes. I trust you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Phew. I sound so irresponsible since she doesn\u2019t know about the Demon Revealing Mirror. It is good that she still believes in me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed with relief. An Eun-young trusted him to such a strange degree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he had no intention of betraying her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then, shall I start the cheating?\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

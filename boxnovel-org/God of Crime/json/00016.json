Seo Tae-hyuk! You raised the white flag to surrender!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang was delighted after hearing that Tae-hyuk wouldn\u2019t go against his cheating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, he hadn\u2019t imagined that he would lose so much money as well as a follower.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, in the end, he was able to get what he wanted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was so delighted that it was almost unbearable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang clicked his tongue and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBy the way, I am sorry. I can\u2019t cancel the expulsion. The water has already been spilled.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, that? I\u2019m okay. I can just transfer. But I would need a lot of money to move schools. I\u2019ll also need to buy a new uniform.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, giving you money... Haha. It seems like we are talking now. By the way, do you still want 500 million?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I'm sorry, that was a joke. I am happy with 500,000.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha!

How about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang called out to An Eun-young who was behind Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh, Class President.

I couldn\u2019t take any photos. Well, lately... The composition technology is really great. Won\u2019t it look completely real?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang held his belly and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s face turned white. She could imagine what the photos would show.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang stepped closer to An Eun-young, then he whispered in her ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn\u2019t there still a long time until graduation? Please take care in the future.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He moved away from An Eun-young and grabbed Tae-hyuk\u2019s collar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk just extended his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Give me the money as soon as possible. At any rate. Is this the establishment of a contract?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang held Tae-hyuk\u2019s hand and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I\u2019ll deposit it straight away. I am thorough regarding deals.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shook Park Sung-kwang\u2019s hand with his right hand while his left hand manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I really didn\u2019t want to use the points on this but\u2026 damn, I\u2019ll bite you to your very bones.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk used the three affinity points he had saved up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Crime Skill: Robbery has gained a new attribute.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[When a robbery occurs, you will have three seconds to choose the item you want.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The items owned by the other person can be checked by \u2018Spying.\u2019]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After confirming that the attribute was bought successfully, Tae-hyuk used Spying.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He confirmed that Park Sung-kwang had the item he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sent a signal to An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As promised, she pretended to fall and pushed him to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Class President must have been nervous.

There was a possibility they would give wrong information in the desire to die together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So, he had to block it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for An Eun-young to show Park Sung-kwang the test paper as instructed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, she was still concentrating on the paper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang, who was sitting behind Tae-hyuk, started to feel nervous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Class President is doing well.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Sung-kwang couldn\u2019t imagine that An Eun-young taking her time was part of Tae-hyuk\u2019s plan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was to make him feel urgent so he would make rushed decisions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was seven minutes before the end of the test.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Three minutes after Park Sung-kwang instructed, An Eun-young placed her answer sheet by a corner of the desk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a sigh of relief from behind Tae-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Park Sung-kwang.

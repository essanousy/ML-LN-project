How did you come in here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason for their panic was simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a place that absolutely couldn\u2019t be entered without permission, yet a person with a skull mask and leather jacket had entered this place unhindered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was suspicious, but didn\u2019t seem dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I have one jajangmyeon for delivery.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-What, jajangmyeon? That would never happen, so get out of here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. As expected, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the situation inside as he spoke.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were around 30 guards in the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were those in charge of the VVIPs of large corporations.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Why were so many security guards needed?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he used \u2018Spying\u2019, the Hawk Eyes attribute automatically activated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could see the status window of the opponent with it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Since he became King, he was able to recognize the weapons the opponents were carrying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hyu~ they also have guns.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were real guns loaded with bullets.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most guards these days were armed with toys, such as tasers or gas guns, yet the guards here were holding pistols.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, they were loaded with real bullets, rather than blanks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The guards exuded the same aura of professionalism as a special forces trained unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The uproar at the entrance was so loud that the person who seemed to be the leader walked out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Why is it so noisy?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, here...a strange person came here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A strange person?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He talked nonsense about delivering jajangmyeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader looked at Tae-hyuk with sharp eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deliveryman?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he wanted to pretend then he should\u2019ve at least brought an iron box.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t even seem like a hitman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. Maknae. Show the guest out.\u201d (Maknae=the youngest person)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yep!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader didn\u2019t know what this person\u2019s purpose was but he didn\u2019t want to make things bigger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGuest-nim. I don\u2019t know why you are here but it is over. Let\u2019s go now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A mixed martial arts fighter grabbed Tae-hyuk\u2019s arm to drag him out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But there was something odd.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He touched something metal beneath the leather jacket.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But strangely familiar...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guard realized what it was and screamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAck! What is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-This bastard has a gun!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t just one.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out a Colt M1911 and Beretta 92.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was common in movies to hold guns in both hands.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, those who used guns knew how hard it was to pull off.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If the person didn\u2019t shoot properly then the accuracy was off and the wrist would be damaged.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t a toy like BB guns...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll tell you in advance that this isn\u2019t a model gun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha? So?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other person obviously didn\u2019t know how to fire a gun properly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The leader beckoned and the suited men pulled out guns.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Cheolkeok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader said with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This isn\u2019t a model.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, OK! The situation can\u2019t be resolved by talking to each other right? Okay, okay. Bullet Time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The skull masked man chanted something like a spell and fired his guns.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tatang!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Tang!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Tatang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKwaaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What, what is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A few guards collapsed in an instant from holes in their heads.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The leader of the guards realized the serious situation and shouted,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-He has a real gun! Everybody take cover! There is only one opponent! If we remain calm then we can beat him!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were elites in the security industry that were trained at the special forces level.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, they struggled to deal with one intruder.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the first place, this wasn\u2019t a suitable room to fight in.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no place to hide their bodies properly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the meantime, the opponent was firing through gaps like they were targets at the shooting range.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why can\u2019t we take out someone who isn\u2019t even hiding?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then a guard behind a couch shouted,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"S-Something is strange! How did this happen...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was natural for the guards to panic.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opponent was fighting with his body exposed but their bullets didn\u2019t hit him at all.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like he knew where all of the attacks were coming from.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ugh! Ah, it can't be helped. Here I am!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the leader fired his gun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He aimed at the opponent\u2019s chest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the skeleton masked person raised a hand to block the bullet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPuhaha! Fool! Do you think you can stop a bullet with your arm?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Ting!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then his mouth dropped open as he saw the bullet bounce off the skull masked person\u2019s arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-How...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The skull masked person grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I came here to sell a new arm. It is bulletproof.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was literally overwhelming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guards boasted significant shooting skills that couldn\u2019t be compared to the mafia.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he was able to easily deal with them thanks to his upgraded crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is good that I modified the human body.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Tae-hyuk had the body of a human.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Illegal Surgery evolved into Body Modification.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could freely use Machina, a machine arm, instead of his original arm.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, it was forged to look like a human arm, but it was actually Machina, made from a superalloy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was to the extent that it could block bullets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'But the damage to Machina is considerable. I should try to avoid bullets if at all possible.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he looked at the guards, the Demon Revealing Mirror sent him a notification.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Number of remaining guards: 14/31]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then red dots appeared on the map, showing where the guards were currently located.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used Bullet Time to accelerate his mind and the bullet lines to see where the opponents were firing their guns.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter the difference in numbers, it would be strange if Tae-hyuk lost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'If I knew this then I would\u2019ve come with a machine gun, not pistols. It feels good to shoot them one by one.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk thought as he fired at a guard who protruded his head from the table he was hiding behind.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tatang!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Tatang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time his gun fired, a guard collapsed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The bullets fired from the opponents were easy to block.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once the number of guards reached 10, the opponents surrendered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Don\u2019t shoot! We will give you anything you want! J-Just spare our lives!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The screams of the shot bodyguards could be heard from around the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The leader of the guards was at a loss for words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A shootout was occurring in a building in the middle of the city.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. You seem to be the highest ranking one here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-That\u2019s right!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader walked forward with both hands up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sheesh. I wanted to kill a little more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spoke like it was a game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"K-Kuheok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader moaned with a bitter expression. His precious men were killed or injured.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk slowly walked closer and asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where is Chairman Song Won-jin right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y-You are after Chairman...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I just asked where Chairman Song Won-jin is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk smirked as the leader didn\u2019t answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you remaining silent? Then...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He aimed his Beretta 92 pistol at the head of a man that was currently moaning on the ground</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will ask you once again. Where is Chairman Song Won-jin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-What the hell is your identity...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should\u2019ve answered well. Why don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk fired at the head of another guard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t a threatening shot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He made sure to take the other person\u2019s life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I understand! I-I will answer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader realized that he would be left until last and started to reveal what he knew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm... He was there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is everything I know. So the remaining people...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Did I make a promise to spare your lives?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tatang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shot towards the chest of the leader.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t even groan and died instantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-This scammer! You said you would spare us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The guards, who had been giving up, raised their guns and started their last hurrah.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the result was just like before.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the dozens of guards collapsed around him and installed a bomb in a corner of the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was someone who was still breathing but it didn\u2019t matter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is small but it is enough to blow up the room. This will get rid of the bodies and evidence all at once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk quickly left the security room and hit the detonator, causing the bomb to explode with a loud bang.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was no longer interested as he looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. Interesting. This is how it works.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Find Chairman Song Won-jin and get information!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A new message appeared on the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The leader said that Chairman Song Won-jin was hiding in a hotel with a entertainment spot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then his next destination was decided.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had to leave here before the people who heard the explosion came running.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk walked out onto the streets where the hot sun was shining.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a bit unsettling that he didn\u2019t show any emotions after just killing dozens of people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had completely become a criminal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A castle like structure was located not far from the city centre.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the J Hotel that only the peak of the political and economic world could enter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the hotel was luxurious and had the finest entertainment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk tried to enter, a security guard stopped him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This place is only for reserved guests.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Reserved? I made a reservation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? W-What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pretended to pull something out from his pocket and hit the guard\u2019s head with his iron pipe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were many people inside the building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A gunshot would definitely be noticed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I should use Transformation so that I can enter peacefully. In fact, I should\u2019ve met the guards as Song Won-jin. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t sound sorry as he entered the hotel.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A woman with a strange hair color approached him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, Guest-nim! Welcome! Please let me know your reservation number and I will guide you there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She thought he was a normal guest because he passed through the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I just went to the convenience store for a while. I don\u2019t remember my room number.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had turned into Song Won-jin before passing through the front door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A security guard would have to show a pass, but customers were different.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With this face, he had a free pass.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The female staff replied with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, could you tell me your membership number?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t know that.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">During this time, Song Won-jin\u2019s phone might ring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he threaten her with a gun?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he shot a few areas without killing her, then she would probably speak.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As he was thinking that, a man passed by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, C-Chairman! When did you leave? I\u2019ll guide you back to your room.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the nametag of the other person and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, Chief Kim. Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha! No. We are always working so that Chairman-nim can relax.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, he was a person who knew Song Won-jin.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thanks to that, Tae-hyuk was able to easily find the room where Song Won-jin was staying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he opened the door, hot air and strange moaning could be heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPant...! Pant pant! W-What? I didn\u2019t order room service.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Song Won-jin, who was gasping for breath above a woman, turned and looked at the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA-Ack! W-What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Chief Kim who reacted.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Two people with the same face looked at each other.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, one person stood with a cynical expression while the other person was lying on the bed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, Chief Kim went through a lot of trouble. Please rest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He swung the iron pipe at Chief Kim\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he entered the room and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChairman Song, it has been a while. Ah, I shouldn\u2019t speak while looking like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and placed the skull mask on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have a few things to ask you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKya, aaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The female who was with Song Won-jin screamed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk also hit her with the iron pipe and sat next to Song Won-jin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill you tell me? We are close friends.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took off the mask to reveal the face of Kim Tae-sung, the Bomber.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

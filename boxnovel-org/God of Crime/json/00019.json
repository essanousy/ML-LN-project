As he could see from An Eun-young\u2019s example, there were other skills out there.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That alone meant one thing - that the talents and abilities of individuals were shown in the form of skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If so, it was odd.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Why am I able to use crime skills?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He only had three at the moment, but he would be able to learn more in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was suspicious of his title.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk clicked on the title in the Demon Revealing Mirror, and an explanation came up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[God of Crime]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You can make use of all criminal skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Somehow, it seemed like he could learn and use the skills of other criminals due to his title.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the ability was based on his rating. Currently, Tae-hyuk was a Commoner.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the lowest rating, so there were various of restrictions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk confirmed the new upgrade conditions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Create a blacklist, 1/1]</span></p><br/><p>[Secured the people on the blacklist, 3/20]</p><br/><p>[Make all stats over 50 points.]</p><br/><p>If he cleared all three of these conditions, then he could raise his rating. He would be able to do more once he upgraded to a Noble.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk knew his future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he did nothing and sat idly, then the same reality that he previously experienced would be repeated.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He would be framed again and would go to jail for the second time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His sister Ha-ran and younger brother Tae-min would receive the same tragic ends.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, if he changed the present, then the future would also change.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had caught one of the people on the blacklist, Yoo Cheol-ho, and saved the lives of three people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was clear that this could also be applied to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then first of all, I need to upgrade my personal rating.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, he had only secured three people on the blacklist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, hundreds of people still remained.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Among those on the list were terrorists who killed hundreds of people, as well as the leader of a pseudo-religion cult with thousands of believers.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Confronting them with his current set of skills was impossible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I need the ability to catch people on my blacklist. However, don\u2019t I need to catch people on the blacklist to get an upgrade? It is like employers not hiring inexperienced workers. This is just a painful regression!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to do what he could first.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was still one upgrade condition apart from the blacklist, and that was to raise his stats above a certain threshold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were Tae-hyuk\u2019s current stats.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Stats: Stamina (63), Intelligence (14), Agility (24), Dexterity (31)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His stats were slightly different from when he first received the Spying skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, his stamina had decreased by one, while his agility had gone up by two, and his intelligence by 10.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His rise in intelligence was due to constantly studying with An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By the way, it was strange that his stamina had decreased, while his agility had increased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why had such a thing occurred?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hum hum. I am an energetic high school student. It can\u2019t be helped!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyway, it had been a week since his suspension, and he had already studied and raised his intelligence by 10 points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This increase rate wouldn\u2019t have been possible without An Eun-young\u2019s studying skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he kept doing it at this rate, then he would be able to raise it to 50 points during his suspension period.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTae-hyuk, are you okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young came in holding a bag of ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this moment, Tae-hyuk felt dizzy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Come to think of it, he was currently alone in a room with a girl. </span><span style=\"\">Of course, this wasn\u2019t his purpose, as he was here to study with An Eun-young.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Still, he couldn\u2019t help being nervous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Just how much did you study? You suddenly got a nosebleed.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pulled out the tissue blocking his nose and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, I don\u2019t think I got the nosebleed from that. The meal...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk recalled the dinner that An Eun-young had prepared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Turtle soup, grilled eel, fried pork liver, bokbunja juice.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were energetic and were really good.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Eating such things had caused his blood to overflow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s expression darkened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUm... Do you not like the taste?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That isn\u2019t it. I-It is just a little much.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStamina is important for studying! I made these dishes because they are good for your stamina...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no! It is delicious!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cR-really? I\u2019m glad! How is your stamina? Isn\u2019t it going up?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t seem to have a good effect on his stamina.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t tell the truth to An Eun-young who was smiling so innocently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ice pack was placed on his head to cool down his hot body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young declared with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen, let\u2019s start learning!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young had taken off her uniform and was only wearing a thin dress. Now that the test had ended, her dark circles were almost gone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The hidden innocent and cute appearance of hers was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018H-help me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s private lesson ended at 10 p.m.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk exerted great patience and studied well until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Well, since I am getting help from her studying skill...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His other stats weren\u2019t rising this quickly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Intelligence had increased by 10 and his score on the mock test rose by nearly 20 points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He really might be able to reach the high rankings in the whole school in just a month.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018By the way, I never thought that Park Sung-kwang would actually drop out.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Today was the day that Park Sung-kwang\u2019s disciplinary committee would be held.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Obviously, the result would be similar to Tae-hyuk\u2019s.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Park Sung-kwang hadn\u2019t come to school since a week ago, and today he had suddenly dropped out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well. He did trust in his father too much.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Seong-ho and his secretary, Lee Ki-hwan, were both criminals on the blacklist.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was lucky that he could secure two people at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a bitter taste in his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Ki-hwan was different from other criminals, as he only followed the orders of Park Seong-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the end result was still a crime. In the end, he acted according to his conscience.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Despite the handcuffs, his face looked satisfied, because he no longer needed to get his hands dirty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Originally, it would have taken a few more years for Lee Ki-hwan to do this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His hands would have become even dirtier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was able to finish matters before all of that even happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The series of events started with cheating, and ended with a politician and his secretary being arrested.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had watched the TV as Park Seong-ho and Lee Ki-hwan were handcuffed. He then received\u00a0two affinity points.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He thought back to Yoo Cheol-ho, and recalled the two people killed by Lee Ki-hwan that were saved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Currently I only caught three people? What about the hippo and the clown?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were people on the blacklist that he would meet soon.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t a game, and the criminals didn\u2019t appear in order from weakest to strongest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is a chance I might meet the final boss at the beginning.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There would be no way for him to deal with them with his current abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His head hurt.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he had a colleague who he could share everything with...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Should I tell Kang-suk hyung?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shook his head. Kang-suk had to be the guardian of Ha-ran and Tae-min, so Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t drag them into the middle of an incident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is there anyone on the blacklist that I can cooperate with?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No apparent name came to mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mind was filled with complicated thoughts.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk became lost in his thoughts as he walked the streets at night.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were luxury homes around him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s house was one of them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her father was the director of a general hospital. She was good at studying and lived well.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her face was also cute when it wasn\u2019t covered in dark circles. Another bonus was that she cooked well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don\u2019t know who she will marry, but they must\u2019ve saved a country in their past life.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the end of the street, there was a two-storey house that seemed like it would appear in a drama.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'One day, I will move into a house like that.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A smile formed on Tae-hyuk\u2019s face as he imagined his family living together in a two-storey house with a yard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But then he saw something strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Are they trying to climb over the wall because they lost their house key?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk decided to quietly watch the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a woman who looked suspicious.\u00a0</span>She was wearing leather clothes that clung to her body and had various tools.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was something else that stood out, however.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She couldn\u2019t climb the fence and kept slipping down.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Every time it happened, she would kick the stones on the street.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She seemed strangely familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Uh, isn\u2019t that the person from last time?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young had lost her spirit after being threatened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had seen the woman when he took An Eun-young home, and didn\u2019t think it was a big deal at the time. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he thought about it again, he felt suspicious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t think she would lose her key twice. There seemed to be a different purpose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018... A thief?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why else would she be standing in front of a rich home?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the novice thief turned her head to look for another way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk shook his head</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt like watching a toddler trying to climb a wall so he walked away.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wanted to get far away.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"\">* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was past 10 o\u2019clock at night. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was surprised when he arrived home.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The house was in a mess, as if a thief had gone through it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The closet and drawers were pulled open and all the contents emptied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-min was attending a private cram school and wasn\u2019t back yet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran was sitting on the floor and crying alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tae-hyuk... W-waaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt like meeting the thief on his way home had foreshadowed the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, he had to make sure that Ha-ran wasn\u2019t hurt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNoona. Are you okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"U, eung...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran stammered as she explained the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had went out for a while and came back to this. The house was a mess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed with relief.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The most important thing was that Ha-ran hadn\u2019t been at home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then what did they steal?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s house didn\u2019t have any valuables.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The money they had was used to pay back all the debts. It covered everything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The rest went into the furniture. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of this was due to the bounty received for catching Yoo Cheol-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, there was less profit to be gained compared to the effort to move the furniture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, we still have all the furniture but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of the furniture was still here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Ha-ran pointed to her treasure chest with a trembling hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Surely not my bankbook? Even if they steal it, they won\u2019t be able to withdraw anything.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the voice phishing incident, Tae-hyuk had set a password on his account and all the seals were kept separately.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Three family members were in charge of them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They couldn\u2019t do anything with just one seal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cM-Mother\u2019s keepsake is gone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk trembled as he heard Ha-ran\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the silver Rosario. It wasn\u2019t a cheap item.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was worth approximately 200,000 won?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was an ornament that was difficult to determine the value because it was worn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was the only remaining memento of his parents.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how difficult life was, they couldn\u2019t sell it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But alas, it was now stolen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how much it was worth, it was a precious memory that they couldn\u2019t live without.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk\u2019s hands trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Perhaps the culprit wasn\u2019t listed on his blacklist. However, they had stolen something precious in Tae-hyuk\u2019s family.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He burned with fighting spirit as he thought of the thief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNoona.

Sniffle!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk grabbed some tissues for the crying Ha-ran. Ha-ran sniffled and blew her nose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From what Tae-hyuk remembered, Rosario had been safe for the entirety of those 15 years. However, it was now stolen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cause was Tae-hyuk moving to this house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like a butterfly effect, since a thief wouldn\u2019t bother with a semi-basement rented room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt a heavy sense of responsibility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Changing the present changed the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But it wasn\u2019t always in a good way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.

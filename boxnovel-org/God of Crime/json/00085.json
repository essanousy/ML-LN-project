Won\u2019t that be a transformation rather than a disguise? It would be a big hit like X-ray Vision.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Upgrading his rank gave him the opportunity to strengthen his skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had already started to wonder how his other skills would change.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he had to first investigate the skill he gained this time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFirst of all, I need to find out how long Disguise lasts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the case of Voice Modulation, it was okay to keep his mouth shut if his voice suddenly returned to normal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, that wasn\u2019t the case with his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he made a mistake, then he would be arrested immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk, who had Kim Bum-soo\u2019s face, looked at himself in the mirror and made several facial expressions.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kim Bum-soo was an actor who could change between dozens of expressions freely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke his famous line,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How dare you destroy the 500 year history of the Goryeo Dynasty!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could act out a drama by speaking in a different voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Acting is possible.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He did a few more lines before looking at the time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After 30 minutes, he returned to his original face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is the limit right now? I have to be careful.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed he would have to carry a timer to tell him the time limit for Disguise.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Next, he changed his face to people he met such as Yoo Cheol-ho, Park Sung-kwang, and Choi Sung-yeol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he tried some nice faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I can\u2019t tell Big Mama and Moonlight Flower about this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The proficiency test was sufficient.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had shattered T Medical Center around a week ago.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Obviously, it was one of the business sites managed by the Chinese mafia, \u2018the Triads.\u2019\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Furthermore, he appeared on TV under the name Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The video had spread around various streaming sites and received hundreds of thousands of views.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is highly likely that the Triads is prepared for war.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk lived in prison and was exposed to information that the public didn\u2019t know about.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">One of them was the Mafia War that occurred around two years later.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Triads, who secretly infiltrated Korea, was enjoying enormous profits.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Russian mob and Japanese Yakuza then mobilized their forces to fight them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, the criminals of three countries waged a war in South Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had smashed one of the businesses of the Triad, which could be considered as the starting point of the war.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know what effect it would have, even with Tae-hyuk\u2019s future knowledge.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The so-called butterfly effect, a scientific theory stating that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil might generate a tornado in Texas.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, Tae-hyuk\u2019s actions weren\u2019t at the level of a butterfly flapping its wings, but a devastating tornado.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the result might be even more destructive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Either way, I need to pay close attention to the movements of the Triads.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once all the tests were finished, Tae-hyuk wore his leather jacket and left the house.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First of all, he needed to keep his promise with An Eun-young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho met with a professor of criminology at his alma mater, S University.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The female professor laughed as she looked at her best pupil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I would like to ask you to do the freshmen orientation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">S University would hold an orientation for their freshmen in the middle of February.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The schedule included inviting graduates to give a lecture on their related occupation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The person who would shine this year was Joo Hyun-ho, the genius investigator who solved many cases.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have plenty of time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut aren\u2019t the police in an uproar due to Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the first time I\u2019ve seen such a disruptive criminal. Countless people took off their clothes because of him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then isn\u2019t Investigator Joo Hyun-ho also in danger?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t too bad if I can play and eat at home.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"As expected of a building owner... I suppose I can get you a job as a security guard here if you retire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then do you have a schedule after this?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I am going to visit my school club for the first time in a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The young professor nodded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She wanted to have a meal with her pupil, whom she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time, but Hyun-ho didn\u2019t realize this fact.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He understood the psychology of criminals but had no understanding of women.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If possible, she wanted to teach him for a few more years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then go after having a drink. If you wait then my assistant will bring it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While waiting, Joo Hyun-ho used his smartphone to look up the T Medical Center case.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As for the related terms, more than half of it was about the criminal wearing the opera mask, Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Despite the fact that the article was just published, there were hundreds of comments already.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Amazing.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then they kidnapped orphans and sold their organs?\u3137 \u3137 \u3137</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">It is good that the scum died.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Yes.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Even if they were arrested by the police, they would just be sent home.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I\u2019ve watched Phantom\u2019s video 20 times already.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">By the way, didn\u2019t his voice strangely sound like Kim Bum-soo?</span></i><span style=\"\">\u3147 \u3148? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">In the end, isn\u2019t he just a murderer?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I don\u2019t understand why people are regarding him as a hero.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t kill them himself so how is he a murderer?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Besides, he caught the criminals that the police couldn\u2019t.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Isn\u2019t that great?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The debate about Phantom was constantly ongoing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was such a perfect defeat that he couldn\u2019t even feel resentful.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He conducted an investigation to catch the culprit who decorated a tree with dead bodies. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, what he thought was a bizarre mutilation murder was actually organ trafficking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been able to solve Ryu Myung-hwa\u2019s disappearance, but that was only due to Cho Kang-suk\u2019s senses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Joo Hyun-ho had done nothing in this case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hu... I should return the title of genius investigator\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, the assistant knocked and entered with cups of coffee.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After drinking it, Joo Hyun-ho stood up and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you. Then I will be going now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... Thank you for today, Investigator Joo Hyun-ho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, thank you for agreeing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho decided to take a walk around the campus to sort out his complicated head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An unidentified criminal who suddenly appeared.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Although the media only knew about the trafficking case, he had been active for a while before.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His first appearance was when he caught the Hippo for the police.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was also clear that Phantom was the one who saved Jung Yuri.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho had met with Jung Yuri and asked what happened, but she only replied that she couldn\u2019t remember.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is obviously something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Phantom had bombs containing immense destruction.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a criminal that absolutely had to be arrested, but his whereabouts were unknown.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, it was a situation where only the bottom tier employees suffered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOhh... Damn!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho, whose head was hurting, kicked a stone on the ground.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As he glanced up, he saw a man and woman who seemed to be high school students.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The man was in plain clothes but the woman was wearing a uniform.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Maybe it was a field trip to the university.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tae-hyuk. There is an art exhibition. Robots will also be displayed there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Great.

Yes, let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The male high school student was looking around with a nonchalant expression, but the female high school student couldn\u2019t keep her eyes away from the man\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho laughed at the sight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Why couldn\u2019t the male student notice when it was just so obvious?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, Joo Hyun-ho and the high school students passed by each other.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the girl lost her balance and stumbled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho reflexively reached out and caught her shoulder.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same with the male student.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho and the male student\u2019s hands touched for a brief moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The girl bowed with a sorry expression,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... I\u2019m sorry. I think it was due to a stone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like she wasn\u2019t paying to her feet while looking at the man\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Class President. Are you hurt anywhere?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUhh. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho looked at the male student, who was wearing a leather jacket.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was an appearance that didn\u2019t look neat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that time, the man said something,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou seem to have dropped this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, when did that fall?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think it fell when we bumped into you just now. Then we will be going.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho scratched his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought it had been placed securely in his Burberry coat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It would be bad if I lost this. Thanks for picking it up. Are you touring the campus?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The female student replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I will be attending next year.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is January yet you already passed? Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHehehe...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In fact, I am a graduate of this school.

Did you want to go to the art exhibition? I know the curator there. If you go with me then you'll be able to see a little more. \"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the male student\u2019s eyes flashed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We can see it in detail?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It is impossible to touch but you can look at it directly. Think of it as the price for a police investigator not noticing that his police badge dropped. Ah right. I am Joo Hyun-ho.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAn Eun-young.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am Seo Tae-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three people who met by chance introduced themselves to each other, but their meeting wasn\u2019t a coincidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The young boss of Huaqing, one of the 12 branches of the Triads, listened to the report from his subordinates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then in the end, the whole place didn\u2019t blow up?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, Boss.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the title for the leader of the organization.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe culprit is this bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Li Zheng watched the video of Phantom on his laptop and muttered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had lost a business that earned him billions of dollars every year because of some stupid bastard.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Li Zheng was furious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader of his subordinates asked him,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He killed seven of our people.

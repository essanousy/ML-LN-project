Even highly trained special forces wouldn\u2019t be able to catch him without any casualties.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It might be tough and it probably won\u2019t end simply. Do you remember how he took the money during the Bomber incident? It is like the police are playing on the palm of his hands.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He seems great because you say so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, what will you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What else?

Is everything homemade?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young brightened as he ate her sandwich.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY-Yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah right, please pass this on to Teacher-nim. It is my diagnosis.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk reached in a drawer and pulled out the documents he prepared in advance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, it was an elaborate fake.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t that hard to create.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">After copying the original, he just needed to adjust the ailment and treatment period at the bottom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A technique that could forge a medical certificate or a painting...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t help sighing as he thought about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s eyes narrowed as she received the medical certificate and started to look it over carefully.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eight weeks?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fortunately, it is spring break soon. I think I can get better before school starts again. Then I will be a third year...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, An Eun-young exploded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She grabbed Tae-hyuk\u2019s arm and pulled it towards her chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Tae-hyuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Eh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confused Tae-hyuk couldn\u2019t say anything for a moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The distance between the both of them was close enough for a hug.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He could feel An Eun-young\u2019s breath on him and he couldn\u2019t look straight ahead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This room. It is a one person room. There won\u2019t be anyone who can interfere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-Is that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I actually came here to do this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you mea...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You will be in hospital for a while, so I have to do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a minute, let\u2019s just calm down. I think you are a little too excited right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a long time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young came closer to Tae-hyuk before grabbing the bag that she had thrown on the bed and returning to her original position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I came packed with everything necessary... Don't be too nervous, I have been preparing this every day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ugh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young\u2019s condition was strange.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he discovered something in her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Every day? D-Don't tell me...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. You need to study.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young started pulling out books and printouts from her bag with an excited face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then she grinned as she placed them on the bed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How much are you going to fall behind in class? You have to really work hard to not fall behind so you can go to university. We have to work hard to get you into university.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had promised to go to university together, but it seemed like she had misunderstood it as going to the same university.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, this wasn\u2019t a situation where he could correct it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018D-Don't tell me. Is this withdrawal symptoms?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Eun-young was a model student with the studying skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She studied most of the day.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thanks to her skill, she was very good at teaching others how to study.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, after getting accepted into university, she didn\u2019t need to do as much studying as before.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In addition, Tae-hyuk who she studied with every day was admitted to hospital.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For that reason, she didn\u2019t seem to spend as much time studying as she used to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That rebound had come all at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gulped.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know if the withdrawal symptoms were due to her skill, or simply because of her personality.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only certainty was that he would have to study with her for all of today.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was literally \u2018only\u2019 studying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t help screaming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"S-Save me...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk finished his conversation with Phantom and made a determined expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho, who came along with him as a partner, stood with a serious expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Usually, that seriousness would be gone already but this was an emergency situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Behind Joo Hyun-ho was the special unit waiting for the police superintendent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho muttered in a low voice that could only be heard by Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is an unbelievable great guy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk ignored the strange person in the trench coat and told the police superintendent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSuperintendent-nim. 30 minutes. The meeting is at XX Building. It seems like he has accepted negotiations because there is something he wants from the police.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The police superintendent nodded with a satisfied expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well done. Will he be armed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cProbably. He is very careful and smart. He will run away if there is even the slightest sign of anything happening.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. First of all, I want you to go in and talk to him as much as possible. Meanwhile, the special forces will enter to suppress the opponent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s expression clouded over. Even if he wore a bulletproof vest, the opponent was a terrorist armed with bombs and firearms.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was being used as bait to catch such a person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk couldn\u2019t refuse the unreasonable command.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A police superintendent who was more interested in the achievement than catching criminals. The police commissioner was the same as well.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He felt nauseous but it couldn\u2019t be helped.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was the only one who could act as bait right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk closed his mouth and nodded.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He decided to come back alive no matter what.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">And after this incident, Ha-ran...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then Detective Cho Kang-suk, please head to the scheduled place. The whole crew will be armed and waiting for the signal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The superintendent was entrusted with full authority by the police commissioner.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, his neck was stiff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The superintendent exclaimed in a voice that didn\u2019t seem dignified at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is time to strip off Phantom\u2019s mask!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">XX Building was approximately 20 minutes away by car.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk made his way to the destination in a military van.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The commandos chief in charge of the vehicle smiled and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDetective-nim, don\u2019t worry. Our members were trained to compete with the US counter-terrorism forces.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s mouth twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was going to confront Phantom, who was armed with bombs and guns, alone. If the opponent wanted, then he could put a bullet in Kang-suk\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk muttered sarcastically,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A well trained crew won\u2019t be able to stop a bomb from blowing up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? What did you say just now?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNothing. Oh, that seems to be the building.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a three story building in the middle of the city.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was reported as a factory. The lights were on even at this late hour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did he take any hostages?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk wondered as he headed to XX Building.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The soldiers and police waited in the darkness so that Phantom wouldn\u2019t smell them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once the commandos leader sent a signal, they would pour into the building at lightning fast speed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once Kang-suk\u2019s shadow disappeared into the building, the leader gave an order on the radio.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Enter in five minutes. Prepare your power.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Yes?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then Detective Cho Kang-suk...</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat did you say? I told you to be ready in five minutes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The commandos leader smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Right now, catching Phantom was more important than the life of one detective.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He stared into the darkness with greedy eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk never dreamt that someone he had just been talking to would stab him in the back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once he arrived at the entrance of XX Building, a security guard stopped him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is private property. You can\u2019t go in here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk quietly showed his police badge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is an emergency situation. I received a report that a criminal is hiding here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The security stuttered with panick at Kang-suk\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-That, to come in here, a warrant...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk pulled out the handgun that was hanging from his waist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI said it was an emergency.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A terrorist with bombs and firearms was hiding here.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was one of the few situations where a detective from South Korea could fire his gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"G-Gu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The frightened guard stepped back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk didn\u2019t hesitate to kick the iron door and break the lock before entering.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Phantom is underground.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to hurry as much as possible.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk ran like the wind towards his destination.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">White-faced women screamed with confused faces, but they couldn\u2019t stop Kang-suk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Kang-suk arrived at the door in the basement where Phantom was waiting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, I should make the gun disappear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He put the gun in his pocket and slowly opened the door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He spoke in a quiet voice towards the waiting opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom... As promised, I\u2019ve come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The special troops would arrive here one minute later.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They would pour all their firepower towards Phantom without worrying about Kang-suk\u2019s death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk realized that there was no one in the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was only a small table in the corner.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The phantom mask was placed on top of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he looked around, tremendous shouting could be heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Power entry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dozens of people entered the room with their muzzles facing forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s face distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Weren\u2019t you supposed to come at the signal?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The commandos chief became aware that Kang-suk was alone in the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere is Phantom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk quietly pointed to the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He didn\u2019t come?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Maybe he caught on to the operation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The commandos leader threw his rifle and cursed,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?

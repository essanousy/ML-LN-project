I think that Moonlight Flower is better...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At first, he thought about getting Big Mama to help.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She would perfectly fulfill the role, but Tae-hyuk still couldn\u2019t trust her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She was a woman who could betray him at any time, so he chose Moonlight Flower instead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a little bit of insecurity, but once Tae-hyuk compiled all the information he knew, at least she wouldn\u2019t betray him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The biggest problem was that it was impossible to communicate with people from inside the Death Circus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was for the sake of confidentiality.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If a phone could be used inside, then anyone would ask for help.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to maintain the Death Circus, it was absolutely necessary to stop that from happening.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, a space was built that didn\u2019t even allow radio waves through.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk had the crime skills.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With the Spying skill, he could see the state of an object from a remote place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He used passwords to enable simple communication.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The A8, K9, and T4 panels are broken, meaning that there are two wolves remaining.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk started a simple stretch to relax.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moonlight Flower bought a ticket to the Death Circus through Big Mama.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She appeared as a guest and told Tae-hyuk the entire situation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he had something to say to Moonlight Flower, then he would do a pre-determined action on camera.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of Tae-hyuk\u2019s actions were recorded on camera.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He took advantage of this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was only possible for Tae-hyuk who had the crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Tae-hyuk raised a finger, then Moonlight Flower would tell him the cards of the both of them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be a strange situation if he lost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For this, he invested his remaining affinity points and bought a trait for the Spying skill.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The palm-sized screen that was projected into the air was the new ability of the Spying skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It is easy since I can see the contents without looking at the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unfortunate that he spent all of his 13 points in a day, but the utilization was endless.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Demon Revealing Mirror looked like a strange mirror on the surface.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to use his crime skills, he had to manipulate it directly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was no problem if it was a usual situation, but in a situation where even one small act could arouse suspicion, it served as a big penalty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the match against Kim Shin-hyeong, if he had any doubts about the Demon Revealing Mirror, then </span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wouldn\u2019t have been able to win.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The game that Tae-hyuk was playing now was Bluff Poker.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Placing the mirror on the table was like declaring that he could see the card on his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That\u2019s why he had invested three affinity points into the screen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he concentrated his mind, then he could project a simplified image into the air.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now he didn\u2019t need to look into the mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I won\u2019t be treated as a pervert holding a mirror.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed and started provoking his opponent in Bluff Poker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTae-soo. Do you want to raise your bet even though you are holding a 9? Um. I think my card is a 4. Is that right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His opponent trembled, as Tae-hyuk knew his exact card.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Park Tae-soo clenched his teeth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time that his poker face broke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis bastard...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Without realizing it, Bluff Poker had reached the mid-game.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The card that Tae-hyuk placed on his forehead was exactly a 4.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-soo didn\u2019t know how his could find out his card.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was it because he counted the remaining cards?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That seemed like the most likely option.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, that didn\u2019t explain the consecutive 10s.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">What trick...?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, were his words before just a bluff?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Or did he really have the number 9?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two 10 cards were already gone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Having a 9 meant unconditionally winning, but it would be impossible to turn the situation around if it was a lie.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Tae-soo gave up this game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. Thank you for the 10 million won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-soo wanted to pull away Cheol-su\u2019s laughing expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, this was one of the few places where violence was banned in the Death Circus.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-soo wanted to quickly check his hand for a second.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A 2 or a 3...\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It would be easy for Cheol-su\u2019s 4 to beat it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The opponent was bluffing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He sensed it using his insight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuaaaaak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-soo screamed as he saw the number 9 card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then Tae-hyuk said again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I wasn\u2019t lying earlier. If you feel doubt, then you will self-destruct. Why don\u2019t you believe your opponent for once?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bluff Poker was a game to deceive the opponent.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">With bold bets, they could make the other person die even with a strong hand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t bluff once and still achieved a complete victory over Tae-soo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-soo had accumulated pride in his skills as a card shark over his long life.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Tae-soo completely collapsed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He still had 20 million left, but he gave up the match.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at the older brother, Dae-soo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn cases like this, the older brother normally gets revenge for messing with his younger brother.

This stage is just starting. I would find out what trick you\u2019re using and beat you with my own hands.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, you spoke long words but are you surrendering? I have suffered a lot. Anyway, I am quite busy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk pointed to his badge that had increased to 340 and left the Bluff Poker stadium.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What?

The badges are fitted with microphones. Yes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eun-jeong sighed with regret.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The masked people listening to their conversation through the monitor responded in the same manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk nodded with a thankful face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then now what?

Is Noona late? Are you hungry? I\u2019ll cook you delicious food at once!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran took off her coat and ran to the kitchen, but there was an unexpected scene awaiting her.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Her younger brother was cooking in the kitchen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh? Noona came? It\u2019s cold out, so sit down and rest. You\u2019ve been studying for a long time so I will prepare dinner tonight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An apron-clad Tae-hyuk carried food to the table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At first glance, there were many things that looked delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran looked at Tae-hyuk with an impressed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It will only take another 10 minutes. Before that, warm up your body. There is hot water in the bathroom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes. I came home. My Tae-hyuk is all grown up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo. Ms. Go in and wash your body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran picked clothes from her room and entered the bathroom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The hot water came out, even in the winter.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In their old room in the basement, the boiler would be frozen, if it was only slightly cold outside.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, she had to boil water with a portable burner for her younger brothers and clean with lukewarm water.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She also had a brief shower with freezing cold water.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was cold enough in winter to make her stunned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her eyes turned red as she remembered those times.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A smile came to her face as she bathed in warm water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now, shall I see how good my little brother is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a variety of dishes on the table, such as steak and salad. There were also California rolls that looked appetizing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were all Ha-ran\u2019s favorite foods.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, these things were expensive and not easily eaten.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-Wah. Tae-hyuk prepared all of this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In fact, a friend helped me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Girlfriend?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, we just study together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhum. I see. You should bring some back for them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, An Eun-young had prepared most of these dishes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk only cut the cabbage, roasted the meat in the oven, and placed it in bowls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t know if this will suit Chef Seo Ha-ran, but let\u2019s eat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. But I can\u2019t eat so much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will wrap the leftovers and give it to Tae-min.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tae-min still hasn\u2019t finished?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He won\u2019t be done until 10 p.m.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk and Ha-ran chatted as they started to eat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran sliced the steak and was pleasantly surprised.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The knife smoothly sunk into the meat, as if she was cutting through tofu.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She could feel that the meat was of the finest quality.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The red flesh and white fat layer were in perfect harmony.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The steak looked so delicious that saliva filled her mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran asked gently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This seems very expensive...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t slice the meat. He just tore it with his mouth and spoke while chewing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, the local butcher store was having a sale. It wasn\u2019t that expensive so feel free to eat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was an absolute lie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The identity of the meat was Kobe beef, one of the top three wagyu in Japan.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was also the most expensive Chateau brand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a dish that boasted a price of over 100,000 won per person, even if it was just the cheap lunch menu.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran cut it into small pieces and raised it to her mouth without knowing it was such an expensive meat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW-Wah... So delicious...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rich juices ran down her chin as Ha-ran started to energetically eat the steak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Next, her fork headed towards the salmon salad.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ha-ran was baffled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were unidentified black things sprinkled into the salad.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">When she looked closely, they seemed to be fish eggs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? What type of fish egg is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I got it in a 1+1 sale at the mart. It is delicious when eaten with salmon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t know that the fish eggs were caviar, one of the three great delicacies that caught the taste of gourmets all around the world.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just seven ounces of it were sold for an exorbitant price of over $500.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That precious food was now being eaten with salmon salad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Although it is a little salty... It is unbelievably delicious, and completely changes the flavor of the salmon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran made a sound of admiration with every bite of food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is okay. There is still a lot left so we can eat it with some rice tomorrow morning.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"These ingredients seem expensive...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aish. They are cheap.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran\u2019s eyes narrowed and she sent him a suspicious glance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk just smiled like he didn\u2019t know anything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had been a long time since he last met his sister, so he wanted to give her the best foods.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The two people faced each other and smiled brightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At any rate, Noona can just study hard and not worry about money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That sounds like something I used to say.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran twisted her brother\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk once again swore to himself after seeing his sister smiling so brightly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t make his sister unhappy unlike the previous life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the only favor that Tae-hyuk could do for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah right. Kang-suk hyung says to expect a date. He is preparing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOmo. Kang-suk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure it will be the best date.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ran blinked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t show it on the outside, but it seemed like she was expected a lot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The concept of this date isn\u2019t Beauty and the Beast, but Cinderella...! The problem is whether Kang-suk hyung can do this properly. If it was Beauty and the Beast then he could do well as the beast.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The actors were ready, but he was worried about how well Cho Kang-suk could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the base of the Nuclear Bomb, the second ranked Kang Han-seong stared at his juniors with cold eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung-nim helped you... It wasn\u2019t for you to look like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His position in the circle wasn\u2019t low.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Rather, his charisma and strong power made him one of the high ranking members.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only thing he was lacking in was his amount of contacts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Therefore, Kang Han-seong desperately tried to increase the number of his followers.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he added just five more people, then he could become a captain of Nuclear Bomb.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had no intention of being underneath someone in a gang.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He planned to grow it as much as possible and turn it into an organization.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he would do his job, but once he was recognized, he would be able to relax from a high position.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The juniors he gathered were his footholds to success.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">But what were these pathetic brats?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In order to join the group, they had to be able to take money and then hand the money over.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They roamed around this area for that reason.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo... You were beaten up by one person?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong caught the eye of a nearby junior, who had one arm in a cast.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t go to the toilet alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sight was enough to make Kang Han-seong sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His juniors bowed their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I\u2019m really sorry. I-If that bastard didn\u2019t have the iron pipe then... He is a cowardly bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong struck the cheek of his pathetic junior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, you jerk. Is that something to be proud of? Aigoo. I can\u2019t believe I invested in scum like this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-Hyung-nim!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The juniors clung to Kang Han-seong and bowed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how pathetic, they were still people who followed him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Kang Han-seong\u2019s heart weakened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I understand, you brats. This strong Kang Han-seong will solve it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T-Thank you. I swear allegiance to Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m getting goosebumps. Stop before you make me sick. Yes, he was wearing the uniform of A High School?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, that\u2019s right. It is a school in the area. I am sure he goes to that school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A High School was a famous school nearby, not necessarily as a prestigious school, but for the second generation of good families attending it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Therefore, it had an ambiguous position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, their money entered the wallets of this gang.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, if the school had a good fighter, then he should check it out.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once they met, Kang Han-seong would see about bringing him into Nuclear Bomb.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if he did have an iron pipe, he had fought four people alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He might not be a good guy. So let\u2019s act in moderation and go to A High School.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-Hyung-nim, then we...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. I\u2019m not your mother. Handle this yourself. Wipe your feet and go home and sleep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I understand. Thank you, Hyung-nim.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong sighed and started to investigate A High School.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Oh, it must be Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">But he isn\u2019t 1st in the school.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">He did a test a while ago and was ranked 2nd.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Ah, is that so?</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Then who is 1st?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">That...</span></i><i><span style=\"\">An Eun-young.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">She is completely crazy (about studying).</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Hah.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">That female is good (at fighting)? </span></i><span style=\"\">[TL: the words in brackets are implied but aren\u2019t actually said.]</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-Completely brilliant.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk is her apprentice.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">He can\u2019t even compete with An Eun-young.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...H-Hyung-nim! I-I\u2019m really sorry. It really was like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong glared at his henchmen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is someone bigger than him? In addition, a woman?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhu, I see. I guess I have to believe what you are saying. What type of person is she?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-I don\u2019t know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong imagined Arnold Schwarzenegger with long hair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that moment, his palms became damp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I guess I should take a look for myself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed like it would become a mess if he left the job to his henchmen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, Kang Han-seong decided to go himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So, where is that person called Tae-hyuk now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-That...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A henchman stuttered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was hesitant about something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong muttered with annoyance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I told you to know for sure!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no. I know.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Where?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard he is at a restaurant cafe in the suburbs right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a restaurant popular with couples.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong was currently sitting in a factory where the heat wasn\u2019t working properly and he was surrounded with the smell of stinky men.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What, a date?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong\u2019s lips twitched.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The suburbs were usually deserted, and thus, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if he wanted to beat someone up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is playing very wildly on Christmas Eve. Are 10 people available right now? We have to take care of that bastard, even if we get in trouble.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong chuckled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were still minors, so they wouldn\u2019t be punished properly, even if they damaged the restaurant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The laws protected them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he would punish that bastard who ridiculed four of his men.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is me. Gather immediately. From now on, we will start a war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang Han-seong mobilized all the strong people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-How is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk asked nervously as he gazed at the suit that was tailored to his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk raised a thumb.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah...

Rather, I should be the one asking for permission.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. Everyone who comes here is the owner. Hello, I am Viviana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sister Viviana, I am Seo Tae-hyuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t seem to be a foreigner, so it seemed like Viviana was a baptismal name.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Viviana sat down next to Tae-hyuk and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPraise Jesus. Thank you very much for coming today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I just came to play with those two people. Kang-suk hyung said that he has already been sponsoring him for many years.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Viviana laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a modest face without any makeup, but he felt strangely calm when she talked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I managed to operate this orphanage with the help of many people, and Cho Kang-suk is one of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the first time that he had a conversation with a woman of this style.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk, who became uneasy, spoke gruffly,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t think you came here just to chat. What can I do for you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, in fact, I wanted to ask you something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, if I can answer it then I will.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Viviana\u2019s face came close to him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An oddly sweet fragrance was evident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHum hum. I think your face is too close.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. The other children shouldn\u2019t hear this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Viviana spoke in a low voice as if it was a forbidden story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you perhaps know a girl called Kim Soo-bin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you asking me that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, there isn\u2019t any strange meaning. I just asked because you seem to be a similar age.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I guess Soo-bin is a high school student.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. A freshman. Ah, could you please wait a moment? A picture...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Viviana rummaged through her pockets and found a piece of paper.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk coughed as he received the photo and opened it.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A girl with a cheerful atmosphere was seen with Viviana.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They looked like sisters, and were holding the V sign towards the camera.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At first glance, Kim Soo-bin was a girl with a short haircut like a man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you know? Soo-bin is very pretty. If you see her then you would definitely remember.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Viviana seemed to really care about the children here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen her. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not helpful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Viviana\u2019s eyes widened and she waved her hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, no. I\u2019m sorry. You must been confused since I asked such a sudden thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wanted to know why she was asking such a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was an orphanage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">No matter how well the nuns took care of the children, they couldn\u2019t feel parental love and a sense of belonging.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were those who wanted to leave here as quickly as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In particular, the age of a high school student was the limit of staying in an orphanage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">So Soo-bin must have left here earlier than planned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"She must have run away from home.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A shadow crossed Vivian\u2019s face,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes... Without saying a word to me...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, Viviana grabbed Tae-hyuk\u2019s hand and spoke what was in her heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you see Soo-bin, then can your tell her that Sister Mom is waiting for her?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She looked a little young to be called Mom, but he understood what she meant.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Viviana thought of the children here as her children.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sister Viviana. You don\u2019t have to ask it from someone like that. Soo-bin unni graduated from here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Viviana was filled with embarrassment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H-Hye-mi!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hye-mi was a girl who seemed to be a middle school student.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She stared at Tae-hyuk like she wanted to eat him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t like him. Are we beggars? Should I say thank you for buying chicken?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She shook her head as if it was unacceptable.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Viviana stopped Hye-mi and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI-I\u2019m really sorry. This child is called Song Hye-mi. She was close to Soo-bin so her nerves are sharp from Soo-bin\u2019s disappearance. At any rate, I am very thankful for today. If you see Soobin then please tell her that Mother is waiting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk scratched the back of his head.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It seemed that the orphanage had complicated circumstances.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can I hear more about this story?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A hard-faced Santa Kang-suk was standing there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After leaving Ha-ran in charge of the children, Viviana, Tae-hyuk, Cho Kang-suk and Hye-mi gathered in the reception room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Before starting the story, Viviana spoke firmly with Hye-mi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hye-mi. You should just listen. Don\u2019t say anything to the detective. Do you understand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bah. Sister Mom doesn\u2019t have to worry. Am I a child?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk removed the beard on his chin and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sister Viviana. Soo-bin is gone, what happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Viviana\u2019s voice trembled as she spoke.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Because she was so desperate, she told the story to Detective Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It has been around a month since the day that Soo-bin went to school and didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk had already been doing volunteer work here for a few years and he knew most of the children.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had known Soo-bin since she was a child,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why didn\u2019t you tell me this sooner?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk asked angrily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-That... I contacted Gangdong Police Station but you weren\u2019t there, so she was reported as missing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... It was around that time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk sighed and leaned back in the chair.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A month ago, he had been unbelievably busy due to the Hippo case.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no way to get in contact with Kang-suk when the police station was called.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He gave his phone number exactly for situations like this.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Were they sorry about contacting a busy person?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The next time this sort of thing happens, please contact me straight away. It is absolutely no trouble. Hah... I heard that there were a lot of disappearances happening these days, but I didn't know it would happen around me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk, who was listening to the side, interrupted the two people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If it was last month, was it after Actress Ryu Myung-hwa disappeared?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk looked at Tae-hyuk with an expression of great interest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow do you know so well? That's right. Since then, the number of missing people have increased.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never dreamed that he would be involved in this incident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ryu Myung-hwa was one of the top three actresses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">She disappeared in the wake of a private video leaking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was speculation that she was staying quiet until the case was settled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, her agency then reported her missing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From then on, the frequency of missing girls increased dramatically.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the Werther Effect, so to speak.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was similar to the phenomenon where a spike in suicides occurred after a celebrity committed suicide.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a word derived from the sorrowful protagonist of Goethe\u2019s novel, </span><i><span style=\"\">The Sorrows of Young Werther,</span></i><span style=\"\"> that was published in 1744.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He committed suicide after a tragic love.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was so popular that Napoleon also carried the book with him.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All over Europe, suicides started to spread as they imitated Werther.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The total number of deaths was over 2,000 people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At present, the development in the media meant that it wasn\u2019t hard to find the Werther effect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I remember correctly, this isn\u2019t just a simple missing persons case. Maybe...'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a bad feeling.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">For the first time, Tae-hyuk hoped that his thoughts were wrong.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Ddrrrung!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone\u2019s phone ringing interrupted Tae-hyuk\u2019s thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I\u2019m sorry. It is my phone. At such a late time...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk pulled out his phone and confirmed who it was from.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He picked up the call and walked to a corner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, this is Cho Kang-suk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- ......</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"M-Mutilation... What is this...?!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">- ......</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t be sure of the conversation due to the distance.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t miss the words spoken by Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mutilation murder.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Damn... It actually is that case.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His bad feelings were always right.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk approached them and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry but it seems like I have to go to work. I'm sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, it's nothing.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I will come back tomorrow for more details. Tae-hyuk, Sister-nim, and Hye-min, I will be going now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk spoke to the leaving Kang-suk in a quiet voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung. Have you discovered a clue regarding the missing people?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Ah. I\u2019ll tell you if there are more details.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t miss Kang-suk\u2019s shaking.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The phone call was clear: A mutilated murder victim was found.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was no harm in checking the identity against the missing people files at the police station.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, the probability that the body was Soo-bin wasn\u2019t high.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it wasn\u2019t necessary to talk about the mutilation murder and make people uneasy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Kang-suk went to check without saying anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk was immersed in his thoughts as Kang-suk left.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was a prelude to the brutal killings of a madman called Doll Play, but that was the extent of Tae-hyuk\u2019s knowledge on the matter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seo Tae-hyuk had memories of the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Until now, it had been easy to catch criminals using those memories.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, this mutilation murder case was different.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'In the end, the killer of this case wasn\u2019t caught.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It ended with many victims.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk only knew a rough outline of what was reported in the news.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The victims were only remembered with the initials A, B, and so on as they appeared in the news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There was an orphan among the identified victims...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk felt like puking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The events so far had been easily solved using his memories of the future.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, this time was different. \u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He knew nothing, and he couldn't do anything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A sense of hopelessness filled Tae-hyuk\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then an amazing thing happened.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk gazed at what was written on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[New mission: Find Doll Play.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The following rewards can be obtained by clearing the mission.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-10 blacklist points</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-20 stat points</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait.

Ack what is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Prisoners are bombers? What is happening on Prison Island?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The article was half speculative and didn\u2019t talk about the incident occurring.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Kang-suk sensed that something was happening just from that sentence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What the hell are you doingggg!

The inmates have made a bomb... it isn\u2019t a toy. It has enough power to blow away at least one floor of the building. The damage to the guards isn\u2019t great yet, but just in case...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk made it seem like an atomic bomb had been made of crude materials obtained in the prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">U-Understood.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">I\u2019ll make sure someone gets out to you as quickly as possible.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could tell that the voice of the other person on the phone was shaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bait was eaten!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After sending the request for support, Tae-hyuk leaked information to several news organizations about the incident.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho would do a good job, but Phantom couldn\u2019t appear in this case.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This had to be an incident occurring due to Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After all the calls were finished, Tae-hyuk quietly put down the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll of the actors are now gathered. Brown Bear should launch the fireworks for the new audience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Shin Chang-ho was setting up the bomb in a passage that led outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn. This is a real bomb so I\u2019m pretty nervous...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would buy time to slow down the enemy\u2019s entry.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There was just one bomb but the opponents didn\u2019t know that.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once they saw the havoc of one bomb, who could easily enter?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were Chinese inmates who were ordered to fight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once they realized that their lives were in danger, they wouldn\u2019t move as the warden commanded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe road to victory has finally opened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho laid the bomb on the flat ground with trembling hands and took out two bags, making sure to mix the contents well.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A stain spread like a green liquid was sprinkled inside and it quickly turned purple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...It is complete. Now the wristwatch that will act as the primer...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He turned a knob twice and the stopped clock needle starting moving again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe next 30 seconds!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho bolted back to the command room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His head had turned white and he couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a dangerous job with the risk of serious injuries if something went wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First, he had to know when exactly the bomb was going to explode.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho slowly counted in his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One, two...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...29... 30...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho fell to the ground while running.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was a bit hasty.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It took a few more seconds to reach 30 and then the bomb went off.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Kukukukung!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though he had ran to almost the end of the corridor, he could \u00a0still feel the vibration of the explosion in the air.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho spat out the dust that filled his mouth and muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a weak bomb? Just a bit more and the whole prison would be gone!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a bright smile on his face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The image of his little sister, Shin Seo-yeon appeared in his mind.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Despite not seeing her for several years, he was able to vividly recall her features.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...Yes. I did everything that Cigarette Seller asked, and now I can hear where Seo-yeon is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was clearly the terms of the agreement.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Of course, he didn\u2019t believe everything that Cigarette Seller said. But he showed an unbelievable ability.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">So he really might know where Seo-yeon was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Once I find out, will I be able to call her after a long time? Then I will apologize for living as a fool. Will Seo-yeon laugh and forgive me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he would once again ask her to wait.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho laughed as he thought of his sister.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was the man called Brown Bear and an object of terror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, he was only a cute baby bear in front of the girl he liked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I have to return to the command room first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He got up and brushed off the dust on his body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He erased the appearance of Shin Seo-yeon in his head and returned to his usual appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once he returned, his men greeted him with excited faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim! Brown Bear did great!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is this really Hyung-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBoss! We will take care of those bastards!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho asked his excited subordinates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happened to the enemies?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They were going to enter but fled once the bomb exploded.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see. I wonder what the warden looks like now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho sighed with relief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The operation was a success.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The enemies were less likely to enter due to potential bombs being installed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If so, they just needed to wait here for the rest of the time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Chang-ho turned and looked for the Cigarette Seller.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was sitting in a chair and looking at the prisoners with cold eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCigarette Seller.

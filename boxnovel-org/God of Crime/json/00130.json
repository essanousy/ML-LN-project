What will we do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t worried about Song Chi-hyun\u2019s safety.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were just colleagues, so it was none of their business if he was caught.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They would easily betray each other in order to live.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This was an appropriate relationship for partners in crime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cForget about that magician. Anyways, it is enough if we just show a few tricks once in awhile. Plus, we have Phantom\u2019s skills. Try to imagine it. Phantom appearing before the public.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoa! There will obviously be a tremendous response.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It will be the greatest hit ever, beyond a jackpot. Ohuhu... This time we won\u2019t receive Oyabun\u2019s help, so let\u2019s try hard from the beginning.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yep.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk recalled Phantom\u2019s absurd abilities.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His know-how and Park Bum-ho\u2019s story. What if it was accompanied by Kim Jin-woo\u2019s production?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was obvious that the public would go crazy.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just imagining it caused a smile to appear on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Once that happens, thousands of people won\u2019t be a problem. Perhaps tens... No, it will be hundreds of thousands of people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk felt a twitch in his chest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He felt tremendous expectations towards the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Bum-ho looked closely at the escape route on the map and said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We just need to turn right there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they crossed the wall in front of them, then a car would be waiting on the other side.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once they rode it, they could get out of this place.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Their short escape was reaching the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk looked at the home of \u2018Sun\u2019, where he had stayed for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo... I didn\u2019t know it would end up this way. Anyway, right now I am running away. Just wait. Within a year, I will create a group large enough to swallow Sun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim Jin-woo listened to his words and agreed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I hope so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are going to be legends. Hahaha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stepped on the Park Bum-ho\u2019s hand and climbed the wall first.\u00a0Next,</span><span style=\"\">\u00a0it was Kim Jin-woo\u2019s turn.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the two people pulled Park Bum-ho up on the wall.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In a flash, the three people had crossed the wall.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a proficient move that thieves were capable of.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think that is the car that Phantom mentioned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Bum-ho pointed to a medium sized sedan that was parked.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was so waxed that the car could be used as a mirror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A big man in a black suit opened the door of the car.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had short cropped hair and black sunglasses.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Anyone looking at him would think he was a gangster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you sure he is the driver?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they approached, the driver asked,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you Cho Min-hyuk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But I heard there would be three people with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk shook his head and explained,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"One person unfortunately...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, three is good enough. Then get in the car.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They quietly nodded and boarded the car.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The driver climbed into his seat and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can you please put on your seat belts?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, um. Right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After confirming that their seat belts were on, the driver added,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoops, I forgot the most important thing. Would you like to have this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He pulled out something shiny and threw it into the backseat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? What...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aaaaack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH-Handcuffs!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Kang-suk, who had been treated as a gangster, turned back to them and declared,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am arresting you for murder, imprisonment, assault and drug trafficking! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. \u00a0You have the right to an attorney and to have the attorney speak for you when asked a question. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you don\u2019t put it on then I will help you directly. What do you want to do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W-We are innocent...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHah, I really got lucky. The prosecutor\u2019s office was paying attention to the movements of the Sun group. Then evidence was found. Sun\u2019s code of conduct doesn\u2019t allow for deserters does it? If someone tries to desert, then aren\u2019t they killed? Ah, don\u2019t worry. I have the evidence right here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, the person who gave it to me asked me to tell you this. Make sure to put you in a religion free prison. I did as he asked, so the place where you will be staying is decided. Do you know the Black Tortoise Prison? You can work hard at your religious activities there. Then who knows? Maybe you can go to heaven.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKwaaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk struggled to get out of the car.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the seat belts couldn\u2019t be removed no matter what they did.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I placed glue on the joints so it can\u2019t be taken off unless a special solvent is used. Then I will drive you to your destination comfortably.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP-Phantom... That bastard tricked me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk cursed his unseen opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Phantom hadn\u2019t spoken any lies.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Being locked up in prison was the easier way to escape from the Yakuza\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cho Min-hyuk and his bishops were arrested by Cho Kang-suk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He made his way down the road like it was an eight lane highway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the remaining people were a problem.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They found out about the leader\u2019s deceit and discovered that Sun was a cult.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Still, the atmosphere didn\u2019t quite dissolve.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A person who was exceptionally faithful and who was the representative of the believers climbed on stage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He grabbed the microphone and told the believers,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll of you are free to return home. But although the leaders were fake, I believe that the teachings of Hwanin are real. Hwanin is an existence that clearly exists. He might\u2019ve been used as part as a scam, but once he knows that we are waiting, I believe that Hwanin will come down from the sky to save us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aye! I'll wait!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Me too! I was born again because of Hwanin! Even though the impostor blurred his name, Hwanin really exists in the world!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">More than half the believers responded to the representative\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it wasn\u2019t everyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChe! Another one... What Hwanin...? I\u2019m going home. Jang-ssi as well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You can go home but I will stay here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The representative holding the microphone raised his voice,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All those who want to leave are welcome to. We won\u2019t oppress any deserters. Just remember Hwanin\u2019s teachings. Wait for him as well. It is free to enter and leave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thus, the believers divided into two groups.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk licked his lips at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why I only got 300 affinity points. In the end, I can\u2019t save the people who have already fallen into the mud.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only 30% returned to their homes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The remaining members renamed themselves \u2018Dawn\u2019.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">A new cult was born.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk sighed and mixed among the people who were leaving.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a familiar face was seen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Once Tae-hyuk approached, Lee Gun-woo clearly knew him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, this cool face... P-Phan...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk raised a finger to his lips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then Lee Gun-woo nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT-Thank you for saving me! Greet him as well. This is...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Min-young was pulled over by Lee Gun-woo and reluctantly bowed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you for helping me regain my mind. I really appreciate it, Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was decided that they would leave Dawn and return home.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk touched the Phantom mask hidden on his body and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I was able to fool them thanks to you. So how long do you have left? I hope you finish your remaining military life well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Gun-woo\u2019s eyes widened at Phantom\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had harsh memories of the military.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he wasn\u2019t like Lee Gun-woo, whose life was twisted due to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wait. Won\u2019t I get a draft notice next year? I have to experience the army twice... Ah...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Tae-hyuk was thinking about the unpleasant memories, Lee Min-young said to him,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This isn\u2019t the best place, but can I please get your signature?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. It isn\u2019t that hard. Do you have a paper or pen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oppa, do you have a pen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh... The rare opportunity to get the Phantom\u2019s autograph...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee Min-young shook her head with a grim expression.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk said with a smile,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBy the way, do you want to see a magic trick?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next evening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had set up a trap to catch Mister Park and wanted to make sure that all of the preparations were correct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm, the cameras and mikes are perfect. The boss is resting well in the warehouse... Now Mister Park just needs to come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was disguised as Cho Min-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk contacted him urgently stating there was a problem.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">All the goods and personnel needed to operate Sun were supplied by Cho Min-hyuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t strange to meet this way.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">First of all, he needed to find out Mister Park\u2019s identity.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he would take measures against the Yakuza.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The appointment time was 6 o\u2019clock.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Exactly one minute remained.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk finally looked at his face in the Demon Revealing Mirror.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same face as Cho Min-hyuk, so even his biological parents wouldn\u2019t recognize him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, I\u2019m strangely tense...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At best, he was just meeting with one of the Yakuza\u2019s subordinates.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But he felt something strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the same as what I felt when I found Yoo Cheol-ho and realized that my memories of the future were real.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was obvious that Mister Park would have a bigger influence on him than Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Ching.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door opened and a man in his 40s entered the cafe.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The cafe had a CLOSED sign so it obviously wasn\u2019t a passing customer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This meant...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Exactly 6 o\u2019clock. I\u2019m not late. You wanted to meet me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk looked at him blankly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the first time he was so surprised since gaining the future memories.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">An unexpected person was standing in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Zombie? No, ghost?

Drink, drink! I will pay for it today!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can Sunbae really do it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">ABS Station\u2019s AD, Kwon Joon-hyuk, pulled the girl sitting next to him closer to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aish, what is Oppa doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShin Se-ho PD... No, this news department head will treat you! Let\u2019s drink!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alcohol was consumed and the girl\u2019s breaths smelled of alcohol.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The waiter came over with bottles of alcohol and fruit snacks. T</span><span style=\"\">here was already beer on the table.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the appetizing snacks were placed down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBeer service!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A female extended some bomb shots to Shin Se-ho and Kwon Joon-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho gulped it down with a red face and a breath that was stinking of alcohol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kwon Joon-hyuk! What did I say? Didn\u2019t I say to trust in and follow Hyung?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho had been on the rise after revealing the secret hobbies of domestic conglomerates.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Soon after, he revealed the truth about the hippo case that the police had been trying to conceal.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">That alone was tremendous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually, PDs only reported exclusive scoops once or twice a year.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, Shin Se-ho had several jackpots successively.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There was an exclusive interview with Phantom. How did you get that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll just say it here. I\u2019m close to Phantom., so if I call him, then he will come running right away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWah...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho worked as a PD at ABS Station.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">As a PD, he had to follow most general events.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It had been two years since he started stalking detectives in order to get a scoop.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He finally got recognized due to meeting Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I was originally going to try other stations, but the chief held my leg and asked for me to remain at ABS Station.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kya! As expected from Shin Se-ho hyung-nim! Now the world recognizes Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho laughed at the compliments and ate the fruit snacks.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">His title at the station was PD, but now he was promoted up two levels.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Starting today, he was a Chief Producer, a CP, not a PD.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The CP managed the PDs, and was in charge of the total production of the broadcasts.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It could be said that his position would be equivalent to a general executive at other companies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I can also use the corporate card that wasn\u2019t available in my PD days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho waved a luxurious gold-plated credit card that was held between his fingers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwon Joon-hyuk hadn\u2019t heard the contents of the deal between Shin Se-ho and Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Why had Phantom given Shin Se-ho the right to interview him?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He asked Shin Se-ho, who replied,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you crazy? Do you think I will cut the belly of the duck laying the golden eggs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I-Is that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a female grabbed Shin Se-ho\u2019s arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa. Let\u2019s sing. I want to hear 18 Times.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two people went on stage and started singing a slow blues song.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwon Joon-hyuk licked his lips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Such a person was now the chief producer.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He started to worry about the future of ABS Station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I don't know. Today is a day to play! Now, let\u2019s go and sing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwon Joon-hyuk put an arm around a woman\u2019s shoulders and walked towards the stage.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then the door opened and a man in a sharp suit entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had such a strong physique that he could be in an action movie right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho, who was playing with the female, turned and looked at the man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t call for the waiter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man, who was mistaken as a waiter, looked around the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you Shin Se-ho?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unpleasant pronunciation showed that he wasn\u2019t familiar with Korean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh, that is me. Did rumors about me already circulate? I am a bit famous. Huhu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho felt proud and took out a 50,000 won bill from his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can you buy me a pack of cigarettes? Marlboro red. You can keep the remaining change as a tip.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man... no, Big Brother laughed.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He pulled out the Tokarev TT-33 and aimed it at Shin Se-ho\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems like I\u2019ve come to the right place. The tip is for your life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother quietly closed the door and entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The people inside screamed until their throats were sore.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it was a place with good soundproofing so the screams didn\u2019t escape outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a few reasons why Big Brother chose the karaoke bar as the place to keep the hostages. (In Korea: a karaoke bar has girls working working there, sort of like an escort bar)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It sold alcohol, snacks and other illegal things.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, CCTV were installed everywhere to avoid a police crackdown.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">There were devices installed inside the room and the structure outside was unknown.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Instead was like a maze with multiple random passages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a fortress that didn\u2019t allow enemy penetration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 30 hostages in the room, including Shin Se-ho and Kwon Joon-hyuk.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Most of them were employees and girls working at the karaoke bar.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, some students who used the convenience store on the first floor were also trembling among the adults.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One young man whispered to another.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you hear? If Phantom doesn\u2019t show up, then he will kill the hostages one by one... Before that, we have to neutralize him somehow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even if he has guns, aren\u2019t we more numerous? I think we can neutralize him if we strike at the same time but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think there will be good enough odds if 10 people join together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I agree.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Me too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother hadn\u2019t tied up the hostages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He was just blocking the entrance so that no one could leave the room.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The hostages were talking so low that Big Brother couldn\u2019t hear them.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They would jump from four directions at the same time, suppressing the opponent and taking his guns.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was better to risk one\u2019s life fighting than to die one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the right, the man who decided to strike Big Brother was anxious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Among the hostages here, there were many men working as waiters, their numbers reaching more than 10 people.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">How confident was that person in his ability that he didn\u2019t even tie them up?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, they would just die at Big Brother\u2019s hand if time kept passing.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If so, he would rather risk his life to fight.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The determined man bit his lip.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He nodded towards the other hostages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone counted down in a low voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c3... 2... 1... Pounce!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A dozen people instantly jumped towards Big Brother.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They lowered their bodies as much as possible and focused on making it difficult for the opponent to hit them with his gun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother held the gun in one hand and slowly opened his eyes.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t seem confused at all by the hostages\u2019 actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are a lot of people so killing a few hostages should be okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother rotated his body and kicked one of the hostages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He then turned and pulled the trigger at the men who were trying to do a back tackle.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">Tang!</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Tatang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKuheok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A man was shot in the leg and rolled across the floor.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">On his right, the man who tried to jump Big Brother was shot in the head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother laughed,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you wonder why I didn\u2019t tie you up? The reason is simple. Even 100 of you lowlives wouldn\u2019t be able to beat me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAaaaack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One waiter took a knife and attacked Big Brother from a blind spot.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The knife struck Big Brother\u2019s chest and the waiter shouted loudly,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hahaha! I did it. My attack...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother casually looked back and fired his gun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It pierced the waiter\u2019s waist precisely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hostages started to feel despair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry but your attacks won\u2019t work on me while I\u2019m wearing this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Big Brother took off his suit and showed the trembling hostages.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a reinforced suit.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was like he was wearing black armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"B-Body armour...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wore a reinforced suit made of Kevlar.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Special products made of those fibers were used in various bulletproof shirts.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wore it around his whole body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if it was hard to move, the ability to protect the body was enormous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Furthermore, the rubbery black fibres on the outside were Nomex.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a special fiber used for firefighting clothing, as it had great heat resistance and electrical insulation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the end, he couldn\u2019t be hurt, even if he was attacked with a stun gun.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The only downside was that it felt like an extra 20kg of weight was on the body.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was the same as wearing huge sandbags on the body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Being able to move like that while wearing this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had handled 10 hostages in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhh... Ahhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The remaining people could only scream.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother knocked on his suit and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you want to knock me down while wearing this, you should bring an anti-tank rocket.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwon Joon-hyuk, who was hiding among the hostages, groaned.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he spoke to the injured Shin Se-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho had several bullets in his shoulders and thighs.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Despite that, he didn\u2019t give Phantom\u2019s contact details.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Therefore, Big Brother took hostages and made an announcement to the police.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">If Phantom doesn\u2019t come here within 30 minutes then I will kill the hostages one by one.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the condition that Big Brother gave to the police.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD-Department Head... Do you really not know Phantom\u2019s contact details?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEu.... euhhh.... I said I don\u2019t know...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You said you were friends!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho had no words to say and could only bite his lips.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Big Brother didn\u2019t seem to believe him but what he said was real.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The relationship with Phantom was only one way.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho couldn\u2019t do anything unless he was contacted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shin Se-ho called out Phantom\u2019s name in his pain-filled state.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Would Phantom come here to save him and the hostages?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he did, Phantom wasn\u2019t just a criminal...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk arrived at the scene to find the neighborhood completely sealed off by police and soldiers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo... I told him to release the hostages. Block it off completely to stop anyone from entering.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldiers were the 35th Battalion of the Capital Defense Command.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had encountered them during the Bomber case.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were a special unit specialization in street warfare and counterterrorism, but now they were just blocking off the road.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First of all, I have to somehow enter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could go up to the police.</span></p><br/><p><i><span style=\"\">-I am Phantom.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">From now on, I will plunge into enemy territory!</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That wouldn\u2019t happen.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was impossible for an average person to get past that surveillance and enter, but it was possible for Tae-hyuk who had the crime skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Then let\u2019s use my newly acquired skill.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, he used Counterfeit to change his leather jacket into a soldier uniform.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then he use Disguise to get the face of Sergeant Kim Ha-sae who he met several times.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The Demon Revealing Mirror showed that he had become a completely different person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is a bit of height difference. Was he originally taller due to his combat boots?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk approached a soldier who formed part of the blockade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The road is fully sealed off, and not even a single ant will be able to enter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Jong-sa, who was maintaining the barrier, looked at Tae-hyuk and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sergeant Kim. Didn\u2019t I tell you to make a barrier on the roof? Why did you come down here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk didn\u2019t panic and said,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The captain asked me to check the blockade.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this situation, it was good to borrow the name of the boss.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was even better if they were a very high ranking person that couldn\u2019t be questioned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sergeant Park pointed inside with his thumb.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was a quick signal telling him to go inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen keep up the good work. Charge!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park Jong-sa clicked his tongue as he saw Tae-hyuk saluting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo, look at that salute. This is a real situation. He should go back to basic training.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk had a moment of silence for Kim Ha-sae before moving to the back of the karaoke bar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The killer is sent by the Triads.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was obviously that the opponent would possess a great deal of firepower that he couldn\u2019t deal with.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk wouldn\u2019t be able to fight him with the Violence skill and iron pipe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'But for weak people, there is a weak way of fighting.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Five minutes later, Counterfeit was released and his leather jacket was restored.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Tae-hyuk took the phantom mask from his pocket and placed it on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom and Big Brother.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two criminals\u2019 fight was about to start.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

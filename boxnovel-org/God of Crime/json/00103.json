Are you comfortable now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t like his face but this is better. By the way, what do you originally look like?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry, but I sometimes have to hide my identity to infiltrate the enemy. I can\u2019t show you my face without a disguise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t simply the face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Everything, from the tone of his voice, to his speaking method seemed to be Shin Se-ho.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk wondered about the body, but Phantom was wearing a thick trench coat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHrmm. Is that special makeup?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019ll just say that it is something similar. By the way, you sound gentler. Didn\u2019t you sound angry whenever I called you on the phone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think you are very selfish.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A variety of expressions crossed Kang-suk\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The person in front of him was a dangerous criminal that couldn\u2019t be compared to a neighbourhood gang.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even if cooperation was necessary for the investigation, that fact remained unchanged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are so dynamic that I want to tease you all day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop the nonsense and get to the main point.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. Now we will talk about the case that is giving Detective-nim a headache.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think I can help you. How about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk stared at Phantom silently.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He wondered how much Phantom knew about Park Sung-yul, so he decided to try it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you helping me with?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom\u2019s eyes went gentle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The answer that he received was far beyond Kang-suk\u2019s expectations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You want someone to sneak into Blue Dragon Prison and look for information on Park Sung-yul. If some of the conditions are met then I can help you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c...You know a lot. How can you give a clear answer when I haven\u2019t even asked the question yet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe somebody gave me information.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"An informant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was a lie.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Phantom completely hid the fact that he wire-tapped Kang-suk by creating a fictional person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad deal for the police. Of course, after everything is done, I must be able to leave properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom laughed,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, if I was kept in there then I might lead some of the other prisoners on a jailbreak. Let's see. If I team up with the Bomber to escape, then the journalists won\u2019t have to worry about working for a week.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk\u2019s body trembled.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Just thinking about that threat was terrifying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let me ask you one thing. You aren\u2019t a police officer... What do you get for helping me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sometimes he did something horrific for a good reason.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk suddenly wondered why Phantom came out like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is indeed money. Let's see. There is no bounty on a hidden crime. I am looking for the guilt of a man trapped in prison. I am fine with receiving 30 million.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see. But I think you can make money through easier methods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am an irregular worker. I am very envious of the office workers with a regular salary.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha... At any rate, I will be sure to contact you at the end of the case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom and Kang-suk briefly talked about the prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In the meantime, the Ferris Wheel was about to complete one turn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then are we accomplices?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We have gathered strengths to solve this case so it isn\u2019t wrong to say that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then it was nice to meet you, Detective Cho Kang-suk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou as well, Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom extended a hand covered by a thick glove.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I\u2019m sorry but my right hand is a bit hurt right now, so please bear with my left hand. Ah right, I am working with Cho Kang-suk, not the police.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk shook hands with Phantom without saying anything.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Thus, the alliance between Phantom and Detective Cho Kang-suk formed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The alliance with Phantom was established but the police were quiet.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk apparently thought that there was some type of deal between the police commissioner and Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He said to hide as much as possible that Phantom is involved in this case?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk was about to make contact with the prison warden, which was the last preparation stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He said that he would use the pseudonym Kim Cheol-su.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the table was Phantom\u2019s fake ID made by the General Affairs Department.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Ironically, even a family registration was needed to go to prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t go in with the name Phantom, so he needed a fake identity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Inside the envelope was a resident registration card, a passport, and a driver\u2019s license.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">But the photo shot was literally art.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk lost his appetite looking at it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The person was in their mid-40s, and displayed a half-shaved head covered in oil.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Deep wrinkles were seen on the face.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">In particular, the reddish eyes looked dangerous.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It was almost like he was on a drug.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Even so, the beard was neatly shaved with a razor blade.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The atmosphere that he gave off would make any weak person crack.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">It felt like the face of a crazy person was painted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was photographed with an old shirt and a blue jacket.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The quality was so good that Kang-suk could distribute many flyers right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is enough to seem like a criminal...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the appearance of \u2018Kim Cheol-su\u2019 that Phantom would use in the prison from now on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is he the person who will enter Blue Dragon Prison?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joo Hyun-ho opened the door and entered.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">This mission was strictly confidential, so he didn\u2019t tell Hyun-ho that Kim Cheol-su\u2019s identity was Phantom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, that\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyun-ho looked at the photo on the ID and muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow, totally perfect. What type of person is he? He looks like he could kill 15 people while laughing. If you knew such a person then you should\u2019ve told me in advance. There was no need to waste time on Phantom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn't realize that I knew such a person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He gets 30 million won as compensation, although he certainly deserves that much for entering Blue Dragon. Of course, one billion would be given if needed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We were lucky.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk barely managed to keep his mouth shut.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Was this what a hat seller felt like when they discovered that the king\u2019s ears were strange?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe quiet. I have to call the warden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had sought cooperation from the warden beforehand.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now, if Kim Cheol-su\u2019s details passed, a new prisoner would enter Blue Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk called the number of the prison stored in his phone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Then a gentle voice welcomed Kang-suk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Detective Cho Kang-suk, is the criminal prepared?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I will send you the relevant materials through fax right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">Let\u2019s see...</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Wah.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">Isn\u2019t this person really a criminal?</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry but he is an investigator.

The more people who know, the more likely discovery will be.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">So I will keep it a secret, even if he is treated a little harshly by the prison guards.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">You should know</span></i><span style=\"\">. </span><i><span style=\"\">The prisoners confined here usually aren\u2019t human.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">A little roughness is needed to deal with these people.</span></i><i><span style=\"\">It is the only condition of my cooperation.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, then Kim Cheol-su will arrive in three days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-</span><i><span style=\"\">I hope this turns out well, Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></i></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The phone call ended there.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The prison warden definitely seemed to be hiding something, but it was impossible to know unless he went directly there.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Kang-suk muttered so that Joo Hyun-ho, sitting next to him, couldn\u2019t hear anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In the end, everyone involved in this operation is deceiving someone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He lost his appetite.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything was in order to dig out the tragedy caused by Park Sung-yul.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, the case wouldn\u2019t end that simply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Three days later, the stage was moved to the Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Now Kang-suk had to wait for Phantom to safely get the information from Park Sung-yul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In the end, Phantom is the only one who can tell the truth about this case. He is literally an accomplice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">@</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe warden seems to be hiding something; you should be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-suk and Phantom were riding the convoy heading to Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once they arrived at the port, they would ride on the boat for 30 minutes before arriving at Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Rather than the handcuffed Phantom, Kang-suk was the one that seemed more nervous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't worry. I am Kim Cheol-su. I don\u2019t care if it is Blue Dragon or Red Pheonix, no prison can hold me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tone was a completely different person to Phantom.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The more he watched, the stranger it was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The guards don\u2019t know that you are a co-worker. They just think you are a criminal who has committed terrible acts. It will be hard for you to endure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Endure?\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">He had lived there for 10 years.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">If he closed his eyes, the appearance of Blue Dragon Prison still vividly popped up.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The time limit was one month.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">At that time, he had an appointment with the warden to get him out of prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDetective Cho Kang-suk, we\u2019ve arrived.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Salty wind blew through the iron bars covering the window of the back door.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">They were at the port where a ship would transport them to Blue Dragon Prison.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">The moment he got there, he would be a prisoner completely disconnected from the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom licked his lips and recalled the prison that was beyond the horizon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First of all, it was important to find the gold left behind by the Japanese army.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">However, it was surprisingly enjoyable to solve the puzzle made by Park Sung-yul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Past events have already happened.

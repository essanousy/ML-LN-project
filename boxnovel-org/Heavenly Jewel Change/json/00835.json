I truly didn\u2019t expect that you would be able to master the Genesis Time Law. What a waste! Your skill may be effective against Fen Tian, but it\u2019s utterly useless against me. You can trap living things, but my Destructive Thought is not something that your puny Time Law can trap. I\u2019ll admit that I lost the battle here. However, the Netherworld\u2019s about to open a passageway that leads to this stretch on the mainland. The day my true body descends to this world is the day all of you are destroyed. Fen Tian is my puppet. Even if he has to die, he\u2019ll die by my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was saying that, two green-colored light suddenly shot out of the little six-year-old Fen Tian\u2019s eyes. With a pop, his head exploded just like that. The two green-colored light merged into one in the air, and it seemed to stare at Zhou Weiqing for a moment before it forcefully erupted while the Time Law\u2019s constraint vanished.</p><br/><p>All the Destruction Energy in the air seemed to vanish with this disappearance. There was only Fen Tian\u2019s corpse that dropped onto the ground with a thud. The Saint Land Lord from the Blood Red Hell did not even manage to say his final words before he died.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Empress stared at each other. They could not refrain from laughing, \u201cSo did we lose or win? Fen Tian\u2019s already so powerful with only a third of the Nether Lord\u2019s abilities, how are we going to deal with the actual Nether Lord then?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress sighed, \u201cWe are incapable of dealing with him. The Nether Lord\u2019s not lying. The Genesis Time Law is only capable of restraining lifeforms like us, but he\u2019s different. He\u2019s formed completely from the Destruction Energy and resentment. He\u2019s not even a living entity with substance. Moreover, the level of his Destruction Attribute significantly exceeds the level of your Genesis Time Law. Unless you can comprehend the true Genesis Law, even with all of us combined, we still won\u2019t be a match for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComprehend the true Genesis Law? Is there even a way to do that?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked in a lowered voice.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress let out a forced laugh as she spoke, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. There\u2019s only one person who has ever mastered the Genesis Law, and that person was the Genesis God. After he created the world, his Genesis Law disappeared and ceased to exist. If you can master the Genesis Law, you\u2019ll become the new Genesis God. You\u2019ll be able to destroy the likes of the Boundless Mainland with just a turn of your palm. How will it be possible for something like that to happen? The Genesis God no longer exists.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stared at her in bewilderment as he asked, \u201cSo what are we going to do then? We can\u2019t just wait for our doom here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress spoke, \u201cWe should leave this place first before we discuss the matter any further. Our only way out is to reinforce the seal on the exit of the Netherworld passageway. It won\u2019t be a difficult task to reinforce the seal with your Saint Energy. As long as we can stop the Nether Lord from charging out, what else can it do even if it\u2019s more powerful? It\u2019s already at the Heaven Change Tier now, and it\u2019s also a God in the truest sense. However, it\u2019s still incapable of breaking out of the secure seal that was formed from the divine blood from the bloodline of all the different sects.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded. In truth, he did not like the feeling of destiny not being in his control. However, he could only abide by the Elven Empress\u2019 suggestion for the time being.</p><br/><p>A distorted halo flashed past, and Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Empress simultaneously emerged within the void. When they emerged once again to their own space-time continuum, the Elven Empress returned to her original state accordingly. On the other hand, Fen Tian\u2019s corpse was in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand. Apart from the corpse, Fen Tian\u2019s Heavenly Core Nucleus was in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s other hand. It was the Heavenly Core Nucleus of Maximum-Level Heavenly God.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain, Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and Peerless Sect powerhouses were initially idling around because they were at a loss of what to do. It seemed like Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Empress had only vanished for a split second before they reappeared again in the next moment. To everyone\u2019s surprise, Fen Tian had already turned into a corpse.</p><br/><p>After a short moment of silence, sounds of cheering similar to mighty wave erupted.</p><br/><p>After experiencing such a long battle with countless life and death situations, the great battle had finally ended. They were precisely the final victor.</p><br/><p>Within the sound of cheers, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s soulmates had already pounced on him. Tian\u2019er who was also a participant of the earlier battle stood the closest to him. She hugged Zhou Weiqing tightly. The other women were not slow either as they surrounded Zhou Weiqing in the center.</p><br/><p>The powerhouses from the Three Great Saint Lands also surrounded him one after another. They were truly relieved when they saw the corpse with its blown-off head. It did not matter that they went through many hardships, the battle had finally ended and victory was theirs.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang could not refrain himself from asking, \u201cWeiqing, how did you do it? Is Fen Tian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing wrapped his arms around his soulmates on the left and right as he chuckled, \u201cUncle, this is a secret. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m telling all of you. I can only say that Fen Tian has truly died. However, everything hasn\u2019t ended yet. The threat from the Netherworld Lord still stands.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing his final sentence, the crowd\u2019s initial excitement instantly became much quieter. Each of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s soulmates loosened their grip on his arms shyly. At one point, they truly thought that they were going to lose Zhou Weiqing, with all of their resentment and grudges turning into anxiousness. However, while they were looking at everyone nearby at this moment, they saw Dongfang Hanyue who was also standing next to them. The joy on their faces was once again, replaced by jealousy.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress spoke, \u201cZhou Weiqing is right. We can\u2019t relax our vigilance yet. We must quickly make our way to the seal at the exit of the Netherworld\u2019s pathway. Judging from the Nether Lord\u2019s confidence, I predict that it think it\u2019s certain that it will be able to break through the seal. At that time, no one will be able to stop him if he descends to our world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s expression became solemn as he spoke, \u201cSo where\u2019s this Nether Pathway then? Your majesty, please teach me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress lowered her gaze as she bided, \u201cIt\u2019s precisely there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd followed her gaze. Moreover, more than half of the Wan Shou Heaven\u2019s surface area was destroyed. Shangguan Tianyang was startled, \u201cBrother Xue, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian sighed before he spoke, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to hide anything now. It\u2019s true. Those of us from the Heavenly Snow Mountain has always been guarding the Nether Pathway\u2019s exit. My wife\u2019s even one of the seal\u2019s guardian. After she gave birth to Tian\u2019er back in those days, she returned to the seal right here. I\u2019ve never seen the Nether Pathway\u2019s seal before, but this is definitely the exit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at the Elven Empress, \u201cYour Majesty. What are we supposed to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark clouds and darkness in the sky had already dispersed following the battle\u2019s end, and sunlight was shining on the ground. However, the Heavenly Snow Mountain no longer existed. Moreover, more than half of the Wan Shou Heaven\u2019s surface area was destroyed.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress spoke in a solemn tone upon feeling the gazes from everyone, \u201cIt\u2019s useless for ordinary people to go to the seal. Weiqing, you shall go with Tian\u2019er. You and Tian\u2019er possess true Saint Energy, only the two of you truly possess the ability to reinforce the Netherworld\u2019s seal. I\u2019m one of the originators who created the seal back in the day, and my lineage has the ability to reinforce the seal as well. However, you\u2019ll need to further enhance your cultivation base before you leave for the Netherworld\u2019s seal. You need to restore the two enormous dragon spirits so the dragons can come along with you. You can rely on their Dragon Emperor Bloodlines to ease the process of reinforcing the seal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, \u201cVery well. In that case, we\u2019ll begin now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elf Tribe\u2019s twelve elven elders had already brought over the two enormous dragons, Hui Yao and Duo Si. The Elven Empress relied on her powerful Life Saint Energy to put them into a temporary slumber after trapping them earlier. However, the black-colored stains on their bodies had yet to fade.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing first went over to the upper area of the enormous dragon Hui Yao\u2019s head. His hands were glimmering with a gentle white light as he conjured up the Dual God Strength Hammers. The Astral Divine Territory was still attached to the giant hammers as well.</p><br/><p>He aimed the giant hammers downwards and pinned it down onto Hui Yao\u2019s head. A white-colored radiance flashed past and the pure Saint Energy amplified by the Astral Divine Territory was infused into Hui Yao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao\u2019s enormous body started trembling violently all of a sudden. It was Fen Tian who exercised control over Hui Yao and Duo Si earlier, the Destruction Energy that was controlling them turned into a masterless matter now that Fen Tian was already dead. The Destruction Energy was utterly defenseless in the face of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pure Nebula Saint Energy that had advanced to the Heavenly God Tier. It only took a few moments before the black color on Hui Yao\u2019s body gradually faded and disappeared.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Tian\u2019er was also following the same method as she removed the Destruction Energy within Duo Si\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>After the process was completed, Zhou Weiqing did not relax. Instead, he furrowed his brows and did not lift the giant hammers in his hands that was still pinning Hui Yao\u2019s head down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoo\u2026\u201d The low and deep sound of a dragon\u2019s roar slowly escaped Hui Yao\u2019s mouth as he slowly opened his enormous dragon\u2019s eyes. When his muddled eyesight gradually turned crystal clear, the sound of a dismal dragon\u2019s roar burst forth from Hui Yao\u2019s mouth suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 my children.\u201d On the other side, Duo Si\u2019s dismal and agonizing moan echoed simultaneously. The two enormous dragons let out a sorrowful howl as if they had simultaneously become hysterical. It made all of the powerhouses on the scene feel a sense of grief for them.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had already predicted such an outcome, but he still could not refrain from feeling heavy-hearted. Even Hui Yao and Duo Si were enslaved by the Blood Red Hell, there was no need to go into details about their children.</p><br/><p>The only thing that Zhou Weiqing could do at this moment was to use his gentle Saint Energy to continuously ease the grievance in Hui Yao and Duo Si\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao and Duo Si gradually turned calmer after a long while. Hui Yao raised his enormous head and looked at Zhou Weiqing. Surprisingly, his ginormous body was still trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, they\u2026they killed my children and used my children as a blood sacrifice to the Nether Lord. I\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing squatted down and gently caressed Hui Yao\u2019s huge head, \u201cWhat has passed is past. Turn your pain into strength, my friend. We\u2019ve already destroyed the Blood Red Hell, and I\u2019ve also killed Fen Tian. We\u2019re now heading to the Netherworld\u2019s seal urgently to reinforce the seal so that the Nether Lord\u2019s vision to come to our world will be unfulfilled.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

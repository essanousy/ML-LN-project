It did not emit any sound this time. However, the sea at the far end turned bright red. It looked as if it was dyed red with blood.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was also in the sea, and he was quite a distance away from the main battlefield. However, at that moment, he could feel the sea temperature plummeting abruptly. The terrifying surge of energy almost tore his body apart.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s this energy?\u2019 he thought.</p><br/><p>In the faintness of the energy surge, Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel the presence of darkness and evilness. In addition, there was also a destructive ripping sensation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fusion Skill. This is a Fusion Skill,\u2019 he thought.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing immediately came to that conclusion. Not only that, this Fusion Skill was a real fusion between darkness and evilness. Zhou Weiqing had six Elemental Jewel attributes, and he was also Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor\u2019s disciple. In that instant, he\u2019d already made an accurate assessment about Meng Xing\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>The energy that was released from Meng Xing\u2019s Dragon Spear was indeed one of darkness, but it was not a simple dark energy. It was a heightened version of it. A Heavenly God tier skill that truly combined darkness and evilness.</p><br/><p>He was not sure what skill that was but he understood one thing. If he was stabbed by this thing without any proper preparation, not even Saint Energy could save him.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s strength was so impressive that even the pompous Dreadfiend Sea Naga was forced to dive into the sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowrrrr!\u201d the dragon roared furiously. A cerulean-colored light ribbon rose from the sea, turning into countless watery arrows.</p><br/><p>The water arrows were launched at high speed at the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing who were in the air.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon unfolded its wings. Beneath them, a huge deep purple vortex appeared out of thin air. As the water arrows entered the vortex, they vanished into nothingness.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing brandished her Dragon Spear again. This time around, twelve scarlet beams propelled out, all aimed at different directions.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not even hesitate as he leaped out from the sea and continued to retreat. It was just one shot of the energy, but even someone as far away as him was affected by it. There were twelve shots this time. The energy they contained could only be imagined. He did not want to become that unlucky guy who got hit.</p><br/><p>The fearsome energy kept rising in the air as a brilliant light was suddenly released from the sea.</p><br/><p>It was a cerulean shield that blocked the twelve piercing red beams.</p><br/><p>However, something strange happened. The cerulean shield that looked durable could not completely block out the beams. It left the shield with twelve small holes before it crumbled.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was so fearful of the beams. Not even his Heavenly God tier defensive skill could stop them. Was that Meng Xing\u2019s strength after she combined her eleven-piece legendary armor set with the Blackfiend Dragon? That was a set of eleven-piece legendary armor! As expected, it was powerful.</p><br/><p>Even Zhou Weiqing was slightly jealous of it. After all, even if his Ringless Ground Purging Set was strong, it was only a set of ten. When he thought about how much power he would gain if he could collect all ten pieces of the armor set, Zhou Weiqing could roughly estimate how much more powerful the Blackfiend Dragon Set had increased Meng Xing\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>The sea parted. With a sudden boom, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga ascended from the sea. It did not have wings, but as a Heavenly God tier powerhouse, how could it not have the ability to fly?</p><br/><p>A terrifying power blasted out from its body at that moment. Its body ferociously lunged at the Blackfiend Dragon. At the same time, all the spines on the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s body glowed blue. Thousands of blue lights shot out from its body in every direction.</p><br/><p>The blue lights were too fast. Even if Zhou Weiqing could see it as it happened, it was impossible to evade them. This was because the Water attributes in the air froze the exact moment the blue lights appeared, effectively trapping Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body in mid-air.</p><br/><p>This was not because the Dreadfiend Sea Naga specifically aimed at him, but because its power as a Heavenly God tier powerhouse was so tyrannical that even a simple move could cause heaven and earth to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t!\u201d Zhou Weiqing yelled wordlessly. Left with no other choice, for the sake of his safety, he could no longer conceal his Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>As he readied his Saint Energy, he was preparing to defend himself, as well as to break free from the constraint of the Water attribute. The Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s body swerved towards one side, swooping into a lower area. At the same time, more red beams poured out from the Dragon Spear in Meng Xing\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>In that instant, the sky and earth rumbled. However, what was surprising to Zhou Weiqing was that all the blue lights that were heading his way were blocked by the red beams.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was trying to save me!\u201d Zhou Weiqing thought in surprise as a certain warmth flowed into his heart.</p><br/><p>Even when she was faced with a strong enemy like the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, Meng Xing still took notice of his situation. Powers aside, this act of kindness had branded itself into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>It was true that Zhou Weiqing was a little perverted. However, he was someone who prioritized humanity. If someone treated him with kindness, he would definitely pay them back with ten times the kindness that they had shown. Meng Xing did not realize this, but her completely subconscious move had earned her a ton of respect from Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga and Blackfiend Dragon finally collided for the first time.</p><br/><p>From a purely physical perspective, the Blackfiend Dragon could not rival the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. He was immediately thrown out of engagement from the impact. He had to have been hit by hundreds of those blue lights too, as a mix of scales and dragon blood fell from the sky.</p><br/><p>With that said, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga did not fare any better. If his opponent was only the Blackfiend Dragon, then he was sure he would be able to rip the Blackfiend Dragon to pieces even if he had to sacrifice a little. However, Meng Xing, who stood on top of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s head, posed an even bigger threat than the Blackfiend Dragon.</p><br/><p>At this point, at least forty of the spikes from the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s body had disappeared into the void. The injury he sustained was not any lesser than the ones on the Blackfiend Dragon. Even though he had defended against Meng Xing\u2019s attack with his impressive defensive skill, when he tried to seize the opportunity to hit the Blackfiend Dragon critically, the Dragon Spear in Meng Xing\u2019s hand appeared before him.</p><br/><p>He did not want the Dragon Spear to come in contact with his body. Meng Xing\u2019s Dragon Spear was fused together with its two final Consolidated Equipment pieces. When it came to legendary armor sets, the more pieces it had, the harder it was to craft the Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. Their powers were stronger too. This was even truer when she fused the final two pieces of the armor. It was a whole set. An eleven-piece legendary armor set! The power of this set armor, when combined with the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s own strength, could only be speculated.</p><br/><p>The main reason the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was afraid of the Dragon Spear was because his own father had died under the Dragon Spear\u2019s attack. Not even Heavenly God tier powerhouses like them could defend against the true form of the Dragon Spear.</p><br/><p>An alarming amount of energy swirled in the air. Zhou Weiqing did not know what was going through the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s mind, but it seemed like the Dreadfiend Sea Naga did not gain the upper hand in the last collision.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s huge torso spun around in the air as it let out a vehement roar. The success of the previous attack had boosted his confidence. It had been so many years since he had worked with a partner that had a full set of the Blackfiend Dragon Set. He had almost forgotten how powerful the Dragon Spear was. He did not expect Meng Xing would be able to wield the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear to that extent.</p><br/><p>The frightening Dragon Spear pointed forward once more, Meng Xing\u2019s scarlet eyes did not express a single hint of emotion. Her spirit and focus were wholly concentrated on the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga roared in rage as he glowed for the second time. However, this time, not only did his body glowed, even the sea beneath it was shimmering brightly. Almost instantly, a formidable amount of Water attributes formed a massive cage, trapping both the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing stabbed at the cage repeatedly with the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear, and the Blackfiend Dragon attacked it ferociously, too. But as soon as the attacks came in contact with the icy blue cage, they melted away rapidly. Even if some parts of it had been destroyed, Water attributes would rise from below to reform the cage.</p><br/><p>There was a hint of tiredness in the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s eyes after he used that ability but the majority of his expression was one of excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my territory. So what if your combined strength can rival mine? You still can\u2019t compete with the might of the entire ocean. Just go and die. Both of you should just go and die! Ha ha ha! As soon as you\u2019ve exhausted your darkness energy, you\u2019ll forever rest in the ocean. In my ocean!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that exact moment, Meng Xing\u2019s eyes lit up. She raised the Dragon Spear above her head and traced an outline of what looked to be a glimmer of a red colored flower petal.</p><br/><p>The glowing flower petal did not manage to break the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s Ocean\u2019s Prison which was cast with the sea\u2019s support. However, in the next moment, twelve pillars of pure darkness shot up into the sky from all directions.</p><br/><p>The Ward of Darkness Sealing Spell that was prepared beforehand had been activated.</p><br/><p>Both the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing knew, even with their combined strength, it would be impossible to finish off the Dreadfiend Sea Naga in the sea. If they were able to retreat safely, it would already be considered a win. However, they had prepared for this battle before they came! The Ward of Darkness was a gift specially prepared for the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. It could be said that everything they had done in the exchange prior to this was a distraction. It was a plan to lure it into the range of the Ward of Darkness. Only when it entered the spell\u2019s range could it become the meat on their chopping block and be at their mercy.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, when the twelve black pillars shot into the sky, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was startled followed by a surge of panic before he darted away like a lightning bolt. Covering a distance of a thousand meters in just a matter of seconds was nothing to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, but just as it almost escaped the spell\u2019s range, a loud boom was heard as he rebounded off a black wall of light.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

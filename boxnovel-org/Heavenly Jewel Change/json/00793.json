An intense silver light continued coming out of his body as it infused the Aqua Tide. The Heavenly Energy ripples in the room also intensified.</p><br/><p>Right this moment, Zhou Weiqing slowly opened his eyes when he sensed the changes in the surroundings. He did not disturb Duan Tianlang. Instead, he quietly rose up as he watched soundlessly from a distance. Although Duan Tianlang\u2019s cultivation base was inferior to his, their abilities were on par when it came to the competency of being a Consolidated Equipment Master. It was all thanks to his innate talent that he became a God Tier Master. That was why he did not need to exert much effort. For this reason, he only needed to learn from Duan Tianlang\u2019s technique and experience.</p><br/><p>The Aqua Tide continued to spin swiftly in front of Duan Tianlang. Gradually, the turquoise light that was emitting out of it slowly consolidated and merged with the Spatial Heavenly Energy as it emitted a greenish silver light.</p><br/><p>What was even more bizarre were the changes to the Aqua Tide\u2019s rim. The same greenish silver light actually took the shape of a funnel instead as the tip of the funnel extended all the way into the Aqua Tide bowl. A small, nail-sized black hole could be seen at the tip of the funnel.</p><br/><p>Soon after, Duan Tianlang began to make a move. Countless shades of lights appeared in his hands instantly. Every ray of light was as solid as matter. Although they materialized quickly, they appeared to be very stable.</p><br/><p>Streams of lights continued to infuse the greenish silver whirlpool in the Aqua Tide. Strange enough, although many of the valuable materials were pretty large, they quickly vanished without a trace the moment they entered the whirlpool.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang\u2019s speed was indeed too fast. It was not only fast, it was also rather rhythmic. With speed like this, if one were to stand slightly further away, all one would be able to see would be a colorful stream of lights that continued to flow out of his hands. It looked like some kind of illusion as it poured into the Aqua Tide.</p><br/><p>As more and more lights entered the Aqua Tide, the turquoise color of the beautiful earthen bowl began to turn richer as time passed by. The rotation speed continued to increase as well as it constantly engulfed the valuable ingredients.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Divine Thought had already spread to outside the room. It formed a natural barrier over it. Not only could it prevent outsiders from snooping around, it could also prevent the Heavenly Energy ripples and the valuable ingredients\u2019 aura from escaping outside when Duan Tianlang was in the process of making the ink.</p><br/><p>Apparently, this was something that was necessary. Otherwise, it would easily attract Heavenly Beasts\u2019 attention from a huge perimeter. Although Zhou Weiqing was not afraid of Heavenly Beasts casting their covetous eyes on them, he would prefer that they did not disrupt his Junior Master\u2019s ink-making process.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhou Weiqing was already at the Upper Levels of the Heavenly Emperor Tier and is approaching the Maximum Level soon, the look of astonishment in his eyes grew stronger as time passed.</p><br/><p>This was because he could clearly see that the energy ripples rising from the Aqua Tide was growing stronger as time passed. At the same time, it felt horribly dreadful. He was certain that if the Aqua Tide were to be detonated, the entire Heavenly Bow City would be completely wiped out from the world. Heck, was that the best case scenario? One could easily imagine how much energy was being processed within the Aqua Tide.</p><br/><p>Originally, when Duan Tianlang sent Zhou Weiqing on the mission to search for the Elven Queen\u2019s blood, Zhou Weiqing thought that the main ingredient for the Consolidating Ink would be the Elven Queen\u2019s blood. Although all the other ingredients were valuable as well, they were inferior compared to the blood. However, looking at the situation now, it seemed like he was wrong after all. His Junior Master had only just started the process of making the Consolidating Ink and yet, the Aqua Tide earthen bowl was already exuding such hair-raising energy ripples. Even he, who was already at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier, was taken aback by such a scene. One could easily imagine how ghastly the amount of energy contained in these valuable ingredients. Only the most priceless treasures would be able to release such threatening energy ripples!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was a pretty good judge of things. Although he did not recognize most of the valuable ingredients that Duan Tianlang was using, just from the few that he recognized, it was already more than enough for him to confirm his initial thoughts. For example, he saw a fist-sized crystal clear Nucleus Core that gave off an intense fiery red light. When this Nucleus Core was tossed into the bowl, the fiery red light that it gave off completely solidified. It made it look like it was covered in a layer of solid light. Zhou Weiqing suspected that the Nucleus Core was most probably taken from a Heavenly God-tier Heavenly Beast.</p><br/><p>In fact, if he absorbed this Nucleus Core, it would at the very least stabilize his cultivation base at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier. Currently, Duan Tianlang was merely using it to make the Consolidating Ink.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a realization suddenly dawned on Zhou Weiqing. Just the eleventh piece of the legendary armor suit would most likely surpass the value of all the previous ten pieces together. Most of the valuable ingredients that his Junior Master used was most likely not bought by the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Instead, they were probably treasures that originally belonged to the Strength Legacy that had been put away for many years.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing instinctively shifted his glance towards Duan Tianlang who had a resolute and determined look in his eyes as he was fixated on the Aqua Tide. His entire being gave off an invisible Qi field like a large mountain standing guard up high.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing pursed his lips slightly. His eyes instantly turned darker. Just as his eyes darkened, his pupils constricted into tiny pinpoints. He had already made up his mind that he would give his all no matter how difficult the situation turned out. He would work till his last breath just to finish making the Consolidated Equipment Scroll. It was only in this way that he would be worthy of Duan Tianlang\u2019s sacrifice. Not only that, it could also be considered as him fulfilling his Junior Master\u2019s greatest wish of his life.</p><br/><p>The turquoise light that was emitting out of the Aqua Tide made it look like a small, dazzling turquoise sun. An extremely strong aroma was also coming out of it. This aroma was filled with the breath of life and the energy ripples of all the attributes that Zhou Weiqing knew of. Apart from that, each and every one of the energy attribute was the purest as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing would be able to easily purify a single attribute. However, it was an impossible task to purify all of the attributes at the same time. He could blend all of the attributes together with his Saint Energy but he could not isolate all of the attributes to purify them separately.</p><br/><p>Even Zhou Weiqing could not do this, let alone Duan Tianlang. However, it was currently made possible by the Aqua Tide. It was a treasure that was known as an artifact among Consolidated Equipment Masters. This was also the reason why Duan Tianlang had faith that they would be successful in making the Consolidating Ink as long as all there were enough materials and ingredients. Even the three God Tier Masters in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s Heavenly Jewel Island did not possess such a treasure. It would take the three of them working together just to finish making Consolidating Ink of this level. Moreover, it did not mean that they would be able to succeed with just one attempt.</p><br/><p>If it was not for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Divine Thought\u2019s protection, other Heavenly Jewel Masters who had a higher cultivation base would definitely feel the strong energy ripple from several dozen miles away. The dense aura that was released by the valuable ingredients was more than enough to induce envy.</p><br/><p>Time continued to pass. Duan Tianlang\u2019s eyes turned serious as time went by. When the Aqua Tide\u2019s rotation reached its maximum speed, the speed suddenly dropped. It was as if it had turned heavier. Tiny black cracks began to appear around the air by the Aqua Tide \u2014 it was a sign that space around it was being torn apart.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the energy inside the Aqua Tide was so massive that it was starting to become too much for the Aqua Tide to contain. Beads of sweat began to form and flow down from Duan Tianlang\u2019s forehead. His clothes were fully drenched from the front to the back. However, the Spatial attribute Heavenly Energy that erupted from his body kept going strong. It was continuously rising up. However, his hand movements had started to slow down.</p><br/><p>This was the first time in Duan Tianlang\u2019s life that he was performing such a completion process for the Consolidating Ink. Although he had many simulated practices and thought about all possible situations that may arise, he still suffered from a tremendous pressure the instant he started making the ink.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fail! I can\u2019t fail no matter what! I only have one batch of materials and if I fail, God knows how long it\u2019ll take before I can start making this Consolidating Ink again!\u201d Duan Tianlang thought to himself. He knew very clearly that he only had one shot at this. Although the Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing infused into his body was enough to save his life, his energy was not limitless. It was almost depleted long ago from all the Consolidated Equipment Scroll making from many years ago.If he failed this time, he would not have the courage to attempt it again for the second time. Even though he could still make the scroll by guiding Zhou Weiqing, it was still not a product made with his own hands.</p><br/><p>With an interval every few minutes, Duan Tianlang threw another valuable ingredient into the Aqua Tide. Every interval would be longer than the previous one, and after every new item was tossed into it, the Aqua Tide would appear heavier. It seemed like it was sinking from its position in mid-air. Duan Tianlang broke into a sweat when he saw that.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zhou Weiqing did not dare to intervene at all. He did not even dare to infuse any Saint Energy into Duan Tianlang\u2019s body. Presently, Duan Tianlang was like a taut bowstring that would snap with just the slightest interruption, even if the interruption was good and meant to help him.</p><br/><p>Finally, Duan Tianlang reached both of his hands out and instantly, two golden colored fruits fell into the Aqua Tide.</p><br/><p>With a \u201cwhoosh\u201d, the Aqua Tide\u2019s swirling came to a halt all of a sudden. Without warning, it crashed directly to the ground.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang shouted, \u201cGet up!\u201d His right foot stomped mercilessly on the ground. His alarming Heavenly Energy erupted all of a sudden, and a silverish white light began to pour into the Aqua Tide without reserve. It stopped the fall of the Aqua Tide when it was just a foot away from hitting the ground.</p><br/><p>However, at this time, on top of the Aqua Tide that was no longer swirling, a very unstable energy ripple blasted out without warning. Tiny cracks began to appear on the turquoise lights as if it was about to explode into pieces. A circle of black light could also be seen around the Aqua Tide. It seemed like it was about to slash open the space around it and soar away from this realm.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

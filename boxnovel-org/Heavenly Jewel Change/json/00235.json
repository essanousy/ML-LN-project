However, Zhou Weiqing could see that something was different this time. \u00a0As soon as the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle had touched the water, it began to emanate a hazy halo of light which made it look dreamlike and mesmerizing within the darkness of the night.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing once more entered the shuttle. \u00a0This time, something marvelous happened as soon as he pushed the octahedral gemstone into the impression. \u00a0The lid above them slowly slid shut, separating them from the outside world. As it completely closed and as the vessel completely sank down into the ocean, the insides of the entire shuttle suddenly lit up.</p><br/><p>Line of dazzling blue light appeared within the interior of the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle, creating a dream-like world. \u00a0The crystal screen in front of them suddenly became completely clear, seemingly magnifying everything in the outside world and making everything visible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful!\u201d \u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er instantly let out a sigh of amazement as she stared at the blue light around her. \u00a0No girl could possibly resist this sort of beautiful luster.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s focus, however, was on something else. \u00a0He had just noticed that after the cabin \u2018lid\u2019 had sealed, the shuttle had instantly stabilized. \u00a0The waves of the sea didn\u2019t seem to have any effect on it at all, nor was there any sort of rocking sensation.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a smooth crystal globe armrest slowly began to arise between the two. \u00a0It was located right below Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right arm, and he could comfortably rest his entire arm atop it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was extremely clever. \u00a0He instantly knew exactly what he had to do. \u00a0He slowly tested out sending his Saint Energy into the crystal globe, and the scene around them instantly changed once more. \u00a0The blue light inside the cabin dimmed, but the outside world suddenly lit up. It was night, but they were now able to see everything as clearly as though it was day. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t simple illumination, it was some sort of unique luminescent transformation.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t all. \u00a0An even greater marvel appeared in the form of a helmet-like object slowly descending from up above him, coming to a rest over Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head. \u00a0Moments later, the chairs they were seated in began to transform as well. The crystal seats actually seemed to come to life, slowly shrinking as they molded themselves to their two occupants. \u00a0The seats actually became so connected to them that it was as though they had been \u2018embedded\u2019 into the seats. Not only did they feel extremely stable, the crystal seats actually gave them a soft and comfortable feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is actually a thing?\u201d \u00a0Zhou Weiqing let out a loud, amazed sigh. \u00a0Finally, he understood why Shangguan Tianyang had repeatedly emphasized that they had to return this thing to him. \u00a0He had no idea how this thing had been built, but so long as it wasn\u2019t too slow then without question it could be described as a divine instrument for traveling across the seas.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment the cold helmet sent a pulse of strange energy into Zhou Weiqing, startling him. \u00a0A heartbeat later, he discovered to his astonishment that his mind and consciousness had been instantly expanded. \u00a0It was as though this helmet had some sort of special psychic ripple within it that actually allowed him to link his mind into it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing closed his eyes. \u00a0He was now able to \u2018see\u2019 everything around himself with even greater clarity, but this time he wasn\u2019t just looking at what was ahead of him. \u00a0It was more like he himself was outside the ship, with \u2018eyes\u2019 covering all 360 degrees around the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle. He had no blind spots at all.</p><br/><p>With a rumble, a strange new sense entered his mind. \u00a0In that instant, Zhou Weiqing felt as though the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle had transformed into part of his body. \u00a0The pulse of strange energy had linked up with his mind, making it so that all of the secrets of the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle became embedded into his consciousness. \u00a0He now knew the history of the shuttle and how he was supposed to control it.</p><br/><p>Apparently, the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle had been fashioned from a Heavenly Core Nucleus harvested from one of the Terror Sea Dragons, the hegemons of the seas. \u00a0This particular Terror Sea Dragon had been at the Heavenly God stage, and it was at the absolute top of the oceanic food chain. It had been so large that it was actually larger than the two giant dragons Zhou Weiqing had recently met. \u00a0It had been nearly a thousand meters long! One could imagine how much energy its Core Nucleus contained.</p><br/><p>For the sake of fashioning the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle, the people of the Xuantian Continent had expended incalculable amounts of resources and manpower. \u00a0They had first extracted very last bit of the Heavenly Energy from the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s Core, then had begun the manufacturing process. Countless grandmaster artificers had worked together before finally succeeding in creating this unparalleled ocean-crossing \u2018vessel\u2019. \u00a0It had been meant for the Xuantian Palace to use, and alongside the Spatial Teleportation Gem they were the most supreme treasures the Xuantian Palace possessed.</p><br/><p>When the Xuantian Palace had led people to the Boundless Mainland, they had been planning on fighting a grand war of conquest. \u00a0However, the Boundless Mainland was far, far more powerful than they had predicted, and in the end they had suffered an utterly crushing defeat. \u00a0They had only survived and escaped thanks to the Spatial Teleportation Gem, which was able to teleport them to the location it had locked onto no matter how distant it was. \u00a0After they fled, the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle had been taken away by the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace as spoils of war. That was why it was now available for Zhou Weiqing to use.</p><br/><p>Because the shuttle had been fashioned from the Heavenly Core Nucleus of a Terror Sea Dragon, the aura it emanated in the seas would be enough to cause the vast majority of sea beasts to stay far away from them. \u00a0The shuttle itself was almost indestructibly tough, and it relied upon a Heavenly Jewel Master\u2019s Heavenly Energy to advance. It was incredibly fast, making traversing the seas a completely pain free prospect.</p><br/><p>Not just that \u2013 the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle also included records and maps of the sea within it. \u00a0These were complete maritime maps which the forces of Xuantian Palace had created as they had travelled to the Boundless Mainland, and so they by following these maps they could avoid getting lost or taking any accidental detours. \u00a0They would go straight to the Xuantian Continent!</p><br/><p>\u201cA divine artifact. \u00a0This is definitely a divine artifact!\u201d \u00a0Zhou Weiqing put away his Saint Energy, while the helmet on his head retracted on its own. \u00a0He didn\u2019t explain anything to Shangguan Bing\u2019er, simply asking her to switch positions with him. \u00a0Once she poured in her Heavenly Energy, she was able to sense everything for herself.</p><br/><p>Everyone is filled with curiosity towards new items, especially young people like them. \u00a0They then switched places again, pouring their Heavenly Energy into the sea maps and activating them. \u00a0Thanks to the 360 degree vision the helmet provided, Zhou Weiqing was able to see everything around him with absolute clarity. \u00a0He poured his Saint Energy into the shuttle in accordance with the imprinted mental instructions he had been given, instantly activating this marvelous artifact.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing discovered that when he filled the crystal globe with his Saint Energy, it was instantly magnified by the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle . \u00a0This was the marvelous, powerful effect the Heavenly Core Nucleus of a Heavenly God-ranked Heavenly Beast would have. A light blue stream of fire instantly erupted out from behind the shuttle, sending it shooting through the seas like an arrow.</p><br/><p>The Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle \u2018swam\u2019 through the seas like a fish, with the world around the two still perfectly clear and visible. \u00a0Thanks to the special abilities of the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle, Zhou Weiqing would be able to clearly see everything around him up to a distance of a thousand meters, even if he was in the deepest and darkest parts of the ocean. \u00a0As for his senses, they stretched out even further.</p><br/><p>The seawater almost seemed to be nonexistent for the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle. \u00a0As Zhou Wenqing sent the shuttle hurtling forwards with his mighty Saint Energy, it instantly sped up to an incredible pace which vastly eclipsed the galloping speed of the Ghost Demon Horse.</p><br/><p>What was even more marvelous was that very little of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was being used! \u00a0It was only depleting at a very slow, gradual rate. At the same time, the energies of the outside world didn\u2019t seem to impede the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle at all. \u00a0Instead it became purer as it went past the Sea Emperor Shuttle, allowing Zhou Weiqing to absorb it and use it to replenish his own Saint Energy. The Water-attribute energy of the sea was even able to transform into air, making it so that the insides of the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle didn\u2019t feel stuffy at all.</p><br/><p>The Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle was like a giant fish swimming through the seas under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mental control. \u00a0It was incredibly fast, and the feeling of perfect swimming control was quite refreshing as well. He was like a child who had just discovered a big new toy, and he continuously played around with all of the shuttle\u2019s marvelous functions.</p><br/><p>Because the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle strictly advanced underneath the surface of the ocean, no events which were occurring above the surface would hinder its speed in the slightest. \u00a0In the sea, there was no such thing as \u2018terrain\u2019 to worry about, and so they were able to send the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle hurtling forward in a straight line as they hastened towards the Xuantian Continent.</p><br/><p>After repeated tests, Zhou Weiqing quickly discovered that although there were Heavenly Beasts in the ocean, as soon as they sensed the faint blue aura and light emanating from the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle they would swim away in terror. \u00a0None of them dared to get in the way! Every so often, they would encounter some slower-swimming ocean beasts which were in their way. When this happened, the terrifyingly fast shuttle would almost instantly pierce straight through the beasts without even slowing down. \u00a0Thanks to the incredibly tough \u2018shell\u2019, they suffered no damage from this whatsoever. As the water continued to surge past them, no traces of the beasts\u2019 entrails would be left.</p><br/><p>At first, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er were filled with curiosity towards the ocean. \u00a0They had perfect visibility within the Sea Emperor\u2019s Shuttle, and so they would excitedly stare at the many marvelous scenes the ocean contained. \u00a0To them, this was all completely new and fresh. The many marvelous sea-dwelling creatures were of particular interest to them. There were so many types of fish and coral reefs, and all of them were mesmerizing.</p><br/><p>However, as time flowed on this sense of curiosity began to recede. \u00a0By the fifth day, loneliness had replaced it.</p><br/><p>Yes. \u00a0When sailing the seas, their greatest enemy was not the sea beasts. \u00a0It was loneliness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

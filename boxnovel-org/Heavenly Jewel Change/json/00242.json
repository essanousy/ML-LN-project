When his Heavenly Energy broke through to the thirty-sixth stage it remained Heavenly Xu Energy, but this breakthrough had allowed him to truly enter the realm of Heavenly Dao Energy. \u00a0No \u2013 to him, it would be Saint Dao Energy.</p><br/><p>After accumulating four more stages of Saint Dao Energy, he would be able to Consolidate his Saint Core Nucleus. \u00a0It was exactly like how the power of Heavenly Dao Energy could form a Heavenly Core Nucleus. However, upon reaching the Saint Dao Energy state, he had already eclipsed the vast majority of high-level Heavenly Kings. \u00a0Countless high-level Zong Stage experts had been trapped at the thirty-sixth stage! Now that he had comprehended and gained the Saint Dao Energy, his chances of being able to form a Core Nucleus had just skyrocketed.</p><br/><p>This had been a supremely important step. \u00a0For any Heavenly Jewel Master, this was a step that was incredibly dangerous but filled with tremendous possibilities.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had always trained in the Immortal Deity Technique and had broken through swiftly, which was why he felt as though he had been \u2018trapped\u2019 and bottlenecked at this stage for months, and plagued by how slow that was. \u00a0If other high-level Zong Stage experts found out about this, they\u2019d probably spit out mouthfuls of blood directly into his face. Some of them could go decades without being able to bypass this bottleneck!</p><br/><p>Heavenly Dao Energy was energy which came from the Ways of Heaven. \u00a0It grew and multiplied without end, and it was part of the Ways of Heaven themselves. \u00a0This single stage of advancement had caused him to reach a completely new level. Only now did the Saint Energy in his body form a true and continuous loop. \u00a0Thanks to his Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing was absolutely confident that he could battle anyone below the Heavenly Emperor level. Even if an actual Heavenly Emperor powerhouse wanted to kill him, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be an easy feat.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, are you alright?\u201d \u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er said, rather worried. \u00a0Although she had been able to sense Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy continuously improving, she knew that he had fallen unconscious due to how much mental energy he had used up.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing slowly reached out with his right hand, clenching it into a fist. \u00a0He could feel the atmospheric energies in the palm of his hand naturally compress. \u00a0\u201cHeavenly Dao Energy. Bing\u2019er, I\u2019ve broken through.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er was momentarily startled. \u00a0Her eyes then revealed flickers of complicated emotions. \u00a0Even though she had known many years ago that her Little Fatty was extraordinarily talented and would definitely become a true powerhouse of his generation, she never expected that all this would happen quite so quickly.</p><br/><p>From start to finish, Zhou Weiqing had only been training for six or seven years. \u00a0And yet, his cultivation had securely advanced towards the Heavenly King level\u2026 one with Saint Energy!</p><br/><p>\u00a0Zhou Weiqing sat up and took a deep breath. \u00a0Even while doing so, he was able to sense the atmospheric energies furiously gather around him, much like when he used the Devour Skill. \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he was on XuanTian Palace\u2019s territory, he really felt like using the Saint Energy to activate his actual Devour Skill, just to see what would happen. \u00a0He wanted to see if he could use it to Devour enough atmospheric energies from the world around him to train. That would definitely be an incredible sight!</p><br/><p>This breakthrough had resulted in Zhou Weiqing being strengthened in every aspect. \u00a0Saint Energy, physical strength, mental strength\u2026 he had improved greatly in each area. \u00a0Simply put, he had taken a step into a completely different world.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they say anything?\u201d \u00a0Zhou Weiqing asked Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er shook her head.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chortled. \u00a0\u201cTime to let them know that I\u2019m awake. \u00a0However, let me Consolidate that scroll first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Five pieces of \u2018Hate Ground No Handle\u2019 had already been enough to increase his base physical strength by 32 times. \u00a0Six pieces would result in an increase of 64 times. He had painstakingly constructed the scroll for his sixth piece of the \u2018Hate Ground No Handle\u2019 Legendary Set. \u00a0Once he finished Consolidating it, the sheer boost to his raw physical strength alone would result in his overall power skyrocketing dramatically.</p><br/><p>News that Zhou Weiqing was awake quickly spread to XuanTian Palace. \u00a0Nobody came to bother them on that first day, but early the next morning Zhou Weiqing suddenly halted his cultivation and slowly opened his eyes. \u00a0\u201cThey are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He threw on some clothes, left the bed, then walked out of the wooden room with the neatly attired Shangguan Bing\u2019er. \u00a0After they exited the room, Zhou Weiqing simply stood outside the doorway without going forward to greet their guests. Only three people had come to this gorge, and they were headed straight to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing only recognized one of these three people; Elder Fei Lun, who had brought them to XuanTian Palace. \u00a0Next to him was an old man who had a single sun emblem on his chest which showed that he had roughly the same status as Fei Lun. \u00a0The third was their leader, a man who had three sun emblems on his chest.</p><br/><p>This person was very tall, and his body was covered by long blue robes. \u00a0He had a head of long black hair which cascaded down his back, and a wide azure mask that covered his face. \u00a0Not even the skin around his neck was revealed. He was covered up very tightly.</p><br/><p><em>Three sun emblems</em>? \u00a0Zhou Weiqing was slightly startled.</p><br/><p>The three quickly arrived in front of the wooden room. \u00a0The leader came to a halt, then spoke in an extremely androgynous yet highly pleasing voice, \u201cMaster Zhou, greetings. \u00a0I\u2019m honored that you came to our XuanTian Palace. I am Palace Master Dong Fang of the XuanTian Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing secretly exclaimed to himself, \u201cI knew it!\u201d \u00a0He smiled and took a single step forwards, then nodded. \u201cHello, Palace Master Dong Fang.\u201d \u00a0This time, Elder Fei Lun didn\u2019t make any snide comments about Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation level. \u00a0As soon as Zhou Weiqing had proven himself a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, he had earned the right to act pridefully.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing carefully scanned this Palace Master Dong Fang. \u00a0However, he quickly realized that it was as though he was trying to scan the ocean itself; there was no information coming back to him! \u00a0All he could sense was that Palace Master Dong Fang\u2019s aura was extremely deep and profound. Just by standing there, he made Zhou Weiqing feel as though his own linkage with the atmospheric energies nearby had been lessened significantly.</p><br/><p>Dong Fang said calmly, \u201cI am extremely amazed to see that Master Zhou, despite being at such a young age, already has the ability to create God Tier Consolidating Scrolls. Masters Nie Han and Dreamwake have already informed me of your situation. \u00a0XuanTian Palace has always been extremely welcoming to geniuses like yourself. If there is anything you need, just speak and I shall do my best to fulfill it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled slightly. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have anything I need per se. \u00a0I\u2019ve come to join XuanTian Palace because I wish to have the chance to gain a better understanding of the crafting of Consolidating Scrolls. \u00a0Thus, I\u2019d like for the Palace Master to provide me with various types of materials. Also, I don\u2019t have the time to make Consolidating Scrolls for just anyone. \u00a0Don\u2019t send low-ranked people to come bother me. In addition, I would like to join XuanTian Palace as a visiting scholar, as I don\u2019t wish for other people to order me around. \u00a0But of course, if you need me to do anything, Palace Master, I won\u2019t decline.\u201d</p><br/><p>If anyone else had made these requests, the Elders behind Dong Fang would\u2019ve long slapped that man flying without needing for Dong Fang himself to make a move. \u00a0However, for these requests to come from a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master was a completely different matter.</p><br/><p>Dong Fang nodded. \u00a0\u201cNaturally. I accede to your requests, Master Zhou. \u00a0So long as XuanTian Palace can find the materials you want, you shall have free usage of them. \u00a0However\u2026 I would like to ask that a portion of the completed works be handed over to me to use as I see fit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said without hesitation, \u201cWe\u2019ll give you all of the items that neither myself nor my wife need. \u00a0However, I cannot guarantee my success rates. Please don\u2019t blame me if I waste many materials!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dong Fang smiled calmly. \u00a0\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem for our XuanTian Palace. \u00a0Is there anything else you need, Master Zhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cI\u2019m a bit different from other God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters. \u00a0Possibly due to my fairly young age, I enjoy a bit of liveliness. Quiet and secluded places like this don\u2019t really suit me. \u00a0I hope, Palace Master, that you can find another place in the XuanTian Palace for me to live in.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the two Elders behind Palace Master Dong Fang heard these words, their faces twitched uncontrollably. \u00a0<em>Fairly young age? \u00a0You jerk! You are barely twenty years old and already a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. \u00a0The rest of us are humiliated in comparison.</em></p><br/><p>Dong Fang nodded. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s fine, of course.\u201d \u00a0His tone suddenly sharpened as he murmured to the two Elders behind him, \u201cOn my orders, Master Zhou is now one of the Consecrated of our palace. \u00a0He is to be treated just like a Grand Elder, while his wife will be given the rank of Elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d both Elders said respectfully. \u00a0Fei Lun took out a tray out from his own Spatial Ring and presented it to Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0It had two sets of clothes on it.</p><br/><p>Dong Fang then nodded towards Zhou Weiqing once more. \u00a0\u201cTonight, I shall host a welcoming banquet in honor of Master Zhou joining our palace. \u00a0All of the important members of our palace shall take part in the welcoming ceremony. Master Zhou has been in seclusion for many years and might not be fully aware of the situation within the palace. \u00a0Elder Fei Lun, you are to stay behind and introduce the palace to Master Zhou. I have other matters to attend to. I\u2019ll depart for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d \u00a0A flicker of a smile flashed across Elder Fei Lun\u2019s face. \u00a0An opportunity to ingratiate himself with Master Zhou was clearly a wonderful assignment.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master Dong Fang turned and departed with the other Elder. \u00a0Zhou Weiqing played his role perfectly, bowing slightly as the Palace Master left. \u00a0Although he didn\u2019t say any flattering words, his actions indicated that he had accepted himself being a part of the XuanTian Palace.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing himself secretly felt rather amused. \u00a0He never would\u2019ve imagined that just like this, the first Great Saint Land he joined would actually be on a different continent.</p><br/><p>Fei Lun had long ago discarded the arrogance he had displayed when first meeting Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0Smiling, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t be offended, Master Zhou. This gorge is actually one of the most secluded and private places in the entire Palace. \u00a0Normally, only the other two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters are permitted to enter and exit this place freely, unless someone else gets a specific command from the Palace Master. \u00a0This is why the Palace Master only brought the two of us with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing let out a chuckle. \u00a0\u201cI understand. For the Palace Master to come in person is a testament to his sincerity. \u00a0Please be seated, Elder. I know nothing at all about XuanTian Palace. I\u2019ll have to trouble you to explain it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>A wide smile crossed Fei Lun\u2019s face as he said: \u201cIt would be my honor to do so.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

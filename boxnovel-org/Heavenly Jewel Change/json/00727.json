You, who have fused with the Blackfiend Dragon, had become a key force in the battles. Other things can be faked but you can\u2019t feign the Blackfiend Dragon Armor Set \u2013 an eleven-piece legendary armor set! On the Boundless Mainland, there\u2019s only one Heavenly Expanse Infinitum which can compare to it. That Palace Master Dongfang didn\u2019t have it on him, but you did. Is this still insufficient to prove your identity? I think, Meng Xing isn\u2019t your real name either. I may have lied to you, but I\u2019m really Zhou Weiqing. The truth is that both of us happen to be liars\u2026 so, it\u2019s now fair game, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s analysis, Meng Xing turned her head to look. She did not deny his words but only looked at him with a serious demeanor.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell me, at that time, why did you choose to save us? Those exaggerated abilities of yours, could they really stop the Dreadfiend Sea Naga?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stared at her with slight stubbornness, and said bitterly, \u201cDo you want to hear the truth or a lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d like to know the truth,\u201d Meng Xing said.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, and said, \u201cYou tell me your true name, and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was in a daze. She bit her lips gently, and said softly, \u201cI\u2019m Dongfang Hanyue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang Hanyue? That\u2019s a good name. It matches you.\u201d Zhou Weiqing complimented.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue said, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u201d Zhou Weiqing clarified</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue stared at him in shock, \u201cIs this the answer you\u2019re giving me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cThis is my honest answer. I don\u2019t know why I chose to save you guys either. To me, the most advantageous situation would be for both your people and the Dreadfiend Sea Naga to suffer from injuries. In times of danger, to use the Spatial Transportation Stone, that\u2019ll be my greatest chance. I\u2019m seventy percent confident that I\u2019m able to escape once I\u2019ve retrieved the Spatial Transportation Stone. You can regard me as a fool then. However, I won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon registering the four words \u201cI don\u2019t regret it\u201d uttered by Zhou Weiqing, the sternness and fury in Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes had melted. She stared at him, stupefied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get something to eat,\u201d Zhou Weiqing stood and walked toward the seaside. He needed to calm himself down as well. Thus, it was a situation which required him to make his second choice. Furthermore, it could very well be his last chance too.</p><br/><p>He was eighty percent sure that the Spatial Transportation Stone was with Dongfang Hanyue. \u2018She\u2019s the true ruler of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace!\u2019 he thought. On the abandoned island, she was so weak. Without hurting her, he would also be able to snatch the Spatial Transportation Stone from her so that he could return with Bing\u2019er, and his mission here would come to an end.</p><br/><p>However, could he really make such a decision? If he could, he would not have told Meng Xing so much.</p><br/><p>Reaching the seaside and allowing his feet to be immersed in the seawater, Zhou Weiqing expanded his senses. However, he discovered that in the vast ocean, he could not detect any life.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! I can\u2019t even have some seafood to stabilize my emotions. Where\u2019s your sense of humanity?\u201d Zhou Weiqing shouted at the sea with fury.</p><br/><p>Retreating a few steps, he squatted down on the beach helplessly and drew circles on the sand with his hands, \u201cLittle Fatty Zhou, you coward! Please be soft-hearted\u2026 Please be soft-hearted\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The circles had been drawn to a mess, but the helplessness still lingered on his face. For him to bully a gravely injured girl, more so a girl who treated him quite well, he could not do it \u2014 he simply could not! If the Mysterious Heavenly Palace treated him badly, and Dongfang Hanyue treated him just as badly, he would have made his move long ago. However, he still remembered clearly that when danger struck. she did not forget to protect him despite the odds they were in, even with the risk of her being injured.</p><br/><p>Standing up abruptly, Zhou Weiqing walked toward Dongfang Hanyue with big steps.</p><br/><p>Noticing his aggressiveness, Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s pretty face turned a shade paler. She subconsciously hugged her chest and her petite body retreated a few steps on the beach.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stopped directly in front of her.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue, like a kitten in shock, \u201cWhat, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lowered his head menacingly, and said, \u201cHand over the Spatial Transportation Stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes glinted with stubbornness, \u201cNo. Kill me if you want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t handing it over, fine,\u201d Zhou Weiqing let out a long sigh. A helpless smile could be seen on his face. He turned his body and proceed to lie down beside Dongfang Hanyue.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue was thrown into a daze again. One must know, that the moment Zhou Weiqing had urged for the Spatial Transportation Stone, her heart had leaped to her throat. However, this guy had only uttered that one sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you want?\u201d Dongfang Hanyue could not contain herself. She did not understand even the slightest of what the bastard was thinking of.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laid there, with his hands pillowing his head, and said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be such a waste for me to give up just like that without trying when I have such a good chance. I did ask, and it proves that I\u2019ve tried. I have no choice if you refuse to hand it over. So, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m a man, It isn\u2019t right for me to bully a vulnerable girl like you on an abandoned island. Hurry up and recover your cultivation. Once you\u2019ve recovered, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t you want the Spatial Transportation Stone anymore?\u201d Dongfang Hanyue asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed bitterly, \u201cOf course I want it; this is my mission. However, I\u2019ll come up with other plans. You better look after your precious item well. Don\u2019t let me take it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Dongfang Hanyue grunted. With great struggles, she supported her body up into a sitting position. She closed her eyes and started cultivating. The instant she sat up, a faint smile could be seen in the corner of her mouth. It was just that Zhou Weiqing, who had been lying down, could not see it.</p><br/><p>Sensing that the Dongfang Hanyue beside him had entered the state of cultivation, Zhou Weiqing laid there and stared at the sky in boredom. He chastised himself, \u201cLittle Fatty Zhou, you\u2019re too good of a person. If she wasn\u2019t a beauty, will you still act like this? No, you won\u2019t. You\u2019re a damned dirty-minded guy. Nevertheless, no matter what, I\u2019m still a genuine person, better than hypocrites, I guess. Ah, Beauty Hanyue, you\u2019ve disappointed me. You don\u2019t have to give me your body\u2026 shouldn\u2019t you have at least given me a kiss? I\u2019ve treated you so nicely. Would kill for you to be touched even the slightest bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was filled with such despicable thoughts, he sat himself up after Dongfang Hanyue had settled down. He moved behind her and placed both his palms on her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this to aid her recovery. I just intend to feel her attractive body figure,\u201d Little Fatty Zhou convinced himself internally. The next instant, a silverish white glow had engulfed the two individuals.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall be a good person to the core,\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue had not exaggerated her injuries. The meridians in her body not only had been gravely damaged, they were scattered too. If a normal person were to sustain these injuries, he would be dead, but she was a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse and was still able to hold herself together.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that her recovery could not be sped up, but things were different with Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Smooth Saint Energy was channeled into Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s body. Her petite body shivered momentarily. The warm energy being channeled into her body through a pair of large lukewarm hands was a unique sensation. Dongfang Hanyue only felt her petite body wobbling. Once the warm energy had entered her body, the disorganized energies in her meridians were easily assimilated.</p><br/><p>Along with the advancing of the warm energy, the damaged meridians were gradually being engulfed by the silverish white rays. There was no pain and Dongfang Hanyue only felt as if her body was being submerged in lukewarm water. It was indeed comfortable.</p><br/><p>She gave up her self-recovery, and without the slightest bit of alertness, she completely opened up her body to Zhou Weiqing, allowing his Saint Energy to flow freely within her.</p><br/><p>Slowly, in the comfortable setting, Dongfang Hanyue fell into a peaceful sleep. Ever since she bore the weight of the responsibilities of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master on her shoulders, she had not been sleeping too well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dumb f*ck, it shouldn\u2019t\u2019 be like this. I\u2019m not a good person,\u201d Sitting behind Dongfang Hanyue, Zhou Weiqing was puzzled. \u2018Won\u2019t she be worried if I did something to her in times like this? Even if he had hidden the Spatial Transportation Stone, she can\u2019t be like this. Isn\u2019t she aware of the great damages to a man when he is being exposed to a girl\u2019s vulnerability? I can\u2019t let it affect me, I can\u2019t\u2019 he thought.</p><br/><p>Nightfall then enveloped the island and brought about darkness and silence.</p><br/><p>A bonfire became the island\u2019s only source of light. Zhou Weiqing sat beside the bonfire, roasting dry food.</p><br/><p>The Sumeru Ring had been returned to him. The food and water in there were not of a small amount. Therefore, he did not have to starve even if there was no seafood for him.</p><br/><p>There were occasional crackling sounds of fire. Dry food may be simple, but its taste after being roasted was not bad either.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing restrained himself from directing his gaze to the other side of the bonfire. Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s pretty features were like an apple, too alluring under the illumination of the bonfire.</p><br/><p>No matter how much dirty thoughts Zhou Weiqing had, he could not overcome the pressure of his principles and conscience. It was definitely not a good feeling.</p><br/><p>While he was healing Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s meridians, he had wanted to go. However, upon realizing the possibilities of another Dreadfiend Sea Naga being around, he could not just leave Dongfang Hanyue behind to go by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall wait for her to wake up I do anything,\u201d he decided. It had been a long time since he lost control of himself. However, Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to admit that his mission here was no longer within his control.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

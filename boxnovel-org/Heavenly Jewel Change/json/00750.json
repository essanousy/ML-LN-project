This especially occurred to the warriors who originally belonged to the Heavenly Bow Empire, they had been waiting for this day for far too long.</p><br/><p>Three thousand of them floated into the sky taking advantage of the night sky. Under the cover of the night, they took the lead by flying towards the Kalise and Bai Da union army who had been stationed near the Heavenly Bow City. Among the 10,000 elite in the Peerless Regiment, the Peerless Archers occupied five thousand of them. Zhou Weiqing took two thousand with him while the remaining 3,000 had been gathered by Ming Yu since the beginning.</p><br/><p>Ever since the Heavenly Bow army was recovered, the Peerless Archers had not really showcased their flying skills in combat. The reason being that they wanted it to be their ultimate weapon to defeat their enemies in the last battle. Three thousand of them arrived thousands of meters up in the sky quickly, taking advantage of the cover of night. Night time aside, even if it was during the day, it was difficult to notice their presence if one was not looking intentionally.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu then released his second order. \u201cFirst, second, third, fourth and fifth Strongbow Battalion get ready. Peerless Heavy Cavalry and Snow Deer Cavalry set out. First and second calvary teams move forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had gotten many epiphanies from Zhou Weiqing. For the Heavenly Bow Empire army, he wanted the real elite army. Although it was impossible for him to train an army like the Peerless Regiment, with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s full financial support as well as the material supports from the Fei Li and Zhongtian Empire, one could say that the Heavenly Bow Empire Field Army Group was all set.</p><br/><p>The Strongbow Battalion was not so simple that they were only equipped with ordinary longbows. They were fully equipped with actual strongbows made from Purple Dawn Wood. Besides, every Strongbow Archer would be equipped with a crossbow as well. As soon as they went into combat, their fingers would always be on the trigger. Regardless if it was for defense or to kill enemies, this would increase the archers\u2019 battle ability tremendously. The Strongbow Archers\u2019 were equipped with leather armor for defenses. Although such defenses meant nothing on the battlefield, it would be an entirely different concept if it were combined with the Heavy Infantry and Cavalry.</p><br/><p>In the Heavenly Bow Empire, archers were what they were lacked the least. It was the Heavenly Bow Empire after all! Therefore, among the 10 or so regiments, Ming Yu intentionally picked out five thousand of them and formed five Strongbow Battalions. Apart from these, there were exactly five regiments of archers which occupied almost a third of the army\u2019s forces while the rest were made up of none other than the elite armies.</p><br/><p>There were no Light Infantries in the Heavenly Bow Empire. There was only one type of infantry; the Heavy Infantry. Moreover, their Heavy Infantry was equipped with horses to increase their movement speed on the battlefield. The only thing was that they were trained differently from the Heavy Cavalry and their horses did not have armor on them. The Light and Heavy Cavalry were Ming Yu\u2019s champions. With the leadership of the Peerless Regiment, it was not difficult to develop and train an army. Of course, sufficient resources were of utmost importance or it would have been impossible for Ming Su to develop such a strong army in such a short period of time.</p><br/><p>All of the armies in the Heavenly Bow Empire were up and running. They were moving forward, following Ming Yu\u2019s arrangement. Although their morale was at its peak, none of them dared to leave the team out of impulse. That was what the military discipline meant. Three thousand of them arrived at their destination slowly by air with Ming Yu holding his head up high, looking far away all the time.</p><br/><p>The Kalise and Bai Da union army had woken up ever since they detected movement in the city. Their commander was not an idiot, if something was happening in the Royal Palace of the Heavenly Bow Empire, it would most probably mean that the Heavenly Bow Empire was in action. The commander woke up the rest that was resting in the camp and got them to reform their team.</p><br/><p>However, the effort did not work out. Moreover, nobody expected the attack from the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s to come so quickly. It had been some time since the threat was sent and the Heavenly Bow Empire Field Army Group had been very quiet. Everything came without any warning. A massive amount of black items fell from the sky. Soon, there were intermittent screams in the Kalise and Bai Da union army camp.</p><br/><p>The ear-piercing noise of things getting crushed broke the camp\u2019s peace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that! It broke into my tent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crushing noises were heard from time to time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat smells pungent, why does it smell like kerosene? That\u2019s not right, run quick.\u201d Finally, a smart person could at least determine what the black items were.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, as the black items fell from the sky, a large number of flares sparked. Naturally, the Kalise and Bai Da union army had scouts with them. They would have discovered the Heavenly Bow Empire Field Army Group if they approached the camp since the beginning. However, the attack came from above. No matter how elite the scouts were, it was impossible for them to have their eyes in the sky at all times!</p><br/><p>Three thousand flaming arrows came from above. They did not have to aim as long as they were shot in the directions where they tossed the kerosene bottles. Three thousand Peerless warriors brought four bottles of kerosene each, tossing them into the sky and so they were scattered around. They targeted the tents and places that were easily burned.</p><br/><p>Kerosene was inflammable itself and over the span of ten breaths after the fire arrows were fired from above, the entire Kalise and Bai Da union army camp were covered in flames.</p><br/><p>It was a camp of more than ten thousand soldiers! The Star Forest was not that big. In order for them to be able to protect Heavenly Bow City, their camp was built close to one another and each tent had many soldiers in them. The unexpected fire that came out of nowhere felt like it managed to light the entire camp into flames all at the same time. At that moment, the soldiers received their instruction and got up to prepare themselves to regroup. However, everything was too late.</p><br/><p>Humans were afraid of death. The huge fire that came out of nowhere caused the soldiers who were sleepy to be panicked. Furthermore, they were no elite armies. The Bai Da Empire soldiers were slightly better while the Kalise Empire\u2019s soldiers were all in a panic. Sudden, screaming was heard all over the camp. People were being stepped on and burned; the entire camp was in a mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them!!\u201d Ming Yu said with a cold tone. Then, the same voice spread all over the regiment.</p><br/><p>They had been waiting for this day for way too long. Ming Yu had at least three complete plans for this round of combat. God knew how many times he had gotten the Peerless Airforce to spy on the condition of their enemies.</p><br/><p>As the saying went \u2018fire and flood has no mercy\u2019, the fire attack was just too sudden to the Kalise and Bai Da union army. The raging fire made them lose faith as an army. Under such circumstance, how could they defend the Heavenly Bow Field Army Group whose morale was soaring? Although the Heavenly Bow Field Army Group\u2019s vanguards had arrived within the range of the enemy scouts, they were shocked as well. The camp at the back was burning out of nowhere, would that piece of information be useful when it was sent back?</p><br/><p>Some of them returned while most of the scouts chose to escape. At least they could still find means they could use to escape. The team that first reached the frontline was the Peerless Heavy Cavalry. Aside from the one thousand Heavy Cavalries that Zhou Weiqing brought with him, there were still three thousand Heavy Cavalries that were made up of the Berserker and Gold Crow Tribe as well as the 500 Snow Deer Cavalry.</p><br/><p>The Snow Deer Cavalry had equipment was no different from those of the Peerless Heavy Cavalry aside from their mounts and weapons. Naturally, the Snow Deer Cavalry were riding on a huge snow deer which was much bigger than the Ghost Demon Horse while they used a kind of heavy deer horn as weapons. The Snow Deer Cavalry could be ranked among the top three in the entire Wan Shou Empire so one could imagine how powerful they were. The Peerless Cavalry had competed with one another in the past and they needed at least two Peerless Cavalry to go against one Snow Deer Cavalry. Perhaps, the gap between them would not be so big if we were talking purely about strength. However, when it comes to battle technique, the Snow Deer Cavalry were far superior to the Peerless Cavalry.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the 3,500 Heavy Cavalry stood in a line on the battlefield and marched forward slowly. There were approximately five meters of distance between two Heavy Cavalries. These gaps were not empty as they were filled with five Heavy Infantries between them. After the five Heavy Infantries were five Strongbow Battalion archers.</p><br/><p>The Kalise camp was in a mess and the Peerless soldiers began to push them back with full force. The Kalise army aside, it was difficult for the Bai Da army to form proper teams. Even if they managed to form a group under normal circumstance, could they fight an army like the one from the Heavenly Bow Empire?</p><br/><p>Massive amounts of soldiers could be seen running out of the camp continuously. Suddenly, a striking whistle was heard. The Strongbow Battalion warriors and the Peerless archers in the air launched the actual killing blow. It was the perfect combination; an air-land lockdown where arrows would be shot the moment people appeared. Perhaps the officials of the Kalise and Bai Da union army could not imagine that Ming Yu would only send the forces of three regiments to the frontline. Of course, the three regiments were made up of the most elite soldiers in the entire Heavenly Bow Field Army Group.</p><br/><p>These aside, all Light and Heavy Cavalries as well as archers, had been divided into two groups since the beginning before they launched an attack and flanked the enemy from both sides. They were all equipped with horses and among them, the Heavy Cavalry had traveled further away last night by taking advantage of the cover of night. Ming Yu\u2019s intention was obvious. He did not only want to win the battle, he also wanted to kill all of the enemies to achieve the ultimate victory.</p><br/><p>In actual fact, there was no suspense in this battle from the moment the Kalise and Bai Da union army\u2019s camp caught fire. The conclusion was set the moment the Kalise and Bai Da union army, with close to 200,000 soldiers got surrounded by the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s 150,000 armies.</p><br/><p>In Heavenly Bow City, before the palace\u2019s main hall. The fellow people of Heavenly Bow Empire who were bathed in Divine Energy were waking up from being sealed one after the other. The warm Divine Energy moisturized their bodies, giving them an indescribable comfort. When they opened their eyes, they were surprised to find out that they were covered in a brilliant, golden light. As the golden light was too strong, they could not see what was outside clearly.</p><br/><p>The years were nothing but a dream to them. A moment ago, they had just seen Admiral Zhou using the Fate Denying Seal, disregarding its cost. After a long, deep sleep, it felt like they had just woken up after a short while. Di Feng Ling looked around like he was slightly lost and was not able to even utter a word at that time while he watched his ministers who were recovering their abilities to move one after the other. His state of mind was the same as the time when Admiral Zhou was determined to release the Fate Denying Seal. He mumbled to himself as pain and grief grew in him, \u201cIt\u2019s me who is useless, Admiral\u2026 brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling then looked for Admiral Zhou by instinct but all he could see around him was a golden light.</p><br/><p>Ling Zihan had just woken up and surprised to see the golden brilliance around.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that we\u2019ve arrived in heaven? This can\u2019t be hell. Shuiniu, Shuiniu where are you?\u201d Ling Zihan was almost screaming out her last sense. Recalling that her husband chose to use the Fate Denying Seal as the last straw to save the empire, the tears in Ling Zihan\u2019s eyes poured down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-law, please calm down. Something\u2019s not right! Di Feng Ling held Ling Zihan who almost fell down from attempting to look for Admiral Zhou.</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling was emperor of the time. Naturally, he was much calmer than ordinary people. He pinched himself hard earlier, the intense pain told him that he was still alive. Although they were surrounded by golden brilliance, it was still his palace when he turned around! Suddenly, the golden brilliance around him dimmed, revealing the dark night sky. The ministers of the Heavenly Bow Empire looked at the sky together and saw the goddess-like Tian\u2019er in a white, long dress.</p><br/><p>Silver hair, purple eyes with a golden sparkle shining brightly within. Could she really be a goddess sent from heaven? Besides, the striking golden brilliance was fading towards her direction. The Heavenly Bow Empire ministers were stunned. Was it her who saved us? The ministers aside, even Di Feng Ling almost wanted to kneel as he felt the rich Divine energy that was emitting from Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a deep voice was heard, \u201cDon\u2019t kneel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colorful lights were shining in the sky, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya came to Tian\u2019er. He held her body as without any skill support, Tian\u2019er\u2019s cultivation base was not still insufficient to fly. One must know that the most powerful Heavenly Jewel Master in the Heavenly Bow Empire was Admiral Zhou. Admiral Zhou had just broken through Ninth Jewel Realm when he used the Fate Denying Seal. The Heavenly Bow Empire ministers had never seen any powerhouses who could fly so they were not sure if what they were seeing was good or bad.</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling was quite calm as he saw Admiral Zhou on his second glance. However, Admiral Zhou seemed like he was being held by somebody right now. Moreover, there were bright lights sparkling everywhere. Naturally, that was not something that they could intervene.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, may I ask who are you?\u201d Di Feng Ling asked Long Shiya with respect. Naturally, Long Shiya did not allow them to kneel because of Tian\u2019er. How awkward would it be if she let her father-in-law and mother-in-law kneel for their daughter-in-law?</p><br/><p>Long Shiya chuckled as he pulled Tian\u2019er from the sky and landed in front of everybody.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared and there\u2019s nothing to worry about. I\u2019m that bastard Zhou Weiqing\u2019s teacher. I\u2019m here to save the Heavenly Bow Empire with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>A simple sentence from Long Shiya got Di Feng Ling all stunned and his body was shaking. Really, you guys are really here to save us?</p><br/><p>Ling Zhihan had her eyes opened wide while tears flushed out of her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, my Little Fatty. Where\u2019s my Little Fatty? Old sir, where\u2019s Weiqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya pointed to the sky, \u201cIsn\u2019t he there? He\u2019s saving his father now. You must be Weiqing\u2019s mother I guess, you\u2019ve given birth to a good son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya was old enough to be Ling Zhihan\u2019s grandfather. However, because of Zhou Weiqing, she could only treat him like someone from the same generation. Naturally, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had always done whatever he wanted so he did not think too much about it.</p><br/><p>Everyone was looking at the group of lights that were still shining in the sky. Ling Zhihan clenched her fist subconsciously and bit her lower lips. Those were two most important men in her life! Suddenly, the three people dashed toward them at a tremendous speed. Within several moments, they arrived at the people. Tian\u2019er\u2019s facial expression slightly changed when she saw the three people but she returned to normal soon after. Weren\u2019t those three who dashed here the Shangguan Triplets? Ling Zhihan was stunned to see the Shangguan Triplets. She knew of Shangguan Bing\u2019er but how could she not be shocked to see three Shangguan Bing\u2019er appearing all at once?</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded to her two sisters and bowed with respect.</p><br/><p>\u201cPleasure to meet you, your Majesty. A pleasure to meet you as well, aunty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling was stunned, Shangguan Bing\u2019er was the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s hope! How could the three of them who looked exactly the same come out of nowhere?</p><br/><p>Ling Zhihan looked at one of them and proceeded to another, she could not find the difference between the three of them. Shangguan Bing\u2019er then said immediately, \u201cAunt, I\u2019m Bing\u2019er. These two are my sisters, Shangguan Bing\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh, great. Good girls. How long has it been!\u201d Ling Zihan asked what was on Di Feng Ling\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er let out a soft sigh, \u201cYour Majesty, aunty, it had been almost three years since the Heavenly Bow Empire was attacked. All of you had been sealed in the Fate Denying Seal. With Weiqing\u2019s leadership, we\u2019ve finally accumulated sufficient force to launch a counterattack against the Heavenly Bow Empire. Our Field Army Group has attacked the Heavenly Bow Empire and I believe that victory will be upon us soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat.. what you\u2019re saying is real?\u201d Di Feng Ling looked at Shangguan Bing\u2019er in excitement. He could not believe everything was real. He was a despaired overthrown monarch just a moment ago!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded in all seriousness and said, \u201cIt\u2019s real, it\u2019ll be proven to you soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the bright sparkling light descended slowly and landed before the people. Suddenly, all of the chatter stopped as everyone had their eyes on the light. The light faded away and Zhou Weiqing let go of his arms that were holding onto his father. He had excitement in him as he stood back slowly. He had done everything that he could, everything depended on what they were witnessing whether his father could keep his life or not.</p><br/><p>As the light faded and revealing Admiral Zhou\u2019s body slowly, the muscles of his majestic face twitched.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

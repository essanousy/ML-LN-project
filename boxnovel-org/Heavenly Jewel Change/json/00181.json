(2)</b></p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head without hesitation, his gaze not leaving Tian\u2019er\u2019s face. \u201cI believe in Tian\u2019er. Besides myself, Tian\u2019er will never fall for anyone else. If anyone can evoke her memories, it will only be me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian gave him a long searching look before turning back to Gu Yingbing. \u201cYingbing, this is your last chance. Although I know that you were originally Tian\u2019er\u2019s fiance and all of today\u2019s tests may seem unfair to you\u2026 I have no choice but to admit that some of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words had been right earlier. I have not been a good father, and I have never really thought of her interests deep enough. As such, this time, in the final choice, I want to leave the choice to her. I do not want her to suffer for the rest of her life. Do you know? This time, Tian\u2019er had already made the preparation to marry you in order to cement to alliance between the relationship between the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Lion Tribe\u2026 and then she would leave us forever... permanently. This is not something I wish to see. If today you can move Tian\u2019er with your words and get her to choose you, then I will not unSeal her memories, and let her be your wife like this. Otherwise, Master can only say sorry to you. I hope you can understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing saw the hint of apology in Xue AoTian\u2019s eyes, and nodded gravely. \u201cMaster, I can understand your feelings. I will do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian nodded and said: \u201cAlright, let us begin then. I will give you five minutes first.\u201d As he said that, Xue AoTian raised his right hand, and a layer of faint gold light spread out, enveloping the family of three along with Gu Yingbing.</p><br/><p>On the outside, Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya could not hear anything, but they could still clearly see what was going on inside.</p><br/><p>Five minutes. The last five minutes that would decide if he could spend the rest of his life with his love. In that instant, Gu Yingbing\u2019s forehead was filled with sweat. Even when he had torn off his own arm earlier, he did not have such an expression, his eyes filled with hope, yet more unease and anxiety.</p><br/><p>Taking a small step forward, Gu Yingbing knelt before Tian\u2019er on a single knee. Right at that moment, Xue AoTian also released his spiritual control over Tian\u2019er, allowing her to resume consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, it is me. I am your Big Bro Gu!\u201d Gu Yingbing said softly.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er looked vacantly at Gu Yingbing. Currently, her heart was at a loss, with most of her memory vanished. She only had the memory of everything before five years old, as well as her base instincts.</p><br/><p>Originally, Xue AoTian had already set his resolve to allow Tian\u2019er to marry Zhou Weiqing. However, when he saw Gu Yingbing tear off his own arm, it had affected him greatly. After all, Gu Yingbing was the disciple that he had raised all these years, and his actions proved that he truly loved Tian\u2019er. Who was to say that Yingbing could not bring happiness to Tian\u2019er? At least, he was not such a \u2018playboy\u2019 like Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>As such, Xue AoTian had decided to leave Tian\u2019er with a five year old memory. This also meant that she would know who Gu Yingbing was, but not who Zhou Weiqing was. Without question, this gave Gu Yingbing an obvious advantage.</p><br/><p>Towards her husband\u2019s decision, the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia did not say anything, allowing him to do as he wished.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro Gu.\u201d A tender voice rang out from Tian\u2019er, sounding so moving and sweet to Gu Yingbing\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing was overjoyed, moving forward slightly in excitement. \u201cTian\u2019er, it is me! I am your Big Bro Gu! Big Bro Gu loves you so much, do you remember? I brought you to catch those little snow wolves, you were so scared then, just not long ago. You promised Big Bro Gu that when you grow old, you will become Big Bro Gu\u2019s wife. You won\u2019t go back on your word right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er looked absently at Gu Yingbing. \u201cBecome Big Bro Gu\u2019s wife? But\u2026 Big Bro Gu, why have you become so old?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing started. Even Xue AoTian was helplessly left not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Indeed, he had only left his daughter with her memory of five years. However, that also meant that she had regressed to a mental age of five.</p><br/><p>Now\u2026 at thirty years old, how could Gu Yingbing possibly looks like when he was fifteen?</p><br/><p>After a dazed moment, Gu Yingbing quickly said: \u201cBecause Big Bro Gu and Tian\u2019er have both grown up!</p><br/><p>\u201cPapa, I am a bit scared. Big Bro Gu\u2026 he seems to have changed.\u201d Tian\u2019er muttered.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian gently stroked his daughter\u2019s hair. In that instant, he seemed to see the precious young daughter who had also stuck by his side, unwilling to part from him. Every time he entered closed door cultivation, she would pout and stare at him unwillingly. In that moment, his heart was filled with love and tenderness.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, then do you like your Big Bro Gu? Big Bro Gu treats you so well, will you be his wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like Big Bro Gu.\u201d Tian\u2019er said without hesitation. \u201cBig Bro Gu always protects me, so I like him!\u201d Hearing her words, tears streamed down Gu Yingbing\u2019s face in joy. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 right? Let me always protect you forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er blinked innocently. \u201cBut\u2026 liking Big Bro Gu means I have to marry Big Bro Gu? Papa, I do not understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing froze, the hope that had suddenly blazed in his heart crushed in such a massively heavy blow. He could only stare at Tian\u2019er dazedly. For a while, he did not know what to say. Currently, she was just like a little girl, and no matter what he said, she would not leave her father\u2019s arms to enter his.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was watching from outside the shield of light. The expression on his face was calm and confident, but in truth, his hands were gripped tightly in fists. In this final moment, how could he not be nervous? No matter how much confidence he had, how could it be absolute?</p><br/><p>Although he saw that Tian\u2019er was speaking, and that Gu Yingbing\u2019s expression grew more flurried and anxious, Zhou Weiqing did not grow relaxed at all.</p><br/><p><i>Five minutes, why did it seem so slow!</i></p><br/><p>It was as if an entire century had passed before Gu Yingbing finally seemed to be unable to control himself, standing up and moving right in front of Tian\u2019er, pouring out his heart. Alas for him, almost at the same time, the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia, who had been standing beside Xue AoTian, suddenly gave a soft sigh, clapping her husband\u2019s shoulder. The five minutes was now up.</p><br/><p>The gold light vanished, and Gu Yingbing was still standing there crying out anxiously: \u201cTian\u2019er, I am your Big Bro Gu who will protect you forever! Why won\u2019t you marry me? Big Bro Gu won\u2019t force you, let me hug you please? Just like when we were young.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Tian\u2019er seemed to be in a fright, refusing to leave her father\u2019s arms as she clung tight to him, not even looking at Gu Yingbing.</p><br/><p>At this point, the Lion King Gu Site\u2019s face was ashen. Looking at his son, he sighed and said softly: \u201cFoolish child, you were too anxious and impatient. Even if you had a chance, you have thrown it away now.\u201d As the saying goes, \u2018a bystander sees things with a clear mind\u2019. Seeing his son\u2019s anxious and flurried look, and looking at Tian\u2019er who had lost most of her memory and was in a fragile state. Being pressed like that, how could she not be afraid?</p><br/><p>\u201cYingbing, enough. If Zhou Weiqing does not gain Tian\u2019er\u2019s approval, you will have a second chance later.\u201d Xue AoTian sighed, trying to comfort him.</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing\u2019s body swayed, his face paling suddenly. With a *Wah* sound, he suddenly vomited out a mouthful of blood as he staggered back a few steps. He suddenly felt like Tian\u2019er was leaving him further and further. If not for the Tiger King Xue Aoying quickly stepping forward to support him, he would have fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian turned his gaze to Zhou Weiqing. To be honest, he did not wish to see this sight, the precious disciple that he had raised and groomed with all his effort, now taking such a huge blow from his daughter. Worse still, he might not be able to get back up from this setback. All of this was because of this young man in front of him, Zhou Weiqing. No matter how outstanding and talented he was, how could he easily replace Gu Yingbing in Xue AoTian\u2019s heart, whom he had raised since young! As such, Xue AoTian\u2019s heart was truly complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is your turn.\u201d Xue AoTian said calmly to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, moving to five yards from Tian\u2019er before he stopped. At this moment, his fists unclenched again, as he gazed tenderly at her.</p><br/><p>Unlike Gu Yingbing, he did not seem agitated at all. On the contrary, he just stood there, staring at Tian\u2019er calmly. Currently, Zhou Weiqing had already changed to a fresh new set of clothes, and he had reined in all his Heavenly Energy, not a hint of aura leaking out. He just stood there simply, looking at Tian\u2019er, his gaze tender and clearly filled with love.</p><br/><p>Originally hiding in her father\u2019s embrace, Tian\u2019er seemed to sense something, and she slowly lifted her head to look at Zhou Weiqing. In that instant when her gaze finally met his, her entire body trembled slightly. Although she still seemed puzzled and confused, her heart had somehow started racing. This strange looking person in front of her, whom she had no memory of, was somehow tugging at her heartstrings.</p><br/><p>At the beginning, her gaze was trying to escape, until it slowly turned dull and sluggish. Tian\u2019er just continued staring back at Zhou Weiqing, as if trying very hard to remember something, yet just being unable to do so. Slowly, a pained expression crossed her beautiful features.</p><br/><p>\u201cFat Cat.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said softly.</p><br/><p>In that instant, amongst the entire group gathered there, four people froze at once.</p><br/><p>As everyone knew, tigers were part of the cat family, perhaps the strongest amongst the cat family. Amongst the entire group, four of them were tigers! Besides Tian\u2019er, the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian, the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia, and the Tiger King Xue Aoying, weren\u2019t they all of a Tiger bloodline? With that single phrase \u2018Fat Cat\u2019, the three of them almost vomited blood out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

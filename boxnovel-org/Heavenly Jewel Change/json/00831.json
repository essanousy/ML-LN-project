Why was it necessary for you to ask me that?\u201d Yun Ruoyun chuckled softly as she laughed in a light-hearted manner similar to the clouds and the wind.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun laughed, \u201cRuoyun, I want to kiss you\u2026 Is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Ruoyun laughed again and slowly raised her head. Her red lips met his, as she muttered, \u201cI still remember how you looked the first time you kissed me. I love you, Xingyun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Huang Xingyun slowly lowered his head, and crystal clear teardrops flowed out from the Saint Land Lord\u2019s eyes uncontrollably. Yes, he regretted all this; he regretted his foolishness. It was at this moment that he suddenly realized. Compared to his wife, what else was he able to gain from his power and wild ambition?</p><br/><p>When the four parts of their lips met one another, they felt the other\u2019s warmth and breath once again, as well as that unwilling tremble to part with each other.</p><br/><p>Boom.</p><br/><p>A terrifying growl that felt like the entire mainland was about to be crushed was accompanied by a distorted halo. It was then that it was unleashed on the peak of Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>This was the end of his wild ambition, but also the end of an undying relationship at the same time. Perhaps, Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyun\u2019s wild ambition caused the death of countless lives, as they were the devils that affected the entire Boundless Mainland.</p><br/><p>However, this did not affect their passionate, unchangeable love; the kind that only death would do part. In this aspect, Zhou Weiqing could only turn red with shame when he compared himself to them.</p><br/><p>The space that surrounded them became distorted along with the entire Heavenly Snow Mountain. Within that distortion, the enormous peak of the mountain that towered thousands of meters high unraveled quietly. There was neither explosion nor growl that followed afterward. The enormous mountain peak gradually unraveled within that distorted glow and melted into nothingness.</p><br/><p>Before the brief moment of explosion, every single surviving powerhouse who had been on the Heavenly Snow Mountain were at least already fifty kilometers away. Yet, even as such, they could still feel a tremendous gush of a thrusting force pushing them continuously another fifty kilometers away.</p><br/><p>If it were not for the husband and wife\u2019s unwillingness to part, the spontaneous explosion of these Heavenly God-tier powerhouses would at least cause the loss of more than half the powerhouses\u2019 lives on the Heavenly Snow Mountain peak.</p><br/><p>Sentimental love \u2013 vanished. Yet similarly, someone was still benefiting from such a situation.</p><br/><p>When Fen Tian was worshipping the Nether Lord, the function of his Destruction Divine Territory had already changed. It bounded and detained everyone who possessed Destruction Energy. Because of that, the people from the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and the Peerless Sect were able to escape while the people from Love Valley and the Blood Red Hell were unable to leave.</p><br/><p>The Destruction God that Fen Tian summoned had already done its best to send these two powerhouses from the great Saint Lands into the skies during the brief moment of their self-detonation. Despite that, close to half of the people caught in the terrifying explosion were falling from the sky.</p><br/><p>Those two, great Saints Land powerhouses who were sent into the sky by Fen Tian, would naturally be destroyed by melting into his purplish-black balls of light. On the other hand, those who fell from the sky onto the mountain peak, and those who perished with the Heavenly Snow Mountain, had devoted their Heavenly Core Nuclei. In the sky, they entered the Astral Divine Territory and transformed into Feedback Energy.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain disappeared. Yes, the Heavenly Snow Mountain that towered a thousand miles into the skies disappeared in the midst of this heaven-shocking battle.</p><br/><p>With Xue Ao\u2019tian on the far side, his heart was filled with bitterness at this point. When he witnessed the appearance of so many Heavenly God-tier powerhouses earlier, he had already predicted the possibility of such a situation happening. Yet, now that he had witnessed the Saint Lands that had existed in the world for thousands of years vanish before his eyes just like that, one could only imagine the agony in his heart.</p><br/><p>At this point of the battle, one could say that the coalition of the Peerless Sect, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and the Heavenly Snow Mountain was a great success. Even after taking the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s who suffered the greatest loss into account, the loss of its manpower was still within an acceptable range. It was only that the Heavenly Snow Mountain would cease to exist from here on. On the other hand, aside from Fen Tian who was advancing his Destruction Energy wildly, their entire army on the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley\u2019s side had already been annihilated. After all, they had already sent out all their main forces for this great battle. At this moment, it could also be said that the two Saint Lands had already ceased to exist.</p><br/><p>Among the survivors, the only person who was found to be in even more agony than Xue Ao\u2019tian, was Fen Tian. Even after he had transformed into the Destruction God, his eyes were filled with an indescribable hate while he was encased in the purplish-black ball of light.</p><br/><p>Because Yun Ruoyun and his wife self-detonated, only the Demon God and Destruction God remained in the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s sky at this moment. They were suspended in the midst of the sky and were not influenced by the explosion. Instead, the light that was glowing on their bodies gradually grew stronger.</p><br/><p>The gorgeous starlight that surrounded Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was continuously changing. The initial platinum and golden colors also went through gradual changes. The golden starlight was quietly disappearing into Star Feedback. Meanwhile, only a platinum-colored radiance remained around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Even the Astral Divine Territory in the sky turned into the same dazzling radiance as well.</p><br/><p>The amount of Star Feedback this time was truly too immense; a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse\u2019s Star Feedback was even more intense than all the Star Feedbacks Zhou Weiqing used in the past. Moreover, so many powerhouses had passed on during the battle. Aside from the self-detonation of their Heavenly Core Nuclei by Huang Xingyun and his wife, a majority of the Heavenly Core Nuclei from the deceased powerhouses were involved in this Star Feedback.</p><br/><p>Streaks upon streaks of pure Creation Saint Energy merged with his body, yet Zhou Weiqing\u2019s felt an unusual and peculiar sensation. It was not the feeling of expansion that he felt when he was about to achieve a breakthrough in the past. At that very moment, he could only feel a gush of clear energy rise from within his body, as it rose slowly. It was a marvelous process of attaining a higher level. It felt as if he was separating himself from the original world, and subsequently setting foot into another.</p><br/><p>The impure energy was continuously separated from within his body, and the impurities within his Saint Energy was also melting at an incomparable speed. Streaks of minute spatial fissures were continuously appearing around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>If this was in the past, Zhou Weiqing would certainly assume that this was a spatial tear caused by a violent energy fluctuation. However, he did not think that this was the case at this moment. He could clearly sense that there was a tiny space within each tear, and these little spaces were all created by the Saint Energy emanating from his body.</p><br/><p>A clear comprehension appeared in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart. Creation, creation, is this Creation Energy? In his eyes, it was as if he could everlasting eternity. Countless chaotic yet, realistic fragments of images continuously flashed through his mind.</p><br/><p>The Demon God crumbled without a sound. In midair, only Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body remained. His entire body had now completely taken on a platinum color. His ten fingers continuously pulsed in a rhythmic manner and each time his fingers pulsed, minute fissures appeared on his palms while accompanied various attributes. Among them, the attributes that appeared the most were the Time, Evil, Divine and Spirit Attributes.</p><br/><p>These were the four great Saint Attributes of the world right now, and they had manifested around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. As this happened, the peculiar energy fluctuations grew more powerful as well.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment when a spatial fissure appeared around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body without a sign. A female silhouette gently and gracefully took a step forward as she probed with her palm and held onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand. Next to her, were four peculiar energy fluctuations that glimmered in a similar manner.</p><br/><p>It was Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Saint Energy was initially formed from the dual-cultivation of Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er. However, just as Zhou Weiqing was about to enter another realm, just as he was about to attain an even purer version of Saint Energy, the Saint Energy sensed Tian\u2019er\u2019s presence. After all, it was jointly created by Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er. Without Tian\u2019er, how could Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy be complete?</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing held Tian\u2019er\u2019s hand, the buoyant Saint Energy in his body suddenly surged forward and engulfed Tian\u2019er body. What puzzled Zhou Weiqing even more was the Saint Energy inside Tian\u2019er body that turned as pure as his in a flash. The energy from the four great Saint Attributes around their bodies merged instantly. At this moment, they seemed like conjoined twins, and there was no longer a distinction between one and the other.</p><br/><p>The platinum-colored halo grew more and more intense. The Astral Divine Territory above their heads was also continuously growing. The Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core within their bodies began to undergo some changes as layer after layer of the halo around the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core, was stripped from it. Soon, the original Saint Nucleus Core transformed into human form after the layers were stripped from it. Yes, it was in the form of a human. A human replica that was the exact replica of Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Its entire body was a platinum color, and within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest was a tiny figure of a human with the exact appearance as himself. Similarly, it was alive; a life that was completely connected to Zhou Weiqing. A life that was created from Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>This was the Saint God Nucleus Core. This was the evolution of Saint Energy. The Saint God Nucleus Core that evolved from the Saint Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>At that point, the Saint God Nucleus Core had completely taken form. A dazzling brilliance erupted from Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s bodies as the starlight that initially surrounded their bodies disappeared. They were both like enormous stars as the dazzling radiance erupted from within them. The thick, platinum-color brightened the entire sky. The Destruction Divine Territory that initially shrouded the area dissipated almost instantly the moment it encountered this brilliance.</p><br/><p>Only an enormous purplish-black colored ball of light remained suspended in mid-air. Even then, layers of thick, the intense ball of light continued to ascend, forming layers of intense energy halos.</p><br/><p>The powerhouses of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, Peerless Sect, and Heavenly Snow Mountain had already flown back. A few hundred li\u2019s <sup>1 </sup> would not pose them any trouble. However, at this exact moment, no one dared to approach the area. It was clear that the battle Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian was significantly more terrifying than the battle Huang Xingyun and his wife were involved in earlier.</p><br/><p>On the ground where the Heavenly Snow Mountain was initially at, was an eerily deep cave with a diameter of over three hundred meters. There was no way to tell how deep the cave was, as it stretched as far as one\u2019s eyes could see, but its depth was enough to send a chill down anyone\u2019s spine.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian, Shangguan Tianyang, Shangguan Tianyue, Long Shiya, Wu Yunyue, Dongfang Hanyue and also Zhou Weiqing\u2019s soulmates had all gathered together; they were witnessing the battle before their eyes anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this young lad to emerge as the strongest one after all. If he\u2019s capable of defeating Fen Tian in this battle\u2026 Brother Xue, I\u2019m afraid your reputation as the best in the world will need to be passed on to him.\u201d Shangguan Tianyang exclaimed with a soft sigh.</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"933422af-dccd-6f8d-025c-ff18b35e7219\">A unit of measure, two li\u2019s = 1 kilometer</li></ol><br/>\n</div>"}

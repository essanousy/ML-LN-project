At that very moment, all she could think of was it was the Spatial Law. Yes, only one who had mastered the Spatial Law could do what Zhou Weiqing just did. It was clear that the old tree was the entrance to the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land. The entrance did not avoid them when they arrived earlier. However, it was time for it to randomly move.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing brought the five women to look for it again. It seemed easy but in reality, it was extremely difficult. There was only one way to find the exact location of the spatial transporter. It was to utilize Spatial Law and feel the spatial waves from an exact location within the area. It was an exclusive skill of a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse who possessed the Spatial Attribute.</p><br/><p>There was only one known Heavenly God-tier powerhouse currently on the Boundless Mainland, and that was the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain, Xue Ao\u2019Tian. However, the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain did not possess the Spatial Attribute. If Zhou Weiqing boasted that he was comparable to a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse, Shangguang Xue\u2019er would have doubted him. However, she would believe him now. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s abilities had indeed surpassed her expectation.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing was clueless about the changes in the women\u2019s thoughts. He slowly approached the tree and touched it with his hand in a testing manner. Suddenly, an intense aura of rejection burst out. Even with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength and cultivation base, his hand still recoiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is a Heavenly God-tier energy wave,\u2019 Zhou Weiqing almost said that out loud. Nevertheless, it was merely a Heavenly God-tier energy wave. It was not that Zhou Weiqing could not destroy it if he wanted to. However, it would cause a significant damage to the entire Sealed Land\u2019s parallel.</p><br/><p>The five women stood in a semicircle behind Zhou Weiqing. Shangguan Xue\u2019er said, \u201cWithout the Natural Energy, it\u2019s impossible to enter the Sealed Land. There must be a perfect combination of Water, Fire, Earth, Wind, Light, and Darkness Attributes to create a bizarre energy wave that was sufficiently balanced enough to enter the Sealed Land.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cWhy do I feel like you\u2019re talking about teacher\u2019s Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation! Doesn\u2019t teacher have the six attributes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before leaving the Heavenly Bow Empire, Zhou Weiqing had made arrangements for many matters. Now that the Heavenly Demon Sect had become the Peerless Sect, Ming Yu naturally decided to stay. It was not his call to leave. To keep his words, Zhou Weiqing would not bother Long Shiya if it was not urgent.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said, \u201cPerhaps even Sir Long might not be able to enter. The unique wave that\u2019s made out of the six attributes must be aligned with the interior of the Sealed Land. Moreover, the wave is ever changing. We have all the six attributes between the six of us, let\u2019s just try our luck and experiment with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not that troublesome. Just watch your husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing waved his right hand and enveloped the six of them in rich reddish-gold Nebula Saint Energy. With the Nebula Saint Energy, they levitated off the ground and hovered an inch above the ground. From far, the six of them looked like a big, reddish gold light sphere. Zhou Weiqing controlled the big light sphere and headed towards the Sealed Land\u2019s entrance slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work\u2026\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er was shocked. Just when she thought Zhou Weiqing was going to enter by force with the help of Nebula Saint Energy, something bizarre happened. The tree that was made of energy did not reject the Nebula Saint Energy\u2019s reddish-gold glow. The surroundings became distorted suddenly, followed by a green light that covered the outside of the Nebula Saint Energy. As the glow blinked, they appeared in another place in the next second.</p><br/><p>It was a place that looked like a dream. The five of them had appeared on a hill so they could see far away. The sky was blue. It was so clear that it was flawless. There were no paths here. The only thing available were some strange plants. The shortest tree was over 30 meters in height. It was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first time seeing so many different types of trees. If the forest earlier was filled with Life aura, then this was an ocean of Life aura.</p><br/><p>The most breathtaking thing was the oval quiet and little lake that was a few hundred meters ahead of them. Even though it was a few hundred meters away, they could see how clear the lake was. It was like the highest grade of a blue precious stone was mounted there. As the sun shined on it, it would reflect the light, and in turn, creating a water wave halo on the mountain that was on the other side. What they were looking at was too mind-blowing. The air was so fresh that it almost opened up their pores.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a beautiful place.\u201d Zhou Weiqing turned around and looked at his wives. He found that they were still in shock. The other four women were looking at the scenery but Shangguan Xue\u2019er was looking at him. Her slightly stunned expression was just too tempting. Her red lips were slightly parted and there was a blush on her beautiful face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuah.\u201d How could Zhou Weiqing let such a great opportunity slip away? He gave her a kiss immediately.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er snapped out of her shock from his kiss, \u201cWeiqing, how, how did you do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cIt\u2019s simple! Isn\u2019t your husband great? Actually, I only had the confidence to do this when I heard about how magical the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land is from you earlier. No matter what kind of energy, all of them came from the same place. Whether it\u2019s Natural Energy or Saint Energy, they\u2019re all in the same category. Although my Saint Energy can\u2019t compare to the real Creation Energy, it\u2019s one of the purest energy in the world. It also has the ability to create, similar to the Creation Saint Energy. It\u2019s safe to say that the other attributes will have been integrated with it with it. Although I didn\u2019t use Natural Energy, at the very least it shouldn\u2019t reject my Saint Energy. The level of my Saint Energy is actually superior to the Elf Tribe\u2019s Natural Energy. Based on the fact that I\u2019m using my Saint Energy to enter, what basis do they have to reject me? This is an attribute advantage. Actually, you guys should be able to do it now as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the women had experienced the greatness of Saint Energy but their experience was not comparable to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s experience. Even Tian\u2019er who had solidified the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core was not comparable to him as well. Her Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core was still a distance away from Zhou Weiqing. That was due to the differences in the individual\u2019s absorption and receiving abilities.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing owned a body that had the protection of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation and Immortal Deity Shield. Naturally, Tian\u2019er\u2019s body could not compare to his body. Therefore, the energy that he absorbed when he was solidifying the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core was a lot more. That was the reason why he took such a long time to break through at that time. Although Zhou Weiqing did not dare to say that he understood the Saint Energy completely, he did have quite a thorough understanding of Saint Energy. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to master Spatial Law.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Little Witch who was standing at the side jumped in excitement, \u201cIt\u2019s just too beautiful here. Such rich Life aura! Weiqing, it\u2019ll be amazing if we can live in somewhere like this in the future. This is heaven on earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cNo, this is the Elf Tribe\u2019s heaven. We might be able to open a parallel realm ourselves. Perhaps I\u2019ll have the ability to do that when my cultivation base is upgraded to the Heavenly God Tier one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Little Witch grabbed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck and kissed his face. Ever since they had gotten together, Little Witch had let down her guard and her cheekiness was slowly coming back.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er let out a soft sigh as she looked at Zhou Weiqing with an odd expression on her face. \u201cIf you said you could open up a realm before we came here, I would have thought that you were lying but I believe it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>A person would have to at least have a cultivation base at the Heavenly God Tier to open up a parallel realm. Moreover, not any ordinary Heavenly God-tier powerhouse could do it because the size of the realm depended on the cultivation base. Usually, it would take at least four Heavenly God-tier powerhouses who possessed Spatial Attribute to control the Spatial Law. However, Zhou Weiqing had mastered the Spatial Law even though his cultivation base was only at the Heavenly Emperor Tier. It would not be a lie if he said that he could open a realm when he reached the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er burst out laughing and said, \u201cLittle Witch, you\u2019ll know when he\u2019s opening up the realm. It\u2019s not easy to build something like what the Elf Tribe has. Having the ability to open up realms doesn\u2019t necessarily means having the ability to create a world like the one that we\u2019re looking at right now. God knows how many years of hard work it took to create this. It must\u2019ve taken the Elf Tribe thousands of years. All of the mountains, lakes, and trees here are actually transferred from our world and cultivated here. You\u2019ve been to the Lustre Spatial Realm on the Heavenly Jewel Island. Everything there is formed naturally. It\u2019s different from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er smiled and said, \u201cTian\u2019er is right. However, if we own a parallel realm of our own, we can complete all of the arrangements in there! If we don\u2019t have to concern ourselves with the matters on the mainland, don\u2019t you think it\u2019ll be amazing if we can spend the rest of our days in a world that we created?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the women had sparkles in their eyes as they nodded continuously when they heard what Shangguan Xue\u2019er said. A world of their own. A parallel realm that only they could enter. All the rich had was just a house but what they might have is a realm of their own! The thought of that had gotten them all excited. Looking at the glow on the five women\u2019s faces, Zhou Weiqing made a silent promise that he would fulfill their dream in the future. Besides, he also had the same thoughts as them. If he could own a realm of his own, he could even place the Peerless Sect in there. It would be such an amazing thing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

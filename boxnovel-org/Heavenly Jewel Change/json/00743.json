Next, a purplish symbol appeared on Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s forehead as the effect of Lustersaint Dragon\u2019s possession abruptly.</p><br/><p>It was only a simple strike, but the effects were like the heavens and earth had clashed. Why? Tang Xian, Shangguan Bing\u2019er, and Zhan Lingtian were stunned in confusion, unable to comprehend how Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Demonic Dragon Lady could shatter a Heavenly God tier defensive ability.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang did manage to gather what had happened. After the strike, the Demonic Dragon Lady\u2019s body had become illusory and disappeared into thin air. Undoubtedly, with the Dragon Silencing Seal, it had used its full strength. However, this was not the key element. It was the intense Evil Attribute that Zhou Weiqing emitted during the attack. The presence of the Evil Attribute not only deterred Shangguan Tianyue, it also amplified the Demonic Dragon Lady\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Using an ability to amplify another ability\u2019s power? Not to mention it was an ability that could almost pass for a Heavenly God tier ability, how much of the Evil Attribute does one need to be able to do that?</p><br/><p>As everyone was in shock, Zhou Weiqing flapped his wings in the air and shot toward Shangguan Tianyue. As that was happening, one by one, pieces of dark golden-colored armors appeared on his body. Having delayed until now, Zhou Weiqing finally used his Consolidated Equipment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis cunning rascal,\u201d was what everyone thought.</p><br/><p>He had not been using his Consolidated Equipment, that was because he was afraid Shangguan Tianyue would use his without hesitation if he did so too early. Now that Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s Jewel Stored Skills and Consolidated Equipment were sealed by the Dragon Silencing Seal, he would not second-guess the decision to use it, amplifying his power to the maximum.</p><br/><p>Not only that, the large phantom behind Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back also zoomed alongside him, catching up mid-air and was absorbed into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body by becoming a grey-colored light. At that moment, Zhou Weiqing and his Ringless Ground Purging Set armor turned into a translucent grey figure.</p><br/><p>The dual hammers were raised and slammed toward Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s head. At the same time, one after another, flashes of lights appeared on his torso.</p><br/><p>Absolute Delay, Fetters of Wind, Curse of Doom, and Spatial Collapse were all skills that specialized in control and powerful attacks. It could be said that at that moment, Zhou Weiqing was like six or seven Heavenly King tier powerhouses using their abilities simultaneously. His attack speed was so high, it was impressive to watch, to say the least. Not even Shangguan Tianyang could claim he had the skill to do that.</p><br/><p>For a split second, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s torso was glowing with all sorts of different colors. Limitations and amplifications of different qualities all worked together, preventing him to even evade regardless of his Heavenly Emperor tier cultivation base. He could only manage to lift his arms and do his best to deflect Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attack with all his Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes had become a fog of grey, and the arena felt as if the temperature inside had been lowered by dozens of degrees due to the Evil Energy.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The Dual God Strength Hammers struck Shangguan Tianyue directly, without flourishes of any kind. What was surprising, was that even with Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s endurance and the abundance of his Heavenly Energy, he was still thrown backward with this strike.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right foot stomped on the ground, chasing after Shangguan Tianyue. At the same time, his right leg flung around in the sky in a dreamlike motion, creating hundreds of crystalline energy balls all around Shangguan Tianyue, which then all slammed against him, exploding as they came in contact with Shangguan Tianyue.</p><br/><p>That was not some standard lightning pearls! On every pearl, there were blue-, black-, and grey-colored shines on them, they were Dark Demon God Lightning he had not used for a while. At that time, he relied on Dark Demon God Lightning to defeat Shen Little Demon with his cultivation base of three jewels. Now, there were hundreds of balls of light. Under his Heavenly King tier cultivation base, the power of these Dark Demon God Lightning could be easily imagined.</p><br/><p>In mid-air, Shangguan Tianyue grunted, much of his clothes were tattered. Zhou Weiqing appeared with his Dual God Strength Hammers in front of Shangguan Tianyue and slammed the hammer into his chest.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue was thrown against the ground. The arena was a different subspace, but even so, Shangguan Tianyue was still smashed into the ground as he spat blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyue!\u201d Tang Xian cried out in anguish, ignoring the rules and charged toward Shangguan Tianyue. In mid-air, she couldn\u2019t resist the urge to kick Zhou Weiqing who had just finished his attack.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not evade, he even parted his dual hammer, letting his mother-in-law kick him in the chest. Having such a strong endurance, Tang Xian\u2019s kick could not even scratch him, so there was no harm letting her express her dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>Before she could do anything else to Zhou Weiqing, Tang Xian had reached Shangguan Tianyue. At this point, her face was pale as paper, her tears trailing down her face along with her grief.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er stood there, stunned. Her hands covering her mouth, unable to make a sound.</p><br/><p>All this happened in such a short time. From Zhou Weiqing\u2019s warning to Shangguan Tianyue lying on the ground in heavy injury, it all happened within the span of several breaths.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian caressed Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s slightly bashed-in chest and turned around at Zhou Weiqing fiercely, \u201cYou little sh*t! How could you hit your father-in-law so hard, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her innocently, \u201cYou taught me that, didn\u2019t you? When I first met you, you taught me to learn as much control skills as possible. Even just now, you asked me to beat him up, I was worried if I didn\u2019t do it enough, you might still forbid Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, and Bing\u2019er from marrying me. I\u2019m not at fault here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xian was immediately speechless. As Shangguan Tianyue was injured, she could not spend any more of her attention on Zhou Weiqing. Turning around, she carefully lifted Shangguan Tianyue from the depression.</p><br/><p>Feeling Tang Xian\u2019s gentleness and the tenderness in her actions, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s pale face smiled with difficulty, \u201cXian\u2019er, I\u2019m fine. I wasn\u2019t strong enough to win against this kid. Weiqing was able to attain this level of cultivation at his young age, we should not be worrying about our daughters marrying him anymore. Don\u2019t blame him, he\u2019s right. You asked him to beat me, did you not? So can you forgive me now? For so many years, I had wanted to say sorry to you, to repent in front of you, but I didn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking, does it hurt?\u201d Tang Xian\u2019s gaze was complicated, but if anything was absolute, it would be the concern in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue shook his head, grabbing Tang Xian\u2019s hands, \u201cWhether it hurts or not doesn\u2019t matter. Xian\u2019er, did you know something? Those days when you were gone, every single day had hurt more than this. It was only after you came back that I felt better. However, even then, you were still unwilling to meet with me, those days were so torturous. If you decided not to forgive me, then there\u2019s no need for me to tend to my injuries, I\u2019d rather die. I could no longer bear the torment of missing you. I really want my gentle, lovable Xian\u2019er back!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s tears had crawled all over his face. For his age, he cried like a baby. Between the sniffles, he coughed out blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cI forgive you, I forgive you, I won\u2019t throw a temper at you anymore! Tianyue, don\u2019t scare me like that!\u201d Tang Xian held Shangguan Tianyue in her arms, her suppressed emotions finally bursting out.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er finally reacted to the scene and wanted to rush over to check on her father, but was stopped by Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnhand me,\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er said angrily.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing tugged at her even more, he even hushed her with a gesture and gave her a look.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er was a little startled. Even though her father was hurt, and that filled her with worry, but her mind cleared up as soon as she saw Zhou Weiqing\u2019s look. That\u2019s right! No matter how rash Little Fatty could be, for her sake, he would never hurt her father! Was there something wrong with this scenario?</p><br/><p>As she was thinking, Zhou Weiqing had turned to Shangguan Tianyang, glanced at the incense that was still a little short of half-gone, and smiled, \u201cUncle, I don\u2019t think we need to continue this fight, I should have won by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Shangguan Tianyang smiled and nodded, he said, \u201cA grown girl cannot be kept at home, I will keep my promise. Let us proceed with her betrothal to you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhan Lingtian who stood beside Shangguan Tianyang could not say anything to object to the betrothal. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, Zhan Lingtian\u2019s eyes were filled with disbelief. Just a while ago, he could still feel his superiority over Zhou Weiqing, but now? Zhou Weiqing had risen beyond his level.</p><br/><p>Disregarding the fact that he was already a Heavenly King tier, he defeated Shangguan Tianyue who was a Heavenly Emperor tier. There were some elements of \u201ccheating\u201d in that Shangguan Tianyue wasn\u2019t able to use his legendary armor set, sure, but Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength was undeniably witnessed. What else could he say? Was he to say that he was better suited for Shangguan Xue\u2019er?</p><br/><p>Zhan Lingtian was a little self-important, but he was an upstanding person and truly a manly man. He would never be able to express emotional words like that, so he sighed, lowering his head. He knew he had already lost, and would forever lose to the guy in front of him.</p><br/><p>Having heard Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s words, Zhou Weiqing bowed to him respectfully, \u201cThank you, uncle, for agreeing to my request.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang glanced at the Shangguan Tianyue couple, waved his sleeve, and said, \u201cLet us talk in another place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Light flickered. With Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s help, everyone left the arena quietly. This did not include the couple, Shangguan Tianyue and Tang Xian, naturally.</p><br/><p>Everyone returned to the meeting hall except for Zhan Lingtian, he had left without a word. There was only Shangguan Tianyang, Zhou Weiqing, and Shangguan Bing\u2019er in the hall.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was no exception. Even Xue Ao\u2019tian and Shangguan Tianyang were silent as well. At this moment, nobody could see through Zhou Weiqing at all. None of them could tell what his cultivation base was. From the very start, there were no Heavenly Jewels on both of his wrists at all. After all, once one had reached the Heavenly Emperor Tier and above, it was not hard to conceal one\u2019s Heavenly Jewels.<sup>1 </sup></p><br/><p>After he had defeated Tian Yu, Zhou Weiqing did not immediately descend from the air. Instead, he began to casually and calmly put on his legendary armor set.</p><br/><p>Dark golden lights shone on his body one after the other. Because the light that was flashing on his body was too fast, it was difficult to determine the exact pieces of armor he had already put on. However, the last color that appeared was a dark golden color.</p><br/><p>It was very easy to identify a legendary armor set. As long as it was a complete set, one could easily distinguish how many pieces there were in total just from the aura itself. However, it would be difficult to distinguish if the legendary armor set was not complete and all it showed was only a dark golden color.</p><br/><p>This was exactly what happened Zhou Weiqing\u2019s case. The moment he finished putting on his legendary armor suit, his legendary armor set immediately gave off a powerful and tyrannical aura. Yet, this was not a complete legendary armor set!</p><br/><p>Even the anger that Fen Tian initially felt subsided a little when he saw Zhou Weiqing like this. This brat was just too strange. Everything that he did was completely unpredictable. How could he not possess even one complete set of legendary armor as the Sect Leader of the Peerless Sect? Yet, he still managed to defeat one of his Heavenly Emperors. What the hell was he doing actually?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing bellowed loudly from the air as he held the Dual God Strength Hammers in his hands, \u201cNext! Come up now!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the powerhouses on the summit of Heavenly Snow Mountain immediately snapped back into their senses. Shangguan Tianyang said without any hesitation, \u201cWe admit defeat this round.\u201d The Heavenly King who was the next in line immediately got cut off. The next person that they sent out was also a Heavenly King.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian looked at Shangguang Tianyang from the corner of his eyes as he chimed in, \u201cWe also admit defeat. We\u2019ll change!\u201d As he was speaking, he also changed his participant to another Heavenly King. The Lion King Gu Site whispered a few words to Xue Ao\u2019tian but Xue Ao\u2019tian merely shook his head in silence.</p><br/><p>This time, it was the Love Valley\u2019s turn again. After a moment of hesitation, Huang Xingyun uttered, \u201cWe give up as well.\u201d The person that he sent out to queue in line earlier was a Heavenly King. What use was there for him to send this Heavenly King when even a Heavenly Emperor was so easily defeated?</p><br/><p>Everything happened in just a blink of an eye. It was so fast that even the Blood Red Hell did not have the time to send another person to the line to substitute Tian Yu after his death.</p><br/><p>At this moment, all eyes were on Fen Tian as they waited to see how he was going to deal with the situation before him. The Grand Tournament had already entered the fifth round. However, until now, the Peerless Sect had only sent out three people.</p><br/><p>In everyone\u2019s eyes, it seemed like there were only three people in the Peerless Sect. However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strong performance had placed Fen Tian in an extremely difficult situation. Of course he could see Zhou Weiqing was using the Saint Energy, and for this reason, the Destruction Attribute seemed to have no effects on him at all. However, whether it was Fen Tian, Huang Xingyun or everyone else, they were placed in one big disadvantage \u2014 they could not see through Zhou Weiqing at all.</p><br/><p>Well, nobody could blame them entirely. After all, Zhou Weiqing was still too young and had not been the object of their attention all this while. It was only after the Blood Red Hell had been placed in a difficult situation by him that Fen Tian started to become aware of him. However, the Grand Tournament was already about to start at that time. Even though Fen Tian was paying more attention to him now, he still had the opinion that the small and tiny Zhou Weiqing still could not be compared to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace or the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, Fen Tian suddenly realized that he might have committed a grave mistake. With the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya, Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue and along with this unreadable Zhou Weiqing, the threat that the Peerless Sect posed seemed to be no less than the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace or the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>Now that it had come to this point, it posed the biggest problem in dealing with the current situation. If only Shen Mo did not battle it out with Long Shiya earlier. He would have been the ideal person to be sent out right now. This was because as long as Shen Mo could defeat Zhou Weiqing, the Peerless Sect would be rendered powerless.</p><br/><p>A gleam shone in Fen Tian\u2019s eyes as his eyes landed on Huang Xingyun who was standing not far ahead. This time, his eyes gleamed meaningfully without any disguise as if he was trying to convey a message to Huang Xingyun.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun frowned and shook his head lightly.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian narrowed his eyes and growled, \u201cShen Bu, go!\u201d In the end, he chose to put up with it. However, he himself also did not know how long he would be able to hold back.</p><br/><p>A voluptuous woman who looked as if she was in her thirties walked out from behind Fen Tian. This woman was extremely gorgeous. Every single movement of hers spelled out sexiness, and bewitching seduction radiated naturally with each glance of her eyes. She walked alluringly out of the crowd. Her waist was so slender that it looked like it could easily be broken with just a twist. She looked exactly like a snake woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Hell Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Bu did not immediately rise upwards. Instead, she steadily walked upwards to the sky as if there were staircases built in the air. With every step, her body would curve into a perfect \u2018S\u2019 shape and she would give a fawning look. Anybody who had a lower cultivation base would easily have their hearts beating rapidly the moment they laid eyes on her sexiness.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was impacted the most. After all, from the very beginning, Shen Bu\u2019s gaze had been focused entirely on him. Prior to this, Zhou Weiqing never knew that there could be so many changes in a female\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>She was suddenly pitiful, excited, shy, then pouty. Every tiny and subtle flicker of her eyes seemed to tug on his heartstring every time. It was to the point that Zhou Weiqing was staring at her with his mouth wide open. It was a good thing that he did not visibly drool.</p><br/><p>However, nobody would laugh at him this time. This was because there were already plenty of people literally drooling over her currently on the summit of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Even a woman would blush with redness when they saw Shen Bu\u2019s figure and movement.</p><br/><p>She was actually Shen Mo\u2019s cousin. Due to her cultivation base, her position was not as high as Shen Mo. However, she was the only person in Blood Red Hell that even Fen Tian did not dare to offend.</p><br/><p>Since young, Shen Bu had been born with a natural charm. Even though she was not particularly skilled in other fields, as her cultivation base rose, her own feminine charm coupled with Heavenly Energy formed a special mutated attribute that the members of Blood Red Hell referred to as the Seduction Attribute. Previously, Shen Bu\u2019s Seduction attribute could only seduce those with cultivation base lower than hers. On top of that, it only worked on men. However, after she had merged the Destruction Attribute into her own Seduction Attribute, it had somehow leveled up and turned into a unique ability that was one of a kind in this world. Even though her cultivation base was only at the Intermediate Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier, even Fen Tian was not able to stand it once she fully unleashed her Seduction Attribute. Moreover, it worked on both men and women as well.</p><br/><p>This time, Shen Bu followed Fen Tian here to join the Grand Tournament as his trump card. At first, his initial plan was to use her against either Shangguan Tianyang or Xue Ao\u2019tian. However, he had no other choice at this moment but to play this card in advance after seeing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strong performance.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Fen Tian appeared to be angry but in truth, he was still relatively calm inside. He had heard some of the stories about Zhou Weiqing\u2019s romantic affairs. It was absolutely in the nature of a hot-blooded young man to fall for a woman easily. For this reason, he decided to send Shen Bu out to deal with Zhou Weiqing after he had thought about it thoroughly.</p><br/><p>The main reason Fen Tian sent out his trump card, Shen Bu, so easily was because Fen Tian had started to take Zhou Weiqing seriously. This meant that from this moment onwards, Fen Tian had truly seen him as a Saint Land Lord and was prepared to deal with him seriously.</p><br/><p>Previously, Fen Tian and Zhou Weiqing had come face to face before but at that time, he chose not to unleash his full power. Although Fen Tian could feel Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Attribute energy and Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivation base that time, he believed that Zhou Weiqing was still far behind Xue Ao\u2019tian and Shangguan Tianyang. However, he instantly knew the young man before him was a threat to his plan when he saw how he took on the kick of a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse earlier without the help from his armor or weapons. Moreover, it was a huge threat on top of that. If he could use this opportunity to get rid of him in the Grand Tournament, the situation would be in his favor especially for his upcoming plans. Not only that, Fen Tian was actually eager to see how strong Zhou Weiqing had become. Of course, the best case scenario would be him being annihilated before he could unleash his true power.</p><br/><p>Shen Bu looked at Zhou Weiqing with extreme tenderness in her eyes as she slowly walked up to the sky one step at a time. Both of them did not use their energy or even attempt to mobilize the Atmospheric Energy. Bright sunshine fell from the sky and shone on the two of them. Under that golden gleam of light, they looked like a pair of long-lost lovers who were slowly moving closer to each other.</p><br/><p>Shen Bu\u2019s gaze did not turn intense as she got closer to Zhou Weiqing. Instead, it became somewhat softer and gentler. If the gaze that she initially gave him was seductive, then at this moment, it had gradually become soft and sad. As if begging for people to take pity on her, it was similar to the gaze of a wife who was waiting for her husband to come back home.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze was now trance-like. It was obvious that his gaze was fixed onto Shen Bu as he silently watched her approach him. He began to unconsciously lower the Dual God Strength Hammers in his hands.</p><br/><p>The people from the Peerless Sect who were watching the battle became tense in an instant. Even Long Shiya and Wu Yueyun stopped their cultivation immediately as they stared at the sky.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell did not lower their guard as well. All of them had their eyes fixed on the Peerless Sect. They would definitely rush forward to fight in case the Peerless Sect suddenly decided to rescue Zhou Weiqing from the current situation.</p><br/><p>The three Shangguan sisters, Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er, all had worry etched on their faces. On the other hand, Little Witch was completely filled with fury. Only Tian\u2019er remained calm and composed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d Still fully cloaked, Ling Dang who was sent out to the battle previously, asked Tian\u2019er from the side.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er grunted immediately, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be worried about? Even if that bastard really fell for her gentle act, that woman will never be able to break his defense. As for controlling his mind \u2014 yeah right. In her dreams!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the other girls heard Tian\u2019er\u2019s words, a realization hit them with a bang, and the worries in their eyes instantly began to fade a little.</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"883f18fd-0fe8-700d-a900-d4c35d3b2528\">( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)</li></ol><br/>\n</div>"}

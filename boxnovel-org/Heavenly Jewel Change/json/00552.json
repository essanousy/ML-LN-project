Though the mission that Zhou Weiqing had given him was not easy, he did not shirk from it. After all, as long as they were willing to spend the money, it was not impossible to complete it. Furthermore, they could also requisition some from the logistics department of the Northwest Army.</p><br/><p>Towards the specifications of those heavy armour, they were not afraid of leaking them out. The reason was simple \u2013 they weren\u2019t equipment that ordinary humans could easily wear, not even Jewel Masters would choose to wear such heavy equipment. Only the Gold Crow and Berserker Tribes with their immense innate physical strength were suited to wear them. More so, without sturdy and powerful mounts like their Unicorn Heavenly Beasts, no warhorses could actually carry them in battle!</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo continued: \u201cRegarding our Consolidated Equipment, the situation is going well. Currently, all five thousand archers of our Peerless Battalion already have their Consolidated Bows. As for the Consolidated Wings, we already have one thousand and seven hundred men who have succeeded in Consolidating them. In fact, I have some extremely good news to report regarding our team of Consolidating Equipment Masters, even as they are continuing their progress in creating the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Yun Li has already officially succeeded in reaching the Grandmaster Consolidating Equipment Master stage, and Little Miss Muddle also broke through the Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Master. Both their speeds at creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls have increased drastically. Furthermore, we currently have five more Consolidating Equipment Masters, all introduced by Senior Duan Tianlang; they are his disciples. With seven Consolidating Equipment Masters at work, even with a conservative estimate there should be enough Consolidated Wings for all our archer troops. Of course, that does not include our two Cavalry Main Companies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Lin TianAo\u2019s words, Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed. The Consolidated Wings did not just mean the power of flight, it also meant that all the Peerless Battalion soldiers had reached at least the three-Jeweled stage! The Peerless Battalion had not been set up for a long time, and he was not surprised with all the investment they made that all of them had become Jewel Masters, but for all of them to reach the three-Jeweled stage was a whole different matter. Such a united force was a truly terrifying strength! In truth, he had not expected that in such a short period of time, his dream of completing all their Consolidated Wings would actually have the chance of success.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded repeatedly in satisfaction before turning to Wei Feng, saying: \u201cVice Commander Wei, after this meeting, send word with my order that everyone should work hard in cultivating, to reach the three-Jeweled stage as quickly as possible. Although the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls of the Consolidated Wings might be complete soon, there is still quite a gap for everyone\u2019s cultivation level. Our target is within the next one to two years, our entire Peerless Battalion archers can take flight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng was beaming happily as he agreed. He had also never dreamed that one day he would be leading such a powerful army. He was beginning to regret that he had completed his Consolidated Equipment so early, losing the chance for having his own set of Consolidated Wings.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said solemnly: \u201cIn the next half a year, we will remain here. This remaining time is our final burst in accumulating strength. Bro Lin, help me tell Yun Li and the others, once the Consolidating Equipment Scroll for the Consolidated Wings are completed, begin crafting those made to measure for personal troops. Focus on the Berserker and Gold Crow Tribe members. Do not save on money or resources, this should be of extreme priority.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo nodded in agreement, before moving back to his position.</p><br/><p>Seeing the tent full of various talents, Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but sigh with feeling inwardly, a sense of accomplishment overcoming him. Not that long ago, he had just been a lonely fellow whose Empire had been destroyed, a man without a home, without friends. Yet, today, just a few days later, he now had a powerful troop under his command, one that could even influence the results of the northern border wars. Everything seemed to have fell into place so nicely, but Zhou Weiqing knew how much strenuous effort and heart it had taken for all this to happen.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing thought of Zang Lang and the other senior graduates that had parted from them before all this. After the Peerless Battalion meeting, he called Lin TianAo back and gave him a series of instructions regarding them.</p><br/><p>According to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s original plan, when he had first sent Zang Lang and the others out, it was to have them become officers in the army and to each pull in a few trusted elite soldiers, so that they could come with him in the end to the Heavenly Bow Empire. However, with the current situation, it was no longer necessary. Furthermore, pushing the envelop and taking more elite soldiers with them would inevitably bring about the discontent of the ZhongTian Empire, trouble that was unnecessary, and could possibly even cause Zang Lang and the others to be considered criminals or have a bounty set upon them.</p><br/><p>As such, he gave Lin TianAo the instructions to contact Zang Lang about the change in plans. At the same time, he ordered Wei Feng to record a list of names to ask the ZhongTian Empire to transfer Zang Lang and the other dozen or so seniors to the Peerless Battalion, to become mid level core officers.</p><br/><p>It was indeed time to return soon. Half a year, just half a year more of accumulating strength, to fully grow into their own, then it would be the time to return to the Heavenly Bow Empire and fight to regain it. As he thought about that, he couldn\u2019t help but think of his parents and godfather, and his heart grew heated as his hands gripped in fists.</p><br/><p>Father, wait for me, your Little Fatty will definitely rescue all of you!</p><br/><p>The rest of the officers had already left, and currently remaining in the main tent was the Heavenly Bow Unit God Archers, Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Lin TianAo.</p><br/><p>Under Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s observation, Zhou Weiqing had unknowingly finished the bowl of hot soup through the meeting. Now, he looked towards Hua Feng and said: \u201cMaster Hua Feng, it is time for us to start planning for our return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua Feng nodded and said: \u201cYes, it is time to plan properly. Why don\u2019t you tell me your thoughts first, I believe you should already have a draft of a plan by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cJust a very simple outline, as for the details I still need to discuss with all of you. For us to succeed in reviving our Empire, it will not be an easy task, or a quick one, but it is not impossible. After all, our Heavenly Bow Empire has not been occupied for long by the Kalise and Bai Da Empire. From the Bai Da Empire\u2019s perspective, the only draw our Heavenly Bow Empire has for them is the Stars Wood from the Stars Trees. As such, the main occupation of our lands should be by the Kalise Empire, and the Bai Da Empire should at most have a few army troops to help defend against the Fei Li Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Heavenly Bow Empire and the Kalise Empire have been warring against each other for many years, and the enmity between our Empires means that it is highly unlikely that our Heavenly Bow Empire citizens will easily submit to the Kalise Empire. As such, the first thing we need to do is to return to our homeland and set up a base of operations. We can start establishing that foothold, before starting to call upon the citizens to rise up against the errant occupants. Although our Peerless Battalion\u2019s combat strength is extremely high, our numbers are just too low. Depending on ourselves alone to win a war will be slow and unlikely\u2026 so such a process is definitely needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s detailed description, Hua Feng and the others nodded in agreement, their eyes filled with approval.</p><br/><p>Hua Feng smiled and said: \u201cWeiqing, for you to be able to think of such things, that is very good. I\u2019m happy that you are not blinded by the strength of our Peerless Battalion and start overreaching beyond our means. Alright, in that case, where do you think will be the best place to establish a foothold?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing replied: \u201cThat is one of the details I have not thought of yet. However, it definitely has to be close to the Fei Li Empire border. That way, as long as we can gain the support of the Fei Li Empire, not only can we have an avenue of supplies and logistics, at the same time we can ensure one front is relatively safe. It will be a big step towards success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ke Di couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cLittle brat, are you that confident that the Fei Li Empire will not oppose us instead? Do not forget how they treated you the last time you were there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cThe current me is not the same as in the past. I am no longer alone. At that time, sacrificing me was the expedient thing to do for them politically. Now, they will have to consider if it is worth it for them. More importantly, our target is the Kalise Empire, and possibly the Bai Da Empire. To the Fei Li Empire, that is of no harm to them, and can only be beneficial. What reason would they have to attack us instead? In politics, there is no perpetual friend or enemy. Of course, at the same time, the Fei Li Empire is of high importance to us, and this is a visit we have to make. It is an important springboard for us to return to the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu En asked: \u201cYou want to personally visit the Fei Li Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded without hesitation and said: \u201cI have to go. In the Fei Li Empire, there is still a class of my brothers. This time, I will bring them along. Our Heavenly Bow Empire used to be so weak because we lacked the talents, especially in terms of Jewel Masters and military talent. More importantly, I will also need to ensure that we have a good position for us to launch our counterattack, to begin our restoration of our Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua Feng thought for a moment, then asked: \u201cAre you going as a representative of our Empire on an official visit to the Fei Li Empire? That might not be too appropriate. Although you are the son of Admiral Zhou, but you still can\u2019t fully represent the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cIt has been a long time since I have seen Princess Difuya, I wonder how Her Highness is doing in the TianBei City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, the rest of their eyes lit up. Indeed, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s status might not be sufficient, but Princess Difuya definitely had sufficient status. Besides the remaining Royal Family Sealed in the Heavenly Bow City, she was the only member of Royalty of the Heavenly Bow Empire still alive and active outside. If she was part of their delegation team, that would be sufficient to represent the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p><br/><p>Hua Feng thought for a moment, then asked: \u201cWhen will you move out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cAs soon as possible. I plan to just bring the First Main Company and our Chief Instructor. The rest of you will stay back and continue training the remaining troops. As soon as I come to an agreement with the Fei Li Empire, I will send word back, and we can directly join up in the Fei Li Empire as a good springboard to return to our Heavenly Bow Empire. Chief Instructor, I will have to trouble you to send a letter to the ZhongTian Empire, there are some things which we might need their aid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er looked at Zhou Weiqing, actually feeling as if this was the first time she truly knew him. This was also the first time she had really been at work together with Zhou Weiqing, and though he was the youngest amongst all those gathered here, but he had been at the head of the meeting, taking up the reins without any hitch, arranging everything neatly and in proper order. The light of wisdom in his eyes was far more suave than his usual shameless self!</p><br/><p>All this while, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had always thought that the majority of the Peerless Battalion\u2019s formation and success was due to her sister Shangguan Fei\u2019er, but Fei\u2019er had always lauded Zhou Weiqing to her. At this moment, only then did she realise that her sister\u2019s praise was not because of her love for Zhou Weiqing, but he truly did have his own genuine skills.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er nodded slightly, expressing her agreement.</p><br/><p>Seeing her nodding, a flash of happiness appeared in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes. Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s status was different from even Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s. As the future heir of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, her word and authority was far greater than Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s, and she could influence both the ZhongTian Empire and the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. In Zhou Weiqing\u2019s plan, both were of extreme importance that could not be neglected.</p><br/><p>As long as they had the support of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, there would not be any danger in visiting the Fei Li Empire. At the same time, it would also allow the Peerless Battalion to leave the northern borders without a hitch in half a year\u2019s time, beginning their return to the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>\n</div>"}

In reality, we Elves will never do that. I\u2019ll even control the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s release of the vitality so as to prevent my people from becoming too powerful. Being too powerful would only bring on a bigger ambition and that is very likely to bring about a devastating disaster to our tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Puzzled, Zhou Weiqing asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of you.\u201d The Elven Queen replied without hesitation. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never existed and the Ancient Tree of Life had still evolved, I\u2019d probably do as I\u2019ve said. I believe that I would stand a great chance of succeeding as well. However, it\u2019s exactly because of you that I will not do just that. Be it the debt of gratitude that we owe to you, I\u2019d only bring calamity to my own tribe if I were to do as such.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe Elves have lived here for too long now and have long accustomed to the peace and comfort here. We don\u2019t like killing and we\u2019re even less willing to be involved in any disputes. Even if the Elven Ancient Tree has already evolved, things will still remain the same. On top of that, though we used to hate human beings a lot, but isn\u2019t this evolution of the Ancient Tree brought upon by humankind? How can we possibly repay your kindness with revenge? You\u2019re a great benefactor of the Elf Tribe \u2013 no matter where and when. Besides, I can see your future and I saw that it was you who would be standing on the top of this world. Don\u2019t forget that the Life Saint Energy that I possess now and the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution were all made possible by you alone. For this reason, there is nothing that you need to be worried about at all. In fact, it is us Elves that need to be worried instead. The creation of life is just a small part of creating the world. Though this part is very important, it\u2019s still unable to be compared to the true Creation Energy. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as she arrived, the Queen\u2019s heart that was seemingly closed had opened up again, allowing Zhou Weiqing to feel the changes of emotions in her heart.</p><br/><p>Looking at the Elven Queen, Zhou Weiqing let out a smile as well, \u201cAt first, I thought you rarely come into contact with the outside world and that your thoughts would be as simple as you are. Despite my initial impression toward you \u2013 which still remains the same \u2013 I find you to be very smart. I believe that the choices you make will be the most ideal of all. I too, despise war just as much. As long as you do not initiate a war against us, we, the Peerless Sect, are willing to be the allies of the Elves. Isn\u2019t your Ancient Tree of Life able to move now? If you\u2019re willing, you can migrate to our Heavenly Bow Empire. Now that it has evolved, I believe that be it you or I, we\u2019ve no idea how long our lifespan will be. Let us guard the peace that we love together, shall we?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen narrowed her eyes at him, \u201cSomehow, I feel that your intention is not as simple as it appears to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cHumans are all very selfish. The reason I infused my Saint Energy to you is because you sacrificed your precious Elven Heart to save me, to the point that you\u2019ve become weak as a result. Just count this as my debt you, but I did not owe anything to your Ancient Tree of Life. It has drained a lot from my body and had even almost squeezed me entirely dry. Having it migrated over would be a great repayment for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, the Elven Queen nodded slightly, \u201cAlright, I promise you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still staring at her, a surprised look could be seen on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face. In truth, he was simply joking and did not really mean what he said. He did not expect the Elven Queen to agree to it at all. Yet, it had never crossed his mind that not only had she agreed to it, she even did it very quickly. It looked as if she did not even have the intention to discuss this matter with the tribe Elders first.</p><br/><p>Listening to the thoughts in his mind, the Elven Queen let out a faint smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to discuss anymore? Now that the Ancient Tree of Life has evolved, nobody in the tribe would dare to go against my wishes. Not only that, I also believe that once it has migrated to your country, there would be only benefits and no disadvantages for us Elves. I\u2019m a very far-sighted person \u2013 do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the cheeky smile on the Queen\u2019s face, a warm feeling resonated around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart. Evil thoughts almost formed in his mind. Fortunately, he responded in a timely manner and quickly suppressed before it even came to fruition. However, his heart began to burn now. What would it mean if the Elf\u2019s Sealed Land had migrated to the Heavenly Bow Empire?</p><br/><p>Putting the Elf\u2019s strength aside, just the slight leaking of the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s immense vitality would be more than enough for the people of the Heavenly Bow Empire to be well-fed and live in peace.</p><br/><p>\u201cMigrating the Ancient Tree of Life is not difficult. What\u2019s difficult is migrating the entire Sealed Land that it\u2019s enrooted in. We\u2019d need a little more time to be able to do that. It\u2019s not possible for us to do it right away,\u201d the Elven Queen explained to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>He replied, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, there\u2019s no need to rush. There\u2019s plenty of time anyway; I can certainly wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing!\u201d Right at this moment, a few delighted cries sounded in the air. Zhou Weiqing turned around and at once, he saw the three Shangguan sisters, Tian\u2019er and Little Witch rushing over toward him.</p><br/><p>The Elves did not dare to come closer but these girls did not care at all. Even the Elven Elders would not stop them as well. Although the Elven Queen had not told them about the things that they had gone through during this trip yet, the mere fact that she was still holding on to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand had already spoken for itself.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er and the other four girls were still very excited when they came to Zhou Weiqing, but the moment they saw him and the Elven Queen holding hands, everyone could not help but widen their eyes in surprise. All five pairs of eyes landed on the joint hands, as they stared at them intensely.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, any girl would not hesitate to give her partner a tight slap on the face or show any other strong negative emotions like anger or jealousy, if she were to see her husband holding another girl\u2019s hand. However, when the girls \u2013 who were led by Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Tian\u2019er \u2013 spotted it, the first emotion that they felt was actually admiration.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right \u2013 admiration!</p><br/><p>Right now, all five girls had more or less the same thoughts. Coupled with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s remarkable past achievements, they could not help but wonder to themselves \u2013 what was there that Little Fatty could not do? Even the Elven Queen had caved in, in just a month! Indeed, it had already been one month since the two of them left to give chase to the enemy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had an awkward expression on his face now. After all, he did not know what they were thinking at the moment. But, he was really innocent! This time, having another affair did not cross his mind at all. Yet, the Elven Queen still clung to his hand tightly and there was nothing he could do, as he could not possibly pull his hand away abruptly.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen smiled and nodded to the five girls before she said, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much. There\u2019s no underlying meaning to this. Please hold on for a while longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>While she spoke, she flew up to the sky still clutching Zhou Weiqing. Prior to this, it had been him, who brought her back using Spatial Travel, so he did not notice the changes on the Elven Queen at all. Now that she brought him flying, he was astonished to find that the Elven Queen\u2019s body seemed to be slightly taller than before, by at least half a head. What was even more amazing was the fact that the two invisible wings behind her turned into three pairs instead. With a faint golden light, she now looked extremely elegant and noble, with a supreme majestic aura around her. Of course, this aura was being exuded outwards toward other people and Zhou Weiqing could only feel a faint hint of it. Right now, he could clearly feel her gentleness towards him.</p><br/><p>Before this, most of the Elves only saw the Elven Queen and Zhou Weiqing returning to the land; they did not see that they were both actually holding each other\u2019s hands. At this moment, when the Elven Queen clung onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand in mid-air, each and every one of the Elf Tribe members could not help but be dumbfounded with astonishment.</p><br/><p>In reality, the Elven Queen was the supreme being of the Elf Tribe. At the same time, she was also the purest representative of the tribe. Never mind touching a male human being, even a male Elf had absolutely no right to touch her body at all. Yet, right now, seeing her holding Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand was absolutely something they could not fathom.</p><br/><p>The twelve Elven Elders who were standing at the front did not have to kneel down in respect. Exchanging glances with each other, they were stunned to the point that they could not even utter a single word. It was apparent to them that the Elven Queen was holding Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand at her own will. What was more important was that this Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution had brought them an abundance of happiness over the past month. Otherwise, the Elders might have long gone berserk upon seeing such a scene.</p><br/><p>As the Elven Queen had explained, the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution meant that her position in the Elf Tribe had elevated and became more well-respected. Therefore, nobody dared to go against the Elven Queen\u2019s prestige. All they did was to wait patiently for her orders.</p><br/><p>With her right hand holding onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand, the Elven Queen lifted her left hand gradually. At once, the rich golden Life Energy around her body started to fluctuate without warning. As her left hand flicked outwards, a layer of faint golden light exuded and turned into a faint gold halo as it slowly spread out to its surroundings.</p><br/><p>At this point, at least several thousands of Elves had already gathered here. Under the expansion of the golden halo, the Elves were slowly shrouded by it. The moment the breath of life \u2013 which was brimming with creativity \u2013 touched the Elves, each of them could clearly feel their already abundant vitality continuing to elevate and improve.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live Your Majesty!\u201d A cheering sound erupted like a tidal wave. Even the twelve Elven Elders automatically kneeled down when they felt the rich spread of Life Saint Energy. As for the Elders, they had the most profound understanding of the type of energy that the Elven Queen was releasing now. This was the Life Saint Energy that one could only possess if you release the Elven Heart! Yet, right now, it was actually being released with ease by the Elven Queen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

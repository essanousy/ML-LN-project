Along with the elevation of his cultivation base, his body had completely evolved into the purest form of Saint Energy. It could be said that in some ways, he could no longer be categorized as a human being. Sleeping with him would definitely allow one to gain great benefits from him.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er rolled her eyes at him, \u201cSister is right. Your mind is only filled with all those filthy and dirty things! I\u2019ll just ignore you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said to Shangguan Xue\u2019er, \u201cXue\u2019er, I\u2019ve another thing to ask you. Do you know where the Sealed Land of the Elf Tribe is located?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What did you say?\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not catch on to his meaning. Not long after, her face suddenly lit up in surprise, \u201cH-How do you know about the Elf Tribe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er who were both standing by the side appeared to be confused about their conversation. It was obvious that they did not know about the existence of the Elf Tribe.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged. He had no plans of hiding anything. \u201cJunior Master was the one who told me that your Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace has something to do with the Elf Tribe. Junior Master managed to come up with a design for the eleventh piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set. However, we need the Elven Queen\u2019s blood, which is the most important ingredient, to make Consolidating Ink. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll have to make a trip to the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land and look for the Elven Queen\u2019s fresh blood. Xue\u2019er, if you feel like I\u2019m putting you in a difficult position, I\u2019ll make a trip to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and ask our father or uncle about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er shook her head gently, \u201cWeiqing, I can tell you where the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed land is but I wish that you won\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>She replied, \u201cThe Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land is not dangerous but your purpose in going there is definitely dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stared at her in surprise as he waited for her to continue.</p><br/><p>She continued, \u201cThe Elf Tribe\u2019s reproduction cycle is quite similar to the Dragon Tribe. They\u2019re both very slow in reproducing. This is also why they\u2019re suppressed by human beings in the first place. However, now that many years have passed, the Elf Tribe has already regained their strength. It\u2019s true that the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace has some relations with the Elf Tribe but it\u2019s only for mutual benefits. We\u2019ve given our words that we\u2019ll never allow any human nations to attack the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land. In return, we gained their friendship and to some extent, we also obtained some of their possessions. Still, this doesn\u2019t mean that the Elf Tribe has complete faith in us. They still remain slightly hostile towards human beings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Elven Queen is the supreme being of the Elf Tribe. Every drop of blood from the Elves is an essence of nature, particularly the Queen\u2019s. On top of that, a part of the Elf\u2019s body is actually made of energy. This is why the blood in their body is extremely rare. The amount of blood in the Queen\u2019s entire body is most likely only around 100 drops and this was the result of countless years of accumulation. Wanting three fresh drops of blood from the Queen is equivalent to becoming an enemy of the entire Elf Tribe. Unless you can charge your way in ruthlessly and win against the Elven Queen, it\u2019s almost impossible to accomplish your mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing understood immediately why Xue\u2019er had that kind of astonished and worried expression on her the moment she heard that he wanted to get the Elven Queen\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like it\u2019ll be unlikely for me to obtain the Elven Queen\u2019s blood in a peaceful manner then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er immediately replied without any hesitation, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. And if I bring you into the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land with my Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s identity, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and the Elf Tribe\u2019s friendship will most likely be destroyed. We\u2019ll most likely cause the Elf Tribe to be more hostile towards human beings. For this reason, you have to be extremely careful okay, Little Fatty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er usually addressed him as Weiqing. With just these two words \u201cLittle Fatty\u201d, he immediately felt a sense of numbness all over his whole body. A smile instantly crept onto his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, I\u2019m not a reckless person. Xue\u2019er, with your understanding of the Elf Tribe, what do you think about the extent of their strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Xue\u2019er replied, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to scare you so I\u2019ll just tell it to you directly. The Elf Tribe are the guardians of nature so they\u2019re naturally born with Natural Energy. Each of the tribesmen of the Elf Tribe is a born warrior. They\u2019re good in archery and they master at least four natural element energy \u2014 Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind. Some of the more powerful elves can even master the Light and Darkness attribute. There are at least several dozens of those elves who had mastered six different attributes in the Tribe. Can you imagine that? They have several dozen powerhouses who possess the same attributes as Senior Long. Can you imagine what their cultivation base is? As for the Elven Queen\u2019s cultivation base, even we have no idea how powerful she really is. However, in the ancient times, the Elven Queen had always been strong enough to fight against the Dragon Emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s words, Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er both were stunned. How powerful must she be to be able to be on par with the Dragon Emperor? A Heavenly God Tier? She had to at least be a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse right?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart sank immediately. However, how could he possibly back out from the plan now? Naturally, it would be impossible.</p><br/><p>Junior Master had spent a lot of effort to come up with the design for this Consolidated Equipment Scroll, to the point that he almost lost his life. It was indeed true that Duan Tianlang had sacrificed too much for him. If he could not craft this Consolidated Equipment Scroll successfully, Duan Tianlang\u2019s soul would not be in peace even after he died. This was his Junior Master\u2019s greatest wish after all. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing also wished that he would become much stronger. He had no other choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must go to this Elf Tribe. Xue\u2019er, are you willing to tell me where exactly is the Sealed Land located?\u201d A determined look could be seen in his eyes. It was obvious that he had already made up his mind the moment he said those words.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er sighed. She knew that she would not be able to stop him from going.</p><br/><p>As Shangguan Xue\u2019er lifted her head up to look at him, she sighed again, \u201cWeiqing, will you give me a few days to think about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not force her. He gently nodded his head as he reassured her, \u201cXue\u2019er, you don\u2019t have to put yourself in such a difficult position. If you really don\u2019t want to tell me, I won\u2019t force you at all. I\u2019ll just go ask uncle myself. It won\u2019t take long for me to reach the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace with my current cultivation base.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t let uncle know!\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er quickly shook her head, \u201cOtherwise, he\u2019ll definitely stop you from going. But, Weiqing, even if we really go to the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land, I hope that we\u2019ll try to resolve this matter peacefully and not rush into a battle straight away. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head solemnly, \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Waiting for a few days was nothing to Zhou Weiqing. He needed time to consolidate the tenth piece of his Ringless Ground Purging Set anyway. As long as he had completed his last helmet, his Ringless Ground Purging Set could be considered as complete. As for how his set would look like once the eleventh piece was added on to it, it was not something he had to worry about for now. Being able to put on all ten pieces of his Ringless Ground Purging Set would definitely make his strength increase again.</p><br/><p>In fact, even the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set only possessed ten pieces of equipment.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was a little curious. When the three Shangguan sisters came back, they called Tian\u2019er and Little Witch away with them. At first, Zhou Weiqing wanted to go with them but all of them pushed him away at the same time.</p><br/><p>That kind of situation made Zhou Weiqing worried yet happy at the same time. Although he hoped that all five women would be able to get along well so that he would not have any trouble with them, at the same time, he feared they would gang up and go against him. How would he dare to mess with them? He did not even dare to mess with just one of them!</p><br/><p>For this reason, Zhou Weiqing decided to spend his day cultivating to set up a firm foundation for his cultivation base and complete the tenth piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set tomorrow.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When it was time for dinner, Zhou Weiqing had his dinner together with his five wives and their families. What shocked him the most was after their dinner ended, under the urging of the other four girls, Little Witch actually followed him all the way to his bedroom while she held onto the corner of his shirt with her head lowered.</p><br/><p>Looking at Wu Yuehan\u2019s innocent and delicate face that was flushed with embarrassment as she closed the door after she had followed him into the room, Zhou Weiqing literally widened his eyes. The first thing that crossed his mind was, \u201cIs this a test from the five of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she came here, it was obvious that Little Witch was in the pink of health. Zhou Weiqing had used his Saint Energy a few times now to help nurse her back to health.</p><br/><p>Her pink face was flushed with a crimson red. Among the five girls, Little Witch was the youngest. She was barely a few years older than Zhou Weiqing. With her cute and girlish features, the embarrassed expression on her face made her look even more enticing and lovely.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing asked tentatively, \u201cYuehan, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch\u2019s head was hung so low that it was almost buried in her own chest as she muttered, \u201cS-Sister Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er told me to take care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was a smart guy. She had already hinted at it so strongly, if he still did not catch on to her meaning then he was not worthy of being the descendant of a scoundrel and a drunken rogue.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a step forward and held her hands before he pulled her into his embrace. He chuckled as he asked, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that all of you have already discussed this and decided to take turns and have one person accompany me every night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Little Witch quickly shook her head. Looking at her right now, she no longer had that heroic and cheeky spirit that had almost destroyed the entire Fei Li Battle Team previously. Instead, she currently looked more like the shy little girl next door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Little Witch muttered in a very low voice, \u201cS-Sister Fei Li told me to do some experiment or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing finally understood what was going on. Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er were trying to test the validity of the things that he had told them during the day. Could it be that if he really could help them make a breakthrough to the Heavenly King Tier, they would be willing to do that with him?</p><br/><p>Even though his heart was filled with excitement, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes turned a little colder than usual. It was obvious that he was somewhat displeased with the situation. It seemed like his charm was not as attractive as having their cultivation base elevated! This was not right! Even if Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er wanted to elevate their cultivation base, they should not act in this manner towards him. Based on his understanding of them, he was sure that Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er were not this kind of people. There must be something going on with them!</p><br/><p>However, at this time, Zhou Weiqing did not give it another thought. After all, why would he reject a lamb that offered herself to him?</p><br/><p>With a bit of an evil smirk, Zhou Weiqing put his arms around Little Witch and led her to the edge of the bed before sitting down. He pulled her body that was as light as a feather and as soft as a pillow down on his thighs. He chuckled, \u201cYuehan, do you know what kind of experiment they want you to do?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

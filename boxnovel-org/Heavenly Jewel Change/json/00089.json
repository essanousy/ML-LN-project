This was not a bad thing for them, not just for Zhou Weiqing having good relations with the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, but even the Fei Li Empire would gain much from having good relations with the ZhongTian Empire.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Follower, he naturally had to think of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s position first; but as a Fei Li Empire Citizen, he was naturally even happier with such a win-win situation.</p><br/><p>He understood that Zhou Weiqing had revealed too much of his talent today, and it was just too astounding. As the saying goes, the trees that grow the highest in the forest will be knocked down first[1. That\u2019s the literal translation, but I think you all can get the meaning from the words; basically someone overly talented would attract jealousy], there was always a bad side to drawing too much attention. He knew that with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s character, the only reason he would do something like that was because of Shangguan Bing\u2019er. Alas, if they did not have a strong background, such an outstanding talent could mean an early demise.</p><br/><p>The world had never lacked talents, but those who could survive and grow to their maximum heights were few and far between.</p><br/><p>The thoughts flashed quickly through Lin TianAo\u2019s mind, and he quickly bowed respectfully towards Shangguan Longyin, saying: \u201cThank you Senior Shangguan for taking care of us. Weiqing is severely injured, could you please aid Shen Little Demon to help her stabilize for a while. We will give him the Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit juice to hasten his recovery so he can help cure Miss Shen. Is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin was old and experienced, and he instantly knew that Lin TianAo had accepted the olive branch he had extended. Smiling faintly, he nodded, his favourable impression of this stable young man in front of him going up a notch.</p><br/><p>Pinching Zhou Weiqing\u2019s nose, Lin TianAo poured in the Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit juice and forced him to swallow. However, before he could continue taking action, Shangguan Longyin stepped forward. In truth, he was unable to do anything to stabilize and further help Shen Little Demon; the Dark Demon God Lightning\u2019s venom was just too powerful and overbearing - as soon as he tried to do anything, it would activate. Furthermore, he wanted to get Zhou Weiqing to owe him a favour.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin stepped forward to Zhou Weiqing before placing both hands on his body. His hands were suffused with a shimmering white, almost jade like, colour as he spread his Heavenly Dao Energy around, moving around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Under the guidance of the Heavenly Dao Energy, the Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit juice quickly spread around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body and infused within.</p><br/><p>In the entire process, Shangguan Longyin was secretly shocked. Earlier, on the tournament stage, he had examined Zhou Weiqing\u2019s injuries, and knew how heavily injured he was. Yet, at this moment, only a short time had passed, and now that he was examining Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, he was surprised to discover that his meridians were already starting to heal. It was at a speed that was definitely beyond any normal rate of healing, even for a Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, perhaps only those who had reached the Heavenly Dao Stage like him could do so.</p><br/><p>Such an amazing talent! Shangguan Longyin marveled to himself. Of course, he did not reveal anything in his expression, remaining impassive and cool. In a matter of moments, the Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit juice had circulated throughout the meridian network of Zhou Weiqing, and a faint fragrance wafted from his body. A white mist rose out from his body, and his laboured breathing calmed down.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit was indeed a rare and miraculous treasure, and in fact, it was an ingredient in some of the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit only grew in very particular specific environments. Dragons were very rare in the Boundless Mainland, and they were usually only found in deep in the mountains. An adult dragon was comparable to a Heavenly King Jewel Master powerhouse. However, they were not considered threats to humans as they usually stuck to themselves, and did not venture into the human world.</p><br/><p>At the same time, every dragon was considered a treasure trove to humans. They had the habit of collecting treasure, and it was common for their habitats to have a huge amount of treasure like gold and gems. That was not the only thing; the entire body of the dragon was considered a treasure in itself; their scales were extremely durable and suitable for making scale armour, dragon blood and ground dragon bones were some of the top quality Consolidating Equipment materials, while their nucleus core was the top quality of all Heavenly Nucleus Cores. It could be said their entire body was treasure to humans!</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit was, as its name suggests, linked to the habitats of dragons, and could only grow in their habitats. A dragon\u2019s saliva would drip onto the ground, and after hundreds of years, only then would the area be suitable for Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruits to grow. They were considered top quality healing items, and also had a powerful effect of strengthening physiques. If a normal human drank the juice of the Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit, as long as he wasn\u2019t older than thirty years old, just a single drop would actually be enough to Awaken their personal Power Jewel, to become a Jewel Master! As for Jewel Masters, it was able to heal almost all physical wounds.</p><br/><p>With the aid of the Heavenly Dragon Holy Fruit juice, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s own amazing regenerative capabilities was brought to full power, and his meridians knit themselves together at amazing speed. By the time Shangguan Longyin removed his hands, his Heavenly Energy was fully back in proper circulation.</p><br/><p>Standing beside Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Longyin showed a pondering look, almost uncertain, and remained silent for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Shangguan, Leader will not be able to last long.\u201d It was only when one of the Dan Dun Battle Team members called out urgently did Shangguan Longyin break out of his reverie.</p><br/><p>He placed a palm softly on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head, who shuddered, before slowly opening his eyes.</p><br/><p>Waking up to see Shangguan Longyin right in front of him, Zhou Weiqing started. The next instant, he felt the sudden changes in his body.</p><br/><p>Although he still hurt from head to toe, it was already much better than the unbearable agony he was in before he had lost consciousness. At the same time, he could also feel the energy drawn from the fourteen energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points, constantly re-nourishing his body as he could sense his meridians mending.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Senior for helping me heal.\u201d With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s intelligence, how he could he not understand what had happened.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin nodded to him, not concealing his approval of the youth in front of him.</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo quickly stepped forward towards Zhou Weiqing, softly telling him about Shangguan Longyin\u2019s promise. Zhou Weiqing looked at him questioningly, and seeing Lin TianAo nodding to him, he understood that his companions were not against him saving Shen Little Demon, and he knew it would only be a benefit to them all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Senior has given his guarantee, we have nothing to worry about. However, I am not confident in my own abilities in saving Miss Shen, after all this was actually the first time I\u2019ve also used that Skill. Let me try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin nodded, saying: \u201cI understand, if even you aren\u2019t able to save her, then there is no other choice.\u201d As he said that he turned to the Dan Dun Battle Team members and waved to them.</p><br/><p>Although they were full of hate and animosity towards the Fei Li Battle Team, they did not dare to show any sign of it or delay. After all, this was their leader\u2019s survival at stake. As such, they quickly carried her in.</p><br/><p>The Rest House was just enough for a single team, and it was extremely crowded now with all of them in it. Looking at Shen Little Demon, pale faced and shivering while constantly glowing in the three different colours, Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but feel a strange sensation in his heart.</p><br/><p>Of course, that feeling was not because of Shen Little Demon\u2019s looks, but because of the Dark Demon God Lightning. Although he had previously said he would no longer use it without any compelling reason, he was truly thirsting for its unbelievable power. If he could truly control this amazing triple-attribute skill, it was without a doubt it would be an extremely lethal weapon in his arsenal, especially against opponents higher level than he was.</p><br/><p>As he thought about that, he pondered slightly to himself before saying: \u201cPlease place her on the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>The members of the Dan Dun Battle Team quickly laid her down. Although they did not know how to treat this youth in front of them, who had caused such an injury to their Leader, Shangguan Longyin was right next to them, and Zhou Weiqing had also agreed to heal their Leader, and they would naturally abide by their agreement.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s following actions caused them all to reveal a violent rage.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lifted up his right foot, placing it right on Shen Little Demon\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Lan Feng was about to charge forward, but was stopped by a hand from Shangguan Longyin.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin said solemnly: \u201cHe let loose that attack from his right leg. If I am not wrong, only his right leg is able to withstand the power of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The members of the Dan Dun Battle Team started, halting hesitatingly, but their eyes still showed their anger and humiliation. No matter what, Shen Little Demon was still being stepped on by Zhou Weiqing, and the sheer humiliation and disgrace of it caused their faces to turn red in rage.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhuo Weiqing ignored them all. The only thing in his mind was currently: <i>35D\u2026 stepping on it sure feels soft\u2026 and springy!</i></p><br/><p>Of course, he was not the rash, impetuous youngling of two years back, and would never speak such thoughts out loud. Instead, he looked on calmly, the solemn picture of a gentleman.</p><br/><p>Circulating his Heavenly Energy, Zhou Weiqing pressed the sole of his foot against her heart, infusing his Heavenly Energy into her body.</p><br/><p>However, the infusion was met with puzzlement. Although he could sense the three wildly rampaging energy forces within her body, he was still unable to draw them out with his powerful right leg.</p><br/><p>Inspiration struck. Zhou Weiqing bent down, the Heavenly Jewels around his wrists appearing swiftly, and he placed his palms down onto her chest.</p><br/><p>This time, not only the Dan Dun Battle Team, but even the members of the Fei Li Battle Team all stared in shock, their eyes wide and jaws open. However, before anyone could call out to stop him, Shen Little Demon\u2019s circumstance changed.</p><br/><p>Black, grey and blue. The three lights instantly flickered around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palm, as the lights around Shen Little Demon were drawn towards his palms, just like he had Devoured her Heavenly Energy on the tournament stage.</p><br/><p>Indeed, he had to unleash the Devour Skill through his palms.</p><br/><p>Seeing it take effect on their Leader was the only thing stopping the Dan Dun Battle Team members from charging forward to stop it. Even so, they clenched their fists and gritted their teeth. What sort of healing was this? Was he doing this on purpose to humiliate them?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was totally enjoying himself. Originally, when he had taken action, he truly did not have any dirty thoughts; the reason why he chose the chest area to take action was because that was where the Dark Demon God Lightning had struck.</p><br/><p>Of course, when his hands actually pressed forward and he started Devouring the Heavenly Energy, the feeling in his palms, soft, yet springy, it was just amazing. Furthermore, as the three Attribute Heavenly Energy was drawn into him from her body, it was immediately transformed into his own Heavenly Energy, giving him a surge of strength. After all, it was originally formed from his own Heavenly Energy!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He struggled for a while before he managed to escape from Bai Da Empire to the Heavenly Bow Empire. Finally, he settled down in Heavenly Bow City. Zhou Weiqing and Ming Yu had rushed back from the front lines just to meet the Demonic Emperor.</p><br/><p>The Little Witch\u2019s cries had died down. However, she still refrained from looking at Zhou Weiqing. She just sat at the side in utter silence with her head lowered.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing swept his gaze to her from time to time. If it was not for Wu Yunyue\u2019s presence, he would have affectionately pulled Little Witch into his embrace. However, regardless of how thug-like he was, he did not dare to act recklessly since her father was there!</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue stared at Zhou Weiqing and sighed as he said, \u201cI believe you\u2019re aware of the matters regarding the Heavenly Demon Sect, Weiqing. I came here to discuss something with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease go ahead, senior,\u201d Zhou Weiqing forced himself to retract his lingering gaze on Little Witch and turned to look at Wu Yunyue.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue said, \u201cMy suggestion is very simple. I hope that you\u2019ll take over my position and become the Sect Master of the Heavenly Demon Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The one who exclaimed in shock was Ming Yu. Zhou Weiqing was equally as stunned. Even though he had some ideas regarding the purpose of the Demonic Emperor\u2019s visit, he did not expect that those words would come out directly from the Demonic Emperor\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>As the saying went, a starved camel is still bigger than a horse. Although the Heavenly Demon Sect suffered a destructive blow, it still possessed a third of its powers. In addition to the Demonic Emperor\u2019s Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivation, the sect was still a formidable force. As long as Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue was still alive, who would dare say that the Heavenly Demon Sect no longer existed? However, for Wu Yunyue to want to give away these powers of his at this time, how would Zhou Weiqing and Ming Yu not be surprised?</p><br/><p>It seemed like Little Witch had known about her father\u2019s decision all along. She remained defeated at the side, still keeping quiet.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing inhaled deeply and said, \u201cWhy do you say that, senior? What favors do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not asking for any troublesome favors. I just hope that after you\u2019ve inherited the position of the sect master of the Heavenly Demon Sect, you\u2019ll continue to lead the Heavenly Demon Sect towards strength. At the same time, I wish that your future child with Yuehan will inherit the Heavenly Demon Sect as well. These are two of my simple wishes. The other matters won\u2019t require our attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no flaws in Wu Yunyue\u2019s two wishes. The conditions he had proposed was just like the one Zhou Weiqing had proposed to Shangguan Tianyang in Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. The difference was Wu Yunyue was planning to give away the Saint Land beforehand. And as for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, Zhou Weiqing maintained a passive stance. One could imagine the differences between these two individuals.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly and said, \u201cSenior, you think too highly of me. Do you really believe that I\u2019m capable of controlling one of the Saint Lands?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue smiled softly and said, \u201cOf course you are. Before meeting you in person, I had my doubts. But now, I\u2019ve made up my mind. You possess the Evil Attribute within you. It\u2019s the purest Evil Attribute. I believe that the Heavenly Demon Sect will definitely grow stronger in your hands. It\u2019ll only head towards destruction in my hands. You\u2019ll be the Sect Master of the Heavenly Demon Sect, and I\u2019m willing to be your assistant. At the same time, I assure you that all your commands will be obeyed by everyone in the Heavenly Demon Sect. That includes me as well. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Staring at Wu Yunyue, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes were filled with hesitation. At this time, Little Witch gradually lifted her head. Her eyes that were swollen from crying subconsciously looked at him. There was a glimmer of hope in her eyes.</p><br/><p>If Zhou Weiqing accepted the Heavenly Demon Sect, it would mean that there was a real chance for her. All these years, she had not been living well. Ever since she formed a relationship with Zhou Weiqing, she had been waiting for him to find her. However, she could not even find a trace of him. Little Witch also understood that Zhou Weiqing had too much to do in these years. Therefore, even though she had cried upon seeing him, she did not really blame him.</p><br/><p>She who had been born in one of the Saint Lands knew clearly what was most important to a man. If it was not for the disaster that befell the Heavenly Demon Sect, she might not have met him so soon.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue sighed softly and said, \u201cWeiqing, the remaining powers of the Heavenly Demon Sect may not be much. However, I strongly believe that we\u2019re still of use to the Heavenly Bow Empire. As long as you agree to be the Sect Master, the entire Heavenly Demon Sect will join the Heavenly Bow Empire. I think this is also essential to your country. Go ahead and raise any terms that you have.\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, Wu Yunyue had no other option. The truth was, this choice of his was also the smartest. Appearance wise, it might seem like he had given the Heavenly Demon Sect away. However, only by doing so would the Heavenly Demon Sect have a chance to survive.</p><br/><p>If he handed the Heavenly Demon Sect to the other Saint Lands, the Heavenly Demon Sect would disappear without a trace in a matter of days. Zhou Weiqing, in contrary, was different. He was just a single person and he had his teacher, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor with him. By handing the Heavenly Demon Sect to him, Wu Yunyue\u2019s influence would still remain. Furthermore, it could be said that Zhou Weiqing had endless potential. He was a 23 year old Heavenly King Tier! He had also heard from Ming Yu that Zhou Weiqing had powers comparable to Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses. Under his leadership, Heavenly Demon Sect would absolutely grow in power.</p><br/><p>Not to mention the fact that Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch also had a relationship. Once the child of his daughter and Zhou Weiqing had inherited the Heavenly Demon Sect, would it not be the same in the sense the Heavenly Demon Sect was still being passed on to his own bloodline?</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue did not conceal any of his thoughts. He had laid out everything clearly. Nevertheless, the clearer he spoke his mind, the more Zhou Weiqing had to consider.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Demon Sect might be a very formidable force. However, do not forget that the name of the Heavenly Demon Sect had not been good and it had been isolated by the other Saint Lands. Furthermore, if Zhou Weiqing accepted the Heavenly Demon Sect, his relationship with the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain would become strained. And there was a possibility that the Blood Red Hell might attack at any time. To Zhou Weiqing, this burden was quite heavy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing inhaled deeply before he looked at Wu Yunyue and said, \u201cSenior, I can promise you that. However, I have a condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yu who was next to him could no longer contain himself. He said furiously, \u201cThe Sect Master has voiced his wish to give away his position to you. What other conditions do you still have? Weiqing, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing raised his hand, signaling for him to calm down. He said to Wu Yunyue, \u201cSenior, my terms are very simple. I wish for the Heavenly Demon Sect to change its name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChange its name?\u201d Wu Yunyue was stunned, \u201cWhy? I cannot accept your condition.\u201d He thought to himself, \u2018Doesn\u2019t a change in name mean that the Heavenly Demon Sect will no longer exist?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said in a low voice, \u201cSenior, please don\u2019t rush to your own conclusion. Listen to what I\u2019ve to say. The reason why I want the Heavenly Demon Sect to change its name isn\u2019t because of my personal desires. It\u2019s for the future of the Heavenly Demon Sect. Have you ever wondered about the reason why the Heavenly Demon Sect was picked on by the other Great Saint Lands in all these years? Or why most of the Heavenly Jewel Masters unconsciously choose to avoid us when they heard the thoughts of the Heavenly Demon Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly because of the word \u2018Demon\u2019 in our name. Furthermore, rumors about the Evil Attribute has been greatly exaggerated. That\u2019s why it\u2019s like this today. To be honest, even if I\u2019m the Sect Master of the Heavenly Demon Sect, it\u2019ll still be heading towards destruction in the future if these changes aren\u2019t made. Development of the Heavenly Demon Sect will only be possible if we alter our foundation and get the ordinary people to accept the existence of our Saint Land.\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking through Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, Wu Yunyue was quiet. He might not want to admit it but what Zhou Weiqing said was the truth.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing continued, \u201cI can assure you that the future heir of the Saint land will be the child of me and Little Witch. Nonetheless, if you wish for me to take over the Heavenly Demon Sect, its name must be changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he spoke about his child with Little Witch, Little Witch lowered her head instantly and there was a blush on her lovely face.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue said in a low voice, \u201cWeiqing, this isn\u2019t a trifling matter. The name of a Saint Land can\u2019t be changed as you like. I admit that you\u2019re right. The reason why the Heavenly Demon Sect was able to become a Saint Land back then was due to the fact that the powers of the first Demonic Emperor were the strongest in his time. However, if we\u2019re to change its name now, will the other Great Saint Lands still acknowledge our existence? Furthermore, I\u2019ll have to discuss this with my fellow followers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cSenior, this may not be pleasant to your ears. However, I must still say it. With Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s current situation, will the Saint Lands still acknowledge the existence of the Heavenly Demon Sect Saint Land when they gather again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue\u2019s demeanor changed instantly. This was his greatest concern. He slowly stood up. His eyebrows were furrowed as he said, \u201cRegarding this matter, I\u2019ll have to go back and discuss with everyone. Only then I\u2019ll be able to give you an answer. Yuehan shall stay here as our liaison.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch\u2019s petite body shivered momentarily but she did not respond otherwise.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing also quickly stood up and sent Wu Yunyue to the door. Wu Yunyue halted his footsteps, \u201cWeiqing, treat my daughter well. Regardless of whether you\u2019re willing to take over the Heavenly Demon Sect, I hope that Yuehan can be happy with you. With this, I can finally stop worrying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I was the one who treated her poorly. I will treat her well from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue nodded and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to send me off. Go back in. Ming Yu alone will suffice.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing had seen Ming Yu send Wu Yunyue off, he returned to the meeting hall. He found Wu Yuehan sitting there as she toyed with the corner of her shirt.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing walked slowly towards her as he stabilized his footing. He raised both of his arms, it halted in midair for a moment before it landed on Little Witch\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>Feeling the heat from his huge hands, Wu Yuehan\u2019s body trembled slightly for a moment. Zhou Weiqing carefully pulled her up from the chair and into his embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s all my fault. You\u2019ve suffered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot. I, I miss you\u2026\u201d Wu Yuehan hugged him tightly and her tears flowed uncontrollably, wetting Zhou Weiqing\u2019s collar.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Once the Elven Empress was dead, the Ancient Tree of Life would devolve on its own into how it was before the evolution. When the Ancient Tree of Life devolved to that form, it would be gifted with the addition of a new ability that allowed it to give birth to the Seed of Life.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress was already fully prepared before she participated in the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands. Her presence would either make or break the tournament. The first reason was because she shared the same life as Zhou Weiqing. If Zhou Weiqing was to die in this battle, she would not survive on her own. The more important reason was her responsibility. She was responsible for sealing the Nether Lord. Even if the Elven Empress and the Ancient Tree of Life were to die in this battle, the Seed of Life that was kept by the Elf Tribe would grow into a new Ancient Tree of Life again. Although it would require a long time for it to be fully grown, it would ensure the continuity of the Elf Tribe. This was also the reason why the Elven Empress ordered the elders to head to the Heavenly Bow Empire where the Peerless Sect was before she entered the abyss where the Netherworld\u2019s seal was located.</p><br/><p>At this exact moment, the Ancient Tree of Life made its entrance in an earth-shocking manner. It depended on its peerless and tremendous Life Force to forcibly maintain the entire seal\u2019s stability again.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress\u2019 voice that was usually calm echoed in the cavern, \u201cNether Lord. You\u2019re right. I was precisely the one who created the Netherworld\u2019s seal that managed to seal you for millennia with the Elf Tribe\u2019s first ancestors and the senior Dragon Emperor. My first ancestors even died in the battle over here and sacrificed their lives in order to complete your seal. For the many years that followed, it was the senior Dragon Emperor who had been maintaining the seal, that was why you had no way to break through it. Similarly, the Elf Tribe also bears the responsibility to maintain the seal. As long as we\u2019re still alive, we\u2019ll absolutely never allow you to escape the Netherworld and destroy the mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice sounded calm yet awe-inspiring. At this moment, the Elven Empress was hovering above the Ancient Tree of Life. Her austere yet magnificent face was overflowing with a determined expression. She unleashed her dense aura of life to forcibly suppress the momentum of the Nether Lord\u2019s attempt to break through.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see that you\u2019ve even brought along the Ancient Tree of Life, huh? So what? Do you think that tiny little Life Saint Energy of yours is a rival for my pure Destruction Energy? You\u2019re too naive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord\u2019s voice was filled with rage. Two of its front claws that had already broken through swung violently as dense Destruction Energy surged out wildly and collided fiercely with the Life Force released by the Ancient Tree of Life.</p><br/><p>At least a fifth of the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s roots was damaged with a loud rumble. The agitated Destruction Energy rolled upwards and forced its way into dispersing the tremendous Life Energy.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress and the Ancient Tree of Life were one. When the Ancient Tree of Life was attacked, she could not help but bawl and spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. Her determination did not waver at all as she turned her body and transformed into the Goddess of Nature. The Goddess of Nature\u2019s scepter in her hand glowed with a dazzling radiance, and her Life Saint Energy was replenished so she could exert her energy to match the Destruction Energy released by the Nether Lord\u2019s front claws.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, quick! Restore the magic formation. I won\u2019t be able to withstand this for long,\u201d the Elven Empress\u2019 anxious voice echoed. Yes, they could not completely suppress the Nether Lord even with the combined strength of her and the Elf Tribe\u2019s Ancient Tree of Life. That pair of gigantic front claws were still drilling its way out of the seal\u2019s magic formation bit by bit. With every bit that it drilled, the Destruction Energy that was released would become stronger by a few times.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor was already injured from a fatal blow. He was only depending on the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s tremendous Life Force to pull him back from the brink of death with great effort. It was impossible to maintain the Seal Magic Formation anymore. The only person who was capable of maintaining the magic formation currently was Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er were suspended in midair. His expression was solemn because he understood very well that the fate of victory or defeat hung upon this single action.</p><br/><p>The Destruction Energy that the Nether Lord\u2019s front claws released was so pure that there was not even an ounce of impurity. In comparison to Fen Tian\u2019s ability, the Nether Lord was still capable of displaying such formidable power under the double restrictions of the Seal Magic Formation and the Ancient Tree of Life. Zhou Weiqing was well aware that although his Saint Energy was already considered rather pure, he was still not on the same level as the Nether Lord. He could only depend on the magic formation to possibly seal the Nether Lord.</p><br/><p>The Dual God Strength Hammers appeared in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands as thousands of dazzling Saint Energy\u2019s starlight simultaneously bloomed on every part of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Ringless Ground Purging Set in a blink of an eye. The strong Saint Energy\u2019s fluctuation was elevated to the utmost extent in a flash.</p><br/><p>The Destruction Energy emitted by the Nether Lord was immediately repressed and shrank several folds under the influence of the Saint Energy. All the Divine Beasts that were present, the Elven Empress and the Ancient Tree of Life became high spirited.</p><br/><p>\u201cRestore the magic formation, quick.\u201d Zhou Weiqing shouted once as he raised his single-handle Dual God Strength Hammer high above his head. The Astral Divine Territory was unleashed and the dazzling Nebula was spinning wildly while the Saint God Nucleus Core directly leaped out from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest and released a wave of dense yet enormous Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>The strong and powerful aura released by Zhou Weiqing who was at the Maximum-Level of the Heavenly God Tier at this moment even exceeded the prior Dragon Emperor\u2019s. The purity of his Saint Energy inspired confidence in every single one of the Divine Beast.</p><br/><p>The twelve Divine Beasts, including Hui Yao and Duo Si, returned to their designated position in the magic formation once again, and they dispersed their energy and aura to merge with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes were as bright as the dazzling stars as twelve streaks of platinum Saint Light were simultaneously unleashed from that gigantic hammer and reflected onto twelve Divine Beasts\u2019 bodies respectively.</p><br/><p>These Divine Beasts were immediately enshrouded with a layer of platinum-colored radiance. Their energies that were severely depleted initially seemed to be almost fully restored at this moment.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er acted just like how she did earlier during Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian\u2019s battle. She hugged Zhou Weiqing from behind with her hands and infused her Saint Energy into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body without holding back.</p><br/><p>The platinum-colored radiance emitted from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body turned even more intense after the union with Tian\u2019er\u2019s Saint Energy. The strong energy fluctuation that was filled with Creation Aura suppressed the Nether Lord\u2019s Destruction Energy, and it took the pressure of the Elven Empress and the Elf Tribe\u2019s Ancient Tree of Life. The Ancient Tree of Life also lowered itself accordingly in an attempt to suppress the Nether Lord\u2019s Destruction Energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cFen Tian, you\u2019re a useless piece of trash.\u201d The Nether Lord\u2019s hateful voice echoed. If Fen Tian managed to successfully kill Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er, he would have already succeeded at breaking through the seal by now. Although the Dragon Emperor was severely injured, the Netherworld\u2019s seal had lasted for millennia so there was a massive amount of energy accumulated in the magic formation. The Nether Lord could not charge out of the seal in one go. After the eye of the formation was destroyed, he would still need to assemble a large amount of energy to have a chance at breaking through the seal with a single attempt. At this moment, the Saint Energy produced from the merging of the Elven Empress and Zhou Weiqing was forcibly suppressing his charging momentum.</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord did not fear the Life Saint Energy that the Elven Empress and the Ancient Tree of Life released. The true Saint Energy contained in Life Saint Energy was very insignificant and not enough to pose a threat to it.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was different. Despite the fact that his pure Saint Energy was not true Genesis Energy, the only difference between the energies was the level of purity. Although the Nether Lord was well aware that it was impossible for Zhou Weiqing to possess Genesis Energy and become the Genesis God, he still felt slightly afraid in its heart at this moment because he was most familiar with this seal. He knew that once Zhou Weiqing became the core of the magic formation, he would complete the seal using his Saint Energy. The Netherworld\u2019s seal would then become a perfect seal. A seal that was completely free of flaws.</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord came from the crack that he secretly opened from the other side of the seal. Although he relied on the negative emotions from the Boundless Mainland\u2019s people to strengthen his body, he would still vanish once the seal was completed and perfected.</p><br/><p>Only the Nether Lord had a clear grasp on his own situation. He would need to continuously absorb negative emotions in order to strengthen himself and also, to maintain himself.</p><br/><p>He had been absorbing negative emotions from the outer world since the day he was born. Moreover, not only would he stop growing stronger, he would continuously be weakened until he vanished for eternity if he lost the supply of negative emotions.</p><br/><p>That was the reason why the Nether Lord would never allow Zhou Weiqing to maintain and complete the seal no matter what. If that happened, it was equal to announcing his own death sentence. He really regretted not discovering that someone actually possessed the true Saint Energy earlier so that he could slaughter that person before he grew stronger. He was under the assumption that his own plan was perfect until this point. It was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s appearance that became a variable in this situation. The variable had already grown into a state where it was enough to affect his existence now, how could he not be filled with enmity?</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord\u2019s two front claws suddenly stopped swinging. A tiny black-colored light mass appeared in the middle, between the two front claws. At this moment, he had already exerted his ultimate source of energy in order to break the seal and stop the seal from being completed again. This ultimate source of energy was refined by it after millennia, and there was only a small portion of this energy left. However, the Nether Lord could not care less about the amount currently. As long as he could break through the seal and arrive at the Boundless Mainland, everything else could be rebuilt again hereafter. He had a wild ambition of using the Boundless Mainland as a springboard to strengthen his body. His next goal was to progressively devour the entire universe and make himself into a force that controlled and governed everything.</p><br/><p>The dark radiance was flooded with endless darkness. The mass that was the ball of light continuously grew bigger, and the Destruction Energy in it was terrifying. It turned into a dark green light shield that could not be penetrated by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy or the Elven Empress\u2019 Life Saint Energy. The energy would disappear into thin air upon coming into contact with the dark green light shield.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could only shudder in fear when he sensed the Destruction Energy that was expanding continuously in the black mass of light. This was because he could sense that the waves of Destruction Energy within it was the purest Destruction Energy in the world, and it could truly compare to Genesis Energy. This was a powerful energy that he could not completely resist. Even his Saint Energy that was considered to be very pure would vanish upon contact with the aura released by this Destruction Origin Energy. Furthermore, the Creation Feature that was contained in his Saint Energy would be destroyed by this Destruction Origin Energy into nothingness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her back was facing Zhou Weiqing, and she refused to look at him again as she held on to the dragon\u2019s horn.</p><br/><p>Last but not least, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s sight finally landed on Tian\u2019er who was staring at him but did not come near him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er stared at Zhou Weiqing nonchalantly, \u201cI know you better than they do so you don\u2019t have to persuade me anymore. You don\u2019t have any reason to talk me out of it either. I have the Saint Energy, too! You\u2019re allowed to sacrifice for the mainland so why am I not allowed to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But, our child is in your tummy!\u201d Zhou Weiqing let out a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er continued on indifferently, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want my child to lose his father before he\u2019s even born. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d rather die together with our family of three. Don\u2019t say anything else. If you try to stop me from going by force or make me unconscious, I\u2019ll kill myself the moment I wake up, regardless of whether you\u2019re able to come back alive! I\u2019m sure you know my temper very well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Stumped, Zhou Weiqing stared at Tian\u2019er. He was at a loss for words. Indeed, among all the other girls, Tian\u2019er was the one who understood Zhou Weiqing the most. The time the two of them spent together cultivating was the longest, and they had created the Saint Energy together. Their minds were also very much in sync. As she watched how Zhou Weiqing dealt with the few other girls, Tian\u2019er naturally had her own countermeasure.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Xue Ao\u2019tian with a slightly helpless look as he tried to ask his father-in-law to help him with this matter. However, Xue Ao\u2019tian merely shook his head at him gently, \u201cAlthough Tian\u2019er is my daughter, I\u2019m actually on her side regarding this matter. If it\u2019s not for the fact that we don\u2019t have any Saint Energy that can help you, I\u2019d definitely go with you together as well. Weiqing, stop thinking too much. You have to understand that if you don\u2019t succeed this time, it\u2019s very likely that our world will disappear. At best, we\u2019ll probably just live slightly longer than you. With Tian\u2019er\u2019s help, the chances of you succeeding will be much greater. Bring her along with you. We\u2019ll wait for your good news right here. No matter how difficult the situation that you face, you must have faith in yourself. We\u2019ll be waiting for your triumphant return!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head silently before he solemnly swore to Xue Ao\u2019tian, \u201cEven if I die, I\u2019ll die in front of Tian\u2019er! I\u2019ll use my life to protect her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Relief could be seen in Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s eyes, \u201cI believe in you!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Elven Empress gradually opened her eyes as well. The twelve Elven Elders were waiting beside her with a worried look.</p><br/><p>All of them also knew that once the Elven Empress left, she might not be able to make it back alive. No matter what, the Elven Empress was still the most powerful ruler in the Elf Tribe for the past ten thousand years. She had brought them great hope. Additionally, all the lives of the Elven Empresses were connected to the Ancient Tree of Life. If an Elven Empress died, the Ancient Tree of Life would wilt as well. It would then need a new Elven Empress to connect her bloodline with it before it could be revived once again. However, if that was the case, the Ancient Tree of Life that had evolved would disappear, and the new tree would return to its original form. This was not a good news for the Elf Tribe at all.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress let out a faint sigh as she looked at the Elders, \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain, too. As the saying goes, how can the eggs remain unbroken when the nest is ruined? If we can\u2019t stop the Nether Lord, we\u2019ll no longer be able to survive. If we fail this time, then there\u2019s nothing else that can be said and done. However, if I die after we succeed, please follow Weiqing and my agreement. Please take our people to the Heavenly Bow Empire and allow them to thrive there. The Peerless Sect will take care of our Elf Tribe. At that time, please let my daughter inherit my throne.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty!\u201d All of the twelve Elven Elders fell to their knees in the air. Grief was apparent in their voices.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress let out a faint smile, \u201cEvery life will come to an end. Moreover, it\u2019s not guaranteed that I\u2019ll die. Weiqing will be the true combat force in this battle, and I\u2019m just merely assisting from the side. As long as we can suppress the Nether Lord and strengthen the seal, our mission will be completed. Alright, it\u2019s time for us to go now. Otherwise, everything will be too late once the seal is broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Turquoise light retracted at once as it dyed the six wings behind the Elven Empress into the same color as well. In just a flash, she re-emerged by Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Two loud dragon roars resonated in the air. The roar was filled with complete hatred. Hui Yao and his wife, Duo Si, flew in front of Zhou Weiqing and the other two before he said in his deep voice, \u201cI\u2019ll carry you there. Let us work together. No matter what, we can\u2019t let the Nether Lord have his way!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing saw Hui Yao\u2019s blood-stained eyes, he sighed secretly in his heart. However, he could not bring himself to say any comforting words to him at all. After all, the scar that was etched in this couple\u2019s heart was just too deep.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Zhou Weiqing replied in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, he took hold of Tian\u2019er\u2019s hand and landed on Hui Yao\u2019s head swiftly. The Elven Empress, on the other hand, landed on top of Duo Si\u2019s head all by herself. With another growl, strong fiery red light spewed out from the bodies of both gigantic dragons. As they carried Zhou Weiqing, Tian\u2019er, and the Elven Empress, they turned around and flew directly into the huge abyss that was a cavern on the ground and disappeared in just a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Nobody said a word. With Shangguan Tianyang, Xue Ao\u2019tian, and Long Shiya in the lead, all of the powerhouses of this generation slowly closed their eyes and said a silent prayer in their hearts. Without a doubt, all of them understood very well that Zhou Weiqing and the rest would not be able to defeat the Nether Lord. Due to this reason, all they could do was pray that the entire sealing process would be completed without a glitch.</p><br/><p>As they flew into the abyss, the surrounding air suddenly turned cold. Fortunately, Hui Yao and Duo Si both had a strong affinity to the Fire Element, and it was thanks to this that they managed to drive the cold away. All that Zhou Weiqing and the rest could feel was a warm and pleasant atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing,\u201d Hui Yao\u2019s voice suddenly echoed in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hui Yao?\u201d When he first came across Hui Yao, he was still a very feeble and ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master, but now he had grown into a powerhouse who was at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier similar to Hui Yao. Moreover, he was a Maximum Level Heavenly God who possessed a Saint God Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao told Zhou Weiqing in a very deep voice, \u201cWeiqing, I know it\u2019s very likely that I won\u2019t have a chance to avenge my children. Ever since I knew you, you\u2019ve helped us out many times, and every time we\u2019re with you, our problems were solved without many difficulties. What I\u2019m trying to say is this time, if you who possesses Saint Energy has a chance to kill the Nether Lord, please do so with all your might! If you can kill him and avenge my children, Duo Si and I are willing to become your slave and servant in the future. We\u2019ll guard you and your offsprings for the rest of our lives, forever and ever until the end of time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was taken aback. He could feel the persistence and determination, along with a hint of helplessness and despair in Hui Yao\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath as he spelled out his words slowly, \u201cI\u2019ll give it my best and do everything in my power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Hui Yao\u2019s voice quivered a little.</p><br/><p>The conversation ended, and they did not continue speaking about it any longer. Zhou Weiqing took a clear look at the surroundings calmly.</p><br/><p>The huge cave was probably a thousand meters wide in diameter. Due to this, even a body as large as Hui Yao and Duo Si could fly inside the cave side by side without being overcrowded.</p><br/><p>The cave wall was a dark gray color. A faint Destruction Energy could be felt in there. It was apparent that this cave was not artificially dug out. Instead, it seemed like it was blasted open by a powerful force.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing asked the Elven Empress who was seated on Duo Si\u2019s head, \u201cSince we\u2019re going to face the Nether Lord soon, please do tell me more about it. After all, I\u2019m not very well-informed regarding this matter. How did it manage to come here in the first place?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress nodded her head, \u201cWell, in truth, the appearance of the Nether Lord was actually caused by you human beings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe, humans, were the one who caused it to appear?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked, perplexed.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress nodded her head, \u201cYes. When the Nether first appeared, it did not have a living body at all. To be more precise, it\u2019s a powerful force of living things that evolved from energy. It made its appearance during the first emergence of living things in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what kind of energy is it actually? And where does this Destruction Energy originated from?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress replied, \u201cIt\u2019s from all the negative emotions that come from human beings. It\u2019s mainly from resentment, hatred, fear, bloodlust and so on. These negative emotions then merged together and formed themselves into Destruction Energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>She saw the disbelief in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes as she continued, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, isn\u2019t it? You may think that it\u2019s a little too much for me to blame everything on you human beings. However, the fact is, it indeed stemmed from all the negative emotions that you human beings feel. In ancient times, the Dragon Tribe and we from the Elf Tribe were the main rulers of this mainland. Even though we also had wars that time, there were only a few wars that actually took place. Moreover, we did not have those backstabbing, scheming tactics that you human beings always employ. What played the biggest role here was population.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Elf Tribe and the Dragon Tribes were particularly strong in the past. However, even during our most prosperous period, our population was barely one in ten-thousandth of the population of human beings now. You human beings have reproductive abilities that we envy to death. Additionally, all of you also use underhanded schemes to get ahead among each other. For this reason, the number of negative emotions naturally increased.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the beginning, these negative emotions were merely coming off your bodies. However, with the continuous increase of these negative emotions, some of the energy began to mutate and opened up a small realm of its own. In ancient times, we used to call this the Animus Realm. At first, when the realm was just opened, it was so small that it was almost impossible for anyone to detect it. However, with the gradual strengthening of you human beings, to the point that you gradually became the ruler of this mainland, wars and slaughtering continued to repeat itself again and again. This was how the Animus Realm became bigger and bigger as time goes by. By the time we discovered this realm, it had already formed its own consciousness and was already out of control. That\u2019s the Nether Lord that we all know now.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

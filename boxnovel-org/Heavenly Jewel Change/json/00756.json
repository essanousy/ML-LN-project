They had extended their pursuit to the Heavenly Bow Empire to completely resolve their issues in the west by simultaneously annihilating the Heavenly Demon Sect and the entire higher ranks of the Heavenly Bow Empire. Regardless of how formidable an army was, the army would not be able to demonstrate much of its force without a spectacular commander. Furthermore, without higher-tier weapons, attacks from a few powerhouses would be sufficient to eliminate hundreds of thousands from the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s armies. At the very least, they would be stuck.</p><br/><p>It was naturally Zhou Weiqing who was walking between Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue and Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya. He had a faint smile on his face. It seemed like he was on a holiday. They continued walking before they stopped thirty meters away from the Blood Red Hell powerhouses.</p><br/><p>The Fourth Elder of Blood Red Hell grunted, \u201cWu Yunyue, there are only these few people left in the Heavenly Demon Sect? If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll grant you a final chance. As long as you\u2019re willing to lead the Heavenly Demon Sect and join the Blood Red Hell, we can overlook everything that has transpired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue\u2019s eyes reddened slightly when he looked at those people. However, he was a Demonic Emperor. Thus, he forcefully contained his fury and said coldly, \u201cDream on, Fourth Elder. Nobody knows who\u2019ll be the victor today. Since you\u2019ve called us out for a final battle, let\u2019s set the rules today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fourth Elder of Blood Red Hell laughed out loud before he said, \u201cWith just a few of you, you think you make me? You\u2019re nothing more than mere ants in our eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took two steps forward, distinguishing himself from the duo at his side. He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Zhou Weiqing, nice to meet you. Since you\u2019re the ones who called for the battle, it\u2019ll only be appropriate for you to give us an explanation. To be honest, I fear death, and I don\u2019t want to die at all. How about we have a bet? If you win, spare our lives and all of us will surrender to the Blood Red Hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing what he had said, Third Elder of Blood Red Hell laughed loudly after looking at the charming smile on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face, \u201cAre you Zhou Weiqing? It seems like you\u2019re nothing more than a young man who\u2019s greedy for life and scared of death. We, the Blood Red Hell, will not casually take in trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>The grin on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face did not falter, \u201cYour words are wrong, senior. I may not be a person with immense talent. However, at the very least I\u2019ve reached Heavenly King Tier in my twenties, I\u2019m not lacking at all potential wise. I didn\u2019t mean that only a few of us will surrender. I\u2019m willing to represent the entire Heavenly Bow Empire in the surrender. I believe all of you are aware that I single-handedly led the reclamation of the Heavenly Bow Empire. Therefore, I\u2019ve the power to make this decision. I don\u2019t know if all of you dare to place this bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Third Elder was about to speak again, First Elder raised his arm and stopped him. He then asked Zhou Weiqing flatly, \u201cHow do you want to bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cSince you called for a battle, we\u2019ll naturally be competing with our powers. You have more people, and we have fewer people. How about this? We\u2019ll have fewer rounds instead. I believe each of you know about the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. I suggest that we fight according to the Heavenly Jewel Tournament\u2019s preliminary rules to decide on the final victor. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve participated in two Heavenly Jewel Tournaments. I managed to advance to the top four after defeating Dandun Empire and achieved the final victory. Therefore, I\u2019m still quite familiar with the rules of combat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018To fight according to the rules of Heavenly Jewel Tournament? Won\u2019t that be four rounds of one-on-one and another round of two-on-two battles?\u2019 They thought.</p><br/><p>These Blood Red Hell powerhouses had all been young once. Therefore, quite a number of them had participated in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament before. This arrangement was not foreign to them.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s suggestion had invoked the interest in quite a few of them. After all, no matter how they looked at it, Zhou Weiqing and his people were not sufficient to threaten the Blood Red Hell. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing looked like he was just looking for an excuse to justify their surrender.</p><br/><p>First Eder said flatly, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t agree? You people don\u2019t have the right to be discussing terms with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing spread open his arm and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree to this, we can only call this off. Our powers may be far inferior to yours but if we run, nobody knows how many of us you\u2019ll be able to catch.\u201d</p><br/><p>First Elder\u2019s eyes shone, \u201cAre you saying that if we agree with your bet, you won\u2019t run away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said, \u201cIf you win, all of us will surrender. After we\u2019ve surrendered, I believe that the Blood Red Hell won\u2019t treat us poorly. Why would we attempt to escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>First Elder\u2019s gaze swept across the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and the Demonic Emperor. \u201cYou, a mere youngster, are calling the shots?\u201d</p><br/><p>Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue suppressed the fury and distaste in his heart and nodded strongly. He said, \u201cThis is the result of our discussion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was too lazy to speak so he simply nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>First Elder smiled casually and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll agree with this bet. You can send your first representative.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cI have another suggestion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hot-tempered Third Elder of Blood Red Hell said angrily, \u201cWhy does a brat like you have so much nonsense to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cI\u2019m just proposing my personal idea. It\u2019s up to you whether you agree or not. What I mean is, since this is a bet to decide our fates, let\u2019s not restrict the number of times a person can battle. Everyone can participate more than just one time. Furthermore, to decide the victory with just five rounds will be unfair since you\u2019ve so many people on your side. I don\u2019t want to be a freeloader so we\u2019ll decide who\u2019s the winner with seven rounds. Two of these will be two-on-two while the rest are one-on-one. The side with more wins will be the victor.\u201d</p><br/><p>First Elder of Blood Red Hell was momentarily stunned. He had been wary of the smiling young man because he felt that this youngster seemed to be laying his trap and coaxing them to fall deeper into it. Nevertheless, because of their formidable power, he was not bothered at all even if Zhou Weiqing had any cunning plans up his sleeves. Therefore, he agreed to the bet. He planned to resolve the issue here once and for all and to return to the Blood Red Hell earlier to handle other affairs.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s proposal made him change his mind. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s suggestion was simply too advantageous to the Blood Red Hell. There were four Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell whereas there was only two of them on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side. The more rounds there were, the less restricted it would be for the participants. Obviously, it was obviously more beneficial to them. Although the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was incredibly strong, the Four Elders of Blood Red Hell were no ordinary Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses either. Not only did they possess the Destruction Attribute, First Elder was at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Emperor Tier. Thus, they did not think that they would lose against Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was impossible to reign in one\u2019s power in a clash between Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses. Under such circumstances, even if a person had won a round, it was almost impossible to have any energy left to battle the next opponent.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the First Elder really thought that Zhou Weiqing was just looking for an excuse to justify their surrender and join the Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>If they were really able to take the Heavenly Bow Empire under their wings, it would be a great news to the Dandun Empire. They would then be able to make their moves on the battlefield without any restrictions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll follow your suggestion.\u201d First Elder agreed to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s proposal without any hesitation, \u201cNow, send in your first representative.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the First Elder of Blood Red Hell had already significantly lowered his guard, he did not look down on Zhou Weiqing and his group since he was cunning. Therefore, he had asked Zhou Weiqing to select their first participant so they could plan accordingly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly and said, \u201cThis is not good, senior. If our side has to send out a participant first all the time, we won\u2019t stand a chance at all. How about this? We\u2019ll send our participant first for this round, and you send yours first for the next round. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Four Elders of Blood Red Hell began to feel irritated. Zhou Weiqing kept on raising various suggestions but he had been smiling the entire time. Although both sides had opposing opinions, they would naturally not mind these details given their status.</p><br/><p>First Elder nodded and said, \u201cWe\u2019re fine with it. Let\u2019s start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stepped forward again and said, \u201cWell then, our first participant will be me. I wonder which of you will be willing to enlighten me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Four Elders of Blood Red Hell were all stunned. Although Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base might have reached the Heavenly King Tier according to their sources, and he had also admitted to it, they really had not taken the young man seriously. Regardless of his age and the fact that he had entered the Heavenly King Tier, there was no possible way that he could be on equal standing with the experienced Heavenly King-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>The overall strength of the Heavenly Demon Sect was the weakest among the five Great Saint Lands but they were famed for their individual battle prowess. In their opinion, any one of the Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s Heavenly Kings would be far more powerful than Zhou Weiqing. The elders simply did not understand why they would send Zhou Weiqing out to fight.</p><br/><p>First Elder waved and said, \u201cTian Lei, you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>From behind the four elders, an old man with a slender physique who seemed to be in his sixties walked out.</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s gaze was cold and there were no emotions of any sort on his face. He walked out from behind the four elders and gave them a bow. After that, he walked to Zhou Weiqing and maintained his distance.</p><br/><p>All Four Elders of Blood Red Hell had thought that it would not be convenient for them to fight against a young man like Zhou Weiqing. Nevertheless, this person sent by First Elder was also a famed powerhouse from the Blood Red Hell. With the immense powers of the Heavenly King Tier, it was expected that he would enter the realm of the Heavenly Emperor Tier in the future. It could be said that they took Zhou Weiqing quite seriously.</p><br/><p>A faint light shone and a gentle grin appeared on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face. He put his hands together and paid his respect courteously. He said, \u201cI\u2019m Zhou Weiqing, please enlighten me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Lei spared a cold glance at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cEnough of this nonsense. Let\u2019s begin.\u201d While he said that, he had actually folded his left hand behind his back. It seemed like he intended to deal with Zhou Weiqing with only one hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

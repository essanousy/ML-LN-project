He spent his days in fulfillment, continuously improving himself. Of course, he also made some Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. However, due to his cultivation base, nobody forced him to make any God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. It was obvious that the Mysterious Heavenly Palace placed more importance on grooming him into a reserve God Tier Master.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was happy with the arrangement. However, to prove his worth, he still made ten sets of Master Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls every month in addition to a set of Zong Master Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls that was sent up to the officials. Compared to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s continuous improvement, Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s improvement was even more obvious. Since she was not a Consolidated Equipment Master, she did not have to think about any other matters apart from cultivating. Besides being with Zhou Weiqing every day and doing things she enjoyed, she was focused on her cultivation.</p><br/><p>With the help of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy and her own effort, her cultivation had improved so fast that even Zhou Weiqing was stunned. She was almost at the peak of the Seventh Jewel cultivation base. According to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s calculations, if she continued at the same speed, Bing\u2019er might break through to the Eight Jewel in less than three months. In fact, even Shangguan Fei\u2019er who grew up in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace was not at the Eighth Jewel cultivation base.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, there\u2019s a meeting at the Heavenly Court.\u201d Meng Xing\u2019s pleasant voice came from behind the door.</p><br/><p>The accommodations on the sixth level of the Mysterious Heavenly Castle were completely isolated. Each of them covered a large area, and their living quarters were separated. Without the permission of the owner, even the other upper echelons of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace who were staying on the same level were prohibited from entering.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing opened the door as soon as he heard Meng Xing\u2019s voice. She was wearing a light purple dress that made her look graceful today. Throughout the past month, Zhou Weiqing and Meng Xing had gotten closer. This beautiful God Tier Master\u2019s attractiveness was more potent than he had imagined. Beauty aside, she was also smart. Her vast knowledge made her Zhou Weiqing\u2019s teacher and confidant when it came to making Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. Meng Xing was also the one who visited Zhou Weiqing the most frequently. Meanwhile, Zhou Weiqing had never seen the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master ever since the day of the banquet.</p><br/><p>With regards to Zhou Weiqing and Meng Xing\u2019s encounter, Shangguan Bing\u2019er only said one thing to him. \u201cThe sisters won\u2019t allow you to bring another one back. Think it through, wisely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdmiration, it\u2019s just pure admiration\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing replied. Of course, he looked mesmerized when he replied her. He had been warning himself to behave every day and to not start relationships with other women. He had also been trying his best. Besides matters concerning Consolidated Equipment Scrolls, he hardly had any other conversations with Meng Xing. Neither did he ask Meng Xing about her personal life. All he knew was that she was not married and she was twenty-nine years old.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing asked curiously as he could not help but sweep his gaze at Meng Xing a few times, \u201cMeeting? What meeting is it?\u201d He had never been to the seventh level despite having spent so much time here.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing said in all seriousness, \u201cFollow me right now. The meetings at Heavenly Court are always important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zhou Weiqing replied. He turned around to speak to Shangguan Bing\u2019er, who was cultivating in the room, before following Meng Xing.</p><br/><p>As he walked beside Meng Xing, Zhou Weiqing asked out of curiosity, \u201cHow do we get to the seventh level?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing smiled and replied, \u201cJust follow me. Only the Palace Master has the authority to open the seventh level. It\u2019ll automatically open every time there\u2019s a meeting at the Heavenly Court.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they conversed, Meng Xing brought Zhou Weiqing to the central zone of the sixth level. Usually, it was just a round empty clearing. However, at that moment, there was an odd symbol on the ground. Zhou Weiqing was shocked to see the symbol as it looked very similar to his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. It was also an image of a hexagram but there was an extra ring on the periphery.</p><br/><p>\u201cStep up.\u201d Meng Xing walked up to the hexagram first. Zhou Weiqing knew that it was something like a Teleportation Formation. It was no wonder he had never seen the entrance to the seventh level. As the both of them stepped onto the hexagram, Meng Xing injected a burst of Heavenly Energy into the formation from her feet. As a light flashed by, the both of them were teleported elsewhere.</p><br/><p>It was a huge hall. The most peculiar thing about it was that there was a indiscernible bright brilliance around. Zhou Weiqing was awed. From the looks of it, the seventh level of the Mysterious Heavenly Castle was not an actual place but a dimension like the Luster Spatial Realm. Although it was not as huge, complete, and real as the Luster Spatial Realm, the fact that the Mysterious Heavenly Palace owned a parallel realm like this proved how powerful it was.</p><br/><p>There was an oval table in the middle of the hall. The four Supreme Elders sat on the left and God Tier Master Nie Han sat alone in the second seat on the right. The main seat was currently vacant. However, the gigantic armchair had caught Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attention. The armchair was enormous with a backrest that was ten feet tall. The entire chair was made of an unknown translucent material that was like black crystal and carved into the shape of a gigantic black dragon. The dragon\u2019s head was situated in the middle of the armchair. Its eyes were made of two red precious stones that were the size of a fist. The red stones were shining brightly, giving it a demonic aura.</p><br/><p>A black, gigantic dragon? Zhou Weiqing had never heard about it before. He thought to himself, \u2018Could it be the Dreadfiend Sea Naga? That can\u2019t be right. The Dreadfiend Sea Naga should be dark blue in color, not black.\u2019</p><br/><p>Meng Xing walked silently to the first seat on the right side of the oval table and sat down while Zhou Weiqing took the third seat naturally. The four Supreme Elders had their eyes trained on Zhou Weiqing. He felt uneasy being watched by four Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouses at the same time.</p><br/><p>Just like the Five Great Saint Lands of the Boundless Mainland, which each had their own specialties, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace had its own specialty as well. Their specialty was the Blackness Attribute. That\u2019s right, it was Blackness, not Darkness. The two attributes were different. The Blackness Attribute was exclusive to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>All of the core members of the upper echelon had a Heavenly Jewel of that attribute among other Heavenly Jewels that they owned. That included the Elders and Supreme Elders, as well as Meng Xing and Nie Han. Zhou Weiqing was the only exception. However, he had a special connection with the Blackness Attribute.</p><br/><p>The difference between the Blackness Attribute and the Darkness Attribute was that the former was slightly superior to the latter. The Blackness Attribute possessed some Evil Attribute. It could be considered a type of Darkness, so the combination of Darkness and Evil attributes formed a new attribute. However, compared to the Evil Attribute, it was less powerful. Moreover, none of the masters who were present had Heavenly Jewels of a single attribute. Apart from Blackness Attribute, the four Supreme Elders sitting across him had Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind attributes respectively. Therefore, the people in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace usually addressed them as Elder Water, Elder Fire, Elder Earth and Elder Wind while the normal Elders would be addressed by their names.</p><br/><p>Nie Han\u2019s Heavenly Jewel was naturally the Spatial and Blackness Attribute. On the contrary, Zhou Weiqing had no idea which Heavenly Jewel attribute Meng Xing had despite being the most familiar with her. All he knew was that she had the same Heavenly Jewel as him \u2014 the Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye Jewel. That would mean that Meng Xing also had more than four Heavenly Jewel attributes. That was also the reason why she held a higher position than Nie Han who was also a God Tier Master. Zhou Weiqing had always been curious about Meng Xing. She was only 29! Her cultivation base was at least at the Heavenly King-tier. How did she do that? He had never heard of any Heavenly King Tier that was below thirty years of age on the Boundless Mainland.</p><br/><p>This was the Heavenly Court that everyone talked about. The four Supreme Elders of Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind had solemn expressions on their faces. Based on that, it was obvious the matter that would be discussed at the meeting today was not something the Mysterious Heavenly Palace considered trivial. Zhou Weiqing was puzzled. What exactly could have been so important to the officials of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace? The fact was they did not have any foreign enemies on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. The Mysterious Heavenly Palace was dominant. With their powerful abilities, even if their subordinates were corrupted, it was not necessary for the upper echelons to be so somber.</p><br/><p>Besides, Zhou Weiqing noticed something peculiar. God Tier Master Nie Han, who was sitting next to him, seemed like he also had no idea what was happening either. He looked as puzzled as Zhou Weiqing was. However, Meng Xing had a solemn expression on her face that indicated she knew what was happening. As a God Tier Master, why would Meng Xing know about the event in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace in advance? Just as Zhou Weiqing was pondering over the matter, a blurry shadow appeared in the main seat. It was none other than the masked Palace Master of Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>Everyone stood up immediately and bowed at the Palace Master. The Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master waved his hand. \u201cDispense with the formalities.\u201d He then turned in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s direction and said, \u201cIs Honorary Master Zhou getting used to life in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled as he nodded. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not bad. There\u2019s sufficient material for me to express myself. It\u2019s much easier for me to make Consolidated Equipment Scrolls compared to before when I had to look for the materials myself. Moreover, I can ask for advice from Honorary Master Meng Xing and Honorary Master Nie Han. I\u2019m glad that I decided to join the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Please take a seat, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them sat down while the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace started speaking in a serious tone. \u201cLet\u2019s get down to business. The Dreadfiend Sea Naga has recently been causing trouble at sea. At least a dozen seafaring ships have been destroyed, causing us to suffer heavy losses. If we don\u2019t do anything about it, it might get even more aggressive. Please speak your mind and discuss if we should directly attack it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was stunned when he heard the words \u2018Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019. He thought to himself, \u2018Did I jinx it with my big mouth?\u2019 He did not expect that the Dreadfiend Sea Naga would really appear in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland\u2019s ocean. At the same time, he secretly felt lucky. He and Bing\u2019er would have been in danger if they had encountered the dragon while they were traveling across the ocean. However, he finally understood why the upper echelon of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace looked so solemn. Facing a Heavenly God Tier Heavenly Beast, especially in the ocean where it was strongest, was indeed quite a challenge.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

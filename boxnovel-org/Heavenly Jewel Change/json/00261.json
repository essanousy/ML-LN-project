(1)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>The purplish red light flashed once and disappeared. In the next instant, a large purple symbol appeared on Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s head, and the Holy Light Dragon Possession effect was dispelled.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Such a seemingly simple strike, yet the effect was remarkably different. Why was this so? Tang Xian, Shangguan Bing\u2019er and Zhan LingTian could only stare in shock with jaws agape. They could not understand what had actually happened to allow the\u00a0Demonic Dragon Lady that Zhou Weiqing had summoned to breakthrough the defense of a Heavenly God Tier Skill.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Only Shangguan Tianyang was able to see through some of it. After the blow, the body of the\u00a0Demonic Dragon Lady instantly turned illusory once more, slowly vanishing into the air. It was without question that with the single blow of its Dragon Silencing Seal, it had already unleashed all of its power. However, that was not the key. The critical key was in the powerful Demonic Attribute aura that Zhou Weiqing had given off. Not only did it deter Shangguan Tianyue, it had also boosted the Demonic Dragon Lady\u2019s power in that instant.\u00a0</p><br/><p>A Skill to boost another Skill? Furthermore, it was boosting an already powerful that had already stepped into the realm of the Heavenly God Tier. What kind of insanely terrifying Demonic Attribute power was required to do that?\u00a0</p><br/><p>Just as the audience were surprised, the wings behind the floating Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back flapped abruptly. His entire body shot forward towards Shangguan Tianyue like a rocket. As he flew along in midair, ray after ray of dark gold light continued appearing around his body. From the start of the fight until now, he had finally summoned his Consolidated Equipment.\u00a0</p><br/><p>This little rascal was just too cunning. This was the single shared thought amongst the entire audience.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Previously, he had not used any Consolidated Equipment at all, and without a doubt it was because he was afraid that if he used any, it would give Shangguan Tianyue an excuse to use his own as well. Now that Shangguan Tianyue was temporarily sealed by his Dragon Silencing Seal, and was unable to use his Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills, he no longer hesitated to summon it all, boosting himself to the maximum.\u00a0</p><br/><p>That was not the only thing. The giant grey illusory figure behind Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back had also charged along with him. As it chased him in midair, it somehow warped into a bout of grey light, streaming directly into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. In that instant, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body, even his \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set, all turned into a crystalline grey colour, glittering and translucent.\u00a0</p><br/><p>His Dual Legendary Hammers raised up, slamming directly towards Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s head. At the same time, ray after ray of lights lit up around Shangguan Tianyue without any pause.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Absolute Delay. Fetters of Wind. Curse of Doom. Spatial Collapse. All focused on control and restriction, as well as powerful single target Skills. It could be said that in this very moment, Zhou Weiqing was tantamount to six or seven Heavenly King powerhouses unleashing all their Skill simultaneously, the density of fire so high that one could only sigh in admiration. Even Shangguan Tianyue had to admit to himself that he could not accomplish this.\u00a0</p><br/><p>In that moment, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s body actually turned \u2018multi-coloured\u2019, each colour representing various restrictions, boosts, causing him to be unable to dodge anything at all despite having the full power of a Heavenly Emperor. In the end, he could only forcefully lift his arms, circulating his Heavenly Energy with all his might in an attempt to block Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attacks.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes had turned grey and overcast, filling the entire area with the ice cold demonic aura, causing the temperature to drop by at least several dozen degrees.\u00a0</p><br/><p>*BANG*</p><br/><p>The Dual Legendary Hammers slammed directly into Shangguan Tianyue, without any flourishes. To everyone\u2019s surprise, even with Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s powerful physique and thick Heavenly Energy, he was actually sent flying by the hammer blows of Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right foot stomped down hard on the ground, his entire body charging towards Shanguan Tianyue\u2019s flying body in an unforgiving chase. At the same time, his right leg was swirling in the air in an illusory figure, and over a hundred crystalline energy pearls appeared all around Shangguan Tianyue. In the next instant, they all plastered themselves onto him, exploding with a terrifying accompaniment.\u00a0</p><br/><p>This was not so simple as mere Lightning Pearls! Each and every single pearl was glowing with Blue, Black and Grey. It was the Dark Demon God Lightning that he had not used for such a long time. In the past, he had used this Dark Demon God Lightning to defeat Shen Little Demon for the first time, when he was only at the three-Jeweled stage. Currently, more than a hundred of these pearls had appeared, and with his Heavenly King stage cultivation, one could just imagine the collective power of these Dark Demon God Lightning pearls.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s body was still flying in midair, giving a muffled grunt. His clothes were already torn in many areas, and current Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual Legendary Hammers were once again reaching him, slamming into his chest once more.\u00a0</p><br/><p>*PENG*</p><br/><p>This time, Shangguan Tianyue was slammed directly into the ground. The drill grounds existed in another small spatial existence, but even so, his tall and large figure was drilled into the ground. A mouth of blood spurted out from his mouth.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyue!\u201d Tang Xian cried sorrowfully. She no longer cared about any rules, charging towards him in a flash. While in midair, she did not forget to give a savage kick towards Zhou Weiqing, who had just completed his attack.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing did not dodge, even purposely moving his hammers away, allowing his mother in law to kick him in the chest. With his insane defense, how could that swift quick even injure him.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Tang Xian did not have the time to care about Zhou Weiqing, she had already reached Shangguan Tianyue. Currently, her face was pale, the pain in her eyes was clear despite the tears flowing out.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er could only stand there, struck silly, her hands covering her mouth in horror.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Everything had happened just too quickly. From the time that Zhou Weiqing had given a warning, to Shangguan Tianyue falling on the ground critically wounded. All of it had happened in the barely the time it took for a few breaths.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Tang Xian\u2019s hand was carressing Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s chest where it had caved in slightly. Turning her head around to glare at Zhou Weiqing savagely, she snarled: \u201cYou bastard, how could you treat your father in law like that, to strike him so brutally. You\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said with an innocent look on his face: \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you taught me? When I first met you, you taught me to learn as many Control Skills as I could. Earlier, you also told me to beat up Father in Law. I was afraid that if I did not exert myself, you would not allow Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er to marry me. You can\u2019t blame me for this!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Tang Xian was instantly struck speechless. Since Shangguan Tianyue was injured so seriously, she did not bother caring about Zhou Weiqing any longer. Turning back, she carefully carried Shangguan Tianyue out of the hole he was stuck in.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Feeling Tang Xian\u2019s warmth and gentleness, as well as how careful she was treating him, the pale face of Shangguan Tianyue forcefully squeezed out a smile. \u201cXian\u2019er, I am alright. I lost fair and square, it is just that I never expected I would lose to that little brat. That brat Weiqing, to be able to have such power at such a young age, it looks like we can set our minds at ease to leave our daughters to him. Don\u2019t blame him, what he said was right\u2026 you were the one who asked him to beat me up. Now, is your anger assuaged? All these years, you know I really wanted to say sorry to you, to repent sincerely in front of you. However, you never gave me the chance\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak anymore. How are your wounds?\u201d Tang Xian\u2019s eyes were complicated, but it was without question, the majority of her feelings shown was worry and concern.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue shook his head, holding onto her hands. \u201cMy injuries are not important to me at all. Xian\u2019er, do you know? Those years you left me, I was in so much more pain than I am now\u2026 every single day, suffering. It was only until you returned that it got better. However, you still continued ignoring me, and I continued suffering everyday. If you do not forgive me, then I will just stay here and refuse treatment, I might as well just die now. I really cannot endure this emotional and mental torture any longer. I really miss my gentle, loving Xian\u2019er!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>As he spoke up to this point, Shangguan Tianyue began weeping bitterly. Such an age, he was actually crying so bitterly, and he was still coughing out blood at times.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cI forgive you, I forgive you, I won\u2019t ignore you any longer. Tianyue, don\u2019t scare me.\u201d Tang Xian held onto Shangguan Tianyue tightly, the emotions she had kept bottled up for so long finally exploded out.\u00a0</p><br/><p>At this point, Shangguan Bing\u2019er finally broke out of her reverie, and she was just about to charge forward to examine her father\u2019s injuries, but Zhou Weiqing grabbed hold of her.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of me.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er said angrily.\u00a0</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing just held on tighter, giving her a silencing gesture as he winked at her.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er started momentarily. Although she was extremely worried about her father\u2019s injuries, when she saw Zhou Weiqing\u2019s wink, her mind suddenly cleared up. Indeed! No matter how reckless Little Fatty was, for her sake, he would never hurt her father! Could it be\u2026 there was some secret issue?</p><br/><p>In the time she was thinking, Zhou Weiqing had turned to Shangguan Tianyang. Looking at the sandalwood incense that hadn\u2019t even burned to a half point, he smiled faintly and said: \u201cUncle, I think there is no need to continue with this competition right? I think I should have the victory.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>A smile also crossed Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s face, and he nodded, saying: \u201cA girl has to marry out of the family eventually, since I have already spoken the words, I will definitely hold up my end of it. Today, let us settle the betrothal matters.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Standing beside Shangguan Tianyang, Zhan LingTian was unable to say anything to stop it. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, his eyes were filled with disbelief. It was not too long ago when he was far above Zhou Weiqing, and he had felt a strong sense of superiority. Yet\u2026 now? Zhou Weiqing was no longer even on the same level as he was.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Just the fact he had already reached the Heavenly King stage was shocking enough, but now he had even used his Heavenly King stage powers to defeat a Heavenly Emperor Shangguan Tianyue in actual combat. Although he had also resorted to some trickeries to do so, for example manipulating Shangguan Tianyue into not using his Legendary Set, but the power and strength he had displayed was obvious to everyone\u2019s eyes. What else could he say? Could he even say that he deserved Shangguan Xue\u2019er more?</p><br/><p>Although Zhan LingTian was extremely proud, but his character was honest and upright, a real man. He would not speak out in such a way out of character, and could only sigh inwardly as he lowered his head. He knew he had finally lost forever to this fellow in front of him.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s words, he bowed respectfully. \u201cThank you Uncle for fulfilling our wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang glanced at the couple of Shangguan Tianyue before he said with a sweep of his sleeves. \u201cCome, let us move to another place to speak.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>In a flash of light, under the aid of Shangguan Tianyang, the rest of them disappeared from the drill grounds. Of course, this did not include Shangguan Tianyue and Tang Xian.\u00a0</p><br/><p>As they returned to the grand meeting hall, Zhan LingTian did not follow them, instead leaving silently. At this point, there were only the three remaining, Shangguan Tianyang, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

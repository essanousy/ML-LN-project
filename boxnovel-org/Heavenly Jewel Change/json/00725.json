His location was now in the middle of the chest of the massive grey shadow. That humongous grey shadow seemed like it had blended with him in the background.</p><br/><p>The skies and earth were grey and the day was dim. At that moment, the sea was only filled with endless evil.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Zhou Weiqing launched his summons once again, and the Demon God descended.</p><br/><p>The Demon God, summoned by the Ward of the Demon God. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy in his body was close to depletion. However, he himself could clearly feel that this Demon God differed from the one he had summoned previously.</p><br/><p>The previous summon was only an instantaneous appearance of the evil god\u2019s projection. However, this time, he had literally summoned the real evil god, and not just its mere or brief appearance.</p><br/><p>The huge evil god projection just stood in utter silence behind Zhou Weiqing, but that was already sufficient to him.</p><br/><p>What surprised Zhou Weiqing was that the moment the evil god arrived, the Saint Energy in his body had completely vanished and had poured itself into the evil god. However, as the projection had completed its appearance, all the Atmospheric Energy from the heavens and earth gathered toward the evil god\u2019s body in a manner which was incomprehensible to Zhou Weiqing. At the same time, he was also affected; the Saint Energy in his body absorbed these highly concentrated and purified Atmospheric Energy, insanely replenishing his energy.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy within him seemed to be purified once again, just like how a galaxy of stars would be brightened. The 36 Death Acupuncture Points seemed to have stopped spinning crazily, and transformed to 36 devouring mouths, effectively blending these Atmospheric Energy into his own body.</p><br/><p>In fact, even Zhou Weiqing himself was not aware that the reason he was capable of such feats was not only because of the resurrection abilities of his Saint Energy. More importantly, it was due to this own bloodline.</p><br/><p>Within Zhou Weiqing, lay the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodlines. The Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline was at the same level as the Dragon Emperor Bloodline. Within the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline, the strongest would be the stream of Demon God Bloodline. In other words, his inner potential had been released completely under a great deal of stress. It was due to the blending of these Demon God Bloodlines and his Saint Energy, that he was able to summon the true Demon God\u2019s projection.</p><br/><p>It was the legitimate Demon God, surpassing even the ranks of those who were at the Heavenly God-tier and above, Although it was just a projection and thus, could not fight for Zhou Weiqing, the heavens and earth were bounded by its command after it appeared, unless a powerful presence of another being of the same level was also present.</p><br/><p>It was true that this Demon God would be unable to launch an attack like the previous Demon God that Zhou Weiqing had summoned when his cultivation was still insufficient. However, the aura and intimidation it possessed were those of a true Demon God. It was not required to attack in any form, but the instant it appeared, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, which had fallen into the ocean, was overcome by fear. It no longer dared to launch its attack toward Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing himself was immersed in a mysterious state. In just a span of a few breathes, he had fully replenished all the Saint Energy he had consumed previously. Furthermore, there was another elevation to his abilities. The more important thing was that the Saint Energy had been purified again. Subconsciously, he found out that he could touch the boundaries of the 38th-tier.</p><br/><p>\u2018Demon God, did I really resurrect the Demon God?\u2019 he thought.</p><br/><p>Yet, he soon realized he was wrong. He had no way of contacting the resurrected Demon God behind him. There was no way of communication even by sound, the last time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was a little puzzled, but the whole battlefield had changed upon the presence of the Demon God that he had summoned.</p><br/><p>First, was the Dreadfiend Sea Naga which had been aiming for rescue falling abruptly into the deep sea \u2013 it did not even dare to escape. It curled itself into a ball in the waters, emitting all its internal energy to refrain itself from being eroded by the evil terrifying powers.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the Ward of Darkness had the Evil Attribute encompassed in itself. When the outside world had been filled with the Evil Attribute, the powers of the Ward of Darkness were boosted instantly.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga, already in a disadvantageous position, had its momentum suppressed. Its situation had become more dangerous than ever.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s changes had finally been discovered by the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing. When they saw the world outside the Ward of Darkness being engulfed in grey and his body floating amidst the grey shadow, they could not help but halt their offenses.</p><br/><p>\u2018He, he really stopped the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. What power is this? How can it be so frightening?\u2019 thought Meng Xing.</p><br/><p>Neither he nor anyone among the Mysterious Heavenly Palace powerhouses knew how Zhou Weiqing did it, nor could they deduce his true capabilities any further.</p><br/><p>It was then that the Dreadfiend Sea Naga trapped within the Ward of Darkness had raged.</p><br/><p>Regardless of the species of living beings, one would never just wait for death or willingly surrender one\u2019s life when faced with inescapable death, let alone a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse.</p><br/><p>Within the instant of the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing losing their focus, a highly concentrated dark blue beam exploded from the center of its body.</p><br/><p>The layer of blue ray looked so special. It was a shade of blue that nobody had ever come across. The blue gave people feelings of comfort and transparency. The horrifying energy waves seemed to have escalated all of a sudden, and the Dreadfiend Sea Naga would shiver each time the great amount of energy changed. Circular blue light rays exploded from its body one after another. The terrifying atmosphere seemed to be attempting to break through the empowered Ward of Darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Meng Xing thought.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon was shocked, \u201cOh no, it\u2019s going to self-explode from its Nucleus Core. Hurry, stop it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, Meng Xing and the Blackfiend Dragon no longer dared to hold back. If the Dreadfiend Sea Naga were to succeed in self-exploding its Nucleus Core, it was very likely that nobody in the Ward of Darkness would come out alive.</p><br/><p>A concentrated scarlet beam shot to the skies and the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s body immediately lost its colors. However, the whole scarlet beam entered Meng Xing\u2019s body at once and flowed into the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d Meng Xing screamed, and blinding colors exploded from the Blackfiend Dragon Armor Set.</p><br/><p>The crimson light expanded, and the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear flew from Meng Xing\u2019s grasp, instantly transforming into a huge fifty-meter-long Dragon Spear. The crimson beam vanished as soon as it shone.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga intended to self-explode at the very end, while the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing launched their attack: <em>Devastation. </em></p><br/><p>Before this, they had refrained from activating the attack, even if another Dreadfiend Sea Naga had headed their way and posed a big threat, they would still not use that technique. The reason was that upon its launch, Meng Xing and the Blackfiend Dragon would immediately have ninety percent of their powers reduced. To them, this was an attack from their origins.</p><br/><p>The moment <em>Devastation </em>was launched, one could imagine the extent of destruction of an attack which encompassed all of the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing\u2019s energies.</p><br/><p>While a deafening shriek sounded, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga reacted instantaneously. Although it had yet to release all its energy from its Nucleus Core, it still chose to self-explode right there and then. Otherwise, if it were to be struck by<em>Devastation </em>, it would even lose its chance to self-destruct.</p><br/><p>From afar, one could see the whole surface of the sea vibrating violently all of a sudden. In the massive Ward of Darkness, all black rays shrunk for a moment, and then, terrifying sounds of explosion shot out.</p><br/><p>Although there was the assault of <em>Devastation </em>and the barriers of the Ward of Darkness, it was still a self-explosion of a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse!</p><br/><p>The mighty explosive power made every living being shiver. It was at that moment that a humongous mushroom-shaped cloud of a thousand meters formed by the erratic waves appeared at sea.</p><br/><p>Within the radius of a hundred miles, all the living beings in the ocean were annihilated to nothing but mere dust at that very instant \u2013 no lives were spared.</p><br/><p>The projection of the Demon God was meant to possess only the aura and would not be able to withstand any attacks. With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation, even with the aid of Saint Energy, it would be impossible for him to even activate the skills of the Demon God. The Demon God\u2019s projection was intended to make the opponents fearful of attacking itself.</p><br/><p>However, the Demon God\u2019s projection disappeared along with the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s self-explosion. Fortunately, it had been summoned by Zhou Weiqing by using the Ward of the Demon God. When the explosion occurred, all the evil energies immediately surrounded Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, ultimately shielding him.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength was demonstrated. He possessed the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, a solid defense with the Immortal Deity Shield and the protections by the Ward of the Demon God. Although his whole being had been flung away by the horrifying power, he did not really sustain any injuries. Of course, this was also due to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s failure in releasing all the energies of the Nucleus Core. It was struck by <em>Devastation </em>and the concurrent barriers of the Ward of Darkness. Otherwise, it would not be as simple as living in misery within a hundred miles.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly God-tier was an almighty existence! It would not be easy to picture the destruction brought by the death of such a mighty figure.</p><br/><p>In simpler words, if a powerhouse such as the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was to self-detonate its Nucleus Core in the Fei Li Empire, at least half of the beautiful empire would be reduced to nothing. One could only imagine the extent of its destruction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

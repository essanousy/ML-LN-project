The only thing that can restrain his Destruction Energy is your Saint Energy. That\u2019s the reason why you must make your Saint Energy purer than his Destruction Energy. Otherwise, no one would be able to deal with him. Don\u2019t worry. With my help, I believe that we\u2019ll be the ultimate winners.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to the Elven Empress, Zhou Weiqing calmed down a little. Lights flashed and the Astral Divine Territory appeared again, floating above the Demon God\u2019s head. Under the bright starlight, the Demon God that was originally filled with an evil aura unexpectedly looked divine.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d A sad and shrill voice suddenly came from the Destruction God. In the purplish-black light, the Destruction God\u2019s body began twisting and suddenly trembled violently.</p><br/><p>A large hand appeared from the void. A horrifying pull suddenly burst out in the mid-air.</p><br/><p>What was Fen Tian trying to do?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing who was preparing for some action was shocked. What he was most worried about was that Fen Tian would launch an attack against the Peerless Sect in his current state. Those in the Peerless Sect were his companions and loved ones.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s worries were unnecessary. Ten figures surged to the sky from below, toward the large pulling force. However, they did not belong to the Peerless Sect, the Heavenly Snow Mountain, or the Heavenly Expanse Palace. They were powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>Amongst the ten fighters, four were sentient while the other six only had their fighting instincts with them. As they rose to the sky, there was a layer of a dark purple light around their bodies. However, when compared to the Destruction God, the purple light was much lighter.</p><br/><p>What was Fen Tian trying to do? <sup>1 </sup></p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked carefully and discovered that the Blood Red Hell powerhouses who were rising into the air were also shocked. This was obviously not something Fen Tian pre-arranged.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Zhou Weiqing finally understood Fen Tian\u2019s objective.</p><br/><p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!\u2026 A peculiar sound was heard consecutively. The Blood Red Hell powerhouses that rose towards the purple radiance around the Destruction God exploded into clouds of blood. When their bodies exploded, so did their Heavenly Core Nucleus. Then, it formed dark purplish balls of light that merged with the huge, purplish-black radiance. The assimilation of these light balls caused the Destruction God\u2019s body to seemingly fade a little. Only its huge palm continued to face down as it absorbed the mist.</p><br/><p>He was absorbing all those powerhouses that have the Destruction Attribute into himself! Who would have thought that Fen Tian could still perform such a malicious maneuver? It was no wonder he waited until this point to use it. He only did this when he no longer had any alternatives. After absorbing the Destruction Attribute of these Heavenly King-tier powerhouses, his strength would certainly increase immensely.</p><br/><p>The Demon God\u2019s body also flashed at the same time. It was just like what the Elven Empress had said. Zhou Weiqing could not wait any longer. If Fen Tian really completed his merging, who would be able to stop him?</p><br/><p>A ball of light, mixed with platinum and golden colors hovered above the Demon God\u2019s chest. On top of his head, the radiance of the Astral Divine Territory suddenly became richer and stronger. The nebula, formed by tens million rays of starlight formed rotated violently. The eye-catching brilliance clearly illuminated the body of the Demon God.</p><br/><p>The Demon God stretched out his hands and made a downward move. Immediately after that, balls of light rose from beneath and flew toward the Demon God.</p><br/><p>The people from the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley were now in confusion. In the sky, Fen Tian continued to absorb the powerhouses, and within a short time, dozens of people had already exploded into bloody clouds and disappeared into the void just like that. They did not die at the hands of their enemies but by the hands of one of their own. How could they not panic? Among them, the first to be absorbed were the ones in charge of controlling the powerhouses from Blood Red Hell that had lost all sentience, as well as the ones from Love Valley who were controlling the insentient ancestors. However, the Destruction God\u2019s actions resembled that of a greedy, terrifying demon that had no intention of stopping anytime soon.</p><br/><p>Originally, the two sides were evenly matched on the battlefield. This unexpected situation caused a huge confusion among the Blood Red Hell and the Love Valley.</p><br/><p>How could this opportunity be missed by Xue Ao\u2019tian, Shangguan Xue\u2019er, Dongfang Hanyue, and the others? They first probed a little, and after finding out that the power from the Destruction God\u2019s action had no effect on them, they immediately launched an all-around counter attack. Within a short moment, the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley suffered a crushing defeat. In the beginning, they could still put up some resistance. When the Destruction God continued absorbing them one after the other, they were finally unable to hold out any longer. So, they immediately fled and scattered in the sky, trying to escape.</p><br/><p>However, they had forgotten that the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain had already been shrouded in the Destruction Divine Territory. If Fen Tian did not allow them to leave, would they even be able to leave?</p><br/><p>The entire battlefield became chaotic. Although the sky was calm, the crisis that could happen at any moment was even more terrifying.</p><br/><p>At Fen Tian\u2019s side, he was constantly merging with the subordinates that he had drawn to him. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Demon God was also doing something similar, but without any murder involved. Instead, he absorbed the Heavenly Core Nuclei and released it into the Astral Divine Territory. Without a doubt, it was Star Feedback.</p><br/><p>Before this, Zhou Weiqing had already killed several enemy powerhouses. Quite a considerable amount of powerhouses died on the battlefield. Fen Tian needed to absorb it from living bodies but Zhou Weiqing only needed the Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>For a period of time, the Demon God and the Destruction God were immersed in a different colored display of light. The brilliance of creation and destruction sparkled symphonically, sending a continuous dazzling splendor into the sky</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, catch!\u201d Six Ultimate Heavenly God, Long Shiya, swung out his right hand. A beam of light shot high up into the sky. He had killed Shen Mo earlier.</p><br/><p>Before he came here, Zhou Weiqing told his powerhouses that upon killing their enemies, they had to seize their Heavenly Core Nuclei and give them to him as soon as possible. He was now at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier. However, even with Saint Energy, breaking through to the Heavenly God Tier would not be easy. However, as long as he was able to obtain sufficient Heavenly Core Nuclei for his Star Feedback, the chance for a breakthrough would definitely be much greater. The greatest advantage Saint Energy had given him was that he would not need to worry about a possible rebound or his foundation being insufficient.</p><br/><p>When there was confusion on the Heavenly Snow Mountain while Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian were both building their strength, there was a fierce burst of fluctuating energy at the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation.</p><br/><p>The dreamy white clouds disappeared almost instantly. More than a hundred figures scattered all over the sky at breakneck speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Xue, let\u2019s go. Quickly!\u201d Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s voice burst out in the sky. The energy fluctuation that was already very intense spread out even further because of the dispersion of the clouds.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyun were quietly standing on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. They held each other\u2019s hands, looking calm. However, a bright purple color slowly spread out from their chests.</p><br/><p>Xu Ao\u2019tian heard Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s voice and immediately turned his head to take a look. The moment he laid eyes on them, he could not help but gasp with astonishment. He then grabbed Tian\u2019er and escaped.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re going to self-detonate.\u2019</p><br/><p>It was true. Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyun were going self-detonate. They could no longer fight the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation. This was because they had suffered heavy injuries during the collision between the elves and dragons. They could not hold out much longer.</p><br/><p>Dragging Dongfang Hanyue along, the Blackfiend Dragon escaped even faster than Xue Ao\u2019tian. They rushed out immediately after the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation collapsed.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er escaped while holding her two sisters \u2014 one in each hand \u2014 as she flapped the Wings of the Wind God with all her might. Surprisingly, she was not much slower than the Blackfiend Dragon.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the only people Six Ultimate Heavenly God, Long Shiya could help were the members of the Peerless Sect as he quickly fled far away as well. The fighters on the Heavenly Snow Mountain were equally proficient. Unless their parents gave birth to them without both their legs, they ran as fast as they could.</p><br/><p>While everyone scattered away as though they had encountered a plague, the couple quietly held each other\u2019s hands as they slowly turned around to look at one another.</p><br/><p>\u201cXingyun, why are you doing this?\u201d Yun Ruoyun looked distressingly at her husband as she gently caressed his face. Earlier, she had taken the lead in choosing to detonate her Heavenly Core Nucleus in order to give her husband a chance to live.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fool. We\u2019ve been together for nearly a hundred years, never once were we apart from one another. No matter how ambitious I am, no matter how much I desire to rule the world, without you by my side, will all these things even matter?\u201d <sup>2</sup>Huang Xingyun held the hand that was caressing his face.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Love Valley Lord no longer had a treacherous and vicious gaze. Instead, his eyes were filled with an endless affection for his wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we cannot live a glorious life, we\u2019ll have a glorious death! Ruoyun, at the end of the tunnel, we\u2019ll still be together. If there\u2019s a life after this, you\u2019re the only one I\u2019ll want to be with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Ruoyun slowly closed her eyes. She could clearly feel that she could no longer hold back the Heavenly Core Nucleus from exploding. If it was to kill the enemy, they should not stop here.</p><br/><p>However, at this time, their hearts were full of reluctance. They were neither reluctant to part with their lives nor the world. Instead, they were reluctant to part with one another. They wanted one good look at each other for just a moment longer. Although they had been with for close to a hundred years, they were unable to get enough of each other at this moment. They only wanted to be able to imprint the face of their loved one within their hearts.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain was now almost empty. Everyone had run far away as Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyun struggled to restrain the energy that was about to burst within their bodies.</p><br/><p>The two only stared at each other affectionately. It was the end of their love story, but you could say that this was probably the start of an entirely new beginning.</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"106da720-764d-2f63-19b2-b8dc005e1863\">Putting this here cause the author did.</li><li data-annotation-id=\"d27f36a8-3d43-f02f-b640-0b744a73387f\">T_T \u2026\u2026..</li></ol><br/>\n</div>"}

background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u00a0 Both of these two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters came to the same tacit conclusion. \u00a0But\u2026 would Zhou Weiqing actually fail?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The answer\u2026 was yes! \u00a0Of course!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Yes. \u00a0Just after Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pen had completed two arcs, before he had finished even a single complete part of the sketch, a few mistakes appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As had already been explained earlier, even the tiniest of mistakes made during the creation of a Consolidating Scroll would result in immediate failure. \u00a0Every single stroke of this God Tier Consolidating Scroll sketch was finer than a human hair. \u00a0The entire scroll would only be completed after hundreds on thousands of sketched lines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He failed. \u00a0He failed already. \u00a0I knew he was no God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master!</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u00a0 The two stared wide-eyed in surprise at the quick failure\u2026 but for some reason, they also felt a sense of relief in their hearts. \u00a0Perhaps they subconsciously were unwilling to believe that there really was an incredible genius who was just at the five-Jeweled level and twenty-something years of age, yet capable of becoming a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">But\u2026 just as they were about to let out sighs of relief, they suddenly stopped breathing entirely, and their relaxed bodies tensed up once more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pen had made that tiny mistake, something marvelous happened. \u00a0The illusory figure of an odd-looking meaty bug suddenly began to slowly appear behind his back. \u00a0A strange type of energy rippled out from it, causing everything within the entire wood cabin to twist and distort.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The strangest thing was, once the big translucent bug appeared, it gave a bizarre wiggle and caused a stream of silver light to be released from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everything began to happen in reverse. \u00a0Although only a few seconds were reversed, it was enough to go back to the moment before Zhou Weiqing had made the mistake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cTime Attribute!\u201d \u00a0This time, the old man was completely unable to hold himself back. \u00a0He almost instantly blurted these two words out, jumping to his feet in sheer astonishment, no longer able to maintain the slightest bit of calm. \u00a0As for the woman next to him, she had been completely stunned as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Given their cultivation levels, they were naturally able to tell what Zhou Weiqing had just done. \u00a0Time Attribute! \u00a0Only the Time Attribute could\u2019ve produced such an effect! \u00a0Although they didn\u2019t know what technique or Skill Zhou Weiqing had used, just now he had clearly used it to reverse time and cause his pen to return back to the moment just before he had made that mistake, allowing him to continue sketching.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Is this for real?</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u00a0 Suddenly, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters felt as though everything they thought they knew about how the creation of Consolidating Scrolls worked had been completely overturned. \u00a0Not just them \u2013 even Shangguan Bing\u2019er, who had come here alongside Zhou Weiqing, stared wide-eyed at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When they had first arrived, Shangguan Bing\u2019er had actually felt extremely nervous. \u00a0She understood Zhou Weiqing very well and knew that in recent years, he had almost spent no time on creating Consolidating Scrolls. \u00a0How could he possibly be God Tier? \u00a0She wasn\u2019t able to accurately judge just how strong the two people in front of them were, but she could sense that they were at a level beyond what she and Zhou Weiqing could handle. \u00a0If Zhou Weiqing wasn\u2019t able to pass the test, it would be hard for them to leave this place, much less acquire the Spatial Teleportation Gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Zhou Weiqing had repeatedly assured her that he would pass this test, Shangguan Bing\u2019er probably wouldn\u2019t have even permitted him to come here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Shangguan Bing\u2019er had only grown increasingly astonished by what she saw here today. \u00a0That state of becoming \u2018one with the world\u2019 didn\u2019t matter, as she knew the mysteries involved. \u00a0But when Zhou Weiqing first began to create the Consolidating Ink, she immediately realized that she didn\u2019t know nearly enough about her Little Fatty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing had a completely focused look on his face. \u00a0Even though he wasn\u2019t all that handsome, but a woman would always be captivated by the look of her man when he was completely absorbed in his work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When she saw this, Shangguan Bing\u2019er finally understood why Zhou Weiqing said that he would be able to produce a God Tier Consolidating Scroll. \u00a0It might look as though he was relying upon the Time Attribute, but Shangguang Bing\u2019er knew that the key of the matter was actually the Time Attribute Skills being infused with his Saint Energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the journey over to the XuanTian Continent, Shangguan Bing\u2019er had gained a clear understanding of all the many techniques and Stored Skills which Zhou Weiqing had available to him. \u00a0This Stored Skill he had used just now was actually his highest-class Time Attribute Skill, the \u2018Time Reversal\u2019.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This technique had once saved Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s life, which was why Shangguan Bing\u2019er remembered it so clearly. \u00a0However, normally speaking a technique like Time Reversal would cause time to go backwards by a full hour. \u00a0Even if Zhou Weiqing improved his cultivation level, he would at most be able to gain enough control to extend it to a day or perhaps even longer, not shorter. \u00a0More importantly, once used the Time Reversal technique started the user would be unable to stop the process, much less change midway through the process. As such, despite its great power, its practical effects were less so.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However\u2026 Zhou Weiqing had somehow succeeded in controlling it. \u00a0Without question, he must have relied on his Saint Energy to cast the Time Reversal, causing this relatively useless Heavenly God Tier Skill to suddenly become truly monstrous in power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing was no God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in practice, but he had the knowledge. Now, thanks to this \u2018Time Reversal\u2019 technique, he was able to slowly complete a God Tier Consolidating Scroll one step at a time. \u00a0So what if he made mistakes? \u00a0He\u2019d just reverse time and fix it! \u00a0So long as he could successfully complete one stroke at a time, he\u2019d eventually succeed in finishing the entire thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As for the expenditure in Saint Energy? \u00a0To Zhou Weiqing, he only needed to use a tiny amount to keep the effect active. \u00a0The energy expenditure was virtually negligible. \u00a0He was after all a nine-Jeweled cultivator. However, even if he really was just a five-Jeweled cultivator, the low energy expenditure meant that he should still be able to sustain this process.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Little Fatty, you really are brilliant.</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u00a0 The only thing which Shangguan Bing\u2019er felt was approval. \u00a0Her Little Fatty was simply too brilliant. \u00a0Clearly, he had already come up with this plan when he first proclaimed himself a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. \u00a0He had prepared everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing continued with his manufacturing process. \u00a0By now, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters were completely stupefied. Yes, his manufacturing technique was absolute \u2018cheating\u2019; they could see this right away. \u00a0But\u2026 he had the Time Attribute! \u00a0This was an innate gift, an absolutely extraordinary innate gift!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The attributes which Zhou Weiqing had already demonstrated included wind, space, and time. \u00a0When you combined these three mighty attributes together, they allowed an incredibly powerful and incredibly talented God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master to arise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When Zhou Weiqing had first learned of Consolidating Scrolls and had been learning from Huyan Aobo, Huyan Aobo had been absolutely overwhelmed with joy to discover that he had all three of these attributes. \u00a0Now, Zhou Weiqing had transformed this \u2018overwhelming joy\u2019 into \u2018overwhelming shock\u2019 and delivered it to the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters of XuanTian Palace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Most importantly of all, they didn\u2019t even recognize the Time Reversal technique which Zhou Weiqing was using. \u00a0Even if they did, they wouldn\u2019t believe that it was the same \u2018Time Reversal\u2019 technique, as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s version allowed him to fully control time within a specific duration. \u00a0If this technique wasn\u2019t used for creating a Consolidating Scroll and was instead used in battle\u2026 how terrifying would that be?!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What they didn\u2019t know was that even when activated via Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing was only able to reverse time by five seconds while maintaining \u2018absolute control\u2019 over it. \u00a0In addition, it wasn\u2019t quite as easy as Shangguan Bing\u2019er had thought it to be. \u00a0Although it was true that this process took up very little Saint Energy, it consumed an enormous amount of mental energy. \u00a0Zhou Weiqing himself hadn\u2019t expected this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Thankfully, he wasn\u2019t actually a five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, but a nine-Jeweled one. \u00a0In addition, his mental energy far surpassed that of an ordinary person\u2019s! \u00a0Given the above, Zhou Weiqing was able to continue with the manufacturing process despite the intensity of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time continued to tick away. \u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s forehead became beaded with sweat, but there was no way he would ever let that sweat drip down upon the Consolidating Paper. \u00a0A layer of strange spatial energy had already formed directly above it, flicking away anything besides the pen which fell down upon it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was the first time Zhou Weiqing had so seriously and determinedly worked on putting together a Consolidating Scroll, one stroke of the pen at a time. \u00a0The scroll he was working on was naturally for the equipment he was most familiar with \u2013 the \u2018Hate Ground No Handle\u2019 Legendary Set. \u00a0He was creating his seventh Consolidated Equipment, which he was desperately in need of.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He had already reached the nine-Jeweled stage, but he only had five pieces of the Hate Ground No Handle set. \u00a0If you factored in the Overlord Bow, he only had six pieces of Consolidated Equipment in total. \u00a0If he was able to create another part of the Hate Ground No Handle set, his cultivation power would explode once more as he doubled in strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It must be remembered that his physical strength had already reached a terrifying level. \u00a0If it was doubled once more\u2026 Zhou Weiqing felt absolutely confident that he could battle even high level Heavenly Kings! \u00a0He might be able to given even max level Heavenly Kings a fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As for Heavenly Emperor powerhouses? \u00a0He didn\u2019t even want to think about them, nor did he want to test them out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Time continued to flow on. \u00a0Zhou Weiqing had arrived at dawn, but by now it had already begun to darken outside without him realizing it. \u00a0His skin had lost its luster, transforming to become rather sallow, but the determination in his eyes had never wavered in the slightest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">By now, he had reached the very final stages of creating this Consolidating Scroll. \u00a0Not much of the Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body had been used up, but he could feel that his mind and spirit had been all-but drained empty. \u00a0Maintaining this process was causing him to feel an ear-splitting headache. \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that his willpower, tested repeatedly by the Immortal Deity Technique, was incredibly strong\u2026 he probably would\u2019ve collapsed long ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The process of creating a God Tier Consolidating Scroll allowed for brief pauses, but it didn\u2019t allow for any complete halts. \u00a0If you truly stopped, all of your earlier work would be for nothing. \u00a0This was yet another reason why God Tier Consolidating Scrolls could only be created by Heavenly Kings.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

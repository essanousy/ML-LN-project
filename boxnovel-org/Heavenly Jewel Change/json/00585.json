At that point, he could actually vaguely sense the inner circulations of Heavenly Energy for both Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, your Devour Skill evolved?\u201d Tian\u2019er asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, his voice still cold from the change. \u201cIt seems like when my Heavenly Energy cultivation level reached the six-Jeweled stage, it automatically evolved, just that I had never really noticed or activated it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Tian\u2019er extended her hands out. \u201cCome, let\u2019s try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at that scene, Shangguan Xue\u2019er suddenly felt her heart race. She had never had a favourable impression of Tian\u2019er, but in that instant, that feeling changed. Without question, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current state and the Devour Skill was extremely terrifying, but Tian\u2019er did not hesitate to offer herself as a test subject. What kind of trust did that require? It might just be a simple detail, but from that alone Shangguan Xue\u2019er was sure that Tian\u2019er was willing to sacrifice everything for Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded. He had absolute confidence in his control, and his hands grasped on Tian\u2019er\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>As their hands met, Tian\u2019er\u2019s entire body started shuddering violently like she was being electrocuted. Standing at the side, Shangguan Xue\u2019er could clearly see a circle of eye-piercing light burst out of Tian\u2019er\u2019s body, flying right into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Heavens! That was\u2026</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er widened her eyes in surprise. The Boundless Infinitum Technique she cultivated in was extremely sensitive towards even minor changes in energy flow, especially at such close proximity. She could clearly sense Tian\u2019er\u2019s Heavenly Energy flowing crazily into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Not only that, it was as if Tian\u2019er\u2019s entire body had been Sealed, and besides Devouring the Heavenly Energy, even her life energy and vitality were being drained out of her. Originally, Tian\u2019er\u2019s smooth silky skin was starting to darken, even her soul and spirit were trembling violently.</p><br/><p>What a terrifying Skill.</p><br/><p>As the actual parties concerned, both Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er had an even stronger sense of that. The instant that Zhou Weiqing held onto Tian\u2019er\u2019s hands, he immediately felt as if his body had become a bottomless pit, a crazy suction force bursting out, crazily devouring everything from Tian\u2019er. He felt a strong sense of satiation as the Devouring began.</p><br/><p>The Devoured Heavenly Energy flowed in through his hands, beginning to circulate all around his body, starting to merge with his own Heavenly Energy. Although this external Heavenly Energy was still not his, he would be able to quickly refine it with the Devour Technique to purify it and make it his own. Althugh only the finest core of it would remain, perhaps only a tenth or so, that was still far faster than his own cultivation speed.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing was not at all pleased by that. Instead, fear filled his heart, as he was shocked to find that as soon as the Devour Skill started, his own control started to slip. Attempting to stop the Devouring process, he found it extremely difficult, almost impossible. Furthermore, he could sense the life force draining out of Tian\u2019er, and it was also because the Devouring process included this life force that allowed him to refine the Heavenly Energy so easily.</p><br/><p>If this continued, when Tian\u2019er had been drained dry, nothing would remain of her but a dessicated corpse.</p><br/><p>Just like the Forest Direwolves all those years ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, activate your Saint Attribute!\u201d Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud. At the same time, he channelled all his might into trying to control the Devour Skill, attempting to stop or at least slow it down, and also invoking his Time Attribute Heavenly Energy simultaneously.</p><br/><p>As soon as the Devour Skill started, it was as if it was never-ending, with all his other Attributes now actually being suppressed. Only his Time Attribute, as the other equal Saint Attribute, was barely able to be invoked out.</p><br/><p>Currently, Tian\u2019er was also filled with surprise. However, she did not feel any fear in her heart; even if she were to die at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands, she would not regret it. In this case, at least she would forever be with Zhou Weiqing, a part of him. Sometimes, a girl who is lost in love just thinks differently from ordinary humans1. Of course, after hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, she immediately began to attempt using her two Saint Attributes.</p><br/><p>Divine and Spirit, the two Saint Attributes slowly began circulating under Tian\u2019er\u2019s control. However, they were still began Devoured into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. One could imagine, for both Saint Attributes to actually be Devoured in failed resistance, what what the other Attributes?</p><br/><p>Naturally, the reason for this was because Tian\u2019er\u2019s cultivation level was not much higher than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, and more importantly she had allowed him to Devour him without resistance earlier, and now she was unable to break free anymore. If it were a powerhouse with far higher cultivation level than Zhou Weiqing, as long as he discovered and broke free as quickly as possibly, it was definitely no problems. Of course, even then it had do be done quickly; if one underestimated the Devour Skill and allowed it to go on for some time\u2026 well, it would be hard to say who would end up the victor.</p><br/><p>Currently, the grey swirl of air around Zhou Weiqing grew even stronger and obvious, his entire body glowing with grey light. The original purple looking scales that had emerged over his skin also turned a crystalline grey, as if a layer of grey water was now covering him.</p><br/><p>As the Divine and Spirit Attributes entered his body, Zhou Weiqing immediately reacted. He had cultivated with Tian\u2019er so many times, and towards any change in energy between the two of them, control, he had much experience. Instantly, he started activating the Time Attribute energy and a small portion of the Demonic Attribute energy to move over and meet the incoming energy.</p><br/><p>This time, the four Saint Attributes gathered inside Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, and under his control, they began to spin faster and faster, forming the usual whirlpool which now blocked in front of the Devour Skill.</p><br/><p>Instantly, now blocked, the speed of Devouring slowed drastically. No matter Zhou Weiqing or Tian\u2019er, both gave an inner sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>The more they experimented and tested with the fused Saint Attributes, the more they realised how unique it was. The fusion of these four Saint Attributes was at a level above any other Attribute, even a single Saint Attribute.</p><br/><p>However, it was also because of this knowledge that Zhou Weiqing realised with such clarity how terrifying the Devour Skill truly was. Even facing the blockade of the four Saint Attribute whirlpool, the Devour Skill continued, not halted but just slowed immensely.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was prepared to forcefully break the connection between the two of them and end the Devour Skill, a miraculous sight happened next.</p><br/><p>The four Saint Attribute whirlpool that formed in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was spinning faster and faster, and all the Heavenly Energy that had been Devoured and not refined by Zhou Weiqing was actually being drawn into the whirlpool. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s own Heavenly Energy was also drawn into it at an almost equal rate of Tian\u2019er\u2019s energy and his own. Originally, the tiny whirlpool began to grow larger and larger, and somehow the Devour Skill did not slow down further from there. Instead, it seemed to form a strange equilibrium with the whirlpool, continuing to draw energy and life from Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>What was this?! Zhou Weiqing was totally shocked. However, the next instant, that shock would be multiplied many times over.</p><br/><p>As the whirlpool grew larger, the strange new Energy, power to the extreme, seemed to form at the very tip of the whirlpool, dropping down.</p><br/><p>It was just a single drop, pure white liquid, clean and crystalline, glowing with a faint shimmer like it was an unparalleled treasure.</p><br/><p>As soon as the pure white liquid that was as smooth as jade entered Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, he felt an indescribable sensation. The sheer power held within this single drop of unknown energy was even stronger than his original Heavenly Energy, and many times purer.</p><br/><p>When his cultivation level had reached the Heavenly Xu Energy stage, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Heavenly Energy had already reached a liquefied state. However, this strange new liquid energy that had been a product of the four Saint Attribute fusion whirlpool was just so much purer and refined than his own Heavenly Energy, a level that seemed to be utterly impossible. That was to say, given the same volume, this drop of liquid held the maximum possible amount of energy density.</p><br/><p>Even more miraculously, as soon as the drop of liquid entered his body, it became his own, part of him. He was able to take command of it and move it around. Furthermore, as the liquid slowly flowed to his DanTian, it did not merge with his own Heavenly Energy, instead taking its own position at the side, as if establishing a system of its own.</p><br/><p>Within the drop of liquid, it not only held an unbelievable amount of Heavenly Energy, it was also full of life force. This was not something either Zhou Weiqing or Tian\u2019er actually had originally. It was as if their life force had upgraded and evolved itself within the whirlpool. Zhou Weiqing felt as soon as he was joined with that drop of liquid, a sense of euphoria overcame him.</p><br/><p>The second drop formed, much slower than the first one. Right at that moment, an urgent voice slammed into his soul in a shocking fashion, right into his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cZHOU WEIQING, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL HER?!\u201d The voice was Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s, her urgent and frantic voice rang out in his soul, reverberating throughout his mind, instantly snapping Zhou Weiqing out from his reverie.</p><br/><p>Opening his eyes, Zhou Weiqing was given a huge fright.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s hands were still in his grasp, and her eyes were currently closed. Her skin was dim, almost dark, and her life force was unbelievably weak, and continuously dropping down. Her Heavenly Energy was almost fully drained. It was clear that under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Devour Skill, Tian\u2019er was on the verge of death.</p><br/><p>Oh no! Not good! Cold sweat streamed down Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back as fear and shock overwhelmed him. Subconsciously, he circulated his own Heavenly Energy, surrounding the fresh new drop of silvery white liquid, forcing it into his mouth. At the same time, he pulled Tian\u2019er into his embrace, lowering his head and giving her a kiss on her pale red lips.</p><br/><p>Just like that, the drop of liquid passed through their lips into Tian\u2019er\u2019s mouth, and a strange spectacle occurred next. Standing at the side, Shangguan Xue\u2019er could only stare with her jaw agape as she watched the two kiss, and from their mouths, an utterly pure form of energy seemed to diffuse all around, instantly engulfing Tian\u2019er within. She could clearly see a faint light shine forth, starting from Tian\u2019er\u2019s head, slowly moving down. Within moments, her entire body was glowing, and a large Heavenly Energy reverberation began. All the Heavenly Energy and life force that Tian\u2019er had lost seemed to return, and her eyes began to open\u2026 filled with surprise and shock.</p><br/><p>The whirlpool in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body continued spinning, continuing to draw upon his and Tian\u2019er\u2019s original Heavenly Energy\u2026 and as it spun\u2026 more drops of the white liquid continued to be generated.</p><br/><p>Slowly, Zhou Weiqing began to get the hang of it. He would leave one drop of the white liquid for himself, one drop to Tian\u2019er, and so on\u2026 In this way, an intriguing but marvelous loop began.</p><br/><p>At the side, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had a totally different sensation. All the energy aside, in her eyes, all she saw was Zhou Weiqing holding onto Tian\u2019er, their bodies pressed against each other. Every once in awhile, Zhou Weiqing would lean forward to kiss Tian\u2019er deeply.</p><br/><p>The strangest thing was that everytime they kissed, a brilliant light would appear around Tian\u2019er, as if the precious light of treasure. Originally, Tian\u2019er was already a great beauty, and each time that happened, it was as if she was evolving, her beauty shining forth even more, even her skin purifying. Looking at that, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was not only shocked, but also slightly envious.</p><br/><p>How are they doing that? Wasn\u2019t it the Devour Skill? How did it end up like this?</p><br/><p>As the process continued, the amount of the silvery white liquid in Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s bodies grew steadily, and their original Heavenly Energy also continued dropping.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er had cultivated together with the four Saint Attributes fusion so many times before, but this was the first time something like this had occurred.</p><br/><p>In the past, when the cultivated together, they would release their Heavenly Energy, allowing the four Saint Attributes to gather between or above them. In that way, the Saint Attributes would begin to spin and form the whirlpool, drawing in energy. As their Heavenly Energy slowly increased, it would be drawn back into their bodies and made their own.</p><br/><p>Such a cultivation technique, it was already far faster than if they were to cultivate individually and separately. However, this strange silvery white liquid had never appeared before!</p><br/><p>In this moment, a vague understanding slowly came to Zhou Weiqing. The profound secret should be the difference between the fusion occuring outside the body and within the body.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, the current situation happening in his body was the truest form of the cultivation with the four Saint Attributes. Furthermore, he guessed that the true key to this miraculous event was not the Devour Skill, but the life force of both of them fused together.</p><br/><p>The Devour Skill had only been the tool to bring all of their energies together into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body to form such a new whirlpool. When their life forces had joined together due to the Devour Skill, they had also fused together to join into the four Saint Attributes fusion. Under such a circumstance, the fusion of the four Saint Attributes had been ignited, causing such a miraculous chain reaction.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s guess was pretty accurate, but still incomplete. As he had imagined, when the four Saint Attributes gathered together, life force was the key to activating and igniting the change. However, at the same time, it was also due to the fact that when the four Saint Attributes fused outside of their bodies, it would draw in all forms of energy from the atmosphere. At that time, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er had thought it was naturally a good thing to draw in the atmospheric energy\u2026 after all, it could only be a boost right?</p><br/><p>However, the truth was actually the reverse.</p><br/><p>The four Saint Attributes were the highest quality Attributes in the world, and within them was a vast potential and miraculous force. When they fused together, how could they require the addition of other weaker and mixed energies? All they needed was absolute purity, not additional quantity of other unnecessary energies. When they were fully purified, the four Saint Attributes would grow in synergy, interpromoting reciprocally and having mutual generation, resulting in a all around growth and evolving.</p><br/><p>Currently, the four Saint Attribute fusion was right in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, and it was a strangely favourable condition endowed by nature\u2026 with the Dragon Tiger Transformation, his body had a natural pure XianTian or primordial force. This was something that the four Saint Attributes needed. Furthermore, within his body, as they gathered an spun, they would not come into contact or draw in the various mixed atmospheric energies that were full of other impurities. Under such a circumstance, with the mix of Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s life forces, only then had the true profound secret of the four Saint Attributes been revealed.</p><br/><p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s luck was truly good. If not for all of these unique circumstances coming into play, perhaps in their entire lives they would never discover this profound secret.</p><br/><p>By going through this process, not only was their entire Heavenly Energy going through a fresh round of purification and refining, it was also going through the evolving of the four Saint Attributes fusion. In this manner, their original Heavenly Energy without going through their Elemental Jewels, had not transformed into the purest energy in the world, with the aura of the four Saint Attribute fusion energy. This was truly the purest form of energy in the world that any Heavenly Jewel Master could have.</p><br/><p>A human\u2019s DanTian had its limits, and before reaching the Heavenly King stage, this limit would not be broken. As for the Heavenly King Stage? This was actually one of the greatest bottlenecks of this stage. Only when one was able to break past this major limiting factor, transforming their energy to a whole different level, only then would a Heavenly Jewel Master be able to reach the next stage. However, the size of the DanTian and the Ki Ocean would not change. That was to say, even for a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, besides having his meridians and internal organs stronger and more flexible, his \u2018load bearing\u2019 and capacity was actually no different from an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>Although their meridians were widened, there was definitely a limit, and it was impossible for it to continually widen forever. If that really happened, wouldn\u2019t the person just explode?</p><br/><p>Now, this silvery white liquid that Zhou Weiqing had formed from this round of cultivation was totally different. The inherent energy held within was more than ten times that of the Heavenly Energy liquid of the same level. That was to say, Zhou Weiqing could store more than ten times the energy in his body. Furthermore, that was a qualitative change, not that he had compressed the energy. This would mean both he and Tian\u2019er, when compared to a Heavenly Jewel Master of the same level, their energy purity and density was far stronger than anyone, and their sustainability would be on a whole new level. Furthermore, once they could enter the Heavenly King Stage, that would be yet another concept altogether. The true profound secret of the four Saint Attribute would only come into play fully then, and the future benefits it would bring them was not something they could even dream about now, far beyond the limits of their mortal comprehension.</p><br/><p>Time passed, seconds and minutes. Nearly an entire day and night passed before all their Heavenly Energy had been fully refined and transformed.</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Xue\u2019er was rather envious and even jealous, she still kept guard by their side. She knew that such unique opportunities were few and far between for any Heavenly Jewel Master, and once they missed it, it would be a regret that they would have to live with forever. Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s cultivation level did not seem to have much changes, but the aura and presence they gave off, it was as if they had been born anew.</p><br/><p>Finally, the last bits of their Heavenly Energy entered the whirlpool, and the last drop of silvery white liquid formed.</p><br/><p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er both had the feeling like their DanTian and meridians were so empty. The originally feeling of being filled with energy had disappeared, and all they had within each of them was a mere over twenty drops of that silvery white liquid. Even then, they could sense that their total amount of Heavenly Energy was actually more than previously. Although it was all contained within that twenty plus drops of liquid, it was without a doubt their inherent energy was terrifying. The strangest thing was that it was not a condensed or compressed form as well, and they did not need to focus on controlling it.</p><br/><p>The whirlpool slowly dissipated silently. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing also discovered something else strange. That was\u2026 despite the sheer power of his Devour Skill, it was unable to draw anything from Tian\u2019er\u2019s body any longer. That was to say, the silvery white liquid Heavenly Energy was totally immune from his Devour Skill.</p><br/><p>Towards this point, Zhou Weiqing was rather pleasantly surprised. It was without question that the silvery white Heavenly Energy was on a whole different level, not something that any existing cultivation technique could cultivate or refine. After this strange cultivation process, a whole new door had been opened to both him and Tian\u2019er, and they were slowly starting to realise the true potential of the four Saint Attributes.</p><br/><p>The Devour Skill also stopped at last, as the whirlpool within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body finally stopped. The cultivation of the two of them had also finally stopped after an entire day and night. Tian\u2019er had also been kissed so many times by Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>In truth, during the cultivation, as the time passed and it reached the later stages, the time between the production of each drop of the silvery white liquid began to take longer and longer time. In Zhou Weiqing\u2019s senses, it was due to the fact that their \u2018raw materials\u2019 were running out, thus the cultivation speed had also slowed dramatically. However, despite that, before the entire process was complete, how could Zhou Weiqing bear to stop? Who knew if there would be a future chance like this, and if he passed it up, they might regret it in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er, come here a while.\u201d After ending this round of cultivation, that was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first words.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing with brimming with energy and almost radiant in complexion, Shangguan Xue\u2019er who was extremely tired started momentarily, but she still walked towards him.</p><br/><p>Just as Shangguan Xue\u2019er reached Zhou Weiqing, in that instant, Zhou Weiqing suddenly grabbed hold of her waist without warning, lowering his head to give her a kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuuu\u2026\u201d Facing such a sudden intimate violation, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was caught off guard, embarrassed fully. If it had just been her and Zhou Weiqing, perhaps she would not have resisted, or not struggled so much. However, Tian\u2019er was right there! With her character, how could she not be embarrassed?</p><br/><p>However, before she could struggle too violently, she suddenly realised that a shameless scoundrel had actually stuck his tongue into her mouth.</p><br/><p>Filled with sudden anger, Shangguan Xue\u2019er bit down onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s tongue.</p><br/><p>In shock and pain, Zhou Weiqing quickly withdrew his tongue. \u201cAiiiiyaaa, that hurts! Xue\u2019er, what are you doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tongue was perhaps one of the weakest spots in the entire human body, and having it bitten, how could it feel good? Furthermore, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had been in a state of anger and embarrassment, and that bite had been stronger than she realised.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Shangguan Xue\u2019er froze in shock. She clearly sensed that as she bit Zhou Weiqing, a burst of pure energy instantly filled her mouth, streaming down her throat. Within moments, that pure Heavenly Energy entered her body, filling her entire body with a soothing cool, a comfortable, almost euphoric feeling extending through every inch of her body.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 this was the secret behind him kissing Tian\u2019er? Shangguan Xue\u2019er was extremely intelligent, and she immediately realised what had happened. Previously, every time Zhou Weiqing had kissed Tian\u2019er, she had glowed with that light of treasure. So, that was because of this strangely pure energy entering her body. Although Tian\u2019er did not know how this energy had come about, but she could sense it held its sheer purity and the massive amounts inherent, with the aura of the four Saint Attributes as well\u2026 what kind of valuable treasure was this! He\u2026 he actually gave me a drop, but I bit him instead. Instantly, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s face turned red, looking at Zhou Weiqing apologetically.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Tian\u2019er opened her eyes, looking at Zhou Weiqing pained look, she couldn\u2019t help but giggle out loud. \u201cServes you right, who asked you to just take advantage of her without explaining anything. Couldn\u2019t you just spit it out and give it to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her exasperatedly: \u201cWhy does it sound so disgusting when you say it like that! What do you mean spit it out!? Without my aura protecting it, once it comes into contact with the atmosphere, it will quickly dissipate and vanish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said apologetically: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shamelessly stuck out his tongue once more, showing the slight teeth imprint. \u201cGive me some more kisses and it won\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBah\u2026\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er blushed deeply, subconsciously dodging behind Tian\u2019er, saying in a low tone: \u201cIn the future, you do not need to do so again. This is the energy that you both risked your lives for, and gone through so much trouble to cultivate, how can you just give it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er giggled and extended her hands, pulling Shangguan Xue\u2019er to her side and saying: \u201cSister Xue\u2019er, I haven\u2019t even thanked you properly yet. Earlier, if not for your intervention in reminding some particular scoundrel, I would have been drained dry and killed now. Little Fatty is right, we are a family, why should we be so particular about sharing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she had argued a lot with Shangguan Xue\u2019er, in that previous instant earlier, she had finally truly accepted Shangguan Xue\u2019er in her heart. Without question, they were rivals in love, but in that point of critical danger, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had still been willing to save her life. Not just willing, but anxious. Although there was still the possibility that Zhou Weiqing might have come to his senses in time, it was still without a doubt that Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s reminder had saved her, and Tian\u2019er had been extremely touched by that. The previous ill feelings she held towards Shangguan Xue\u2019er had vanished.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Tian\u2019er was no fool. She knew Zhou Weiqing\u2019s feelings for Shangguan Bing\u2019er was the strongest; not to mention there was still another Shangguan Fei\u2019er. The three of them were sisters, triplets. No matter what, the three sisters added together would have a higher place in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart than her. If she continued on this path of constantly arguing with Shangguan Xue\u2019er, just like what Zhou Weiqing said, the days ahead would not be good at all. It was a good opportunity at hand in closing the gap between the two of them, and at least they would not have such a sense of enmity towards each other.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er looked at Tian\u2019er with a slightly startled expression before she finally shook her head lightly, saying: \u201cAlthough I do not like you much, but we are not enemies after all. If it had been you, you would have also done the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er giggled and said: \u201cIt isn\u2019t as simple as not being enemies right. Because of a particular rascal, we have been forced to become sisters. For the sake of Little Fatty, and for our own sakes, we should indeed try to accept each other. What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Both girls could be said to have extremely stubborn characters, each with their own strong personalities. It was not easy for either of them to admit defeat at all. At this moment, with Tian\u2019er taking the initiative to ease the relations between them, it instantly broke the thin barrier between them that was the most difficult first step to take.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er slowly nodded. Looking at Tian\u2019er, she slowly smiled faintly. For a person who was cultivating the Boundless Infinitum Technique to actually smile, it was not an easy feat!</p><br/><p>Only then did Tian\u2019er turn her gaze to Zhou Weiqing, whose tongue was still stuck out as he stared at the two of them with wide eyes. \u201cLittle Fatty, what was all that about? What is that liquid energy? How did you gain such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the fact that the leading force was Zhou Weiqing, as such although Tian\u2019er had accepted the pure energy and benefited from it during their long cultivation, she was actually just as confused as Shangguan Xue\u2019er, not knowing what had happened at all.</p><br/><p>At that time, Tian\u2019er had discovered that her body was almost drained dry, even her life force was about to vanish. In her heart, there was some fear and panic, but at that very moment, she sensed Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s shout of warning towards Zhou Weiqing, the voice that shook down to the very soul even managed to cause her dazed thoughts to rouse slightly. The next instant, Zhou Weiqing had pulled her closer and kissed her lips.</p><br/><p>In that instant, Tian\u2019er could sense a vital life force entering her body, fully replenishing all of her drained life force. Next, the silvery white liquid of pure energy fused fully into her body. Tian\u2019er\u2019s senses were no lesser than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, and within moments she discovered the power of the liquid. As the involved party, her curiosity about it was definitely even higher than Shangguan Xue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cHeh, Tian\u2019er, we have just been too lucky. I\u2019d say we were blind cats that caught a dead rat1.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er said exasperatedly: \u201cYou are the one who\u2019s the blind cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cIf only we can meet such good luck all the time, so what if I\u2019m a blind cat. Hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er said, full of curiosity: \u201cHurry up, tell me and Xue\u2019er, what was actually going on? Why was there that pure energy whenever you kissed me? How come all my Heavenly Energy was totally transformed in the process?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing began to describe the entire process of that cultivation simply, and as the two girls listened to his story, their expressions changed several times.</p><br/><p>Previously, Tian\u2019er was still bashful and irritated about Zhou Weiqing\u2019s choice of words with blind cat, but after hearing his description, she could only shiver with fear on how close she had come to death several times. Indeed, she had to admit that the phrase was rather apt in the circumstance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a true mix of time, luck and life. Sometimes, when luck comes, one can\u2019t even reject it! It looks like we have to thank that assassin, otherwise we might not have such a miraculous encounter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er said: \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, this is just the beginning for us. Now that our Heavenly Energy has all been transformed, how are we going to cultivate in the future? Without our original Heavenly Energy\u2026 could we continue cultivating with this pure and refined energy? This is already the fusion of the four Saint Attributes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: \u201cThis is also what I am worried about, so we will need to continue experimenting in all the cultivation techniques for the four Saint Attributes. This is something we have to fumble about before we can find a right path. However, what you mentioned just now should not be possible. When the Heavenly Energy was refined and transformed to that silvery white liquid, I was no longer able to affect it with the Devour Skill, not able to draw upon it. As such, it cannot be used as our Devour Skill cultivation. We will have to try on other areas.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er stood at the side, her heart filled with envy. However, she did not have any Saint Attributes, and naturally could not cultivate together with them in a similar fashion.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cThat is the reason why I infused a drop of the fused power to Xue\u2019er. Since we are going to experiment, we need to conduct many different tests with many different variables. I have a thought to try out later\u2026 I will begin Devouring Xue\u2019er\u2019s Heavenly Energy instead this time, and Tian\u2019er you and I will start forming the four Saint Attribute fusion whirlpool within my body like the last time, and we shall see if we can help Xue\u2019er to transform all of her Heavenly Energy as well\u2026 as well as what difference there might be in such a process, or what we can gain from it. With that drop of the silvery white energy protecting her, no matter what happens, at least Xue\u2019er will not be in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er blushed deeply, but her heart was secretly rejoicing. At least, Zhou Weiqing had not forgotten her, and such an unbelievable treasure, he was still willing to think of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou both haven\u2019t eaten for a whole day and night, aren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er asked concernedly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er exchanged looks. Indeed, such a long time had passed, yet neither of them felt any sense of hunger.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cPerhaps it is because of the four Saint Attributes\u2019 fusion and that sheer massive amount of energy that it holds, that it even settled all issues of hunger and thirst. Alright, it is rather tiring to keep calling it that, how about we give it a name. Hmmm\u2026 a simple one\u2026 our original energy is called Heavenly Energy, and this is the product of the four Saint Attributes\u2026 shall we call it Saint Energy then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said: \u201cWeiqing, I think your idea of experimentation is in the right step. However, I think that you should not rush to start on that first, especially in using the Devour Skill in training for now. That is because you still have not fully grasped this Saint Energy yet, understanding it fully and being able to control it. I feel that you both should begin cultivation first, try to learn how to cultivate it on your own and also how to control it, and also begin sharing your thoughts and understanding. With that, you can begin to fully understand it, the underlying principles and control. Only then should we start experimenting with the various training methods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes lit up and he nodded in agreement. \u201cThat is true, I am being too eager to try that out.\u201d At the same time, his heart was secretly rejoicing. Everything else aside, it was at least clear that Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s attitude towards him had changed. This could be seen just from the fact on how she addressed him compared to previously. Furthermore, it looked like the relationship between Tian\u2019er and Xue\u2019er was starting to improve as well. This was amazing news for him! At least, with this improvement, his days would no longer be plagued with suffering!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Although they weren\u2019t particularly hungry, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er still decided to rest up and have a meal first, along with Shangguan Xue\u2019er. While doing so, the three of them began to have a simple discussion regarding the four Saint Attributes. Only then did they begin the fresh round of cultivation, entering a meditative state.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sat there cross legged, starting his attempt to circulate this new Saint Energy of his. What Shangguan Xue\u2019er had said was indeed true, he had to learn and understand it, and to do so, he would have to start actually using it and trying it out. Only then would he be able to understand the underlying profound meanings behind it, and to truly make it his own.</p>\n</div>"}

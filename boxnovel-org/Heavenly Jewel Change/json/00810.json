The black flame that was burning from the merging of the Destructive and Fire Attribute around his body dimmed instantly. His attack was consolidated with his own Heavenly Core Nucleus \u2013 the most powerful attack that came from burning his Flames of Life of Fire Attribute.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue let out a cold scoff while he swayed the Demon Emperor Sword around. It flew out of his hand and turned into a crystal-like glow before colliding hard with the black crescent Destructive Light Blade in the sky.</p><br/><p>Bzzt!</p><br/><p>This time, the collision from both sides did not create any bangs at all. When the gray and black lights collided in the sky, an odd yet ear-piercing crackle was heard, much like when oil meets a hot blade. No matter the black or gray color, both of them melted rather visibly. In the end, both of them disappeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>It was clear who won and who lost. Although the Demonic Emperor lost his Consolidated Weapon, the worst that could happen was his inability to use his Demon Emperor Sword for a short period of time. It was worse for the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor, as he was draining his ultimate source of energy. One should not underestimate the attack. If it had landed atop a mountain, it would instantly cut the mountain in half if it was less than a thousand meters tall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe surrender!\u201d Fen Tian shouted almost as soon as the collision happened. However, would Wu Yunyue stop just like that? Of course not. Wu Yunyue began to move as soon as he tossed out his Demon Emperor Sword. The Blue Rain Hibiscus appeared silently behind the Blood Red Hell Emperor. It was impossible to restrict his movements but the Blue Rain Hibiscus that was twisted around the back had paralyzed the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor\u2019s body for a little while.</p><br/><p>It was sufficient for the Demonic Emperor. A blue glow held onto his leg from below; Wu Yunyue\u2019s body felt like it was being pulled hard as he was dragged downward at an angle. When he fell five meters downward, he was yanked by another blue string, which was pulling upward in the other direction. He looked like he was folded at a clear angular fold line in mid-air.</p><br/><p>When the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor\u2019s body was paralyzed, Wu Yunyue arrived before him. Naturally, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor would not sit and wait. It was impossible for him to dodge it, but at that very moment, the only thing that he could do was to defend himself as much as possible. He punched with both his fists while releasing the little Destructive Attribute that was left, in attempts to defend himself against Wu Yunyue.</p><br/><p>As the four fists collided, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor groaned as a deep bang was heard, which flung him away. Both his hands were now completely folded backward. A blue string that detached from the Blue Rain Hibiscus appeared out of nowhere and its ends were tied onto Wu Yunyue and the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor\u2019s waists. While the latter was flung away, the blue string pulled Wu Yunyue together. The Demonic Emperor conveniently slapped hard on the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>An ear-piercing bang exploded in the sky; the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor\u2019s legendary set broke and shattered everywhere. The last layer of protection had now vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Fen Tian\u2019s surrender had lasted for a couple of seconds but Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue proceeded to attack like he did not hear him at all. It was impossible that he was not mad! He then leaped toward the sky in a flash. The terrifying Destructive Thought was like a stormy wave that swept towards Wu Yunyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHell Lord, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very nice.\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mellow voice was heard. A dark light curtain with a bright white light then unfurled in the sky and blocked Fen Tian\u2019s Destructive Thought completely. The black light curtain looked like a huge cloth but as soon as it opened, as countless dazzling starlights fell from the middle of the cloth, blocking Fen Tian\u2019s Destructive Thought completely.</p><br/><p>When Fen Tian exploded with his Destructive Thought, he had already flown upward. Now that his thoughts were being blocked, it still did not stop him from flying in the sky. While Zhou Weiqing was releasing the Astral Divine Territory, Fen Tian had arrived with the help of the Spatial Law at the same time. It was a battle between the Blood Red Hell and the Peerless Sect, Fen Tian against Zhou Weiqing. The both of them collided hard in the sky without much theatrics.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Energy was different from the rest of the powerhouses who possessed the Destruction Attribute, especially the ones that Zhou Weiqing had witnessed before this. If the way that the other powerhouses released the Destruction Attribute was in the form of a facet, then Fen Tian\u2019s way of release was akin to countless powerful sharp blades. Not only was each of the Destruction Energy filled with a dense Destructive aura, they were filled with the ability to cause immense harm. With the impact of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory, it caused ripples among the starlight.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian\u2019s right arm enlarged at the same time when he flew into the sky. His arm had enlarged to almost double its original size when he got closer to Zhou Weiqing. His muscular fist had completely turned a dark red, while the energy that was hiding in the sparkling, dark red brought about a terrifying feeling like it was going to tear the sky open.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing attacked Fen Tian \u2013 not with his arm, but with his leg \u2013 his right leg to be exact. He lifted his right leg high and stepped hard onto Fen Tian\u2019s gigantic fist as swiftly as a whip would.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>An intense stormy bang made everyone on the Heavenly Snow Mountain lose their sense of hearing temporarily. The snow near the Heavenly Snow Mountain was thrown up from the intense bang and fell hard onto the ground, causing an avalanche to roll down from the Heavenly Snow Mountain from every direction.</p><br/><p>Everyone present was shocked at the overbearing collision. Fen Tian\u2019s body fell from the sky and all his Destructive Thought retreated. As his feet landed on the ground, his right arm had gone back to its original size but part of his clothing that was covering his right arm was damaged beyond repair. The people could clearly see that the veins bulging from Fen Tian\u2019s right arm were all black, like how it would look if his blood was black.</p><br/><p>A couple of people with the most powerful cultivation base saw Fen Tian\u2019s legs completely submerged into the ground the moment he landed. That meant that he did not manage to completely counter the impact from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s kick when he was falling from the sky. However, it only took a second before Fen Tian got both his legs above ground, as if the ground had been moved by him. With his cultivation base, it was an easy task for him to morph the ground under his feet.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhou Weiqing who was mid-air had just ascended approximately a hundred meters higher, but he still looked calm, plastering a smile on his face. Was it a tie?</p><br/><p>Many people secretly gulped when they saw what happened earlier. When Zhou Weiqing arrived and announced that his Peerless Sect would be a Saint Land, many people were waiting to ridicule him. Even after the other Saint Lands had recognized the position of the Peerless Sect as a Saint Land temporarily, most people, including Fen Tian and Huang Xinyun thought that the Peerless Sect depended on the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue\u2019s abilities. This was regardless of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s outstanding talent and the fact that he was a remarkable powerhouse amongst the young generation.</p><br/><p>However, everyone\u2019s perspective changed at that very moment. Without a doubt, the raging attack that Fen Tian launched as he dashed into the sky was definitely at the standard of a cultivator at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier. That was indeed a Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor-tier\u2019s attack with Destructive Attribute as its base.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiling managed to block it with ease and the battle seemed to end in a tie. That would mean that no matter what, Zhou Weiqing would at least have the cultivation base of a Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor himself. The both of them did not put on their Consolidated Equipment when the attack happened, so it was safe to say that the collision was the most direct representation of their cultivation bases. Zhou Weiqing did not lose, which meant that he had emerged victorious. Now, the Peerless Sect was like an entirely new concept to everyone there.</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing stared blankly at Zhou Weiqing; he was completely stunned now. He was full of confidence when his cultivation base was upgraded to the Heavenly King Tier from his continuous handwork, and his power even experienced a leap the moment he achieved this. All Heavenly Jewel Masters knew that very well. He challenged Zhou Weiqing once again for his dignity.</p><br/><p>However, he suddenly understood that his distance with Zhou Weiqing did not only fail to get closer due to his Heavenly King Tier achievement, but he was now even further away from him \u2014 similar to the distance between a Heavenly King and Heavenly Zong Master. Such a distance between a cultivator at the Heavenly King Tier and one at the Heavenly Emperor-tier was an extremely huge gap! He had never expected Zhou Weiqing to have the ability to challenge Lord Fen Tian. Gu Yingbing knew that he was never going to be capable of fighting Zhou Weiqing forever, as he would never be able to catch up with Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Right after Fen Tian landed on the group, two slams were heard as the two bloody bodies fell on the ground before him. The two bodies belonged to the same person, who was Wu Yunyue\u2019s opponent earlier, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing blocked Fen Tian at just the right time while Wu Yunyue managed to catch up to his opponent. The Blood Red Hell\u2019s Heavenly Emperor whose Consolidated Equipment Set was broken was now akin to a young lady with her legs wide open \u2013 helpless and powerless to defend herself. Wu Yunyue had been waiting for this day for far too long. He grabbed each of the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor\u2019s legs with both his hands and ripped him in half mid-air.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing landed at almost the same time Wu Yunyue did. He discreetly patted Wu Yunyue\u2019s back with his hand before landing. Wu Yunyue had given his very best in all the battles, so he had already consumed quite a lot of his strength. Hence, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pure Nebula Saint Energy was the best supplement.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou, Wei, Qing.\u201d Fen Tian said word-by-word as an overbearing will to kill swept towards Peerless Sect like it had come to fruition.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

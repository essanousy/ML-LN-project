With your weak physique, how can you be a proper soldier? Before the recruit training starts, this Battalion Commander will be giving you some personal tough training. If you can\u2019t finish it, just get lost from here and don\u2019t throw our 3rd Battalion\u2019s face! I\u2019ll come and find you after lunch.\u201d After saying that, she spun around and stalked off.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Zhou Weiqing watched her leave, after which he leapt to his feet, the sly expression on his face gone. \u201cThere is such a difference between people\u2019s personalities. From now on, I shall not anger this Battalion Commander already. Compared to Difuya, she is such a kind soul.\u201d Honestly, he had not imagined that he would be let off so easily, he could easily foresee that if the person administering the beatings had been Difuya, he would definitely have to suffer all the remaining 9 blows. Zhou Weiqing had clearly seen the expression on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s face after the first blow, that she couldn\u2019t bear to hit him a second time, and he had a very good impression and liking of her. Of course, for this rascal, that liking caused him to slyly think back of the feeling in his hands from the previous day, causing him to drool again.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Soon it was noon; the lunch in the army was nothing special, it was simple and only meant to ensure stomachs were filled. Since Zhou Weiqing wasn\u2019t used to any special treatment or foods at home, he was fine with just filling his stomach with the standard fare. Of course, he was eating at the ordinary soldier\u2019s mess, the officers had a separate mess area. By the time he got back from lunch, he saw that Shangguan Bing\u2019er was already standing outside his tent waiting for him, dressed in the same outfit as earlier in the morning. Zhou Weiqing was secretly thinking, how great it would be if she were his girlfriend waiting for him. Of course, it was just a passing thought \u2013 Zhou Weiqing\u2019s greatest strength was that he knew his limits, he would not really expect that the top genius in the empire would fall in love with such a trash who could not cultivate like him.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0\u201cGreetings Battalion Commander.\u201d Zhou Weiqing quickly walked up towards Shangguan Bing\u2019er and gave her a smart salute.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Although Shangguan Bing\u2019er had a very kind nature, but she was also very intelligent. In the morning, after she had left Zhou Weiqing after the whipping, she realised that she had been fooled. After all, she had not used much strength, how could he be in such pain? That rascal had clearly been acting. He might look very honest but that Little Fatty Zhou was definitely not a good person, if she did not punish him for that she would not be able to assuage her anger. To think that the first man to ever touch her body was such a rascal, Shangguan Bing\u2019er almost couldn\u2019t control her anger.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0\u201cLittle Fatty Zhou, let me ask you, to an archer what is the most important?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er asked solemnly.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Zhou Weiqing answered unhesitatingly: \u201cSpeed, strength and accuracy.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er heard his swift and accurate reply and was rather surprised, \u201cVery good, you\u2019re right. From your conduct this morning, your physique is in bad shape and not up to standard for an archer. As such, from now onwards, I will be conducting special training for you.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Upon hearing that, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face changed, \u201cLord Battalion Commander, can we start later? I just ate lunch, and need an afternoon nap.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er said angrily: \u201cDo you have the qualification to bargain with me? A soldier has to follow orders, I hope you remember that point, or you will never be a good soldier, let alone an officer. I\u2019m going to prepare some things, the special training will start in an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0After Shangguan Bing\u2019er left, Zhou Weiqing laughed and said, \u201cAlthough this girl acts tough, but her heart is really soft. She has given me an hour of rest, haha in front of this young master there is no point acting. Alright, I\u2019ll go take a nap. Afternoon naps are a good habit, good for the complexion.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0When Shangguan Bing\u2019er returned in an hour carrying a heavy duffel bag, all she heard was the snoring sounds of Little Fatty Zhou.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er was both amused and vexed at the same time. This Little Fatty Zhou rascal really just ate and slept, couldn\u2019t he tell that she was using her rank to take revenge on him? It was unbelievable that he could still sleep so soundly.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0\u201cLittle Fatty Zhou, Wake up!\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er shouted loudly outside the tent, she naturally would not enter his tent, what if that rascal was sleeping naked?</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0The snores continued.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">A sly light flashed in Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s beautiful eyes, and she suddenly shouted loudly: \u201cFIRE!! FIRE!!\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0\u201cAaaahhh\u2026\u201d A loud screech resounded from within the tent, preceding Zhou Weiqing rushing and stumbling clumsily out of the tent. Luckily, although he was dishevelled, at least he was still clothed.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0\u201cWhere, Where?\u201d shouted Zhou Weiqing as he rushed out, face was filled with panic.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er said exasperatedly: \u201cAre you so afraid of death?\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">By now Zhou Weiqing had finally fully woken up, and looking around, he realised that there wasn\u2019t any sight of flames around and immediately knew that he had been tricked. His face full of indignation, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s human nature to be scared of death, those who aren\u2019t scared of death are fools. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m going back to sleep.\u201d Having said that, he actually turned around and headed back to his tent.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0\u201cYou wretch, stop right now!\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er realised that every time she faced Little Fatty Zhou she would always fall into a rage.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0\u201cBattalion Commander, is there anything else?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked impatiently.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0\u201cSpecial training.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er gritted her teeth as she looked at the rascal, and she lifted her hand and threw the duffel bag into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms. She had already decided that no matter what, she would teach him a lesson today and assuage her anger.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Zhou Weiqing felt his hands filled with a sudden weight, and upon opening the bag, he saw it was filled to the brim with rocks, weighing about 20kg in total. Immediately, he didn\u2019t dare to act anymore and said with a pitiable expression: \u201cBattalion Commander, this is too harsh right.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er said coldly: \u201cAs an archer, your speed and strength are far from passable, if you don\u2019t get a large amount of physical training, how can you survive?\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cBut, shouldn\u2019t being accurate at shooting be enough?\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er asked suspiciously: \u201cIs your archery very accurate?\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Zhou Weiqing had some confidence in his archery, and immediately nodded.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er said: \u201cOkay, if your archery is more accurate, or at least equal, to mine, then you won\u2019t have to undergo my special training. Take your equipment and follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Zhou Weiqing shouldered his bow and brought his quiver, and followed Shangguan Bing\u2019er out of the camp.</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Once they were out of the camp, Shangguan Bing\u2019er stopped, and pointed towards a large tree, whose trunk was about as thick as a human, about 200 yards away: \u201cSee that tree? To be a passable archer, you need to be able to shoot a human figure at least 200 yards away. Your target now is the centre of the tree trunk. Go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><p class=\"normal\">\u00a0Zhou Weiqing took down his longbow, and took out an arrow of around 90 cm long from his quiver, nocking it to the bow. He drew the bow and took aim \u2013 the tree at 200 yards away was but a slim figure \u2013 before releasing the arrow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

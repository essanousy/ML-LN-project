Zhou Weiqing had started because of the sudden feel of her legs, while Shangguan Fei\u2019er had been too shocked, along with the rush of sudden heat.</p><br/><p>With Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s legs on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shoulders, even though she was wearing pants, it was still quite an unbecoming position.</p><br/><p>After a moment of shock, the two of them suddenly looked at each other, once again with that strange understanding as if they were both on the same page.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s beautiful face immediately flushed full red, and Zhou Weiqing immediately took action according to his original plan. With a sudden pull, he exerted all his considerable might, dragging Shangguan Fei\u2019er off the ground.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t your flexibility so good? Without any leverage, let\u2019s see how you can react to my throw!</p><br/><p>As he thought that, Zhou Weiqing had exerted strength to throw Shangguan Fei\u2019er in revenge for earlier.</p><br/><p>Alas, he had once again underestimated Shangguan Fei\u2019er. Her right leg might be caught by his hands, but she still had her left leg. At the same time as her body was flung into the air, her left leg dipped forward swiftly in a small motion, the tip of her legs hooking onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s throw was rendered useless, and in the end it was his neck suffered the immense pulling force, causing him to stumble, while Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s flexible body twisted in midair, landing down safely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er gave a cold humph, her body flipping around again, totally ignoring the fact that one of her legs was still being held, and she instead grabbed Zhou Weiqing by the waist.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not dare to let her get a good grasp. This girl\u2019s close combat techniques were plentiful, and terrifying to boot. If she got a good hold onto him, he would definitely be in trouble.</p><br/><p>Switching quickly to a single-hand grasp, his other palm shoved out forward on Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s back. She was after all his sister in law to be, and looked exactly the same as Shangguan Bing\u2019er, and he could not strike savagely.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not seem to realise that Zhou Weiqing had used a hand to push her away. From appearance, her entire body had to flip all the way down, but Zhou Weiqing only had to push forward simply with his palm, and with such a difference in movement required, it was certain that Zhou Weiqing would be faster. As long as he managed to push her away, she would not be able to grab onto his waist.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, Shangguan Fei\u2019er gave him a lesson on what was the extremes of flexibility. Under such a movement that already seemed to disregard the natural laws of a human body, she actually changed positions once more, twisting suddenly to the left, and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palm actually grazed her back, missing her by just a little.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing felt his waist go numb, and his hand on Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s leg loosened its grip involuntarily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you finally convinced?\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er said airily.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lay there unmoving, as if he had been thrown to his death. That was because Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s thumbs were on his eyelids, and he dared not open his eyes, though he lay there silently, as if even if he were to die he wouldn\u2019t admit defeat.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er gave a humph, saying: \u201cNot bad, very stubborn eh, since you are unwilling to submit, I\u2019ll sit until you die!\u201d As she said that, her incomparably elastic little buttock moved about around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest area.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was trembling slightly now, but he still did not make a sound.</p><br/><p>It was not that our dear Zhou Little Fatty was stubborn or unwilling to admit defeat. It was just that, in such a scenario, how could this young little rascal be willing to do so!</p><br/><p>Such a beautiful young lady, sitting on his chest, that highly intriguingly springy buttocks rubbing along his chest, the faint fragrance of her entering his nose. Although it was a little difficult to breathe, but Zhou Weiqing was enjoying himself in an unprecedented fashion. It took all the control he had not to lift his hands to touch that bounty right in front of him.</p><br/><p>Seeing him shivering, Shangguan Fei\u2019er started momentarily. \u201cWhy are you shivering, I\u2019m not using that much strength, are you really injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she lowered her head, rather uncharacteristically scatterbrained. She could not understand how her extremely low weight could injure him at all.</p><br/><p>Could it be that when she threw him down on the ground, he had smashed down on some sharp rocks or something? Shangguan Fei\u2019er turned her head to examine Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>She spotted something sticking up, a large bulge that was like a proud tent, propping up the material of his pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er cried out loud. \u201cLittle Fatty, I did not mean to do that!\u201d In a flip, she jumped up from his body. She was in truth still an untouched virgin, innocent and naive to the core in that manner, and with her preconceived idea earlier, she had already made the judgement. In her eyes, that large protrusion should be some sharp rock, piercing right through Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. In that moment, she was greatly and urgently worried in her heart, forgetting in that instance that with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s toughness and physique, how could he be easily injured by a mere rock, and that there was no sign of any blood anywhere.</p><br/><p>She did not dare to pull out the object for fear of aggravating his wounds, and instead she quickly pulled down Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pants to reveal the \u2018critical and deadly\u2019 protrusion.</p><br/><p>Thepinkish-purple, pigeon-egg sized little head reared out as it was freed from its confines, presenting itself to her. She had moved too quickly, and in her urgency, that thing that \u2018bounced\u2019 out actually struck her cheek once.</p><br/><p>Stunned and dazed. That was Shangguan Fei\u2019er. She had never seen such an \u2018evil demonic object\u2019 1, yet something that caused her heart to race.</p><br/><p>Frozen stiff. That was Zhou Weiqing, who had never in his wildest dreams imagined that things would progress in such a way.</p><br/><p>Naturally, earlier when Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s soft, springy buttocks had been moving around on his chest, it would have been just too strange if he had not had a \u2018reaction\u2019. After all, he already had intimate relations with both Shangguan Bing\u2019er and Tian\u2019er, and at such a young virile age, his urge for such things were quite high. Furthermore, Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked exactly the same, and were top beauties to boot. How could he possibly not have any reaction?</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing had not expected that this mischievous young lady, the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, would actually be so innocent and naive regarding such matters. Even Shangguan Bing\u2019er, when he first met her years ago, had known more than she did! She\u2026 had actually thought his \u2018raised bump\u2019 as an injury\u2026 !!!</p><br/><p>Especially so when Shangguan Fei\u2019er had actually looked upon his \u2018state\u2019 at such a close range, Zhou Weiqing was stunned, frozen and totally in shock. Such a circumstance was also something totally new to him, and although he was usually so shameless, he was totally left at a loss. After all, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was not Shangguan Bing\u2019er, and whether or not she was really here to supervise and monitor him was true or not, if she really ran back to Bing\u2019er to complain about him, to say that he had molested her, what would happen?</p><br/><p>Although he also liked Tian\u2019er a lot, and had already had intimate relations with her\u2026 in truth, within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart, Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s place was irreplaceable, and no one could match her.</p><br/><p>What Shangguan Bing\u2019er had taken hold of\u2026 taken over\u2026 was the part of his heart that was the softest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh!!!\u201d A shrill, high-decibel shriek rang out, piercing the skies, as if even more powerful than any spirit based attacks. Zhou Weiqing was just beside her, and he suffered the effects of it the most. That sudden shrill cry causing him to almost lose his hearing, dazing him momentarily into silence.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er was in short momentarily, before finally reacting. This was not the first time she had thought about what was the difference between man and woman, and had even asked others about it. However, in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, who would dare talk to her about such a thing? In that moment, she finally understood the difference between the two, and in her heart, a strange, indescribable fire was burning, causing her to scream out shrilly involuntarily.</p><br/><p>The first thing Zhou Weiqing did was to quickly pull up his pants. If any of his companions saw this sight, he truly did not know what they would think. The second thing was to charge forward in a flash to cover her mouth, not allowing her shrill cry to spread out.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er bit down on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand savagely, causing him convulse in pain and cry out angrily: \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er shoved his hand away, saying: \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 bast\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said angrily: \u201cIs it me? Is it me? If you didn\u2019t sit down on me, would I have such a reaction? It was you who pulled down my pants, you scoundrel girl! I\u2019m going to tell Bing\u2019er that you molested me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Being accused with an unfounded blame by Zhou Weiqing before she could blame him, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was enraged, and she leaped to her feet, about to beat him up.</p><br/><p>Her shrill cry was just too too high, and in the camp, Lin TianAo and the others started heading out to their location, worried. At that moment, something happened abruptly.</p><br/><p>A shrill, ear piercing sound rang out, along with a bone chilling cold that caused Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er, who were in an excited state, to be given a shock. Abandoning their argument instantly, Zhou Weiqing grabbed onto Shangguan Fei\u2019er, and the two dropped down to the ground. The next moment, a silver light passed through where their bodies had been a split second ago before disappearing into the sky.</p>\n</div>"}

Musing to himself: Fat Cat, Fat Cat, what a good phrase to use. Perhaps I should start calling Old Monster Xue that as well?</p><br/><p>However, the same two words had a totally different feeling in Tian\u2019er\u2019s ears. Just like a heavy warhammer, smashing right into the closed and locked doors of her heart, causing her entire body to tremble violently. In her entire life, only Zhou Weiqing had called her that, and it was how he had called her in those few years they had spent together.</p><br/><p>As Gu Yingbing had already failed, Xue AoTian had neglected to raise the sound barrier once more. As such, all present had actually heard Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er continued looking at Zhou Weiqing, her gaze turning from blank, to dazed, to a strange struggle. She was trying so hard to remember, to remember why this stranger in front of her looked so familiar, yet she did not remember anything about him. Subconsciously, she felt that this person in front of him should be important to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still remember how we first met? You were always so mischievous, yet always loving to hide in my embrace.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said softly. His voice was gentle, yet seemed to be filled with a strange magic, every word striking deep into Tian\u2019er\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. I still remember the first time I beat your buttocks. Although you were still a tiny little white tiger then, but your little buttocks were still so round and soft, anyone would be unwilling to let go.\u201d Not far away, Gu Yingbing vomited out another mouthful of blood, as he stared angrily at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian\u2019s expression also turned ugly. He truly wanted to send a slap into that little brat\u2019s face! His daughter\u2019s buttocks had been touched by this stinking little brat when she was in her main form!</p><br/><p>The Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia was still standing at the side, covering her mouth as she smiled faintly. She couldn\u2019t help but think to herself, no wonder this naughty little brat was able to attract her daughter. His bad boy look was easy to attract attention indeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, I still did not understand why you were struggling so much. Weren\u2019t you just a little tiger, what\u2019s the big deal about touching you. At last, only after looking did I realise that you were a little female tiger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaah* Gu Yingbing vomited another mouthful of blood. This time, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, his entire body swaying as he fainted, before being caught by Xue Aoying.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, are you trying to die? If you continue talking like that, you better get lost!\u201d Xue AoTian was also unable to hold back any longer, and he growled angrily at Zhou Weiqing. He was starting to regret giving that stinking little brat any chance, such a wretched brat!</p><br/><p>Long Shiya looked at Xue AoTian\u2019s angrily face and he laughed heartily, saying: \u201cThis has nothing to do with me, it is his previous teacher who taught him that.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as if Zhou Weiqing did not hear their words. All this while, his gaze was still fixed upon Tian\u2019er. Gently, he continued: \u201cLater on, I still gave you a bath, and that time you struggled even harder. After that, you kept ignoring me for days. Yet, even then, you still did not leave me. From your body, I could vaguely sense some energy reverberations. Later on, many people told me that Tiger type Heavenly Beasts were the top tier amongst all Heavenly Beasts. By then, I already knew that you had your own goals and reasons for staying by my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour goal was this\u2026 right?\u201d As he said that, Zhou Weiqing waved his hands, the two glowing triangles once more, stacking, and in moments he had once again summoned his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation.</p><br/><p>The concentrated light seemed to draw Tian\u2019er\u2019s attention, causing her eyes to dull slightly momentarily. The next instant, within the glow of six lights, only two auras remained. Time and Demonic. The two Saint Attributes!</p><br/><p>Instantly, Tian\u2019er\u2019s body froze, before she started trembling even more. Subconsciously, her hands raised as well, gold and purple flickering in them. The Divine and Spirit Attributes rose up, mingling with the Demonic and Time Attributes of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>They had after all once had intimate relationship, and in that time the four Saint Attributes had gone through a major fusion. Even before that, they had cultivated and trained many times with the four Saint Attributes. In that moment, the attraction between their Attributes and Heavenly Energy was far stronger than anyone else. Even so, as soon as Zhou Weiqing released his two Saint Attributes alone, in that instant, both Xue AoTian and Xue Aoying felt a strong sense of benign warmth, as if they could not wait to step forward to cultivate together with Zhou Weiqing. Of course, due to the sheer gap between their cultivation levels, the feeling was diluted many times over, and they were clear that it was not a huge benefit for them to cultivate with Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing slowly walked towards Tian\u2019er, step by step, his hands held out with the two Saint Attributes reverberating around.</p><br/><p>As he walked, he continued speaking: \u201cIn truth, the time when I truly fell in love with you was on the Heavenly Jewel Island. Originally, I had always been wary of you, as I could sense that you had some purpose and goal for staying by my side. At that time, your cultivation level was far higher than mine, and I dared not do anything to you. However, after the events in the Lustre Spatial Realm of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, my view of you totally changed. After that, when I learned of the demise of my homeland, only you stood by my side. You were even willing to use your most precious possession to ease my despair and hurt. If not for you, I do not know how I could have walked out from that state of depression.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, although my heart was mostly filled with vengeance, I could still clearly sense that it had also been seized by you. Tian\u2019er, do you still remember? Just because you did not want to cause any further trouble for me, and you left me that letter before sneaking away. You signed off with \u2018Your Tian\u2019er, your Fat Cat.\u2019, along with that last question. Now that I have finally seen you again, I must tell you those words that I owe you, the words that I failed to tell you long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke up to this point, he had finally reached Tian\u2019er. Tears poured down uncontrollably from his eyes. A man does not easily show his tears, only if his heart is truly broken. His hands slowly grasped onto Tian\u2019er\u2019s hands, and in that moment, the four Saint Attributes swirled around, above their heads, without any sign of rejection or exclusion, as if they belonged together. Almost instantly, they seemed to fuse together, forming a four-coloured whirlpool spinning right over their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, I love you.\u201d As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing was already sobbing.</p><br/><p>A spark seemed to enter the dazed orbs of Tian\u2019er. As light slowly returned to them, a faint purple mist emitted from her head, and her body began trembling violently. Tears started streaming down her cheeks like the pearls from a broken necklace, following the curve of her cheek before dropping down.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, I love you. I am your Little Fatty! Please wake up!\u201d Zhou Weiqing called out as he sobbed. His voice was not loud, but at that moment, it infected everyone present.</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing had managed to rouse from his faint with the Tiger King Xue Aoying\u2019s help, just in time to see this sight. His already pale face turned even whiter, and he closed his eyes in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, my Little Fatty\u2026 Little Fatty, Little Fatty!\u201d Light seemed to spring from Tian\u2019er\u2019s beautiful eyes, and with a sob, she sprang forward abruptly, her arms encircling Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck as she burst into tears.</p><br/><p>At last, Tian\u2019er had awoken, The faint cloud of purple mist was the Seal that Xue AoTian had used to Seal her memories.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s imprint in her heart was too deep, just too deep. How could a mere simple memory seal work to remove it? Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, the four Saint Attributes, all of it allowed the seed of memory to grow once more. The young couple who loved each other deeply, after all their trials and tribulations, they finally embraced each other again.</p><br/><p>In that moment, all words and descriptions were useless, only the deep feelings and emotions, as if they were melding into one another\u2019s body, tying their hearts together, forever.</p><br/><p>The ugly expression on Xue AoTian\u2019s face slowly relaxed. Sensing the feelings of his daughter bursting out like crazy, he knew that things were already set in stone.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his hand was suddenly grasped by Phelia, who said: \u201cJust wish them well\u2026 For our daughter to be able to find true love, it is her fortune. Just like originally when we met each other. Although we had no choice but to separate for twenty years, although we also went through our own trials and tribulations, but I will never regret it. AoTian, hold me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The feelings that Xue AoTian had hidden deep in his heart for twenty years also burst forth, and he pulled his wife in for a deep hug. At that moment, his eyes were moist.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya was beaming from ear to ear. Before coming up the Heavenly Snow Mountain, he had estimated that their chance of success was less than ten percent. However, they had done it, they had succeeded. It was not Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation level, power, fighting ability or his bloodline, or even his teachings that had won the day\u2026 it was an invincible strength in the world \u2013 Love!</p><br/><p>\u201cFather.\u201d After some time, Tian\u2019er finally lifted her head from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest. Looking at her parents in their own embrace, she leaped over to them, hugging them as well. Looking at this woman in front of her that she did not recognize, her beautiful face was filled with a sudden joy. Love, both of intimacy and kinship, this was what the world spun around for\u2026 and at this moment, she had finally received both of them at once. Currently, Tian\u2019er felt like she was overwhelmed with joy, all the suffering that she had once undergone evaporating.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian held out an arm, enveloping his daughter into their joined embrace. At this point, he wished he could hold his wife and daughter forever like this, what an amazing thing that would be!</p><br/><p>Unknowingly, Long Shiya had somehow appeared behind Zhou Weiqing. Giving him a kick on the buttocks, he said: \u201cLittle Fool! What are you still standing there for?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhou Weiqing rouse to his senses, and he scrambled forward quickly. With a thud, he knelt down before Xue AoTian and Phelia, kowtowing three times. \u201cThis little son-in-law, Zhou Weiqing, greets his father in law, mother in law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian gave a humph and said: \u201cStand up. If you let me know that you ever bully my Tian\u2019er\u2026 hmph, hmph, you know what will happen.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

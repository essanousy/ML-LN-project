Of course the true god set \u2014 the only god set \u2014 had its claim to fame.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace had been each other\u2019s rival for such a long time. If Xue Ao\u2019tian really had the power to kill Shangguan Tianyang, he would have done so earlier a few tournaments back. How could he possibly show any mercy to him? However, he was unable to do it, and the reason was none other than the Boundless Infinitum Set that Shangguan Tianyang owned.</p><br/><p>An eight-piece legendary armor set could hardly scratch the \u2018legendary\u2019 title but a nine or ten-piece set was definitely a legendary set. As for an eleven-piece armor set, well, it would no longer be limited by the word \u2018legendary\u2019. Instead, it would be a true god set.</p><br/><p>The first distinctive feature of the Boundless Infinitum Set was its resistance towards Divine Territories. The second was its own Divine Territory. The god set was equipped with its own Boundless Infinitum Divine Territory. Although Shangguan Tianyang might not be able to defeat Xue Ao\u2019Tian in terms of overall strength, it was precisely with the help of this set that Xue Ao\u2019tian was also unable to defeat him. Under such circumstances, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace that had a strong backing was able to rank first in the Five Great Saint Lands without any dispute.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Boundless Infinitum Set once again made its entrance on the summit of Heavenly Snow Mountain. It did not matter if Fen Tian, who was already a Heavenly God or Huang Xingyun, their imposing manner could not help but falter a little. The shock that the Boundless Infinitum Set brought to them was just too much to digest. Even until this day, they were still unable to break free from the nightmare that is the Boundless Infinitum Set.</p><br/><p>There was no emotion in Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s voice. It was so cold as if he was pouring icy cold water on Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun. \u201cThe Heavenly Spirit Earthly Fiend Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation is also known as the God Slaying Demon-Vanquishing Great Formation. So what if you\u2019re at the Heavenly God Tier? Brother Xue, let the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace be the one to deal with Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian cast a glance at Shangguan Tianyang. Although they had no choice other than to join forces right now because of the immediate situation and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s secret act as a mediator, how could they so easily erase the estrangement between them after being rivals for so many years? A cold snort could be heard immediately, \u201cWith just your Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace alone? Huh, so do you think we from the Heavenly Snow Mountain is incapable now?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, Xue Ao\u2019tian lifted up his right hand and waved it swiftly in the void. A bright and splendid golden light erupted from his wrist instantly. Without any warning, the rich golden light illuminated the entire surroundings brightly as a golden light beamed up to the sky. It forcibly bulldozed an area within the Destructive Divine Territory in a tyrannical manner and enveloped all of the people that were present on the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>The God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set materialized on his body. The ten-piece set shone lustrously in gold color. The slender and long God Spirit Staff landed in Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s hand as the intense divine aura instantly began to spread out.</p><br/><p>Unlike the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, when Xue Ao\u2019tian put on his gear over at the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s corner, all of the powerhouses of the Heavenly Snow Mountain quickly stepped forward and surrounded him in the middle as they formed a ring around him. On the contrary, at the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s corner, the battle array that they formed took the shape of a triangle with the Shangguan brothers, Tianyang and Tianyue, taking the lead as the arrowhead.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian did not take this opportunity to order their followers to attack. Instead, they were merely watching the situation coldly. Before they had a clear understanding of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s strategy, they were not in a haste to make their moves. At least for now, everything was still within their control. They still had a trump card that they had yet to play as well.</p><br/><p>After the God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set and the God Spirit Staff were ready, it took on a peculiar purplish gold color. Noble, sacred, and majestic. A purplish golden headband decorated with complicated patterns could be seen on Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s head. A dazzling golden oval gemstone was embedded right in the middle of the headband. Divine aura radiated from his body ceaselessly and broke a part of the Destructive Divine Territory. That was none other than his Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory. Apart from that, what was more peculiar was the fact that the strong Destruction Attribute leaking out from the super intense Destructive Divine Territory could not do any harm to his Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory at all.</p><br/><p>Just like how the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley shared the same Destruction Attribute, the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace both equally shared the Creation Attribute originating from Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Long ago, when Zhou Weiqing had gone to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to defeat Shangguan Tianyang and received his blessing in taking the hands of the three Shangguan sisters, he had already given his words to Shangguan Tianyang during a private conversation that he would share the Saint Energy with the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Of course, there was a certain degree of limit to their agreement to share.</p><br/><p>Later, when Zhou Weiqing let the three Shangguan sisters return to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to consolidate their legendary armor sets, the plan that he put together from his foreshadowing came in handy.</p><br/><p>It was still relatively easy for Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er to consolidate their legendary armor sets but Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s legendary armor set was the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s secret relic \u2014 the Boundless Infinitum Set. If he was not prepared to pay a price, how else could he cajole the old fox, Shangguan Tianyang, to agree to it? After all, the moment he agreed to allow the three Shangguan sisters to be married to Zhou Weiqing, they would no longer be part of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace anymore. This fact was attested when the three sisters showed up in the Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands under the name of the Peerless Sect.</p><br/><p>The main reason Zhou Weiqing passed on his Saint Energy to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace was, without a doubt, to fight against the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Destruction Attribute. At the same time, how could he be willing to see his wives being put in an awkward situation as a man? For this reason, he decided to use his Saint Energy to exchange for the three women\u2019s Consolidated Equipment Set, and that included the Boundless Infinitum Set as well.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang understood perfectly well that the role and transitivity of the Saint Energy were far superior to the Boundless Infinitum Set. For a Heavenly Jewel Master with a lower cultivation base, the Saint Energy, could only accumulate in their body and allow them to possess a greater strength temporarily when they unleashed it at most. By the time they finished consuming it, that would be all to it. However, this was a whole different concept altogether for a powerhouse who was at Heavenly King Tier and above.</p><br/><p>All of the powerhouses who were at the Heavenly King Tier and above possessed a Heavenly Nucleus Core. They were fully capable of integrating the Saint Energy into the Heavenly Nucleus Core and add the Creation Attribute to their Heavenly Nucleus Core. In this case, their resistance towards the Destruction Attribute would undoubtedly be enhanced, and this would also bring great benefits to their cultivation, particularly to those powerhouses who had already reached a bottleneck in their cultivation.</p><br/><p>Due to this reasons, Shangguan Tianyang did not spend much time pondering before he agreed to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s proposal by allowing the three Shangguan sisters to infuse their not-so-pure Saint Energy into some of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s powerhouses to increase their strength. Of course, those who gained the most benefits were none other than Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue.</p><br/><p>This was also why Shangguan Tianyang was not particularly nervous when faced with the Destructive Divine Territory. With a certain amount of Creation Attribute in their bodies, the Destruction Attribute would not be as threatening as it used to be. At least, they were not in a position where it was too disadvantageous for them in terms of attributes. Of course, the Destructive Divine Territory would still have the upper hand against them owing to the purity of the Destruction Attribute in it. However, at the very least, it could not do much harm to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s powerhouses just by relying on the Destruction Attribute alone.</p><br/><p>It was even simpler in the case of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Tian\u2019er\u2019s return had meant everything. Moreover, the purity of Tian\u2019er\u2019s Saint Energy was second only to Zhou Weiqing. Even though she was there alone, the benefits that the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s powerhouses received was actually even greater than that of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>For this reason, at the moment when Xue Ao\u2019tian hoisted his God Spirit Staff up high and unleashed his Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory, the Destructive Divine Territory could not forcefully tear it apart. On top of that, the strength that Xue Ao\u2019tian demonstrated right now was not as simple as something from someone at the Mid-Level of the Heavenly God Tier. It was obvious that he had already strode into the Upper-Level of the Heavenly God Tier. This was the power of the Creation Attribute.</p><br/><p>\u201d For the glory of Wan Shou, the brilliance that guards the Heavenly Snow Mountain! All rise! Guardians of the Heavenly Snow Mountain! <sup>1 </sup>\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the divine aura strengthened without warning. A golden ray shone down from above the Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory that stretched over the sky. The ray shone down all the way and lit up a part of the castle atop the summit of the Heavenly Snow Mountain followed by countless deafening roars and hows that began to fill the air.</p><br/><p>The Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace had the Heavenly Spirit Earthly Fiend Boundless Infinitum Set as their trump card so why wouldn\u2019t the Heavenly Snow Mountain, that had a longer history than the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, have their own trump card up their sleeve as well? Furthermore, they had never ever played this card before in the past Grand Tournaments.</p><br/><p>Figures of gigantic shadow soared up to the sky from the Snow Deity\u2019s Castle. Under the illumination of the Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory\u2019 Divine brilliance, a strong sense of coercion could immediately be felt the moment each of the huge figures showed up on the scene. Not only that, each of them would shine a strong golden beam and infuse it with the Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory as it increased the area that the Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory was enveloping.</p><br/><p>Those were all gigantic Heavenly Beasts. Heavenly Beasts that could only be found in the Heavenly Snow Mountain. After all the Heavenly Beasts had soared up to the sky, they immediately made their way towards the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s powerhouses. Even though they appeared very quickly, there would be a Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s powerhouse that leaped up to the sky to join them each time a new one appeared. In just a blink of an eye, over twenty Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s powerhouses had already found their mounts. What was more amazing was the fact that none of these twenty-odd Heavenly Beasts had a cultivation base that was lower than the Heavenly Emperor Tier.</p><br/><p>In terms of strength, a Heavenly Beast that had a cultivation base at the Heavenly King Tier and above usually would not be on par with a Heavenly Jewel Master who was at the same level. However, the difference was not too large. In any case, this was the first time everyone present on the scene witnessed the appearance of so many Heavenly Emperor-tier Heavenly Beasts all at once. What a spectacular scene this was!</p><br/><p>The aura of over twenty Heavenly Emperor-tier Heavenly Beasts united together, coupled with Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory actually decreased the area that the Destructive Divine Territory forcibly controlled. Even that purplish black light was no longer able to seal off the surrounding air completely. Streaks of lights began to pierce through from above the Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>Let alone Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun who had their brows knitted together, even Shangguan Tianyang who could be considered as their ally was completely taken aback by such a sight. After all, the Heavenly Snow Mountain had never unleashed so many Heavenly Emperor-tier Heavenly Beasts before in the past Grand Tournaments. Moreover, no one had ever joined forces with a Heavenly Beast before. Even though the number of powerhouses that the Heavenly Snow Mountain sent out was not too large, which caused them to lose the championship at the Grand Tournament every time, Shangguan Tianyang always had the feeling that there must still be some tricks up the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s sleeve. However, it had never crossed his mind that this trump card of theirs would be so impossibly excessive.</p><br/><p>Each of the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s powerhouses including Lion King Gu Site and Tiger King Xue Ao\u2019ying <sup>2 </sup>, possessed a Heavenly Emperor-tier mount of their own. From the looks of it, it was obvious that this was not the first time they joined forces with the Heavenly Beasts. After each and every one of them was settled in, their strength merged together all at once. Just take the Tiger King and the Lion King for example, after they had merged with their Heavenly Beasts, their strength immediately approached the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this was not the end of it. The Heavenly Beasts did not stop appearing continuously. In just a short amount of time, over 50 Heavenly Beasts appeared in succession at the summit of Heavenly Snow Mountain, and each of them had a cultivation base higher than the Heavenly King Tier.</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"22d0dc71-763f-3a0e-9803-24b5ad302f69\">:3 I can picture this happening in my head, so epic.

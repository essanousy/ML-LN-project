To be more accurate, both the second and third Skills activated at the same time in a fusion Skill. The Silver Emperor\u2019s own famed Skill, the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend Slash!</p><br/><p>An ear piercing explosion, as this too was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s greatest offensive Skill, exploding with full effect on the Silver Emperor which had just been struck hard by Shangguan Fei\u2019er. It gave a loud shriek as silver feathers fell from its body.</p><br/><p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing had let loose of the arrow, he had dismissed his Overlord Bow and charged forward with all his might. Without hesitation, he renewed the Dragon Silencing Seal on the Silver Emperor, not caring about wastage at this moment. At the same time, the Giant Spirit Yang Palm of his right hand grabbed onto the Silver Emperor\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The Devour Skill activated instantly, and simultaneously, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s left hand, encased with the Giant Spirit Ying Palm, also slammed hard on the Silver Emperor.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current action now was just too sly and even ironic, almost derisive.</p><br/><p>That fellow was Devouring the Silver Emperor\u2019s Heavenly Energy with his right hand, before quickly using its own Energy to pump out a Skill from his left. More so, he was using the Silver Emperor\u2019s own Spatial Rend!</p><br/><p>Soon, even this powerful and tough Silver Emperor was no longer able to handle such abuse. After three, four hits, it was knocked unconscious by Zhou Weiqing, with most of its Heavenly Energy Devoured as well.</p><br/><p>It was only then that Zhou Weiqing heaved a sigh of relief, relaxing a little. If this Silver Emperor had managed to charge into the midst of his companions, who knows how many deaths would have occurred. Tossing the Silver Emperor to Shangguan Fei\u2019er, he said angrily: \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that there were no powerful Heavenly Beasts in this Ghost Demon Forest? What\u2019s this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er pursed her lips and said: \u201cHow could I know? The Silver Emperor definitely does not live here, they are all from the north east, still beyond the northern border. Occasionally a Silver Emperor might wander the mainland due to unique circumstances, but that is rare and far between. How could I know that our luck would be so bad, to actually meet one which is wandering the mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: \u201cYou still dare say? This fellow was obviously drawn here by your cries earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er glared at him, her eyes wide opened: \u201cYou!! I haven\u2019t dealt with you yet for that, and you still dare to bring it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them stood there arguing, while at the other side, the others stood staring at them in shock.</p><br/><p>Naturally, they were not shocked because of the two of them arguing, but because of the sheer power the pair had just shown.</p><br/><p>Zang Lang and the others might not know what type of Heavenly Beast the Silver Emperor actually was, but it did not change the fact that they could sense how terrifying it was. All of them had witnessed that sheer speed of that silver glow in the sky, the intense pressure that caused their legs to feel like jelly even at such a distance.</p><br/><p>This beautiful young lady who had followed them all the way\u2026 who had not displayed anything else on the road besides her beauty and mischievous nature, was actually a Upper level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master! Heavens! Her Physical Jewel\u2026 was double the usual amount?! Her power was just too terrifying!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Zang Lang and the others had also noticed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s four sets of Heavenly Jewels, adding on to that terrifying Skill that they did not know the name of. At this moment, they truly understood how powerful this young boss that they were following.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Zang Lang and the rest might not recognize the Silver Emperor, but Lin TianAo and the other Fei Li Battle Team members certainly did, and they had a clear judgement about the Silver Emperor\u2019s power. This Silver Emperor might not have reached the Heavenly King Stage yet, but amongst all Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts, it was already considered one of the top, with its speed and terrifying offense.</p><br/><p>Especially that offensive power. The original Fei Li Battle Team members were extremely clear about how strong Lin TianAo\u2019s Assembly Shield Set was, especially after he had reached the sixth Jewel, its defense had increased several fold once more.</p><br/><p>Despite that, his shield had been destroyed in a single blow. From that, one could tell how horrifying the attack of that Silver Emperor had been. Yet, such a powerful Heavenly Beast had been taken down by Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er in such a short time, with only that tiny help from in TianAo. These two were just too unbelievable.</p><br/><p>In truth, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er had expended everything they had in that fight. The fight might have seemed quick and easy, but in just that short period of time, Zhou Weiqing had used up all of his Heavenly Energy, even the large amount he had Devoured. Shangguan Fei\u2019er was slightly better off than him, but she had also unleashed all of her Legendary Set Consolidated Equipment. Of absolute importance was also that single block of Lin TianAo\u2019s shield, which was only a seemingly tiny contribution, but critical in allowing them to accomplish it all; otherwise, even if they managed to beat the Silver Emperor in the end, Shangguan Fei\u2019er would have taken critical damage.</p><br/><p>Finally, Lin TianAo gave the order to the others. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s over. Everyone, let\u2019s go back to rest.\u201d As such, the rest of them returned to the their camp, leaving Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er to their own devices. Lin TianAo would not even attempt to think of intervening. After all, with their relationship, nothing really big would come out of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re even now, alright?\u201d Zhou Weiqing was no longer willing to continue arguing with her, and he took the initiative to say it.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er gave and angry humph, looking up into the sky. The intense fight earlier had lessened the embarrassment she had been feeling previously, but even now when she thought of that evil looking thing, her heartbeat couldn\u2019t help but start beating faster.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cI have discovered that close combat skills are really useful indeed. Who knows, I might meet an opponent with powerful Control Skills and need that. Every bit of power and ability has a time and use. Can you teach me please?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s eyes lit up, and she looked at him, saying: \u201cYou really want to learn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er shook the Silver Emperor in her hand and said: \u201cLearning close combat has to start from being beaten up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: \u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you already beat me up just now? What about the Silver Emperor, why do we do with it? Do we just kill it off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said: \u201cYou have the Darkness Attribute, don\u2019t you have any Darkness Skills? If you can Seal it, that\u2019d be great. Although this Silver Emperor has not evolved into a Heavenly King Stage yet, it is still worth a lot. Next time when you come to our Heavenly Jewel island, you can sell it off there. We have a lot of requirements for any high stage Heavenly Beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s interest was sparked, and he said: \u201cI do have a Sealing Skill, the Blood Rites \u2013 Seal of Darkness. Will that work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said in surprise: \u201cYou actually have that Skill? If you can actually succeed in Sealing it, you might actually be able control that Silver Emperor. However, its cultivation level is just too far ahead of yours, I don\u2019t know if you can actually succeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing walked up to Shangguan Fei\u2019er and said: \u201cYou\u2019ll never know if you don\u2019t try.\u201d He had after all even Skill Stored a Heavenly Emperor Stage Beast, and this Silver Emperor was only at the Zong Stage, albeit at the maximum. In terms of cultivation level difference, he was not too worried.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at him disdainfully, before saying: \u201cDon\u2019t be too overconfident, With your Heavenly Energy, you still want to enslave the Silver Emperor?\u201d She did not know why, but whenever she could succeed in knocking him down, Shangguan Fei\u2019er felt a strange happiness.</p><br/><p>Looking at her with a provoking gaze, he said: \u201cIf I were to succed in Sealing? What do you say? Do you dare bet with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er thought about it for awhile, before saying with interest: \u201cWhat do you want to bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>If Lin TianAo were here, he would immediately think that this Zhou Weiqing was going to take advantage of others by betting once again. Both he and Yun Li had lost to Zhou Weiqing just like this!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cIf you lose, then you\u2019ll have to marry me along with Bing\u2019er. If I lose, then I\u2019ll marry into the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to you and Bing\u2019er. How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er said angrily, giving him a kick.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, jumping back and avoiding her kick skillfully. \u201cYou are the one who asked me what to bet, I\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said huffily: \u201cYou already have Bing\u2019er and you\u2019re not satisfied? Trying to take advantage of me, stop dreaming! Even if I have to marry a pig, I won\u2019t marry you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a humph and said: \u201cAs if I want it that much! What do you want to bet then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s eyes spun in their sockets and she said cunningly: \u201cHow about this, if you do not succeed, when we return to the camp, you act as my horse. If you succeed, I\u2019ll forgive you for what you did earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: \u201cYou are still trying to take advantage.\u201d Thinking about her riding on him like a horse, that taut little buttocks of hers in contact with himself once more, he couldn\u2019t help but feel his body heating up, and his eyes naturally fluttered to the abovementioned portion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er said angrily.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing changed the topic hastily: \u201cAre you going to bet or not? If you want to bet, it has to be fair stakes. How about this, if you win, we\u2019ll do as you say and I\u2019ll act like a horse for you. If you lose, I\u2019ll get to smack your bottom ten times to assuage my anger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScoundrel!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er flushed deeply as she snapped.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said naturally with a beatific smile: \u201cHow did you know my middle name? So, do you want to bet or not? Make up your mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er thought about it for a moment, but she just could not see how Zhou Weiqing, at the four-Jeweled stage, could possibly Seal the Silver Emperor. After all, no matter how powerful Darkness Seals were, they would still be restricted by Heavenly Energy levels. As long as there was a difference of more than five levels of Heavenly Energy, it was already nearly impossible to successfully Seal\u2026 and the difference between Zhou Weiqing and the Silver Emperor was almost twenty levels! Unless there was some miracle, she could not see any possibility of success.</p><br/><p>Thinking about a win and how she could get her revenge on Zhou Weiqing, letting him lose face in front of all his companions, Shangguan Fei\u2019er immediately felt better. Gritting her teeth, she said: \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll bet with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at her appealing little bottom again, grinning as he said: \u201cHeh heh, alright, you watch and see then.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he grabbed the Silver Emperor in one hand before crouching down. All this while, he had not dismissed the Demonic Change State, and currently, with his right foot on the Silver Emperor, he took a deep breath to regain his Heavenly Energy and smoothen his meridians before starting on his action.</p>\n</div>"}

Saint Energy would automatically restore his body, and a Heavenly God-tier Elven Queen was guarding him by his side. How could there possibly be any problems with safety?</p><br/><p>However, the scene before him shocked Zhou Weiqing to the core. Let\u2019s not mention the fact that the Elven Queen was lying on top of him, even the changes in his body completely stunned him.</p><br/><p>While it was a big fight, his cultivation base couldn\u2019t possibly have received such a substantial increase! This could only prove one thing; with the Elven Queen\u2019s help, his body and cultivation base had received such amazing effects.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing wasn\u2019t too bothered about the advances to his cultivation base, thanks to his Saint Energy, he didn\u2019t really have many bottlenecks to speak of. He only needed to continue cultivating or to receive information from Galaxia to advance and eventually, he would be able to enter the Heavenly God Tier. However, the evolution of his body was different.</p><br/><p>He knew his body better than anyone else, so Zhou Weiqing could naturally sense that his own Dragon-Tiger Bloodline had entered a whole new level. The Dragon Emperor Bloodline and Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline did not just completely merge together, there was no longer any distinction between the two. Even the Essence of Demon God that he used to summon the Demon God had merged perfectly. This was no longer a simple Dragon-Tiger Transformation, but a Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation.</p><br/><p>An evolution like this has allowed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body to enter the Heavenly God Tier, and the level of his bloodlines had even outmatched those above the known Heavenly God Tier. One can only imagine his level of power. When you include his Upper-Level Heavenly Emperor Saint Energy, he would definitely have the ability to contend against any Heavenly God cultivator. Even though he had provided a great aid to the Elf Tribe \u2014 the Elven Princess should be safe by now. In comparison, it would seem that the benefits he received are far greater.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhou Weiqing was rather confident in himself, he would not go so far as to assume that his current looks would make the Elven Queen burn with desire, then strike some sort of special relationship with him. This was completely impossible but what on earth did she do for him?</p><br/><p>After mulling it over for a short while, Zhou Weiqing slowly calmed down. He then squatted in front of the Elven Queen, and with a slight movement in his Divine Thought, began to scan his physical situation.</p><br/><p>The scanning process was unimportant, for Zhou Weiqing gasped. The Elven Queen was actually unconscious, and it was not because of her own weakness.</p><br/><p>There were no wounds on her body, but her initially near inexhaustive and powerful Life Energy seemed so fragile that it was as if it could be cut off at any moment.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing instantly understood. He had always been a smart person, so how could he lack the skills to make a conclusion in a situation like this? Without a doubt, the Elven Queen had used a special form of mysticism to help heal him from his wounds in the shortest time possible. Because of that, she ended up in such a fragile state.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no wonder that he had received such a great improvement, you could tell how high-handed this mystical technique was, to have reduced a Heavenly God-tier cultivator like the Elven Queen to such a weakened state. While Zhou Weiqing was still unaware of the significance of the Elven Heart to the Elf Tribe, he could guarantee that the Elven Queen has definitely used her most precious ability to save him.</p><br/><p>Scratching his head in a puzzled manner, Zhou Weiqing could not help but feel embarrassed. He had only intended to fetch a good trade but ended overstepping the price, for the other party had given far more than what he had given. Under these circumstances, how could he possibly request for the Elven Blood! He did not notice the little bottle in the Elven Queen\u2019s hand. If it were not for the mouthful of blood that the Elven Queen had spat out from her mouth, she would not have become so weak.</p><br/><p>Once Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy had recovered, with the help of her Life Saint Energy, the Saint Energy automatically began an ejection, forcing the Elven Queen out. This caused the Elven Queen to lose her endurance, coupled with the fact that she had already planned on giving Zhou Weiqing her own blood, her action in spitting out her precious Elven Queen blood resulted in a state of fragility that she had never experienced before.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I cannot go back like this.\u201d He thought. If he returned with the weak-looking Elven Queen, and without any knowledge of where she had hidden the Elven Princess, the Elf Tribe would definitely be out for his blood. If they did not, it would be very strange indeed.</p><br/><p>Alright then, you gave some to me, now I\u2019m going to give you a little as well. Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly, albeit exasperatedly. Of course, at this time, his heart held no wicked intentions. He really wanted to take his clothes off again, take advantage of the Elven Queen\u2019s previous state, and squash her beneath him. Obviously, these were only thoughts. Who would dare admit to actually carrying a few wicked intentions deep down in his heart?</p><br/><p>Sitting cross-legged, Zhou Weiqing gently clapped his hands up towards the sky. Two rays of light twinkled at the same time, the purplish-red light turned into the Demonic Dragon Lady, and the black light turned into Hell\u2019s Angel. These two have long been abilities that Zhou Weiqing had used most frequently. Zhou Weiqing was more afraid of being disturbed, as he would need time to heal the Elven Queen. Hence, he needed guardians. Based on his current cultivation base, summoning the Demonic Dragon Lady and Hell\u2019s Angel was definitely more powerful than using his own living cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Pure golden light gathered in front of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest, slowly lighting up. It was the light from the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core, except, while the light was still a pure golden shade, the core position of the Saint Nucleus Core had already presented itself as a purer shade of white-gold.</p><br/><p>The deliberately crucial difference between then and now seemed to only come the moment the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core released its power. The skies darkened instantly, and little bits of starlight appeared, and thick Genesis Energy filled the sky. The Atmospheric Energy, which was initially in the air, seemed to have been absorbed by the Genesis Energy instantly. In the midst of the bits of starlight, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body followed suit and became transparent. His entire being seemed to emit an extra amount of divinity.</p><br/><p>More accurately speaking, his summoning of Nebula Saint has not reached the level of Divine Territory, because he still hasn\u2019t achieved total control over the process. Even so, this piece of Nebula Saint was a great deal more powerful than most Divine Territories. This was definitely more superior than those in the levels above it. How many would have the ability to be on the same level as Genesis Energy?</p><br/><p>The Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest suddenly felt a little kinder. Then, a ray of light shot through the skies, it was the Heavenly Core Nucleus from the man in black whom Zhou Weiqing had killed.</p><br/><p>A cultivator on the Upper Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier, who also had a Saint Nucleus Core with Saint Attribute at the Upper-Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier. How could Zhou Weiqing bear to waste it?</p><br/><p>Even though he was already severely weakened at the time, but he still preserved the Heavenly Core Nucleus at the first opportunity, storing it in his own Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core, ready and waiting to be used for absorption through Galaxia feedback, once his cultivation base was restored. However, now, he clearly had no intentions of absorbing it for himself.</p><br/><p>The splendid starlights seemed to send back information in the next moment. This time, Zhou Weiqing did not immerse himself in it. Instead, he extended his right arm, and the starlight solidified into a bundle. Then, under his guidance, slowly illuminated around the Elven Queen\u2019s chestal area. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s other hand gently pressed against the air, and gentle Nebula Saint Energy formed into a half-foot long spiral, then whirled around above the Elven Queen\u2019s chest, slowly absorbing the Galaxia feedback that fell from the skies, and then converting into the most gentle and purest Saint Energy, pouring into the Elven Queen\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen herself may not have Saint Energy, but her body was pure, a definite rare sight in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lifetime. Drinking in Nature\u2019s energy from a young age, growing up in the Goddess of Nature\u2019s baptism, the Elven Queen had a very pure body. It\u2019s a good thing that Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t do anything immoral to her, otherwise, if her purity were to be damaged in her weakened state, the Elven Queen might have perished.</p><br/><p>Gentle Saint Energy mixed with creation aura slowly entered into the Elven Queen\u2019s body, filling her weak life energy.</p><br/><p>The creation of life includes Creation Energy. The Elven Queen was able to use the Elven Heart to mobilize Life Genesis Energy and was stronger than most humans in the receptivity of Saint Energy. Besides, under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s deliberate control, the Saint Energy automatically converted into great life force upon entering the Elven Queen\u2019s body, to make up for the severe wear and tear in her body.</p><br/><p>The energy brought from Galaxia feedback from an Upper-Level Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivator is rather powerful, but to a Heavenly God Tier cultivator like the Elven Queen, this was obviously not enough. Soon, the energy from the Galaxia feedback was completely depleted, but this showed no effect to the treatment that Zhou Weiqing had given her.</p><br/><p>The pure gold starlight with a faint white-gold nucleus was spat out from the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest, making up for the position initially held by the Galaxia feedback. He was now pouring the purest of his Saint Energy into the Elven Queen.</p><br/><p>You could say that Zhou Weiqing held nothing back in healing the Elven Queen. Saint Energy brings great benefits to all living things, even though Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was still not at the level of Genesis Energy, it was pretty close. The attributes of Saint Energy was all-inclusive. Hence, it brings great benefits to people of all attributes. Even if you were not a Heaven Jewel Master and only an average person, it could still provide you with longevity.</p><br/><p>To cultivators, it had a more significant purpose. Furthermore, the higher your cultivation base, the greater the benefits received. Simply put, if a Maximum-Level Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivator were to receive Saint Energy from Zhou Weiqing, it would be highly possible for him to shoot up towards the Heavenly God Tier. For example, the current Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, the old man was now in closed-door cultivation in the Heavenly Bow Empire. With the help of his precious disciple, his bottleneck which has been around for more than ten years showed signs of loosening up.</p><br/><p>Cultivators at the Heavenly God Tier could not only gain comprehension of the heavens and earth but could also hold the world in their grasp. They would truly be considered to be masters in their own Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>The benefits that a Heavenly God-tier cultivator would have after receiving Saint Energy could not be easily described in a concrete manner as the benefits would be all rounded. Aside from the comprehension of the heavens and earth, it would bring an even deeper, profoundly meaningful and incomparable benefit to Heavenly God-tier cultivators.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The sword gleamed with a distorted light that turned black without any warning. When the Blue Rain Hibiscus clashed with the black light, it did not put up any resistance and faded away maniacally. The sword seemed to pierce through the Demonic Emperor\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>The ferocity in the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor\u2019s eyes was clear for all to see. A powerful Destruction Energy burned from deep within his sword. He had absolute confidence that Wu Yunyue would not be able to block his blade. In truth, he was only feigning weakness in the previous battle. If Wu Yunyue had only launched a simple attack, perhaps he would have stuck to his plan and consumed Wu Yunyue\u2019s absolute cultivation base before he admitted defeat. However, Wu Yunyue\u2019s attack that was filled with killing intent had angered him thoroughly. He no longer cared about Huang Xingyun\u2019s orders. He wanted to use this opportunity to defeat the Demonic Emperor with a blow. Judging from his Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivation base, once the longsword that was filled with a high level of dense Destruction Energy pierced through Wu Yunyue\u2019s body, the Destruction Energy would cause Wu Yunyue\u2019s body to explode. Not only would it destroy Wu Yunyue instantly, no trace of him would remain even with the protection of the Time Attribute.</p><br/><p>A loud explosion reverberated clearly and loudly in the entire area. The entire Heavenly Snow Mountain could hear it very clearly. Then, a blood red light appeared in the sky as two black shadows descended from the sky causing the initially distorted light to scatter.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom! Two bodies were fiercely flung onto the peak of Heavenly Snow Mountain followed by a rain of blood that covered the skies.</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned. They could tell that the figure that had fallen down from the sky to the ground was the corpse of the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor.</p><br/><p>His body was severed from his left thigh all the way to his right shoulder. It was severed \u2014 cleanly and magnificently. One could even see a dense aura of the Evil Attribute in the Heavenly Energy on the two devastated halves of his body. With a few dazzling techniques, he managed to destroy the tough and tenacious body of a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse to the extent that the body was now beyond recognition.</p><br/><p>\u2018What was going on?\u2019 This was a question that everyone was asking. Even though Wu Yunyue previously had the upper hand, when the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor utilized Time Mirror Image to evade the life-threatening attack, he had managed to snatch back the upper hand.Even if he was unable to defeat Wu Yunyue, the victor should not have been decided in such a short time.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wu Yunyue was descending from the sky as well. At first glance, he looked completely unscathed. Only his middle finger on his left hand that was concealed in his sleeve was completely swollen. He would not be able to use it in a battle for a short period of time at least.</p><br/><p>Even in death, the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor still had his eyes wide opened. His gaze was filled with disbelief. Wu Yunyue glanced at him coldly and increased the density of his overbearing aura.</p><br/><p>Only Wu Yunyue himself knew what had happened. The deafening bang came from Wu Yunyue when he used his left middle finger to flick away the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor\u2019s blade that was filled with Destruction Energy.</p><br/><p>In the midst of dealing his crucial blow, the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor was flicked off by Wu Yunyue. He had concentrated all of his Heavenly Energy completely in that one blow. How could he have possibly anticipated that his own attack would be so easily neutralized? Naturally, he was also unable to evade Wu Yunyue\u2019s counter slash and ended up with his body sliced in half.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue looked at Zhou Weiqing. Both men had a momentary exchange, communicating with their eyes. Zhou Weiqing could roughly guess what had actually happened. Huang Xingyun, on the other side, stared dolefully at Wu Yunyue as if he could attack him at any moment.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Emperor glanced at him with mild disdain. Just as he was about to say something, Zhou Weiqing was already next to him. He spoke apologetically, \u201cValley Lord Huang, I\u2019m truly sorry. Our Vice Sect Master momentarily lost control and was unable to show mercy. Sigh, fights between Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses are indeed cruel! I ask that you do not take this to heart, Valley Lord Huang. It\u2019s the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands after all. Death and injuries are unavoidable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the pitiful look on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face, Huang Xingyun almost gnashed his teeth in anger, \u201cFine. That\u2019s a good one, Peerless Sect. Wu Yunyue, I hope you can keep going like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue grew calmer due to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arrival. He replied emotionlessly, \u201cIf you\u2019re not satisfied, why not personally take the field. However, if you plan on facing me, you\u2019ll need to get in line. Next!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic Emperor, after you.\u201d Naturally, it was the powerhouse from Blood Red Hell, placed behind Love Valley, who had entered the second round. Fen Tian sent a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse as well. However, at this time, Fen Tian was frowning as he stared at the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue. His looked like he was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, from the beginning of the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands, it was the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue from the Peerless Sect who had the most eye-catching performance. He is also the only one to pass the first round. Even though this was also directly related to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s smoothly drawn lot, Wu Yunyue has also been able to defeat both his opponents in immediate succession and is currently the only one who has been able to win two fights in succession. Especially the recent round against the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor, where he won in a short period of time, fiercely issued a death blow, and raised the atmosphere of the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands into suspense.</p><br/><p>Of course, Wu Yunyue may have delivered a powerful performance, but at least based on the current situation, the other four Great Saint Lands still found it all very acceptable. After all, Wu Yunyue was once a leader of the Five Great Saint Lands. In the previous Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands, he was always the last to emerge. It was normal to have a contestant with powers slightly higher than the rest. Besides, it was Yun Ruoyun of Love Valley in the first round who was an aberration, to have actually lost the match so easily.</p><br/><p>Two figures rose to the sky once again. The emotions of the Five Saint Lands observing the match from below showed a clear change as well. Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian were naturally the ones who paid the most attention. They stared squarely upon the two powerhouses as they ascended the sky. Zhou Weiqing smiled at Fen Tian and said, \u201cI wonder when are you prepared to personally take the field, Hell Lord! By simply sending out your subordinates\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that you won\u2019t stand a chance in the Grand Tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian glanced at Zhou Weiqing with an indifferent expression, \u201cThe Grand Tournament has only just begun. Sect Master Zhou, you seem to be talking prematurely. Wu Yunyue might be powerful, but he cannot possibly hold on like this for too long. Do you really think that he can take me on, head to head?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cOf course not. Only that I\u2019ve heard of Lord Fen Tian\u2019s great name since a long time ago. I do wonder if I can actually take you on head-to-head, Hell Lord, and get some advice. Sigh. How unfortunate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s unfortunate?\u201d Fen Tian stared at the remorseful-looking Zhou Weiqing with a mild suspicion.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sniggered, \u201cI\u2019m only saying that it\u2019s unfortunate that there are so many powerhouses in Blood Red Hell. However, I don\u2019t know how many will return with their lives this time around!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for your own death.\u201d Two Blood Red Hell powerhouses behind Fen Tian were enraged and were about to charge towards him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing exclaimed with a terrified look on his face, \u201cAh! Unable to win the Grand Tournament, and here you are, wanting to violate the rules of the Grand Tournament? I\u2019m so scared of you! Come on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing might not be speaking very loudly, but not a single person in Heavenly Snow Mountain did not have the stature of being a powerhouse. Naturally, they heard this very clearly. Instantly, a numb expression appeared on many of the powerhouses\u2019 faces. Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain Xue Ao\u2019tian and Shangguan Tianyue glanced over, putting on an \u2018I don\u2019t know who this person is\u2019 look on their faces.</p><br/><p>The battle in the skies had begun. Compared to the last two battles, Wu Yunyue looked as if he had gone wild from eating medicine this time around. He did not remove his Demonic Change and his Demonic Emperor Set. He had long harbored a deep hatred towards the Blood Red Hell, from the moment the Heavenly Emperor of Blood Red Hell rose to the air, he unleashed an attack that had the force equivalent to a torrential rain.</p><br/><p>In the air, all you could see was a grey-colored omnipresence filled with Evil Energy. Powerful Evil Attribute bore down like the weight of Mount Taishan, forcibly stifling the opponent as if Wu Yunyue could not care less about the depletion of his energy. His crazed attacks rendered the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor powerless to fight back. The Blue Rain Hibiscus coupled with his Demonic Emperor Sword caused the heavens and earth to transform with his every attack.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor may not be a weakling and had chosen to unleash the Destruction Attribute from the very beginning. However, his cultivation base was still a little inferior to that of Wu Yunyue\u2019s. More importantly, the Destruction Attribute that he had unleashed had no effect towards Wu Yunyue\u2019s Evil and Life Attributes. It felt as if he were simply relying on his Fire Affinity to contend against Wu Yunyue.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian observed the situation in the sky and frowned. However, there was a flash in his gaze as he carelessly shot a look toward Love Valley, and coincidentally caught the Lord of Love Valley, Huang Xingyun looking at him. Both men communicated silently through their eyes and saw the chill in the opposing party\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>It was only momentary, and not many people managed to notice this change in the two Lords of the two Saint Lands.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue\u2019s attacks were simply too powerful. Under the conditions of the Demonic Change, he who was at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor-tier had absolute control \u2013 vertically and horizontally. With the Demonic Emperor Sword in his hand, he gave everything he had with every slash and showed no signs of mercy. On top of that, the Blue Rain Hibiscus continuously attacked the enemy from every angle. Under these attacks, one would be dreaming if they were thinking to use a Heavenly Skill Projection.</p><br/><p>The main reason why Wu Yunyue\u2019s had the ability to kill the Heavenly Emperor from Love Valley at the last minute, was because he had Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy in his body. With the help of Saint Energy, he no longer feared the Destruction Attribute. Otherwise, in that last second, he could only choose to dodge, and would never have been able to successfully kill his opponent.</p><br/><p>Fen Tien had clearly noticed this now but so what if he had? Zhou Weiqing having the Saint Energy was no secret. The only new thing he discovered was that Zhou Weiqing was able to transmit Saint Energy to other people.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d Continuously suppressed, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor was red with rage. Suddenly, his entire body turned black. His weapon was a long saber. At that moment, the tyrannical Destruction Energy was taken away, and the long saber reacted in a way that could split the heavens and earth throughout its body. A black, crescent-shaped light appeared from the saber and charged toward Wu Yunyue.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

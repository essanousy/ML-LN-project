A sheen of pale green light appeared on Bing\u2019er\u2019s pair of gigantic wings as she shook off the Consolidating Papers that landed on them. Above the huge, wide-open wings, the papers fit snugly in a neat position.</p><br/><p>The divine Wind Attribute wings had a wingspan of ten meters, and they were fully covered with about 50 sheets of Consolidating Paper.</p><br/><p>With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation, naturally, it was not necessary for Bing\u2019er to help him at all. However, he had only revealed that his cultivation base was at the Fifth Jewel. Naturally, he could not make himself stand out too much, and it was vital for him to conceal his cultivation base. Otherwise, it could let slip the secret that he had already mastered the Heavenly Dao Energy if he showed his proficiency. He would definitely be treated as a monster by the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s high-ranked officials. Not only that, they would undoubtedly be more guarded against him.</p><br/><p>What was he going to do? 50 sheets of Consolidating Papers? Did he really plan to use all of them to make Consolidated Equipment Scrolls? That would take a f*cking long time, wouldn\u2019t it? There might be no point in having the banquet today.</p><br/><p>Although everyone who was present had doubts, nobody dared to stop Zhou Weiqing at that moment. They could not wait to witness what powerful technique this new God Tier Master was going to show them, and if he was worthy of the title Honorary Master.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing waved his hands again. This time, 50 tiny crystal bottles appeared out of thin air. Each of the bottles held a different type of Consolidating Ink in it. Slowly, every one of them landed on the 50 Consolidating Papers respectively seemingly aided by Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s Wind attribute.</p><br/><p>This time, even Meng Xing and Nie Han could no longer sit still. Almost at the same time, the two of them walked out from behind the desk. They stood in a trance behind Zhou Weiqing. This was because the both of them could clearly see that the Consolidated Equipment Scrolls that Zhou Weiqing was about to make were actually 50 sets with completely different functions respectively.</p><br/><p>Turning around, Zhou Weiqing flashed a smile at Meng Xing. \u201cMeng Xing, can you lend me two Consolidating Brushes, please? I only have my usual one with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing nodded her head. Without asking any question, she quickly passed two Consolidating Brushes to him. Although the two brushes could not compare to the one that Zhou Weiqing used when he crafted the God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll, they were still of excellent quality.</p><br/><p>After he had gotten his hands on the two Consolidating Brushes, Zhou Weiqing returned to his spot behind Bing\u2019er once again. With a brush in each hand, he lifted both of his arms slightly and gradually closed his eyes in concentration.</p><br/><p>Because he was the center of everyone\u2019s attention, after Zhou Weiqing completed his action, everyone on the scene could immediately feel the obvious shift in his aura.</p><br/><p>In truth, nobody on the scene cared about his cultivation base that was at the Fifth Jewel. But in that instant, he was emitting an aura that they could not help but greatly admire. His entire aura seemed like it was elevated to another level that was much more dominant than the people present. This aura did not come from his physical force. Instead, it was unique, and it seemed to have come from the innermost part of him as it slowly spread out. It was as magnificent as the tall mountains, and yet, it was also like the clouds that were drifting freely in the sky. Basically, the aura was imposing, but it was not oppressive.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was standing the closest to Zhou Weiqing, so she had a view of his side profile.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhou Weiqing was not very handsome, the unique quality that he exuded from his body and the state that he was in right now as his body merged with the environment made her usually calm heart fluttered very lightly.</p><br/><p>A man with confidence was indeed charming. A confident man with a prodigious talent was even more irresistibly charismatic. On top of that, he was still at a very young age. Compared to those handsome men who were good looking and only pleasing to the eyes but had no capabilities, men like Zhou Weiqing were much more attractive to a lady of elegance and poise.</p><br/><p>It was precisely for this reason that he was able to get so many stunning beauties to stay by his side. Had it not been for the exceptional talent that made him stand out during the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, he probably would not even stand a chance to meet Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Xue\u2019er. Had it not been his bloodline that attracted Tian\u2019er greatly, they would not have interacted in the first place.</p><br/><p>Other than his bad-boy charm that attracted the girls\u2019 attention, the reason why so many beauties were attracted to Zhou Weiqing was becau of his resolution, the honesty in his soul, the powerful talents he displayed, and the sincere heart that he had.</p><br/><p>seA God Tier Consolidated Equipment Master like Meng Xing also could not help but be attracted to him. Even though right now she was merely impressed by his powerful Heavenly Energy, he had already left a deep impression in her heart.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing had no idea that his own actions had managed to elicit new feelings from her. Right now, he was completely immersed in a mystical state.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had graduated from being Huyan Aobo\u2019s disciple, Zhou Weiqing actually did not really put much effort into crafting Consolidated Equipment Scrolls after he left. However, during the period when he was still a disciple, Huyan Aobo had laid a very deep foundation in him for his lessons. In order to not disrupt Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation, Huyan Aobo had passed on all of his knowledge to him. Of course, Zhou Weiqing had been forced by Huyan Aobo to memorize most of them.</p><br/><p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s memory was quite good. At the very least, he did not forget all of the things that he had learned even though quite a few years had passed. Although he did not spend too much effort in crafting Consolidated Equipment Scrolls, he was not the least inferior to Yun Li in terms of theoretical knowledge. On top of that, when he stepped on to the Heavenly Jewel Island for the first time, he even received guidance from three God Tier Masters for a short while. For this reason, his knowledge alone was enough for him to become a God Tier Master. Not only that, the three God Tier Masters specially created a God Tier Consolidated Equipment so he could watch and learn.</p><br/><p>After his cultivation base had reached the Ninth Jewel along with the advancement of his Saint Energy, by using the strong Saint Energy\u2019s perception ability, he was able to achieve mastery and become well-versed in the knowledge that he had forcefully memorized in the past.</p><br/><p>For a genius, especially one who possessed Saint Energy, it was rather easy for Zhou Weiqing to absorb the knowledge that his predecessors imparted to them. In fact, when Zhou Weiqing came to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland in The Pearl, he had already started to absorb this knowledge to make preparations for himself and Bing\u2019er. Even Bing\u2019er did not know about this. This was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s best strength compared to ordinary people. He was able to take the whole situation into consideration and plan ahead. Because of this, even though he might not be a good general, he definitely had the potential to become a great commander. It was just that he had never been interested in the military.</p><br/><p>The creation of the Consolidated Equipment Scroll a few days ago had managed to help him verify the knowledge that he had gained. He was now truly and thoroughly acquainted with the knowledge that he possessed. After the few days of hibernating, he felt completely refreshed the moment he woke up, as if he had truly become a real God Tier Master. Of course, he, the God Tier Master, still needed to rely on the Time Attribute to cheat a little in order to demonstrate his full strength.</p><br/><p>All of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s masters who were present subconsciously held their breath and silence descended upon the spacious and luxurious hall. They were afraid to disrupt Zhou Weiqing\u2019s process in case it left an unfavorable impression on this new God Tier Master.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not let the crowd wait for long. After three long breaths, he started to make his move.</p><br/><p>Five Heavenly Jewels began to emerge slowly on each of his hands. The Alexandrite\u2019s Cat Eye gems on his left hand instantaneously became the center of attention.</p><br/><p>Rich, flavorful green and silver colors appeared simultaneously within his hands. It highlighted the two Consolidating Brushes, making them seem brilliant and dazzling.</p><br/><p>In a flash, Zhou Weiqing went next to Bing\u2019er\u2019s stretched out wings. With a shake of his wrist, the caps of two Consolidating Ink bottles popped open.</p><br/><p>As fast as lightning! These were the only words that could describe Zhou Weiqing\u2019s movement. Not only that, instead of blinding the rest with his erratic movements, his every move seemed to follow a special kind of rhythm. It left a pleasant feeling in the spectators. Each of his every move was very harmonious. It made him look very skilfull and dexterous, yet rapid and rather brisk.</p><br/><p>He shocked the two God Tier Masters that were standing at the back as he simultaneously dipped the two Consolidating Brushes into two different Consolidating Ink.</p><br/><p>The brushes in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands landed on two different pieces of Consolidating Papers. With lightning speed, his hands started to move across the papers.</p><br/><p>The two Consolidating Ink that Zhou Weiqing used was totally different! This meant that they were both used for two different Consolidated Equipment Scrolls.</p><br/><p>Multitasking? Making two different Consolidated Equipment Scrolls at the same time? Any God Tier Master would also find this to be an impossible task.</p><br/><p>For any Consolidated Equipment Master, the most important thing that they had to master was the rhythm. This was to ensure that no mistakes occurred when the scrolls were made in one go. However, what Zhou Weiqing was doing now totally contradicted this theory. Two different Consolidated Equipment Scrolls would require two different rhythms, and right now, what he was demonstrating was precisely two different rhythms.</p><br/><p>Silver and green light merged together on the tip of the brushes. Even the top Heavenly Jewel Masters by the side could not clearly see what Zhou Weiqing was doing. With just a stroke of his hands, along with a simple sketch, two rays were already blooming out of the Consolidating Paper under his hands.</p><br/><p>The moment the stunning ray burst forth from the Consolidating Paper, even the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master who was sitting on the master seat could not help but exclaim out loud. This was because everyone knew that the eye-catching ray was the light that would flash after a Consolidated Equipment Scroll was completed.</p><br/><p>Even with the bright light obscuring their sights, they could discern that it was only a Master Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll. Nonetheless, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s speed was too fast. The entire process only took the duration of a breath or two. Not only that, that also included the time he took to dip the brushes into the Consolidating Ink.</p><br/><p>When the two God Tier Masters saw such an alarming speed, they thought that even they themselves could not finish making a Master Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll in such a short time. On top of that, Zhou Weiqing made two different scrolls at the same time. In their opinion, this was a feat that was absolutely impossible to achieve.</p><br/><p>One stroke from him only took the span of a breath. Not only that, he was also multitasking. Even the saying \u2018practice makes perfect\u2019 was not enough to describe his action.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

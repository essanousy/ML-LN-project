(2)</b></p><br/><p>Seeing that Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not reply him, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand did not hesitate to stab down with the arrow once again, this time close to his chest. Before Shangguan Bing\u2019er could react, another *pssh* sound rang out as the arrow sank in and blood once again spurted out.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing showed his savage side, as he grit his teeth. Despite the sweat beading on his forehead, he stood there resolutely, not moving an inch, as if the 2 arrows weren\u2019t stuck in him. Once again, his hands moved towards the quiver, taking out another arrow. \u201cNo more!\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er finally caved in, and in a green flash of light, her hands were grasping hold of the hand holding the arrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fool! Aren\u2019t you afraid of death? Afraid of pain? Why must you hurt yourself?\u201d Looking at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s upper half of the body, which was now soaked in fresh blood, the anger in her heart had long since evaporated. She raised her hands to try and seal the blood flow, but Zhou Weiqing grabbed her hands instead..</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me explain to you first; once that is done, we can treat it.\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s voice was very soft and gentle, looking at her with love in his eyes. All that he had done was a gamble, a gamble that she also held some reciprocal feelings for him, that she would stop him. It worked, and when Shangguan Bing\u2019er had cried, he knew he had finally succeeded.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, do you want to die? Let me stop the blood first, then I\u2019ll listen to your explanation okay?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er said between sobs, pulling her hands from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s grasp. She pulled out the arrow from his hand and threw it away, then placed her hands at his wounds and circulated her Heavenly Energy into his body, repelling the arrows embedded in his body with a deft touch before quickly sealing the blood flow.</p><br/><p>She then tore his sleeve away, and when she saw the wounds, she drew a sharp breath; they were extremely deep.</p><br/><p>In truth, she did not know that if Zhou Weiqing had not activated his Heavenly Jewels and absorbed the black pearl\u2019s evil aura, he would have died by now. Originally, when he had first swallowed the black pearl, a drop of blood on his fist had already dissolved a large Stars Tree, furthermore he had bled out so much. Shangguan Bing\u2019er quickly took out a clean white shirt from her backpack, tearing it into strips, and used it to bandage his wounds carefully.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing just stood there, watching as she bandaged him. At this moment, his tensed breath was finally relieved, and the serious eyes turned lively once again.</p><br/><p>Quickly bandaging his wounds, Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s forehead was full of sweat as well, and her hands stained with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s go to the side to rest.\u201d She looked up at Zhou Weiqing, only to see his pale, ashen face, his eyes closed as he started swaying. Shocked, she quickly held on to his other arm, but as soon as she did so, his body crumpled, falling into her arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, Little Fatty, don\u2019t scare me!\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er quickly held him. Even when facing stronger enemies, or when they were facing the direwolf pack, he had not sustained such heavy injuries; yet for her sake, Zhou Weiqing who feared death so much had actually inflicted such heavy self injuries, what more was there to say?</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er quickly helped him to the roadside, seating herself against a tree while holding Zhou Weiqing in her embrace.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes feebly, giving a forced smile as he said: \u201cBing\u2019er, I\u2019m alright. As long as you\u2019re willing to listen to my explanation, I can even take another two more arrows.\u201d This wasn\u2019t him spouting nonsense; with his body\u2019s current physique, as long as he wasn\u2019t stabbed in the heart, he would be able to recover from two more stabs. At this moment of weakness for Shangguan Bing\u2019er, if he didn\u2019t take advantage of the situation, he wouldn\u2019t be called Zhou Weiqing. Nestled in her soft embrace, although his shoulder hurt so much that it felt numb, his heart felt as if it had eaten honey and was indescribably comfortable.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s tears fell like pearls from a cut necklace as she said: \u201cLittle Fatty, you don\u2019t need to speak anymore. I trust you. Even if you lied to me, I\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d Before today, even during the time when they were facing the Forest Direwolves and Zhou Weiqing had tried to sacrifice his life for hers, her heart was still confused; she had not known how she felt about him.</p><br/><p>However, just in that instant when Zhou Weiqing had resolutely stabbed the arrow into his own body, Shangguan Bing\u2019er felt as if a knife had stabbed right into her heart as well. Only then did she realise that this rascally, shameless and brazen fellow had somehow imprinted himself in her heart.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing slowly closed his eyes, as his voice grew serious. Still weak, he said faintly: \u201cBing\u2019er, I really did not lie to you, I never have. Do you remember, when you first asked me about my past, I said I did not want to lie to you, and asked you not to ask further. I admit that I hid my past, but I would not lie to you, at that time if I had told you my identity, would you have allowed me to stay in the army camp? I was afraid you would have shipped me back to my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er bit her lips and said: \u201cBut\u2026 you already have a fiancee, yet you behaved as if nothing was happening to stay beside me. Do you think you\u2019re treating her fairly? Treating me fairly? How can you even face us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said bitterly: \u201cI have never treated Difuya as my fiancee, how could I even speak of treating her or facing her? A woman who would try to kill her own fiance, do you think I would even think of her? Do you know why I happened to swallow the black pearl originally?\u201d As such, he told Shangguan Bing\u2019er about how he chanced upon Difuya bathing, and how he had been left for the dead.</p><br/><p>\u201c... After I ran away, I left a message for my father asking him to help me reject the marriage. After all, she doesn\u2019t fancy me, which I can understand; nor do I fancy her. No matter how beautiful a woman is, if her heart is not good, how can I accept her? She has never been in my heart, and the person I really love is you. You\u2019re so gentle, and kind; while Difuya, I only caught a glimpse of her bathing, and didn\u2019t really see her naked, yet she already tried to kill me. On the other hand, for you, even after I did that to you, you thought about the bigger picture and restrained yourself from killing me, even though you were more than justified to do so, and you even helped train me to become a Heavenly Jewel Master. Ever since that day, your kindness and compassion had touched me, and after spending so much time with you, I have really fallen for you. Bing\u2019er, I really am no longer able to live without you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er flushed and stammered: \u201cBut\u2026 Admiral Zhou\u2026 did he manage to reject the betrothal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cMy dad is fond of his face, and it won\u2019t be easy for him to do that in front of godfather. I\u2019ll personally tell godfather when we return. Bing\u2019er don\u2019t worry, even if I have wives in the future, it would never be Difuya.\u201d [1. gg]</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded gently, saying: \u201cEn\u2026\u201d However, almost instantly, she realised something was wrong, and her eyes widened. \u201cWhat did you say?? You still want to have other wives??!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErrr\u2026 I misspoke\u2026 \u2026 Aiiyaahhh, my wound hurts!\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head lolled to the side, his face pale as he \u2018fainted\u2019 then. When he fainted, he still didn\u2019t forget to position his head properly, landing right in her bosom. While his feelings were real, it wouldn\u2019t extinguish his rascally nature.</p><br/><p>At first, he was just enjoying the feeling of being pressed against Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s soft body; the feeling was just too great. However, his blood loss was too great, and before long, he had really fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>After an unknown amount of time had passed, Zhou Weiqing finally awoke. As soon as he opened his eyes, he found himself lying down with Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s lap as his pillow, with some of her spare clothing covering him like a quilt. Warmth flooded his heart, and he couldn\u2019t help but wish that the moment would last forever.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s small hand rested on his forehead: \u201cYou\u2019re finally awake, there\u2019s no more fever. How do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing twitched comfortably on her leg, and seeing her concerned look, his heart was filled with tenderness. Moving his shoulder tentatively, he found that although it still hurt, it was already much better. He knew that his recuperative abilities were a lot stronger than a normal human\u2019s due to the black pearl, as evidenced from the previous time he was injured by the Direwolf King\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, you won\u2019t leave me again right?\u201d Zhou Weiqing lifted up his right hand to hold hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmmn.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded softly, a blush tinting her cheeks.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing struggled to get up, then unreservedly leaning into her, he put his right arm on her shoulders to support himself as he leaned in closer\u2026</p><br/><p>As his face grew closer, the flush on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s beautiful face grew deeper, and she said softly: \u201cKnock it off, you\u2019re still injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing immediately seized upon her word gleefully and said: \u201cDoes that mean, as soon as my injuries are healed, we can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er chided him reproachfully: \u201cCan\u2019t you be more proper!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cBeing proper is not my style! After all, they say that girls only fall for bad boys. Bing\u2019er, do you know that today\u2019s my birthday, my 14th birthday. Previously, at Master Huyan\u2019s place, when I said that there were 2 more months before I reached 14, I was just randomly giving a time. In truth, today is my actual birthday. How about giving me a kiss as a birthday present?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFourteen\u2026\u201d Hearing his age, Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s expression grew a little strange, and she put her hand to his mouth and said: \u201cLittle Fatty, you\u2019re just fourteen years old, and not fully grown up yet. We shouldn\u2019t be too intimate, or it\u2019ll affect your growth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was dumbfounded, he had not expected that he had dropped a rock on his own foot [2. Lol, couldn\u2019t help laughing at his predicament. Anyway, that was another literal translation of , which pretty much means he shot himself in the foot], the expression on his face turned weird.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er thought he was angry, and gave him a quick peck on his cheeks. \u201cHappy Birthday Little Fatty, I\u2019m already yours, so I\u2019ll wait for you to grow up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t know what to say to that, having a very complicated feeling in his heart, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>As it was already four hours later, the two decided to continue on their journey, though it was only after Shangguan Bing\u2019er had verified that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s wounds were pretty much healed before agreeing to continue traveling. Of course, they were no longer chasing one after the other, but were running hand in hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

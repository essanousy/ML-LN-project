Basis?\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked at the youth and said passively: \u201cMy basis is my fist. Since my fist is stronger than yours\u2026 Might is right! In the future, my word is the rule for the class. At least in the next four years, no matter who it is, no one is allowed to surrender and depend on either noble families or the Skill Storing Palace. After four years, when we have all graduated, everyone will go on their own path, and you can do whatever you want then. I can\u2019t control anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he walked slowly towards the youth, who continued staring at him with a burning gaze without backing down. Even Ma Qun who was standing beside the youth knitted his brows. Zhou Weiqing was being unbelievably arrogant. Even Kou Rui had a rather ugly look on his face, while the other seniors who were around them looked towards Zhou Weiqing as if he were crazy.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er grabbed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arm, saying softly: \u201cLittle Fatty, what\u2019s wrong? We\u2019re all classmates, don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly because we are classmates that\u2019s why I am doing this.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said coldly as his gaze swept across all the freshmen commoner students. He saw fear, anger, discontent, apprehension, all sorts of emotions and looks expressed on their faces and eyes. \u201cAs a person, one needs to be able to stand up tall and straight. If one has no backbone, how does one become a strong person? Have you ever heard in the Jewel Master world of any strong person who was a slave? Let me teach you all a lesson. As a human being, one has to stand up tall, straighten your backbone. As such, I will not allow my classmates to be slaves to others, I do not want to see you all dwarfed or looked down on by others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was still being held onto by Shangguan Bing\u2019er, he walked on to the front of the youth. That youth was indeed stubborn and strong willed, facing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s imposing aura, he did not back down.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing walked to only one chi from the youth before stopping. \u201cEarlier, you asked me, what is my basis? Alright, let me tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he lifted up his hand and wiped it across the spatial necklace around his neck. Instantly, a gold coin storage card appeared in his hands, and he pushed it in front of the youth. \u201cIn this card, there is at least 400,000 gold coins of value. From today onwards, all of our classmates\u2019 requirements for Skill Storing will be paid for by that. If it runs out, I will top it up. I do not need you all to submit to me or enslave yourselves to me, but in this four years I will pay for your requirements, and all I require is that you all stand up tall and be a real person, and not a dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, everyone around erupted into words. The first impression of the seniors around was that this fellow had gone crazy, paying for his classmates\u2019 Skill Storing without requiring anything in return?! Isn\u2019t that insanity?</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the freshmen were all dumbfounded, staring at Zhou Weiqing with a strange expression on their faces. This fellow in front of them might be crazy, but he was a really cute and adorable crazy! After all, if given a choice, who would want to become a dog, become a slave and be bound by Darkness Seals?</p><br/><p>The cold, grave youth subconsciously took the card from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands. His eyes, originally full of anger and stubborness, were now dazed. \u201cYou should know that Skill Storing isn\u2019t really the issue, and Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment is actually the real problem. Even a normal set of low level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls will cost at least 50,000 gold coins, and this 400,000 gold coins will not last long. Furthermore, even if you are rich, it doesn\u2019t mean that you will be able to purchase Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, since they are still very rare!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: \u201cI said that I would handle it\u2026 Kou Rui!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d Kou Rui heard his name being called and ran over. \u201cBoss? You called me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing patted him on his shoulder and said: \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing, Kou Rui said: \u201cI trust you. Since I have already made my decision to follow you, I will not regret it. My father said, in our lives, we always have some opportunities or chances which appear before us, and we will need to seize the opportunity and not let go of it. I believe that this is my opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily. \u201cVery good, I also believe in that. Help me hold this.\u201d As he said that, he once swiped his hand across his Spatial Necklace, and a sheet of paper appeared in his hands. He asked Kou Rui to hold two edges of it, while Shangguan Bing'er held the other two edges, keeping the paper horizontally flat in midair. Turning to the grave youth, he said: \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis? Could this be\u2026 Consolidating Paper?\u201d Came the surprised reply.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: \u201cWatch.\u201d As he said that, he flicked his wrists, and before anyone could see clearly, a brush and a small bottle appeared in his hands. As he opened the bottle cap, he dipped the brush into the bottle, which was filled with Consolidating Ink. Taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze seemed to turn sharp as he focused, his eyes narrowing as his entire concentration was on the Consolidating Paper before him.</p><br/><p>By now, that Ye Lou fellow returned with seven to eight academy teachers in tow. Ding Chen\u2019s injuries weren\u2019t light, and he could make use of that against Zhou Weiqing. His big bro was not attending this opening ceremony, and if he found out about what happened, he would be extremely angry, and Ye Lou would be in trouble. Since he wasn\u2019t able to deal with Zhou Weiqing personally, then he would let the teachers deal with him! First would be to get him expelled using Ding Chen\u2019s injuries as an excuse, and once he was expelled they could deal with him slowly.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ding Chen\u2019s injured body on the floor, two of the teachers rushed over immediately to start healing him, while the others walked towards Zhou Weiqing. Just as Ye Lou was about to speak, the leader of the teachers, looking about 50 years of age, stopped him. He stared at the paper that Shangguan Bing'er and Kou Rui was holding, surprise in his eyes. \u201cWait. Let\u2019s see what he is up to. That\u2019s a Consolidating Paper\u2026 And it\u2019s an empty one too\u2026 Could it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing started moving. His movements were not quick, on the contrary, they were extremely slow and measured. It was as if nothing in the background mattered, that nothing was affecting him, and nothing had happened earlier. As the brush moved up and down steadily, it brought along a shimmering silver glow as the Consolidating Ink swirled around on the paper, etching deep into it.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the hall was staring at Zhou Weiqing, most of the students even standing to look. Many of the students who were originally far away did not know exactly what was going on, but steadily more and more attention was drawn here.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing seemed to have lapsed into a strange, unique rhythm. With his stroke of the brush, a mark was left on the Consolidating Paper. As he continued drawing, the image of small round shield slowly appeared on the paper, strange symbols and tattoos seemingly making everything fall into place. The entire process was very slow, but natural and smooth, like the endless flow of water in a stream. His actions did not stop a second, and every brushstroke seemed to be linked to the world.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was focused fully on the Consolidated Paper, while Shangguan Bing'er was focused on his face. As the saying goes, a man who is focused at work is at his finest, and at that moment she finally understood what all that he was doing, the deeper meaning in it all. <i>Of course! My Little Fatty was never a careless person, how could he do anything for nothing?</i></p><br/><p>Finally, Zhou Weiqing completed the last brushstroke with a flourish, and a brilliant gold light shone forth, and the unique aura of a Consolidating Equipment Scroll was released. Although it was just a split second, it was something that the surrounding onlookers \u00a0would never forget.</p><br/><p>Although Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were rare, there were many Jewel Masters around, and quite a few had used Consolidating Equipment Scrolls before.</p><br/><p>However, witnessing the actual process of creation of a scroll was something that almost none of them had been through! However, though they hadn't seen it before, they had at least heard of the process. When the gold light flashed out, even a fool would know that Zhou Weiqing had completed the Consolidating Equipment Scroll.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing kept the scroll from Shangguan Bing'er and Kou Rui\u2019s hands, and turned once more to the cold youth. What he saw was a look of surprise and respect, the cold look in his face gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cElemental Jewel Skill Storing, Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment. My dear classmates, what else do you all lack? I am a mid level Consolidating Equipment Master. As I said, I can upkeep all of you, without any need for repayment, and I can do so even for the Consolidating Equipment you need. I am a commoner, but I believe that with my ability at creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, I have the right to say all that. Are you all willing to spend the next four years with me? To not allow anyone to bully us?\u201d</p><br/><p>After creating that Consolidating Equipment Scroll, Zhou Weiqing did not show any signs of fatigue, instead looking energetic. His eyes were filled with confidence and an incomparable resolution.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am willing.\u201d Kou Rui was the first to support Zhou Weiqing once more. As for Shangguan Bing'er, it was not necessary for her to even speak. She would always follow him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Yan Zhexi. I, too, am willing.\u201d The second person to speak up was that cold youth.\u201d With such an offer, with free Skill Storing and free Consolidated Equipment, he would be a fool not to agree!</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh\u2026\u201d Without even taking a look and just hearing that voice, Zhou Weiqing naturally knew it was Ma Qun who had just opened his mouth as well.</p><br/><p>The freshmen students stood up one by one. No matter what their nature or character was, with Zhou Weiqing holding that freshly created Consolidating Equipment Scroll in front of them, and asking them if they would stand tall together with him for four years, their blood was ignited.</p><br/><p>No one would be willing to be enslaved without reason. Especially so now they had a strong support in front of them. A Consolidating Equipment Master, who knew how many strong and powerful people would be willing to follow him. Furthermore, he was their classmate, a classmate who was willing to help them without recompense. At this time, who would make another choice?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing! We\u2019re willing!\u201d Voices sounded out one after the other. In this very instant, all the freshmen students\u2019 hearts were bound together, and the central nucleus of that binding was Zhou Weiqing, scroll in hand, as he stood tall.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

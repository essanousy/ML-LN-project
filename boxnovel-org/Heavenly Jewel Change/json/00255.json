I also voiced my suspicions and asked him why he did it. He said he didn\u2019t know why\u2026 but, that he had no regrets.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">She took another deep breath, glistening teardrops appearing in her eyes, \u201cElders, your worries were correct. Zhou Weiqing came with a goal in mind, the Spatial Teleportation Gem. However, has he done anything to harm our palace? No, on the contrary, he saved all of us. And us? \u00a0We\u2019ve suspected him and even acted against him. \u00a0I can\u2019t accept something like this\u2026 and I have given him the gem already.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The four Grand Elders became aghast after hearing the last sentence. \u00a0Dong Fang exclaimed: \u201cWhat!? You actually gave him the gem? Hanyue, how could you do this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Dongfang Hanyue answered calmly, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I? At the very least, I am still the Palace Master right now. According to the rules, the Master can use all of the palace\u2019s resources. Think about it, how old is Zhou Weiqing right now? Moreover, he isn\u2019t like me, who relied on inheriting legacy to gain power. \u00a0He only relied only on his own cultivation talents. Yes, he is from the Boundless Mainland and will return there for sure. But, isn\u2019t befriending someone who is almost guaranteed to reach the Heavenly God realm in the future far better than keeping a gem that can\u2019t be used many more times? I hope to befriend him. \u00a0Who knows what kind of support he will give us in the future? \u00a0By choosing to capture Bing\u2019er, you\u2019ve ruined all of my sacrifices and plans. Maybe I can\u2019t convince everyone here but you can\u2019t convince me either. I can accept no longer being the Xuantian Palace Master, but if you wish to act against Zhou Weiqing I absolutely refuse to take part.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her eyes became quite fierce as she added, \u201cOne last thing. \u00a0Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t get the gem for free. He gave a part of his Saint Energy to me, and I can feel that with its magical power, the bottleneck from father\u2019s inheritance shouldn\u2019t be a problem any longer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With that, she stood up and left decisively in order to find and talk to Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The faces of the five people remaining turned ugly after seeing her leave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Dong Fang sighed and said, \u201cA girl\u2019s heart eventually leaves home! This foolish girl, does she not know that they can\u2019t become a couple?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Water Elder smiled wryly, \u201cIt looks like we need to carefully consider our Palace Master\u2019s words. We can\u2019t lose our relationship to her over a stranger. \u00a0Besides, it\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t make sense! Maybe she is the one with the better vision.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A musing glimmer appeared in Dong Fang\u2019s eyes. \u00a0\u201cIf Hanyue could actually reach the Heavenly God level, that would be far more valuable than a Spatial Teleportation Gem.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing naturally didn\u2019t know what has transpired back at the palace as he used his fastest speed to return.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He could already see the distant mountain range where the Xuantian Palace was located, and his fury burned brighter and brighter. \u00a0He had repeatedly tried to communicate with Bing\u2019er to no avail. That seed of anxiety had transformed into a fiery rage. \u00a0For the sake of his love, he wouldn\u2019t mind doing battle against the entire world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Alas, regardless of his current mood, he just couldn\u2019t find it in him to be angry at Dongfang Hanyue. What was he going to do now?\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Sneak into the citadel? No, that\u2019s virtually impossible</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If the people from the palace have captured Bing\u2019er, they would be expecting me to come rescue her secretly. With their numerical advantage as well as the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, a secret rescue would impossible. If that\u2019s the case, then I might as well act a bit more brashly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Having thought to this point, Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t slow down and continued flying towards the citadel. The Saint Energy seemed to be boiling inside his body. With his current cultivation, flying long distances in the winged Dragon-Tiger form wasn\u2019t a great burden on his body. The Saint Energy remained \u2018full\u2019 from start to finish.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The palace eventually appeared in sight. \u00a0Right at this moment, shouts rang out, and over a hundred shadows rushed into the skies in order to stop Zhou Weiqing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He wasn\u2019t too clear on just how powerful Xuantian Palace was in combat, but as the only Great Saint Land in the Xuantian Continent, how could they not be strong?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He stopped in the sky and looked down carefully. Those who were flying up weren\u2019t just Heavenly Jewel Masters, they were riding Heavenly Beasts as well. The beasts\u2019 cultivation varied but they were all powerful flying creatures. The weakest was around the Zun Stage while the masters were all at the five-Jeweled level and above. Clearly, they had immediately rushed up after detecting Weiqing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">He calmly floated there and let this aerial \u2018army\u2019 surround him without moving. \u00a0He shouted towards the citadel\u2019s direction, \u201cDongfang Hanyue, come out here or don\u2019t blame me showing no mercy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Energy came from his dantian to empower this shout. With his Saint Energy and nine-Jeweled cultivation, the flying beasts in front of him all were all blasted backwards, one after another. The overbearing and furious voice resounded across the valley and echoed back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">These Heavenly Jewel Masters still haven\u2019t attacked him\u2026 because some of them recognized him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When joining the palace, Zhou Weiqing had revealed his brilliance during his welcoming banquet and shocked all of the upper echelon members. These commanders of the aerial army had participated in that party as well, so they naturally recognized him as Consecrated Zhou.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The palace has been keeping Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s matter a strict secret, and so these people didn\u2019t know what has happened between Zhou Weiqing and their sect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cConsecrated Zhou, what are you saying? Please calm down first.\u201d A nine-Jeweled master controlled his mount and flew before Weiqing. He respectfully saluted him and smiled. At the same time, his eyes were full of amazement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The large wings behind the Dragon-Tiger Transformation spread out wide, and his skin was covered with violet draconic runes which pulsated with dominating power. More importantly, Zhou Weiqing no longer hid his number of Jewels. \u00a0He had nine Jewels in each hand! This was an immense difference compared to the five Jewels he had back at the party. How could these experts not feel shocked?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing smiled calmly. \u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t your problem. As long as you don\u2019t attack me, I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The commander felt a bit speechless. He couldn\u2019t help but think to himself, \u201cWe have more than one hundred men on top of supporting Heavenly Beasts. Even if this guy is as strong as nine oxen, how could he hurt us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Despite thinking this, he didn\u2019t dare to issue a command to attack. Who knew why this was happening? What if it was only a misunderstanding? If they hurt Consecrated Zhou, how were they going to report this to their superiors? Moreover, he was a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master as well. Everyone wanted to be on his good side for further benefits!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing\u2019s loud shout was effective. Within the citadel, at least ten more Heavenly Jewel Masters all came out. Among this cluster were Dong Fang and the four Grand Elders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression sank after seeing this. His rage surged even more.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Dongfang Hanyue still won\u2019t come out to see me? Is she feeling guilty?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cConsecrated Zhou, please come down and talk.\u201d The masked Dong Fang beckoned at Weiqing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Surrounded by the aerial army, Zhou Weiqing slowly descended. \u00a0He stared at the other side of the abyss, staring towards Dong Fang and the others. \u00a0He said coldly, \u201cAre you the fake or real palace master? The only person I want to talk to is the person who is in charge?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Dong Fang frowned slightly. \u201cConsecrated Zhou, calm down first. We are very appreciative of your help during the crucial moments of the disaster. What are you trying to do right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing smiled brightly. \u201cAppreciative? Really? Then where is my wife? Your way of repaying me is to capture her? I\u2019ll have you know, if even a strand of hair from Bing\u2019er is missing, I will bathe the Xuantian Citadel with blood and and erase your palace from this continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This response enraged Dong Fang. She had originally discussed this over with the four Grand Elders previously and decided to repair their relations with Zhou Weiqing for her daughter\u2019s sake. Moreover, they thought that Hanyue\u2019s perspective made sense as well. The Spatial Teleportation Gem was already in his possession. If he actually chose to abandon Shangguan Bing\u2019er, not only would they lose him, but they would also have made an enemy out of this young man, who would definitely become a peerless powerhouse in the future. Thus, it was simpler to return Bing\u2019er to him in order to improve their relationship and let him leave quickly. He had to return to the Boundless Mainland anyhow, so even if he caused trouble it wouldn\u2019t be here at the Xuantian Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Alas, no one expected for Weiqing to act so arrogant at this moment. Dong Fang might not be the real Palace Master, but given her position, she was only below one person and above all others at the Palace. Given her prestige, she has never been yelled at so aggressively by anyone. Not even Hanyue would dare to do so!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even though her heart had turned cold after realizing that Zhou Weiqing was aware of them having placed Shangguan Bing\u2019er under house arrest, she was also enraged by his behavior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even if you are have incredible potential, it is still just potential. You brat, you aren\u2019t even a Heavenly King yet. \u00a0You dare to boast about bathing the Xuantian Palace in blood?</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Of course, Zhou Weiqing could not possibly keep bothering his Senior Uncle to help him, especially since he was immersed in Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.</p><br/><p>As such, the only right solution was for Zhou Weiqing to reach the Heavenly King stage as quickly as possible. This time, Zhou Weiqing did not know how long he would be gone, so he needed to ensure everything would continue running well without his presence. After all their plans and contingencies, and with Ming Yu and the officers to run things, there should not be any problems. His only worry was if any enemy powerhouse entered the fray.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Zhou Weiqing left a letter for his Master, inviting him to stay in the Heavenly Bow Empire during the period he was gone. If a large amount of enemy powerhouses came, he would ask the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor to take care of them. As for the fact that Long Shiya previously mentioned he would not help him revive his Empire, our dear Little Fatty totally ignored it. In his letter, he gave the excuse of asking his Master to help him \u2018protect a few people\u2019, not to help him revive his homeland. Of course\u2026 the \u2018few people\u2019 was\u2026 quite a large number in the end.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Third day since the meeting.</p><br/><p>Dawn.</p><br/><p>Six warhorses quietly left the Crescent City, heading directly into the Fei Li Empire and eastwards.</p><br/><p>The six warhorses were extremely conspicuous and attention drawing. The one at the head was extremely huge, covered with thick and sturdy looking scales, with a single horn on its head. It was the single-horned Ghost Demon Horse. Naturally, the youth seated comfortably atop it was Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Their group of six was definitely attention grabbing. Zhou Weiqing, Tian\u2019er and Yun Li were all mounted on Ghost Demon Horses, while Ma Qun, Crow and Xixi were mounted on their Unicorn Heavenly Beasts. These were all top horse-type Heavenly Beasts in the entire mainland. Furthermore, the figures and stature of the six of them were indeed massive. Besides Tian\u2019er and Yun Li who looked relatively normal, even Zhou Weiqing was nearly two metres tall. Of course, even he paled in comparison to Ma Qun and the two Gold Crow Tribe girls.</p><br/><p>Of course, though they drew much attention and gazes on their journey, perhaps due to their massive sizes, they did not actually meet any trouble. Within ten days, they had reached a city in the east of the Fei Li Empire, called the Green Jade City. As soon as they passed through the Green Jade City and headed east for another few hundred li, they would enter the ZhongTian Empire.</p><br/><p>There was still more than a month before the Heavenly Jewel Tournament began, and they had a lot of time to spare. The reason they moved out so early was because Tian\u2019er wanted to care for Tian\u2019er, and wanted to take their time in traveling. Although they currently could not see any outward signs that she was actually pregnant, but he did not want to take any chances! As such, in their current travels, they did not rush or would also find a comfortable place to rest every night.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, I have heard that there is a special delicacy called the Green Jade Cake Roll in this Green Jade City. Shall we go try it since we are here?\u201d Yun Li said to him.</p><br/><p>Ever since he met Zhou Weiqing, he had never been able to experience a relaxed day again. If he wasn\u2019t researching Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, he was creating them. This time, he was finally getting a chance to rest and relieve stress, and he was happy that Zhou Weiqing had chosen this slow method of traveling. Watching the scenery as they moved, enjoying the good food as they traveled, it was quite a good feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, that sounds good! You\u2019ve been to this Green Jade City before?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked Yun Li.</p><br/><p>Yun Li shook his head, saying: \u201cNo I haven\u2019t, I only just heard of it. You all wait a while, I\u2019ll go inquire about it and see which place sells the best Green Jade Cake Rolls.\u201d As he said that, he passed his reins to Ma Qun before heading off to inquire for more information.</p><br/><p>Before long, Yun Li returned. \u201cNot far up ahead, there is an inn called the Green Jade Palace. We can find the Green Jade Cake Rolls there. Come on, we can also stay there for the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Yun Li, the group soon reached the Green Jade Palace he had mentioned.</p><br/><p>Although its name was impressive, it was just a three story inn. Of course, for a small border city like the Green Jade City, it was considered one of the luxurious inns.</p><br/><p>Handing their horses over to the stablekeep and paying for the best fodder for it, the group entered the inn.</p><br/><p>They checked in three rooms. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er would share a room. Alas for Ma Qun, he had been abandoned by Crow as soon as they left the Crescent City, so he had to share a room with Yun Li while Crow and Xixi shared a room.</p><br/><p>The six of them first went to their rooms for a short rest and clean up, arranging to meet up in the dining hall of the inn later to try the Green Jade Cake Roll.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, hug!\u201d Zhou Weiqing grinned as he enveloped Tian\u2019er in his arms.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er giggled, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t! I want to take a bath and change before we go eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was not like human females who might feel shy so easily, instead feeling happy that Zhou Weiqing was so infatuated with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we take the bath together? Heh heh.\u201d Zhou Weiqing grinned.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er blushed slightly, rolling her eyes at him, saying: \u201cWell, now you aren\u2019t afraid of harming your child?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said: \u201cI\u2019ll be gentle\u2026 who knows our precious will be in your stomach saying\u2026 Wahh, papa is here to visit me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pfft* Tian\u2019er laughed at that, \u2018savagely\u2019 punching him a few times. At last, she fell into the shameless perverted fellow\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was best at shamelessly following up on things when given the slightest opportunity, and he immediately began \u2018helping\u2019 Tian\u2019er remove her clothes. Taking a bath together, such a great temptation, a certain person\u2019s \u2018beastly blood\u2019 began to boil instantly.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, a knocking sound rang on their door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it!\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked exasperatedly. Anyone who was interrupted at such a time would definitely not be in a good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, the situation is like that. There are a few new guests outside who have taken a fancy to your mounts, and they are asking if you would sell the mounts to you.\u201d The waiting staff\u2019s voice traveled from outside.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cWe\u2019re not selling. Stop disturbing our rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a slight pause, the staff\u2019s tentative voice said: \u201cThose guests said that they are willing to pay a high price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt his anger rising, and he let go of Tian\u2019er, stalking to the door and opening it. The staff immediately nodded at him respectfully and with humility. He could naturally tell that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s group were not ordinary at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo tell those people, ten million gold coins per mount. If they can afford it, then we will sell, otherwise tell them to stop bothering me.\u201d After saying that, Zhou Weiqing slammed the door shut.</p><br/><p>The staff stood there, stunned momentarily. Only after a few moments did he finally react. Ten million gold coins? This gentleman truly knows how to demand an exorbitant price.</p><br/><p>Returning to the room, Zhou Weiqing ignored Tian\u2019er\u2019s sudden startled cry as he picked her up and walked into the bathroom. In the misty hot bath, the sounds of spring pervaded the room.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, the Heavenly Bow Battle Team met in the dining hall. They sat together at a table in the corner, having ordered the Green Jade Cake Roll and a large amount of other food.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all looking at me?\u201d Tian\u2019er said shyly as she glanced at the others.</p><br/><p>Xixi blinked and said: \u201cSis Tian\u2019er, you are so beautiful. Why is your face so red, you look so cute and beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er was left speechless, and below the table, she stomped savagely on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s foot. She was originally extremely beautiful, and after just being \u2018enriched\u2019, she naturally looked especially attractive. It was no wonder that the others couldn\u2019t help but look at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr, come let\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat.\u201d Zhou Weiqing could only endure the pain in his foot and quickly change the topic.</p><br/><p>As he glanced at Yun Li unwittingly, he realised that fellow was mouthing a line: Wanton actions in the day!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s skin had always been thick, and he did not care what others thought about him. Looking at the beauty beside him again, his heart was filled with satisfaction. He was growing more and more infatuated with Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Soon, their food was served. They were no refined nobles or the like, and they immediately began eating voraciously.</p><br/><p>Just as they were in the midst of their meal, another group of guests arrived, seating near them. As it was in the afternoon, and not during any meal time, the dining hall was relatively empty.</p><br/><p>This new group numbered five, four males and one lady. Their clothes were showy, especially the lady\u2019s. She looked about twenty years of age, dressed in a purple skirt with a gold peacock embroidered upon it. Her features were above average, with a curvaceous figure, though she paled in that department compared to Tian\u2019er. Still, she could still be considered a beauty.</p><br/><p>The lady sat down first, and the other four men were clearly very attentive of her, helping her pull out her chair, ordering dishes etc. Their voices were especially loud in the dining hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder which bastard is the one who owns those horses, actually quoting us ten million gold coins, how sick.\u201d The lady was clearly in a bad mood as she said angrily. She did not lower her voice, and Zhou Weiqing and his group could clearly hear her.</p><br/><p>When she finished speaking, she happened to glance over at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s table. When she saw the strange mix of people there, especially the absolute beauty Tian\u2019er, her gaze froze momentarily.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan\u2019er, don\u2019t be angry. Isn\u2019t it just some Ghost Demon Horses and Unicorn Beasts, I\u2019ll get one for you later, whichever you prefer. Although those are indeed expensive, ten thousand gold should be enough to get one.\u201d One of the youths seated beside the lady called Xuan\u2019er said fawningly.</p><br/><p>Xuan\u2019er gave a cold humph. \u201cDo I need you to pay ten thousand gold for me? Do I lack money? Hmph, some people just don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them. Don\u2019t let me know who it is, otherwise I\u2019ll teach them a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, Zhou Weiqing knew she was speaking of them, but he ignored them, continuing to eat with large mouthfuls. Guzzling down his food, he did not look civilized at all. However, with Ma Qun, Crow and Xixi there, he was not too obvious. The table which was filled with food was swept clean in a short time.</p><br/><p>Ma Qun called out loudly: \u201cBoss, another round, same order as just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>If one had to point out the biggest flaw of the Berserker and Gold Crow Tribe, it was definitely their insane appetite.</p><br/><p>Their appetite was no joke at all! For the two tribes to actually run into survival issues, their sheer capacity for food was one of the reasons. It was no surprise really, with their massive stature and strength, it was normal to have a larger appetite.</p><br/><p>One of the other youths at Xuan\u2019er\u2019s table, with thin lips and clearly with an acrid tongue, said in a low tone: \u201cWhat a bunch of gluttons1. Xuan\u2019er, do you think those horses belong to them?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

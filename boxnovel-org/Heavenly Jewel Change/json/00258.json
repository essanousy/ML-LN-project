(2)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Hui Yao looked at her.\u00a0\u201cGo ahead and sense the changes in our bodies.\u00a0After being bathed by that astral light, our bodies seemed to have benefited from it.\u00a0Not just that.\u00a0Although that night sky only appeared for a brief period, I can sense that in reality a total of forty-nine days have gone past.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were Heavenly Gods whose senses regarding the natural world were far more acute than the senses of ordinary humans, especially with regards to time.\u00a0They often went into long periods of slumber, after all.\u00a0If they couldn\u2019t sense the passing of time, they wouldn\u2019t even know how old they were!</p><br/><p>When Duo Si heard Hui Yao say this, Duo Si immediately unleashed its own senses.\u00a0A moment later, Duo Si\u2019s jaw dropped own in surprise.\u00a0Hui Yao was right.\u00a0Forty-nine days had gone past during that brief moment of astral light accelerating and disappearing.</p><br/><p>What was going on?\u00a0They had no idea, but when they looked at Zhou Weiqing they no longer saw that simple, ordinary human youth.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing continued to float there, all the light having been completely withdrawn into his body.\u00a0The only difference was that on his chest, a ball of light seemed to emanate ephemeral flickers.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t any particularly powerful energy ripples.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing looked like a very ordinary person, but the wings on his back had already vanished.\u00a0He himself, however, continued to hover in the air.</p><br/><p>His skin had turned as pale as ivory, and it glowed with sleek, glossy light.\u00a0His features were never particularly handsome, but right now they felt almost holy and sacred.\u00a0He seemed to have become translucent.\u00a0As he hung there in the sky, he was like part of the air itself rather than a human.\u00a0If you closed your eyes, you wouldn\u2019t be able to notice he was there.\u00a0Not even the two Heavenly God dragons could sense his presence.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao let out a long breath, draconic eyes spread wide.\u00a0If in the past he could easily sense how Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation was changing, even for a powerhouse like him Zhou Weiqing had now turned into an enigma.\u00a0There was no point in using any type of senses to try and scan him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing, still floating in the air, slowly opened his eyes.\u00a0When they saw his eyes, the two great dragons and Shangguan Bing\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but stare.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t glowing with dazzling light as they had imagined.\u00a0In fact, it was just the opposite.\u00a0His eyes looked a bit glossier than the eyes of others, but there was nothing particularly powerful to them.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Jewel Masters were different from ordinary people.\u00a0The more powerful a Heavenly Jewel Master was, the more powerful their auras and their gazes would become.\u00a0And yet\u2026 Zhou Weiqing seemed to have completely lost these Heavenly Jewel Master abilities.\u00a0It was as though he was just an ordinary person\u2026 but could that really be true?\u00a0How could an ordinary person float in the skies?</p><br/><p>As he opened his eyes, the dazzling ball of light in his chest grew dim.\u00a0It was as though everything had gone back to normal.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing bowed down in midair, offering his respects to Hui Yao and Duo Si.\u00a0\u201cThank you, seniors, for assisting me.\u00a0Weiqing shall never forget your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice didn\u2019t seem to have changed, but it now had a certain charisma that felt extremely comfortable.\u00a0Hui Yao smiled and shook his head.\u00a0\u201cNo, this was your destiny.\u00a0You did good deeds and so reaped a good reward.\u00a0In addition, we benefited from your ascendance as well.\u00a0I really want to know what cultivation level you have reached.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled.\u00a0\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure either.\u00a0I think I\u2019m a Heavenly King, but I don\u2019t know what stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two great dragons were both rather shocked to hear him say he was a Heavenly King.\u00a0As they saw it, no Heavenly King could\u2019ve caused those phenomena which Zhou Weiqing had just displayed.\u00a0Clearly, his Attributes had mutated somehow.</p><br/><p>However, Shangguan Bing\u2019er had a different interpretation when she heard this.\u00a0A twenty-three year old Heavenly King!\u00a0This was a speed of cultivation which was unequalled in past, present, and future in the Boundless Mainland\u2026 and the man who did it was her man.</p><br/><p>A deep sense of pride pervaded Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s heart.\u00a0The feeling was quite marvelous.\u00a0She spread her wings, discarding her embarrassment and throwing herself into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing\u2019er in his arms.\u00a0He was every bit as excited as Shangguan Bing\u2019er, but he didn\u2019t reveal it.\u00a0It seemed as though his mentality had transformed and grown just as much as his cultivation had.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er nestled herself into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms.\u00a0She felt that he smelled extremely good right now.\u00a0She couldn\u2019t explain what he smelled like, but she felt that it was refreshing and comfortable.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said to Hui Yao and Duo Si, \u201cSeniors, I wasted quite some time.\u00a0Let\u2019s continue on our journey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao nodded.\u00a0He exchanged a glance with his wife, then the two transformed into balls of fire that flew into the Spatial Teleportation Gem around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Once they actually entered the Spatial Teleportation Gem, they discovered to their astonishment that the gem, which had teetering at the brink of collapse, had actually been fully repaired.\u00a0Now only was it now extremely sturdy, its Spatial power had increased countless times over.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing hadn\u2019t repaired it.\u00a0Clearly, when Zhou Weiqing had made his breakthrough, the Spatial Teleportation Gem had been repaired by the energies he had emitted.\u00a0One could simply imagine how marvelous Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Attributes were!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing himself had the deepest understanding as to what had happened.\u00a0To put it simply, only Heavenly King-level Saint Energy was \u2018real\u2019 Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>The Sea Emperor Shuttle once more descended from the skies into the sea, with Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er hopping into it.\u00a0They closed the lid, then Zhou Weiqing hugged Shangguan Bing\u2019er and said with a smile, \u201cBing\u2019er, I think we\u2019ll arrive home a bit earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said, \u201cLittle Fatty, do you know how much time you used up after Devouring that thing and then breaking through?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, puzzled.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said, \u201cNearly two months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u00a0That long?\u201d\u00a0Zhou Weiqing had thought that it had been half a month at most.\u00a0He didn\u2019t imagine that two months would have gone by in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s hurry up and go back.\u00a0The two seniors are waiting for us to return so they can rescue their children.\u201d\u00a0When he thought of coming back, Zhou Weiqing felt as though he needed to go home immediately.\u00a0He had temporarily discarded everything else to come here, but in truth he needed to do many, many things.\u00a0His most important task was to rescue his parents and the others, then re-establish the Heavenly Bow Empire!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t use his hand to press the crystal into the indent.\u00a0Instead, he just willed it and the Sea Emperor Shuttle instantly shot forward like a bolt of lightning, diving into the sea and disappearing.</p><br/><p>This sudden acceleration badly startled Shangguan Bing\u2019er, even though her body didn\u2019t suffer from it. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body glowed with a layer of faint golden light which captured her as well, sending the Sea Emperor Shuttle hurtling through the seas like an arrow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

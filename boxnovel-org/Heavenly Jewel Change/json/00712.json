The Ringless Ground Purging Set. What a Strength Legacy this is.\u201d Meng Xing\u2019s eyes lit up at once. Instead of appearing angry at being defeated, the look in her beautiful eyes somehow became more composed and calm.</p><br/><p>A calm opponent was the most terrifying one. Looking at the changes in her, Zhou Weiqing turned vigilant as he probed, \u201cHow about we just end it right here? Let\u2019s just call it a tie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s answer was absolutely unadulterated, \u201cIN- YOUR- DREAMS!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she finished talking, she charged toward him again. Furthermore, this time, her speed became much faster. In just a flash, she had already appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing. Before he could lift his Dual God Strength Hammers, her delicate body had already vanished again.</p><br/><p>Blink!</p><br/><p>As a God Tier Master, the Spatial attribute was undeniably important. Of course, it was natural for her to possess this Blink technique as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not dare to hesitate. The moment he lost sight of Meng Xing, he quickly unleashed his Blink as well. Two silver lights alternately flashed almost in tandem. The moment he disappeared, her claws literally scratched at the position he was just standing in a moment ago. She clawed a hole at the residual image left behind by Blink.</p><br/><p>When he reappeared, both of the hammers were already lifted and spun a full circle around him.</p><br/><p>His movements were precise. Because, just as he reappeared, Meng Xing had also appeared at his side. Faced with the absolute coercing force from the Dual God Strength Hammer, she could not do much. Like a solid bridge, her entire body arched backward as if she had no bone in her. At the same time, her right leg bounced up and slipped through the gap between the two hammers, heading straight for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cBam!\u201d In the thunderous rubble, he staggered three steps backward. Meng Xing was unlucky as she was pushed back too.</p><br/><p>She had just fully experienced the powerful effect of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formations. Just as she lifted her leg up to kick him, there were a total of 10 Lightning Pearls that were gathered in front of his chest. For this reason, her foot could only land on and hit those Lightning Pearls. Both her and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s bodies were separated in a violent explosion. The originally victorious kick turned out to be a wild goose chase in the end.</p><br/><p>Anomalous. Only this word could be used to describe The Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation\u2019s sudden burst. Not to mention the fact that its Heavenly Energy consumption was extremely low.</p><br/><p>The Flying Lightning God Technique was the handiest technique Zhou Weiqing had. The instance both of them were blown back, he quickly launched his second immediate technique on the spot. It was the Flying Lightning God Technique again. The only difference was instead of Lightning Pearl, he changed it to lightning bolt instead. At once, more than 100 lightning bolts were simultaneously launched. All of them were fired toward to Meng Xing.</p><br/><p>The speed of the lightning bolts was just too fast! Not to mention the fact that it was an immediate technique. For this reason, there was absolutely no way for her to dodge at all. In desperation, a black light shield emerged above Meng Xing\u2019s head. A series of \u2018thud\u2019 sound could be heard as the lightning dispersed as it hit the black light shield. However, at the same time, she could not launch an attack toward Zhou Weiqing at all.</p><br/><p>Currently, she had completely put aside her contempt toward Zhou Weiqing. This bizarrely talented guy was even more difficult to defeat than what she had imagined. Particularly his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation\u2019s immediate technique. It always thwarted her attacks at the most dangerous moment. If only she could unleash her full strength, then this would be just a small matter to her as she could very easily suppress him. However, because she could only use a Sixth Jewel cultivation base, she dared not use many techniques that consumed too much energy. On top of that, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation immediate technique was impossibly fast. She was not sure if her own techniques would be interrupted by him.</p><br/><p>The surprise that Zhou Weiqing felt was no less than Meng Xing\u2019s. As a God Tier Master, why was her combat experience so rich? He had thought that he had plenty of combat experience but somehow she did not seem to be inferior to him. In just a short moment, she had already seen through his speed\u2019s weakness when he was using his pure energy. With the help of her flexibility boost, she had almost pierced through his defense. Not only that, from the beginning of the battle till now, they were just probing each other with their attacks and none of them had completely unleashed their powers yet.</p><br/><p>Even though they had suppressed their cultivation base to the Sixth Jewel, this battle was actually quite fair. Even supposing Zhou Weiqing had not reached the Heavenly King-tier yet, he still had his Saint Energy with him. If he had unleashed his Saint Energy, even Meng Xing who was in the Heavenly King-tier might not stand a chance of winning against him. In the end, it looked like suppressing their cultivation base was actually a lot fairer and safer because they would have to use their true capability instead during the battle.</p><br/><p>After the lightning was dispelled by the black light shield, the two of them did not continue to launch any attack as if they had a tacit understanding. They watched each other vigilantly. Their Chi energies were completely locked to each other, ready to attack at any given moment.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing narrowed his eyes. The Dual God Strength Hammers lowered slightly by his sides. In truth, he was rejoicing secretly in his heart. Fortunately, Meng Xing\u2019s Duo Physical Jewels were not a combination of flexibility and speed. Or otherwise, he would definitely fall into an even more disadvantageous situation. It was extremely difficult to defeat her when he had to hide his true strength at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoosh \u2013\u201d Meng Xing let out a long breath. Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel that the surrounding had suddenly become much chillier than usual. Dots of blue lights emitted from her body at once. Almost instantly, they spread out to cover a range of several hundred square meters.</p><br/><p>A Qi field? No! It was the effect of her Heavenly Dao Energy affecting the Atmospheric Energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s foul play!\u201d Zhou Weiqing glared at her.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing looked at him coldly, \u201cWhat foul play? I only said that I\u2019ll use a Sixth Jewel cultivation base! I didn\u2019t say that I won\u2019t use techniques that I\u2019m skilled at!\u201d</p><br/><p>He stared at her speechlessly. \u201cThis is the effect of your Heavenly Dao Energy affecting the Atmospheric Energy. Isn\u2019t it foul play using the Atmospheric Energy to help you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing snorted, \u201cWhen I say it\u2019s Six Jewels, that means it\u2019s Six Jewels. This is just what I deduced. Who asked you to have such a weak cultivation base anyway? If you\u2019re so great, you can utilize the Atmospheric Energy here, too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although this was another space, the Atmospheric Energy here was full of vitality. The way Meng Xing was using her Heavenly Dao Energy to mobilize the Atmospheric Energy granted her an infinite amount of backup. Although her attack would still be at the Sixth Jewel-tier, it was still infinite Six Jewels for f*ck sake! Despite the fact that Zhou Weiqing had the support of his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, he could not use it to mobilize the Atmospheric Energy as she did. What was more important was, even though he had the Heavenly Dao Energy\u2019s induction too, he did not dare to use it at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a bully!\u201d Zhou Weiqing lamented in anger.</p><br/><p>A glimpse of laughter flashed across Meng Xing\u2019s eyes, \u201cYes! And I\u2019m bullying you!\u201d As she finished saying that, her body moved. Once again, she was charging toward him. This time was different than before. The chilliness in the air increased in an instance. Numerous ice shards rushed along with her as they swarmed toward Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body as well. The chilly air instantly pierced into his body in a frenzied manner.</p><br/><p>Although these ice shards were not enough to affect him for the time being, as the time went by, the cold would surely make his movements rigid. His Heavenly Energy consumption would increase greatly as well.</p><br/><p>At first, Meng Xing did not have the intention to do this but Zou Weiqing\u2019s powerful energy along with his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was just too troublesome. She was determined to win this duel. Not just to let off her steam but to also teach Zhou Weiqing a small lesson. Even she could not understand why she brought him here today. Was it really just because she felt unsatisfied about the incident that day? She refused to admit that her heart that had never moved in the past thirty years was now somewhat feeling a little restless.</p><br/><p>The Dual God Strength Hammers waved sideways. A twinkle could be seen in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes. As the hammers were thrown to the side, his body was suddenly enveloped by a rich layer of green light. He quickly took a step back and picked up the hammers again before smashing them down vigorously from the top.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was taken aback by his sudden increase in speed. This was the Wind-type Accelerate Technique. His Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation could even imitate this assisting technique?</p><br/><p>With a loud roar, the entire space seemed like it violently shook for a moment. A tyrannical and peerless turbulent force smashed most of the Atmospheric Energy that Meng Xing had gathered in the air into pieces. The strong shock ripple even stopped her from her pursuit.</p><br/><p>What a strong power. She narrowed her eyes instantly. Right now, she could clearly feel how strong Zhou Weiqing\u2019s power really was. He did not boast after all. Even if she had unleashed her Heavenly King-tier cultivation base, her pure power seemed to be inferior to his power when he smashed the hammers down on the ground.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, a strong sense of danger crept into Meng Xing\u2019s heart. She was shocked to see a purplish red light rising up from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back as it turned into a strange creature suspended in midair.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Skill Projection?</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was completely stunned. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was only at the Sixth Jewel. Not to mention he had only just gotten to the Sixth Jewel not too long ago. From her what she understood, he would never be able to cast such a powerful technique like the Heavenly Skill Projection with a cultivation base like his! Not only that, she could sense great danger from the aura emitting out of the technique.</p><br/><p>There was almost no hesitation as a Heavenly Skill Projection rose up from behind Meng Xing too. Before Zhou Weiqing could see clearly, it was already charging toward the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic Dragon Lady on top of his head in high speed.</p><br/><p>The clash of two Heavenly Skill Images.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he was already prepared for the clash. That time, after he had suffered the loss from the battle with the Lion Prince Gu Yingbing, he had made many painstaking efforts. In the absence of absolute certainty, he would never display his Heavenly Skill Projection.</p><br/><p>Another cold snort could be heard before a purplish red light rose up again. This time, the light clashed with Meng Xing\u2019s Heavenly Skill Image. In an instant, two lights flashed across the sky and vanished at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does he really have two Heavenly Skill Images?\u2019 Meng Xing thought to herself. She was in a state of surprise yet her response was unparalleled. She did not attempt another clash as she could suddenly sense that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s particular technique was about to be completed soon.</p><br/><p>A layer of dark light suddenly burst out of her body. The crisis left her with no choice other than to use some of her special skills.</p><br/><p>The chill that was originally in the air was suddenly filled with a kind of dark aura. A thick layer of dark fog was being released from Meng Xing\u2019s entire body. Something was moving vaguely in the dark fog but Zhou Weiqing could not see clearly at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The process of the rise was slow and gradual just like a drifting flight. Under the drive of the potent Saint Energy Galaxia in Zhou Weiqing, it rose upwards in a gradual manner.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the other whirlpools in Zhou Weiqing were also undergoing changes. The once rapid circulation slowed down. Not only did the absorption process of the devoured energies slow down, the speed the whirlpool spun at also slowed down at the same time.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing felt as if his body was filled with extremely viscous mercury, causing it to spin slowly.</p><br/><p>He would not be able to stop even if he wanted to. His body was just like a statue, his insides all solid. The speed of his blood circulation had been slowed to the extremes. If Shangguan Bing\u2019er was to place her finger under his nose, she would discover that Zhou Weiqing was not breathing at all.</p><br/><p>This did not mean that Zhou Weiqing was dead even though he was not breathing. He was in an extremely mysterious and dangerous situation that was full of opportunities.</p><br/><p>Because the Immortal Deity Technique could not be cultivated until one was on the 36th tier, Zhou Weiqing had no suitable means of cultivating after he had entered the realms of Nine Jewels. Thus, he had only been concentrating on raising his Saint Energy. He had never heard anything from anyone about the situation he was in so he could not comprehend it either. He could only proceed according to his imagination.</p><br/><p>However, the fact was he could not stop even if he no longer wanted to continue.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Saint Nucleus Core! Is the Saint Nucleus Core about to be solidified?\u2019 Zhou Weiqing thought.</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing could not move, his heart was burning hot. Six days ago, his Saint Energy had broken through to the 39th tier. Followed by the five days of devouring, his Saint Energy had completely transformed into the Saint Energy Galaxia for an entire day. However, there were no other traces of a breakthrough after that. He had no idea how his Saint Nucleus Core would solidify either.</p><br/><p>One had to know that what he devoured was the Heavenly Energy of an entire Heavenly God-tier Heavenly Beast! Even under such conditions, he failed to break through to the rank of Heavenly King Tier. One could imagine how much stronger the Saint Energy\u2019s attribute was compared to the other attributes.</p><br/><p>In Hui Yao\u2019s opinion, Zhou Weiqing would at least be elevated to the initial stage of the Heavenly God-tier through the devouring process. However, at this point, it would be considered good if he even managed to reach the rank of Heavenly King-tier. Currently, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was only left with its Origin Force.</p><br/><p>Although the energy of Origin Force was the purest, the amount was limited. There was no guarantee it could assist Zhou Weiqing in breaking through to the realm of the Heavenly King Tier.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing was still rising. Although the speed was slow, it was still painful to his already bloated body.</p><br/><p>He could feel a sharp pain in his bones and meridians due to the bloating as the 37th-tier whirlpool rose to his chest.</p><br/><p>Once it reached Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest level, it stopped rising and began to spin again. Nevertheless, it showed no signs that it was going to continue the absorption process.</p><br/><p>However, just as it began to whirl, Zhou Weiqing felt a unique sensation within him.</p><br/><p>No words could describe this sensation. When the whirlpool in his chest began to rotate, a realization dawned on Zhou Weiqing. His surroundings had completely transformed. It seemed like he was no longer on the Boundless Mainland.</p><br/><p>The world within his consciousness darkened. However, amidst the darkness, there were countless lights.</p><br/><p>The lights were gradually approaching him in his consciousness. They were gathering, spinning and circling around his body.</p><br/><p>The number of the light spots were increasing as it slowly formed tendrils of lights that were similar to ribbons. On the other hand, the illumination around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s consciousness were getting stronger as if it formed into a nebula.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had never studied astronomy so he did not know what kind of state it was in. He could only faintly feel that there was another source of energy, beyond the force of the heavens and earth, one from a faraway land that was merging with his body apart from the Atmospheric Energy.</p><br/><p>\u2018What power is this? It seems like the energy of the stars that came from the sky,;\u2019 he wondered.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s emotions were very calm. He was not aware of what was happening. However, after entering the mysterious realm, all the previous pain he had with him had vanished. In his heart, there was only an epiphany.</p><br/><p>As the tendrils of light ribbons increased, the rate at which the nebula spun also began to speed up. As for the nebula\u2019s size, it did not increase but began to shrink instead. During the contraction process, the light bands had been gathering a massive amount starlight toward its direction, effectively increasing the nebula\u2019s illumination</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not know that when he had his epiphany, it shocked the people outside terribly.</p><br/><p>Almost instantly, the last of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s Origin Force had been completely devoured by Zhou Weiqing. Then, silver rays shone from within Zhou Weiqing. Once the silver light appeared, the grey silhouette descended from the sky and entered Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>However, even after the shadow entered his body, it did nothing to change the silver light radiating from Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>While the Dreadfiend Sea Naga might have lost his Heavenly Energy, his body was still of Heavenly God-tier. However, when Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was emitting blinding starlight, his physical body seemed to have transformed into energy along the streams of vibrations and ended up being devoured by Zhou Weiqing. In the next moment, the body of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga that was being gripped by the two huge dragons vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the light ribbons surrounding Zhou Weiqing suddenly strengthened. Amidst the violent spinning, a terrifying presence exploded. Hui Yao immediately took Shangguan Bing\u2019er onto his body and retreated with his wife at top speed as they distanced themselves from Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>It was not that Hui Yao could not withstand the presence. However, if he were to defend himself forcefully, he was worried that he would harm Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u2018What power is this?\u2019 Hui Yao wondered. At this very moment, Hui Yao and Duo Si felt complete astonishment in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Initially, the two dragons took control of the heavens and the earth to prevent it from interfering in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation. However, the skies changed at that very moment.</p><br/><p>Day turned into night, and the sky became crystal clear. There was not a single cloud to be seen.</p><br/><p>One could see clearly that every star in the sky was radiating bright colors. On the other hand, the floating Zhou Weiqing was just like another star floating in the ocean. The bright colors he radiated was interacting with the faraway starlight. There were even faint starlight that gathered around his body.</p><br/><p>There was no precedent to such a mysterious phenomenon even in the history of the Dragon Clan. The pressure had disappeared. However, Zhou Weiqing had also vanished from the two dragons\u2019 senses. It was as if he had completely fused with the stars in the sky and he was no longer an ordinary human being.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er put her hand over her mouth. Since she was human, her senses were naturally different from the two dragons. At that moment, she suddenly felt that her Little Fatty no longer existed in the same rank as her. It was not a change in his power, but rather a change in his charisma. It was really hard for her to describe.</p><br/><p>The starlight on Zhou Weiqing strengthened, and the speed they circled him at increased. All of a sudden, when the speed of the light ribbons reached their limits, all the lights converged on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Then, a brightness so terrifying that one could not even look at it directly with naked eyes, exploded from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. The light spread to thousands of miles away. At that moment, all the stars in the sky lost their shine.</p><br/><p>It was only the light that was bright, and it did not have a terrifying presence. Even so, the two dragons almost fell into the sea from the intimidating pressure that they felt.</p><br/><p>\u2018What, what on earth is this power!\u2019 The two dragons wondered. They were stunned and had no idea what Zhou Weiqing had done.</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhou Weiqing himself did not know as well. What he felt was that all the starlight had merged with his body abruptly, and it felt as if his body had exploded.</p><br/><p>HIs consciousness continuously extended outward, as if there was no limit to it. He could sense the endless illumination of the starlight.</p><br/><p>Feeling like there was not even the slightest trace of energy around him, Zhou Weiqing realized that it was as if everything was under his command amidst the stars. The feeling was really unique. It was also at this moment that Zhou Weiqing was shocked when he discovered all the Saint Energy within him had vanished. The Saint Energy Galaxia from before had all disappeared.</p><br/><p>He felt his senses returning to his body upon his discovery.</p><br/><p>The galaxy-shaped Saint Energy was gone but there was something else in his body. It was a perfectly rounded jewel that was light gold in color.</p><br/><p>The jewel was floating in mid-air right at his chest. The most baffling thing was there were fine tendrils of lights that surrounded the jewel.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing only exerted his will slightly and he could feel that everything within his body had undergone drastic changes. His body seemed to no longer exist and everything in the heavens and earth also seemed to fall under his command, including the stars in the vast sky.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is\u2026 Is this the Saint Nucleus Core?\u2019 he pondered. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing felt confused.</p><br/><p>Outside of his body, the night sky finally turned into day. In a short amount of time, everything was restored to its original state. However, the dragon Hui Yao suddenly yelped.</p><br/><p>For a Heavenly God-tier huge dragon who was also the descendant of the Dragon Emperor to cry out in surprise, one could only imagine how shocking the incident was.</p><br/><p>\u201cForty-nine days! It\u2019s been forty-nine days?\u201d Stupefied, Hui Yao mumbled incoherently.</p><br/><p>Duo Si was puzzled as she inquired, \u201cWhat forty-nine days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao looked at her, \u201cTry and feel the changes in our body. After we were bathed in the bright colors of the galaxy, my body seems to have gained some benefits. Furthermore, I can feel that even though it seems like the night sky occurred for just a short moment, 49 days have passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because they were Heavenly God-tier powerhouses, it was only natural that their perception of the world was much more sensitive than those of humans. Especially when it came to the changes in time. After all, they would often fall into a long and deep slumber. If they did not have the ability to detect the changes in time, would it not mean that they would not be able to tell their age as well?</p><br/><p>When Hui Yao\u2019s words finally sunk in, Duo Si immediately activated her senses. In the next moment, her mouth was opened in shock. Hui Yao was right, 49 days had passed within the short amount of time it took for the stars to speed up and contract.</p><br/><p>\u2018What exactly is this situation?\u2019 They wondered in unison. They had no idea. However, the Zhou Weiqing in their eyes was no longer the ordinary human youngster.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing still remained hovering in the air. All of the shine on his body had almost disappeared. The only difference was that there seemed to be a ray of light radiating faintly from his chest.</p><br/><p>Without the strong energy waves, Zhou Weiqing appeared like a normal person. Although the pair of wings on his back had vanished, his entire being still remained afloat.</p><br/><p>His whitened skin was illuminated with faint colors while his features which were not considered handsome before this, gave a holy impression. His whole being became crystal clear as he hovered there. It was as if he was a component of the air and was no longer a human being. If they were to close their eyes and not look at him, even the two Heavenly God-tier dragons would not be able to detect his presence.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao inhaled deeply and widened his eyes. He used to be able to easily sense the changes in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base. However, Zhou Weiqing was now a mystery even to a powerhouse like him. There was no longer any use in trying to detect Zhou Weiqing by using one\u2019s senses.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes slowly as he hovered in mid-air. When they saw his eyes, the two dragons and Shangguan Bing\u2019er were stunned once again.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes did not radiate a blinding light as one might imagine. On the contrary, aside from the fact that his eyes were slightly moister than others, he did not seem like he was powerful in any way.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Jewel Masters were different from ordinary humans. When the the cultivation base of a Heavenly Jewel Master increased in strength, there would be distinctions in his presence and eyes. However, Zhou Weiqing seemed like he had lost all the abilities of a Heavenly Jewel Master. He looked like an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he really just an ordinary person? How is it possible for normal human beings to float in mid-air?\u201d the dragons thought.</p><br/><p>As he opened his eyes, the blinding light on his chest also dimmed. It seemed like everything had returned to its normal state.</p><br/><p>Still floating in mid-air, Zhou Weiqing bent his waist and gave a deep bow toward the husband and wife, Hui Yao and Duo Si, \u201cThank you for your help, senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice did not seem to have change. However, there was an additional unique charm to it that gave people a sense of comfort.</p><br/><p>While smiling, Hui Yao shook his head and said, \u201cThis is an opportunity you brought onto yourself. Do good deeds, and you shall receive good returns. Furthermore, we gained some benefits from your cultivation as well. I want to know what level your cultivation base is currently at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cTo be honest, I myself don\u2019t really understand as well. I think I\u2019ve joined the ranks of the Heavenly King Tiers. However, I\u2019m not really sure what rank I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the words Heavenly King Tier, the two dragons were dumbfounded. In their eyes, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s recent transformation could not even be released by Heavenly King-tier powerhouses. It clearly showed that his attributes had undergone some changes as well.</p><br/><p>However, Shangguan Bing\u2019er interpreted the entire situation differently. \u2018A twenty-three-year-old Heavenly King-tier master!\u2019 She thought. Nobody else had such a great cultivation speed on the Boundless Mainland except for this person, and he was her man.</p><br/><p>Feelings of pride rose from within Shangguan Bing\u2019er. It was a mysterious feeling. She was not shy as she batted her eyes and leaped into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing returned Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s hug. His feelings of joy at the moment was not any lesser than Shangguan Bing\u2019er but he did not show much of it. It seemed like there were mysterious changes to his mindset as well, along with his cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er remained in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s embrace. She felt that there was an extremely fragrant smell emanating from him. She could not tell what it was exactly, and only thought that it was very refreshing and comforting.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said to Hui Yao and his wife, \u201cSeniors, I\u2019ve delayed much of our time. Let\u2019s get back on the road now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao nodded in agreement. After exchanging a glance with his wife, each of them transformed into a red light and merged with Zhou Weiqing and the Spatial Transportation Stone.</p><br/><p>It did not matter even if they merged with the stone. Upon entering the Spatial Transportation Stone, they were in shock as they discovered the Spatial Transportation Stone that was almost destroyed had been completely repaired. Not only was it extremely solid, the concentration of Spatial Energy had also increased by a few folds.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not repair it himself. It was obvious that the stone had repaired itself under the influence of the energy radiating from him during his breakthrough. One could imagine just how mystical the attribute possessed by Zhou Weiqing was.</p><br/><p>The one with the most thoughts was still Zhou Weiqing himself. In short, the Saint Energy after merging with the Heavenly King-tier was the true Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>The Neptune Shuttle descended from the sky and plunged into the ocean, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er leaped into it again.</p><br/><p>Shutting the door, Zhou Weiqing hugged Shangguan Bing\u2019er and smiled, \u201cBing\u2019er, I predict that we\u2019ll arrive home earlier this time around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said, \u201cLittle Fatty, do you know how much time you\u2019ve used to devour and breakthrough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Puzzled, Zhou Weiqing shook his head.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er informed him, \u201cClose to two months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so long?\u201d From what Zhou Weiqing could recall, it should only be half a month at most. Little did he know, two months had passed in a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, we must hurry.The two seniors are still waiting to rescue their children.\u201d Upon thinking about his return, Zhou Weiqing became eager to head home. This time, he temporarily put everything aside to head towards the Boundless Mainland. However, the fact was there were a lot of matters that required his attention. The most important would be to rescue his parents and godparents, and to reestablish the Heavenly Bow Empire!</p><br/><p>With that thought in his mind, Zhou Weiqing exerted his will. He did not even need to use his hand to press on the crystal ball and the Neptune Shuttle had already dived deep into the waters with lightning speed as it vanished.</p><br/><p>The sudden outburst shocked Shangguan Bing\u2019er even though she did not experience any discomfort. A faint layer of golden light shone from Zhou Weiqing and enveloped himself while the Neptune Shuttle moved as if it was an arrow.</p><br/><p>The surrounding water seemed like an illusion. Everything appeared unreal. Except for the vast expanse of blue water, she did not see anything else. \u2018What speed is it at for it to move so fast?\u2019 She pondered. It should be even quicker than her flying speed with the Wings of the Wind God.</p><br/><p>In fact, she did not even need to sense anything from the surrounding, Zhou Weiqing alone was sufficient for that job.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s consciousness gradually widened. At this moment, he was not using his own energy.</p><br/><p>When he channeled his willpower into the Saint Nucleus Core at his chest, a mysterious force of attraction flowed from Zhou Weiqing. His entire being looked just like a real star and the ocean\u2019s powers were instantly under his command. The vast ocean immediately propelled them forward. How could their speed not be fast?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, marine creatures avoided them in fear after sensing the aura of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core from thousands of miles away. That was why they did not encounter anything along their journey.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core allowed Zhou Weiqing to enter the Heavenly King-tier. He did not know the extent of his powers after he solidified the Saint Nucleus Core either. However, he managed to confirm a few of his theories through experiments.</p><br/><p>First of all, after obtaining the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core, he was able to use Heavenly Dao Energy that commanded Atmospheric Energy. However, what made him different from the other Heavenly King-tier powerhouses was the fact that it did not matter if it was a Heavenly Jewel Master, a Heavenly King, a Heavenly Emperor or even a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse, they all had areas they excelled in which was their own attribute.</p><br/><p>Put simply, if it was at an opening of a volcano, a Heavenly Jewel Master with Fire Attribute Jewels would be able to command the greatest amount of Atmospheric Energy for his use. As for the ocean, it would naturally be advantageous to a Heavenly Jewel Master with a Water Attribute Jewel. This was also the reason the Dreadfiend Sea Naga had been so powerful in the sea.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing was different, he did not wield the powers of the Water Attribute. Even when his Saint Nucleus Core\u2019s aura had dispersed, he would still be more agile than Heavenly King-tier powerhouses who possessed the Water Attribute and were capable of maneuvering the energy in the sea.</p><br/><p>This confirmed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s theory that his Saint Nucleus Core was capable of transforming any attribute into his own under any circumstances. In other words, he could maneuver Atmospheric Energy however he liked. Regardless of the location of the battle, they would all be to his advantage.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the more important point was that the amount of Atmospheric Energy Zhou Weiqing was capable of commanding was tenfold to a hundred folds of the what a regular, Lower Level Heavenly King-tier Heavenly Jewel Master would be capable of. As for the exact amount, Zhou Weiqing himself was not clear as well. What was more terrifying was the fact that he could now directly convert Atmospheric Energy into Saint Energy and release his skills. He no longer needed to convert them in his body.</p><br/><p>This was Saint Energy, the true Saint Energy. After wielding the Saint Nucleus Core, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s powers had escalated to an unimaginable level. Never mind a Heavenly King Tier, there was no telling if a normal Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse would be on the same standing as him.</p><br/><p>The Neptune Shuttle was activated at its highest speed. It was so fast to the extent that Zhou Weiqing felt that if it was to continuously increase its speed, the ocean artifacts made by the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s Nucleus Core would face the possibility of destruction. Thus, he could only keep it at a certain speed and it had yet to utilize the maximum amount of energy it could put out.</p><br/><p>What made Shangguan Bing\u2019er speechless was that while he was maneuvering the Neptune Shuttle at such high speed, Zhou Weiqing could still divert his attention to bully her. Furthermore, his body had become even more absurd than before. He would bully Shangguan Bing\u2019er all the time until she had to beg for mercy. Judging from his facial expressions, he was still unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Shangguan Bing\u2019er felt that having a lot of sisters was not that bad after all.</p><br/><p>Before this, if anyone were to tell Zhou Weiqing that it would only take half a month to get from one mainland to another, he would never believe it. However, the truth was laid before him.</p><br/><p>The Neptune Shuttle lowered its speed. Zhou Weiqing was traveling in a rush these few days as he was familiarizing himself with the Saint Nucleus Core. The more familiar he became, the more surprises he found. With the Saint Nucleus Core, he was not sure that he could join the ranks of the mighty figures of the Boundless Mainland.</p><br/><p>Once they reached the seashore, Zhou Weiqing took the Neptune Shuttle to the surface. Opening up the hatch, he inhaled a breath of moist air on the beach and it felt simply refreshing to the both of them.</p><br/><p>Since they took a far shorter amount of time to travel, the feeling of loneliness was not so unbearable. Zhou Weiqing carried Shangguan Bing\u2019er and jumped onto the seashore. With a gesture of his right arm, the Neptune Shuttle flew toward him as if it was being hit by a wave, and bright lights channeled into the Sumeru Ring. The feeling of having the world under one\u2019s control was indeed wonderful.</p><br/><p>Two rays of red light shot out from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest before the concentrated fire element then contracted. Once that happened, the dragon Hui Yao and his wife appeared before Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought we\u2019d be back so quickly. We won\u2019t be able to do such a thing even if we were to fly with all our might. Weiqing, your Saint Attribute is magical indeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with Hui Yao\u2019s abilities, he could not help but voice out such a compliment. It was clear that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s position in his heart had elevated again.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, and said, \u201cMy two seniors, what plans do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao said, \u201cThank you so much for freeing us from the Luster Spatial Realm, but we can\u2019t remain by your side anymore. We can faintly sense the locations of our children, and we must find them. Please, take this.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, Hui Yao opened his mouth, and a red beam of light shot at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao explained, \u201cThis scale consists of my bloodline aura, use it like this \u2026\u201d his voice was lowered and he proceeded to say a few words to Zhou Weiqing with the Sound Transmission Spell.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, \u201cThank you, senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao shook its head and said, \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who should be thanking you. Alright, our journey with you ends here. I believe we\u2019ll meet again in the future.\u201d After his sentence, his large body leaped into the sky and flew up high.</p><br/><p>After nodding at Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er, Duo Si also flew away to pursue her husband.</p><br/><p>Seeing the two dragons vanish from sight, Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cBing\u2019er, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er asked, \u201cWhere should we go first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing answered, \u201cIt\u2019ll be the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. I\u2019ll relay the good news of the dragon\u2019s summoning to my father-in-law, and then we\u2019ll head back to Heavenly Bow City. It\u2019s also time to rescue father and the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finally breaking through the Heavenly King Tier and condensing the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core, Zhou Weiqing was now very confident that he could rescue his father. To rescue his father earlier would solve one of his concerns as well.</p><br/><p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing guided Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s hands, leaped into the air, and flew away.</p><br/><p>With his current cultivation base, he no longer required a horse when he was in a hurry. Flying did not consume much of his energy; not even Shangguan Bing\u2019er Wings of the Wind God were needed.</p><br/><p>A gust of cold wind swept their bodies up into the air and they headed toward the East.</p><br/><p>To prevent themselves from being noticed, Zhou Weiqing summoned a cloud on purpose to hide their silhouettes. Stepping from one cloud to another, it felt like they were gods for a few minutes.</p><br/><p>Although she had sensed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength while they were traveling in the Neptune Shuttle, she was still stunned during the flight.</p><br/><p>The wind seemed to have become their pawn, carrying their weight, propelling them forward and even engulfing them within a layer of air, providing the both of them with a means of protection. The air in the wind seemed to have become part of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Even if he was looking down from the cloud above, he could clearly see the scenes beneath him passing by.</p><br/><p>The flight from the east to the Zhongtian Empire took only a few days. From afar, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace in the Heavenly Jewel Island had come into view.</p><br/><p>With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base, it was perfectly possible for him to fly toward it directly along with Shangguan Bing\u2019er. Even for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, there were few who could stop him now. The most that would happen was a commotion and even that would not be a huge problem for him.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing did not act in such a manner. He had no idea, but since he had broken through, his entire mentality seemed to have changed as well. Put simply, his entire being seemed to have become calmer than ever. The elevation of his soul had propelled him into another level. Compared to how he was in the past, not only he refrain from showing off, he also greatly reduced his antics.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er had been the one who sensed the change the most. If the Zhou Weiqing before was a sharp blade whose existence was always made known, the current Zhou Weiqing now was a precious sword, concealed in its sheath.</p><br/><p>The two landed outside the Zhongtian Empire and headed up the mountains through the Heavenly Pillars directly. Shangguan Bing\u2019er face was more useful than any kind of authorization tally. Who did not know the three Shangguan sisters? In addition, Zhou Weiqing himself had an authorization tally all along. With that, the two traveled without obstacles, and arrived at the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p><br/><p>Upon landing on the island, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er were thrown into a shock as there were two people waiting for them. They were the parents of the Shangguan Triplets, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace Second Master Shangguan Tianyue, and his wife Tang Xian.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed that Shangguan Tianyue had yet to conquer his wife\u2019s heart as Tang Xian was standing four to five meters away from him.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing Shangguan Bing\u2019er, Tang Xian rushed forward like a gust of wind and pulled her daughter into an embrace.</p><br/><p>When a parent had multiple children, no matter how much they would aim to be fair, they would never be perfectly fair deep in their hearts. Among the Shangguan Triplets, there was no doubt that she loved Bing\u2019er the most as they had depended on one another for a long time. Otherwise, she would not be waiting here with Shangguan Tianyue once they received wind of their arrival.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother\u2026\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er voice turned into a sob in an instant, leaping into her mother\u2019s embrace like a baby pigeon.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue looked at them while he stood at the side, warmth, and relief flowing from his eyes before his gaze fell on Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that it only took a year for you to complete\u2026 Eh\u2026\u201d Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes shone and his stare at Zhou Weiqing immediately changed.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing inquired with curiosity, \u201cDear father-in-law, how could you tell that we\u2019ve accomplished our mission?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue did not answer his question, but his eyes were clearly showing shock, \u201cBoy, your cultivation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Zhou Weiqing at that very moment gave him the feeling that he was neither an ordinary human being nor a Heavenly Jewel Master. He could not feel the slightest trace of Heavenly Energy waves on him. \u201cBut how could he be a normal person?\u201d Shangguan Tianyue pondered. If that was the case, he would not appear so relaxed after climbing up the high and steep peaks of the Heavenly Jewel Island. If he had not lost his cultivation\u2026 Well, the answer would be the complete opposite.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue was a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, even he could not see through Zhou Weiqing\u2019s level right then, how would he not be shocked?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, and said, \u201cI broke through it with luck. Dear father-in-law, you have to acknowledge me as your son-in-law now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that. Zhou Weiqing stepped forward but his body had already been floating away from the surface of the earth. However, after a moment, he dropped onto the ground. Flying was one of the trademark abilities of Heavenly King Tier.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes shone brightly, but he decided to stop asking. \u201cLet\u2019s go, come with me and meet big brother. Xian\u2019er, you bring Bing\u2019er to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pitied the travel difficulties of his daughter, as for his son-in-law, he thought, \u201cHmph, this bastard had tricked my three daughters. Does he know what exhaustion is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s eyes were slightly red as she raised her head to look at Zhou Weiqing, Tang Xian said snappishly, \u201cYou silly girl, will he go missing? Hmph, Zhou Weiqing you bastard, don\u2019t you leave. I haven\u2019t dealt with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since Zhou Weiqing had met his mother-in-law, upon hearing that she had matters to settle with him, he could not help but feel stunned for a moment.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian\u2019s action surprised everyone, she let go of Bing\u2019er\u2019s hands and appeared before Zhou Weiqing in a flash. Smacking with her right arm, her whole palm instantly turned a fiery red and pressed itself onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian was never a good-tempered woman, otherwise she would not have left home for so many years due to Shangguan Tianyue being a womanizer. Before this, the Shangguan Triplets had hidden the truth from her. No one dared to tell her that all three of them had fallen for Zhou Weiqing so she did not show up. However, things like this could not be concealed for long. Furthermore, the Shangguan Triplets were getting closer and closer with Zhou Weiqing and brother Shangguan Tianyang had been planning the dates to hold the wedding for them. Under such circumstances, how could they not tell Tang Xian?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

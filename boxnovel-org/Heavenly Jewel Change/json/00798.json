The both of them collided hard, creating a deafening bang. The black light flickered and shrunk slightly; its dashing speed then stopped all of a sudden. However, Shangguan Xue\u2019er let out a deep groan as she was flung away. A black layer of light lingered around her, consuming her Saint Energy. Despite having the Heavenly King-tier cultivation base, she could not remain flying in the air and fell straight onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Shangguan Bing\u2019er arrived with the second batch. Although they saw the odd condition that their sister was in, they decided to attack by force without thinking much, with the sole intention of protecting Zhou Weiqing. The both of them were flung away with a loud bang. The black light only halted slightly and did not seem to be weakened at all. It was still aiming towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er arrived with the third batch. Suited up in the God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set, she floated in the air quietly. A golden light was shot from the God Spirit Staff in her hand. Besides Zhou Weiqing, her Saint Energy was the purest one among all. This time, she managed to defend the black light and counterweighted a small portion of it. However, the black light was too powerful as a whole. If it did not lock its target onto Zhou Weiqing, the Shangguan triplets might be facing a fatal threat for their attempt to defend against the black light.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er felt a destructive and raging energy dashing into her body, just when the black light paused. She had encountered enemies from the Blood Red Hell, who possessed the Destruction Attribute, when she was with Zhou Weiqing in the past. However, it was different this time as the Destruction Energy was much purer than the one from the people from the Blood Red Hell back then. The Destruction Energy was so terrifying that it seemed to be the source of the black hole. Besides, the intensity of its energy had far surpassed Tian\u2019er\u2019s Heavenly King-tier abilities. As the terrifying Destruction Energy entered Tian\u2019er\u2019s body, it was fighting with her Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>One revolved around creation while the other revolved around destruction. As both were similarly pure, they were competing with one another through the quantity they possessed. Without a doubt, Tian\u2019er was completely on the losing end. However, her Saint Energy was much purer than that of the Shangguan triplets after all, so she managed to defend the black light\u2019s attack by force. However, it was going backwards from where Zhou Weiqing was.</p><br/><p>Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue and Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya were the furthest away from where the black light was heading to. Everything happened too fast, it took less than a second from the time Shangguan Xue\u2019er took action until the point when Tian\u2019er defended against the black light. They reacted at almost the same time.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya teleported above Tian\u2019er at an instant. Just as he was about to defend Tian\u2019er against the black light, a miracle occured out of nowhere. A layer of pure white light exploded from Tian\u2019er\u2019s body. Long Shiya had never seen such a pure light before. As soon as the white light appeared, the black light that flung the Shangguan triplets away who in fact, were all on the Heavenly King-tier, and pushed Tian\u2019er\u2019s defense away, so much so that was shrinking like melting snow. It resembled an octopus\u2019 tentacles that shrunk upon contact with fire. Moreover, the destructive energy that dashed into Tian\u2019er\u2019s body had disappeared that very moment, leaving no trail behind.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er was shocked to find out that the Saint Energy in her body experienced a major growth; from the Low-Level Heavenly King-tier to the Upper-Level Heavenly King-tier. It felt like the Destruction Energy was absorbed by her and turned into Saint Energy. Such an upgrade was comparable with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Star Reflection.</p><br/><p>Who was Long Shiya exactly? Although he was shocked to see the events unfold before him, he made a decision immediately. He extended his right hand in the air, compressing it at an instant, while a rich six-colored light transformed into a stream of light and was sent down from above. It then lit the source of the black light directly. At the same time, he appeared mid-air outside the city wall.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue did not join the attack. Istead, he waited quietly next to Zhou Weiqing, as nobody could tell if any of the enemies would attack from elsewhere. Meanwhile, a couple of his Heavenly King-tier underlings were sent to get the Shangguan triplets. Wu Yunyue was definitely sure that he, as the representative of the Heavenly Demon Sect had curried favor with the person who could bring great future to the Peerless Sect, as he saw Zhou Weiqing consolidating in the air. Zhou Weiqing was the core of the Peerless Sect as well as his son-in-law. No matter what, he would protect this amazing bastard with all that he had.</p><br/><p>What Tian\u2019er and the rest did not see was that the seven men in black outside the city walls experienced a tremendous tremor in their bodies, just when the pure white light emitting from Tian\u2019er\u2019s body was purifying the pure Destruction Energy even more. A faint black mist was released from their bodies during the intense tremor. No.1 and No.2 was petrified when it happened, as they could not understand how their Destruction Attribute was being absorbed. They decided right away, without any hesitation, to back off immediately. No.1 had said earlier that they only had one chance to attack. The seven of them were only at the Heavenly King-tier cultivation base; they were not even at a Heavenly Emperor-tier. All they depended on was the pure Destruction Attribute, their unified attacks, as well as their assassination techniques.</p><br/><p>With Zhou Weiqing was consolidating in the air, it gave them the best opportunity to attack. However, they did not expect so many of them to possess the Saint Energy and would take action immediately, especially Tian\u2019er\u2019s defensive technique, which made their attack fail completely. The seven men in black backed off at the same time, like seven black lightnings. As they retreated, they coincidentally avoided Long Shiya\u2019s six-colored light but unfortunately, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God had arrived above them.</p><br/><p>No.1 and No.2 then looked at each other and decided to escape without hesitation. The five remaining men in black who followed suit, flew up into the sky at the same time and flew toward Long Shiya while the first two escaped as fast as they could. They might be able to escape if they encountered the old Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, however, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had now evolved into the Six Ultimate Heavenly God. This was the biggest mistake that these men in black had made on their speculation.</p><br/><p>The anger in Long Shiya was burning! How could he not be raging, when he saw that they were attacking his best and most beloved disciple? He had always been protecting his family so he would definitely not let them go. Long Shiya\u2019s eyes were cold as he looked at the five men in black who were dashing towards him. He waved both his hands and his body then distorted in the air, before five Long Shiyas detached from his body. The five Long Shiyas who looked exactly like the real Long Shiya then made a beeline toward the five men in black.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Long Shiya\u2019s head and the soles of his feet merged with the Dual Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation. The rich six-colored light swept across the heavens and earth, creating a contrast with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Star Divine Territory. The Six Ultimate Heavenly God disappeared within the distorted six-colored light. As he appeared again, he blocked No.1 and No.2 while the other five men in black who were far away from their black light transformed into fireworks and disappeared.</p><br/><p>When No.1 and No.2 were covered in the Six Ultimate Divine Territory, they felt their bodies tightening. The Water, Fire, Earth, Wind, Light and Darkness Attributes became a restrictive energy to them. They could not defend themselves at all when faced with a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse when they were only at a mere Heavenly King-tier, despite possessing pure Destruction Energy. On top of that, being a unique being aside, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya had attributes aside from Saint Energy. The men in black stood no chance in the Six Ultimate Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>Desperation was burning in No.1 and No.2\u2019s eyes. However, there was nothing that they could do now. Long Shiya had just learnt the Six Ultimate Divine Territory with Sixfold Chain as one of the major abilities. Long Shiya was the ruler in the Six Ultimate Divine Territory, and the chain with six attributes were unbreakable without any Divine Territory abilities.</p><br/><p>A terrifying wave of energy was circulating in the air as Long Shiya stood before No.1 and No.2. He then said coldly, \u201cI see that you are all from the Blood Red Hell. You actually had the guts to attack my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their movements, including their Divine Thought were completely suppressed but they could still speak. Knowing that they had nowhere to run, No.1 said coldly, \u201cNo matter what you do, you\u2019re only killing yourself. Long Shiya junior, stop pretending to be a senior in front of me. You weren\u2019t born yet when I was ruling the mainland three hundred years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm?\u2019 Long Shiya was stunned. Three hundred years ago? Although a Heavenly Jewel Master could lengthen their lifespan when their ability had reached certain point, he had never heard of anyone who could live for three hundred years. As he moved his finger by instinct, two six-colored lights swept above the two men in black\u2019s heads and tore the black cloth they were covered in, into pieces. Long Shiya gasped even though he had prepared himself when he saw what No.1 and No.2 looked like.</p><br/><p>The duo who stood before him were not human; he was looking at two skulls! There was a black flaming glow in the skulls\u2019 eyes. Long Shiya waved his right hand again and tore their black clothes open. As expected, there were two black skeletons. The most terrifying part was that they were still sentient and could fight, just as well as they spoke. That was beyond Long Shiya\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Little Fatty, Little Fatty, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeier, listen to me. You listen to me.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said urgently. As the pain in his body grew towards its penultimate, he was afraid that in moments, he would no longer be able to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er, you must listen to me. My current condition is because my body is in the midst of breaking through, it is a part of my cultivation method, and it will not have any permanent damage to me. However, if you keep holding on to me, it will cause my bloodline to be blocked. I have used the Time Reversal Skill, returning things back to what they were earlier. We only have a chance now. Later, as our bodies return to the state before the time reversal, you must leave my body instantly. Do not try to touch me at all, but do not leave ten metres of my body either. All that happened will be reversed and resume again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh? What are you talking about?\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er exclaimed as she stared him slackjawed.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shouted harshly: \u201cYou must follow my instructions, otherwise both of us will die. Remember that!\u201d As he spoke up to the point, the intense pain and violent shuddering of his body caused his voice to turn hoarse, and it grew too hard for him to continue speaking.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing had spoken too quickly, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was still in shock. However, she could sense from her body that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words were indeed true, as her body was rapidly recovering, and the vanished Life Force and Heavenly Energy was welling back into her.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, under the control of the Time Reversal, they returned to the time when Shangguan Fei\u2019er had just touched down on the ground with him, right before she pounced onto him. At this instant, time seemed to settle and freeze.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er stared around her in shock. This Time Attribute Skill gave her an unbelievable earthshaking shock. Was this Little Fatty\u2019s power?!</p><br/><p>Her beautiful long hair fell before her\u2026 the green locks had returned.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, the Time Reversal Skill ended abruptly, and time resumed its normal flow. However, everything around would happen again as it had previously. For Zhou Weiqing himself, he would not be able to change anything happening to himself. That was to say\u2026 in this time reversal, anything else could affect changes to what would happen next, but he could not.</p><br/><p>Almost subconsciously, Shangguan Fei\u2019er nearly jumped onto Zhou Weiqing once more. Seeing his body shuddering violently, she struggled with her heart and his instructions.</p><br/><p>Time Reversal\u2026 He actually had such a Skill. Wait\u2026 he has to be lying to me. If by holding him previously I affected him, how could he possibly use such a Skill?</p><br/><p>Growing up in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, her knowledge was not to be underestimated. With just a look, she could see how much Heavenly Energy such a terrifying Skill would consume.</p><br/><p>Why would he lie to me? Am I thinking too much? Is this really due to his own cultivation technique?</p><br/><p>It was only at this point that Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s mind and consciousness really woke up.</p><br/><p>At the other side, Zhou Weiqing could sense that Shangguan Fei\u2019er had listened to him and not embraced him this time, and he was overjoyed in his heart. He knew that every second that passed meant Shangguan Fei\u2019er would be safer, as everything else would follow its previous path.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, you are lying to me right? Previously, when I embraced you\u2026 I don\u2019t remember anything else after that. I\u2026 I\u2026 died? Or\u2026 was severely injured? You were afraid of me dying so you used the Time Reversal to let everything revert back right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing wanted to cry at this time\u2026 alas, he could no longer speak. If he could speak, he just wanted to say one line to Shangguan Fei\u2019er. \u201cBig sis, can you not turn so smart so suddenly?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s emotions were at least much more stable than previously, and she said: \u201cLittle Fatty, will you really be okay? But\u2026 you seem to be in such pain, and the energy reverberations in your body are just so violent. I\u2026 I\u2019m so afraid that you will leave me. I don\u2019t want to die, I want to accompany you. But\u2026 if\u2026 if you die, what am I to do? Did my previous actions save you? If not, at least give me some reaction!\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the reversal of time, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s clothes had been restored, but Zhou Weiqing was still naked as his clothes had been lost before that.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart was filled with terror. He was truly afraid that Shangguan Fei\u2019er would embrace him once again. However, how could he react to her words, he could not even move an inch, or even speak. How could he prove anything?</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Zhou Weiqing thought of a solution that was well\u2026 not exactly a solution. In his mind, he started thinking back to earlier when Shangguan Fei\u2019er was naked. He could not change anything, but such an innate physiological reaction was just still at the edge, outside that restriction. As such\u2026 Shangguan Fei\u2019er suddenly saw his \u2018reaction\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you shameless!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er saw that straight, tall, evil looking pink mushroom, and she quickly closed her eyes in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>The truth had proven itself, and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s efforts had indeed paid off. At that point, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was thinking to herself: Since he can still do that, he should be fine hmph! \u201cLittle Fatty, if you really die, I will accompany you in death, so you better stay alive.\u201d In the end, Shangguan Fei\u2019er followed his instructions and dismissed the thought of embracing him to help him. She sat down beside him, circulating her Heavenly Energy to heal her injuries.</p><br/><p>Everything else carried on as history repeated itself. When Zhou Weiqing forcefully broke through his Death Acupuncture Point, Shangguan Fei\u2019er paled in shock, finally embracing him once more. Luckily, at that point, the two bloodline powers within Zhou Weiqing had stopped fighting and the terrifying power no longer attacked her.</p><br/><p>Circulating her Heavenly Energy into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, Shangguan Fei\u2019er could sense that the danger was slowly receding for him, and she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>After successfully breaking through his Death Acupuncture Point once more, the warping of the air around them disappeared. Zhou Weiqing once again broke through the seventeenth stage, and the originally dead Shangguan Fei\u2019er lay there in his embrace.</p><br/><p>However, the other difference was that Zhou Weiqing was no longer at full energy. After the Time Reversal, his Heavenly Energy had been totally drained.</p><br/><p>Opening his eyes, when Zhou Weiqing saw Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s eyes on him, filled concern, tears streamed down uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Only after one had gone through loss would one know about cherishing, losing someone and finding her again, that agitated his emotions to the maximum. Black suddenly overcame him in a flash, as the combination of exhaustion with having his Heavenly Energy drained totally and the emotional roller coaster, he fainted.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er was given a big fright, but she was currently in contact with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, and she could immediately sense that it was just a normal unconsciousness, not anything serious.</p><br/><p>Very soon, her eyes grew dazed as she looked at him, especially the streaks of tears from his eyes, and she felt her heart beating quicker. Did he cry because of me? What happened before that Time Reversal? Did I die?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty\u2026 how am I supposed to treat you?! I actually fell for my little sister\u2019s man? I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, she stared at Zhou Weiqing while regulating her breathing, circulating her Heavenly Energy to recover herself, while also sending a strand of gentle Heavenly Energy into Zhou Weiqing to help him recover, stimulating his energy whirlwinds to resume spinning.</p><br/><p>Time passed, minute after minute. The two of them had left the Peerless Battalion Camp before the sky had darkened, as Zhou Weiqing had planned to use the time after the army had eaten dinner and their guard was more relaxed to sneak past. However, by now, after having gone through so much, it was already deep into the night.</p><br/><p>Previously, because they were facing death, although Shangguan Fei\u2019er had seen Zhou Weiqing naked, she had not thought anything about now. However, now that all danger was over and they were quiet and alone, her heart could no longer be quiet in front of his nudity.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s skin was not white, but a healthy bronze. Although it was dark at night, with Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s cultivation level and sight, how could she not be able to see clearly?</p><br/><p>His shoulders were broad, the muscled lines clear, thick and solid, giving a very reassuring, safe feeling. His arms were thick, his muscled \u2018wings\u2019 clear. All in all, it was a package of strength and grace.</p><br/><p>After looking for a while, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s beautiful face turned red, and she quickly retrieved a spare piece of clothes from her Spatial Ring to cover him up.</p><br/><p>However, she was after all the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and her character had always been bold and mischievous. After a moment of her heart racing, her curiosity acted up once again. Previously, she had been staring at his chest muscles, and had not looked downwards. A man\u2019s body\u2026 what difference was there from a woman\u2026?</p><br/><p>As such, after waging war with herself for a while, Shangguan Fei\u2019er reached out with her trembling little hand, gingerly lifting up the clothes as she peeked beneath with a thumping heart.</p><br/><p>Just one look, I\u2019ll just have a quick look. There\u2019s no harm in that right? Now that Zhou Weiqing was safe and sound, she was in a good mood, and she didn\u2019t know for sure what had actually happened to her in that \u2018alternate future\u2019. As such, her Little Demon Girl personality and curiosity reared its head, and she started peeking at a man\u2019s body. Amongst the three Shangguan sisters, only she would be so bold to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er\u2013!\u201d Zhou Weiqing suddenly yelled loudly, sitting up abruptly. As his Heavenly Energy had started recovering, he had finally roused from his unconscious stupor. When he gained consciousness, the first thing he thought of was Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s safety. He was afraid that what had happened was just a dream, and the vision of her dead body crossed his mind.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er had not expected that Zhou Weiqing would suddenly sit up, and that loud shout of his startled her so much that she froze in place. At that point, she had been in the midst of lifting up the clothes and staring at the \u2018difference between men and women\u2019. Being startled by Zhou Weiqing so suddenly, her mind blanked, and she froze in that awkward position just like that.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m dead\u2026 I\u2019m dead\u2026</p>\n</div>"}

Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m especially suave today? Taking down a couple from the Passion Valley so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fat Cat gave a humph. \u201cWhat so suave? It was just too stupid of the two of them, that gave you the chance to beat them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she said that, in truth, deep within her heart she was shocked and amazed by the combat style, and result, of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s fight. Especially since he had held back, yet in a realistic manner that showed he was stuck in the Slow Barrier, causing them to lower their guard and underestimate him. It could be said to be a perfect act, with every step planned out all the way until the final blows. Although she herself was at the seven-Jeweled cultivation level, but the couples of the Passion Valley were extremely well versed in fighting together and matching each other in combat. Even if it were her facing the pair, she was confident of beating them, but it would definitely take a huge cost. To be able to take them down so easily like Zhou Weiqing, without any loss to himself, and even resulting in him fully recovered and more\u2026 it was definitely extremely impressive\u2026 almost unbelievable!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cLet\u2019s not rush. I need to cultivate for a while, to assimilate Ao Le\u2019s Heavenly Energy.\u201d After all, the Devoured Energy was not yet his own, and as long as he did not use it in combat soon, he would have to purify and absorb it as his own.</p><br/><p>Ao Le\u2019s Heavenly Energy was not too difficult for Zhou Weiqing to absorb. With Fat Cat and Da Huang protecting him, Zhou Weiqing spent about an hour cultivating before completely absorbing all of it. Not only was he back at maximum energy, he had improved yet again. He could clearly sense that he was getting ever closer to the Fifteenth Level of Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t take long for him to break through to the next level. Of course, he would not take the risk of breaking through now in such an environment, and it could all wait until after the Heavenly Jewel Tournament ended.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The forest was just too massive, and before they knew it, three days had passed. Zhou Weiqing and Fat Cat walked along, intermittently swapping out Da Huang and Er Huang to join them, exploring the forest. Along the way, they met with some minor encounters, but nothing serious or dangerous.</p><br/><p>As long as it was a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast or lower, Zhou Weiqing could easily handle it, at most with the help of one of the Icy Soul Heavenly Bears. With the huge, tough Bear in front as a meat shield, Zhou Weiqing could stay at the back sneakily throwing out Control Skills and launching attacks. Of course, if it were just a mere Zun Stage Heavenly Beast, it would be easily destroyed by a few swipes from Da Huang or Er Huang. They had even killed off a few of the weaker Low Level Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts which attacked them.</p><br/><p>The only one time which they had been in relative danger was when they met this Mid Level Zong Stage Strong-Arm Demonic Ape, whose strength was so powerful that the young Heavenly Bears could not hold on against. In the end, Zhou Weiqing was forced to use the Demonic Change State, to meet strength with strength. With Da Huang by his side, he had barely slain the Ape.</p><br/><p>In the last three days, Fat Cat had not taken action at all. Also, they had not met any other humans during this time, be it friend or foe. At the same time, the Lustre Gem remained silent, with no one else being eliminated from the Tournament.</p><br/><p>\u201cFat Cat, do you think we\u2019ll just keep going on like this for an entire month? Such a huge forest, if we aren\u2019t particularly lucky or unlucky, depending on the situation, it will be possible to even meet another person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fat Cat refused to take her Tian\u2019er form, slumping on his shoulders as she said: \u201cI do not know, but since the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace has set the Finals of the Tournament to be here, there has to be some deeper meaning. A tenth of the time has already passed\u2026 Perhaps it will not be long before something changes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after she said that, as if it were some sort of signal, the Lustre Gem on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s finger suddenly shuddered violently, and Shangguan Longyin\u2019s voice appeared once more at last.</p><br/><p>\u201cA tenth of the finals time has passed, and the competition area will be halved. You will all be teleported to a new random area. Please prepare yourselves, the teleportation will begin in ten seconds. Countdown starting now. 10\u2026 9\u2026 8\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn??\u201d Zhou Weiqing was totally caught by surprise. Just as he was at a loss of what to do, a gold light appeared out of nowhere, descending from the skies, enveloping him totally. The Lustre Gem on his finger also lit up brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick! Put me and Da Huang back into the Spatial Ring!\u201d Fat Cat cried out urgently.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing realised what she meant, and quickly reacted, drawing the two into his Spatial Ring.</p><br/><p>\u201c4\u2026 3\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026 Teleport.\u201d</p><br/><p>Accompanying Shangguan Longyin\u2019s low, sombre voice, the gold light brightened to a blinding degree, and the surrounding objects seemed to turn blurry, unreal. The next instant, Zhou Weiqing felt as if everything around him was warped and twisted, and the gold light flashed once more, and he felt the same as he had three days ago again. This time, it lasted for about half a minute, before the surroundings seemed to clear up in front of him.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhou Weiqing was much luckier, and he appeared directly on the ground. Not far ahead of him was a large tree.</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d Fat Cat\u2019s voice rang out once more, and she actually burst free of the Spatial Ring by herself. At the same time, a gold light wrapped itself around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, filled with a divine aura.</p><br/><p>A thick, mixed black and grey smoke flashed towards them, striking perfectly on the gold shield around Zhou Weiqing, causing an earsplitting sound that reverberated through the forest, and in that instant, the gold light shuddered violently.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing quickly dove to the ground, at the same time unleashing his Time Disorder Skill, warping the air around his body. Although it only lasted a split second, it was sufficient to cause a momentary disruption in the black-grey smoke, causing it to lose its target. With a quick vault back up, Zhou Weiqing took cover behind the large tree.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh?! Weiqing, is that you?\u201d A familiar voice rang out from not far off.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was currently bathed in cold sweat. In that instant, he had felt a powerful sense of danger overcome in, as if his life would end in that very second. He was just about to enter the Demonic Change State, but on hearing the voice, and remembering the type of attack, his heart moved, and he gave up the idea of entering the Demonic Change State.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Witch, it is me! Are you trying to kill your own dear husband?\u201d Zhou Weiqing clambered up from the ground.</p><br/><p>Little Witch also appeared from behind a tree not far away. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, she heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cWhose dear husband are you? When you join the Heavenly Demon Sect then you can say that to me, I will not object at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she giggled, laughing as she jumped, instantly appearing in front of Zhou Weiqing in a flash.</p><br/><p>Being able to meet Little Witch here, Zhou Weiqing was naturally delighted. In the entire current Fei Li Battle Team, she was definitely the strongest person, even Lin TianAo was no match for her. If he could work together with her, no matter what enemy they met from here on, Zhou Weiqing was confident of taking the fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Witch, have you met any of the others? Or any opponents?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>Little Witch shook her head, saying: \u201cThis place is just too large. From the start of the finals up until this point when we were teleported here, you are the first person I have met.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, get away from her. Didn\u2019t you see that she tried to kill you just now? If not for me, you\u2019d be dead by now.\u201d Fat Cat\u2019s voice rang out. She was standing on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shoulder, her eyes filled with enmity as she glared at Little Witch angrily.</p><br/><p>Little Witch looked at her in surprise, saying: \u201cOhh? Sis Tian\u2019er, how come you aren\u2019t hiding any longer? You have finally decided to speak?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fat Cat gave a cold humph, saying: \u201cWhether or not I speak is none of your business. You better be careful. It is only because of the fact that you are currently a member of the Fei Li Battle Team that I will forgive you this once. If you dare have any untoward actions, I will definitely kill you instantly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch pursed her lips disdainfully, saying: \u201cI admit that your cultivation level is higher than mine, and your Consolidated Equipment is slightly better as well. However, if you want to kill me, I\u2019m afraid that you will still not be able to do so. In any case, who said I want to kill Weiqing; just now I sensed someone nearby, and thought it was an enemy, and I subconsciously launched an attack. Anyway, with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s tough body and resilience, even if he really took my attack head on, do you think that attack could have killed, or even injured him severely? It would at most be a light injury.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sensing the enmity between the two ladies, Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but feel an encroaching headache. \u201cI say\u2026 You two\u2026 Can we have some peace? We are after all in the same boat1, and we should work together properly. If you two keep fighting between yourselves, how can we even possibly go further in the Tournament?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch pursed her lips, an aggrieved look on her face as she said sobbingly: \u201cWeiqing, say\u2026 Do you want me or her?\u201d</p><br/><p>A gold flash, and Fat Cat warped into her human form, appearing at the other side of Zhou Weiqing, linking arms with him unceremoniously, pressing her body to his closely. At the same time, her impressive bosom, larger than Little Witch\u2019s by a cup, pressed against him, and she looked at Little Witch provocatively, saying: \u201cOf course he wants me. Two days ago, he just confessed to me. We have already been together for years, bathed together, and slept together\u2026 What about you? Have you?! You are merely an outsider.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling the fiery hot, bouncy firmness pressing against his side, Zhou Weiqing swallowed hard. However, he did not dare to do anything rash, as Tian\u2019er had a concealed hand near his subcostal nerve. If he dared do anything untoward, he did not doubt that she would not hesitate to beat him up.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s words caused him to feel dizzy. Although everything she said was true, that they had \u2018slept\u2019 together, and \u2018bathed\u2019 together\u2026 obviously Zhou Weiqing had not enjoyed the true \u2018benefits\u2019 of such an arrangement\u2026</p><br/><p>Little Witch looked at Tian\u2019er\u2019s provoking gaze and was instantly angered. In a flash, she appeared at the other side of Zhou Weiqing, grabbing on to his other arm and hugging it as she said disdainfully: \u201cWhat so good about a milk cow2? Isn\u2019t it just more milk? Hmph. If I remember correctly, someone already has a fiance, but you still want to be with Weiqing? You think that old man of yours will agree? Furthermore, that fiance of yours will come looking for Weiqing\u2019s trouble! Weiqing, let me warn you first, that father of Tian\u2019er has a really bad temper, and her fiance is so fierce and violent. If you dare to attempt being with her\u2026. Hmph hmph\u2026 you will not have good times ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked to the left, then to the right. Although he was enjoying himself being sandwiched by two top beauties, he couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cOh, do you two already know each other previously? One of you from the Heavenly Demon Sect, while the other from the Heavenly Snow Mountain, how come you two seem so familiar with each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch said: \u201cEvery ten years, the Five Great Saint Lands have a gathering. We have met before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er said proudly: \u201cThat\u2019s right, the ten year gathering of the Five Great Saint Lands. The one which the Heavenly Demon Sect always takes the honourable last position. From what I see, it won\u2019t be long before the Five Great Saint Lands becomes the Four Great Saint Lands. Little Fatty, as long as you can defeat my fiance and get my father\u2019s approval, with our Heavenly Snow Mountain behind you, even the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace will not dare to do anything to you!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

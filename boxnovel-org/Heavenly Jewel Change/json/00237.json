Master Gu Yu said that the W'Batu City would have a place holding the trials.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shangguan Bing\u2019er just smiled faintly at our dear Zhou Little Fatty\u2019s awkward and unsubtle changing of topics; she didn\u2019t call him out on it. Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but hold her hand tighter. Bing\u2019er was always so thoughtful like that.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">W'Batu City was a port city, and it was also the final destination transcribed on the maritime maps in the Sea Emperor Shuttle. They were feeling great now that they had finally reached their destination and actually stepped onto the XuanTian Continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The first thing Zhou Weiqing did was purchase a map of the continent. He did not have any XuanTian Continent currency, but Heavenly Cores were treasures everywhere. After selling a few Zun Stage Heavenly Beast Heavenly Cores, he had enough money for both himself and Shangguan Bing\u2019er to spend for quite some time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After wandering around idly in the city for a time, Zhou Weiqing discovered that it was actually pretty similar to the Boundless Mainland in many ways. Besides a few minor differences in attire, he could not see any other differences.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After looking for an inn to stay in, they simply asked around and quickly gained news about the XuanTian Trials.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">W'Batu City was after all an important port city, and how could such a large and populated city miss out on holding the trials. It seemed like they were in luck, as this year\u2019s trial for the W'Batu City would be held in a month\u2019s time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After learning about all the news, Zhou Weiqing decided to go into closed door cultivation for the duration. During this long journey on the ocean, although they had not really faced any true danger, both he and Shangguan Bing\u2019er had undergone several trials of their own, and they had their own individual understandings and comprehensions, leading to some increase in cultivation. It was a good opportunity for them to use this time to fully comprehend these understandings and merge them with their own cultivation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Naturally, Shangguan Bing\u2019er also began cultivating with Zhou Weiqing. By now, the Saint Energy in her body was full, and with Zhou Weiqing by her side to support her, she could actually directly use the Saint Energy in her training and cultivation. Once she used up a certain amount of Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing could easily infuse some into her once more. This allowed Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s cultivation speed to rise rapidly. After only three days of cultivating, she had already broken through to the seven-Jeweled stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As for Zhou Weiqing, his own cultivation speed was just as quick as before. Although the Immortal Deity Technique was complete, the improvement of his Saint Energy did not show any signs of slowing down. In the process of gathering, transforming and cleansing, his cultivation seemed to grow naturally. At this point, his Saint Energy was already barely a step from the thirty seventh stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, due to the fact he had completed the Immortal Deity Technique and did not have another cultivation technique, Zhou Weiqing still did not know how he would actually break through the thirty seventh stage. He could only continue growing, improving and gathering, hoping that in the process his Saint Energy would automatically breakthrough.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A month passed in the blink of an eye. Besides cultivating, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er would sometimes go out for walks to experience life in the new continent and to better understand it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Their closed door cultivation was indeed effective. In the past month, with the powerful aid of the Saint Energy, Shangguan Bing\u2019er had managed to increase her cultivation by another level, directly reaching the twenty ninth stage. As for Zhou Weiqing, though he was not able to break through to the thirty seventh stage, after a month of meditation and comprehension, his Saint Energy had not only increased in amount but also quality, further compressed and purified. His own understanding towards the Saint Energy and its usage had also deepened. At this point, it seemed like there was just a mere paper thin barrier between him and the thirty-seventh stage, but Zhou Weiqing still did not know how he could puncture that barrier. However, he was extremely clear that as long as he continued improving and accumulating, he would definitely succeed eventually.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the central square of W'Batu City, it was a big day for them, an annual event of sorts. The W'Batu Governor was already seated on the main platform. A stage which had been built temporarily for the trials was now surrounded by a crowd of excited onlookers, and it was only the presence of a large number of soldiers that maintained order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cGovernor, this is the name list of this year\u2019s trial participants,\u201d a servant reported, handing over a paper.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The W'Batu Governor Sang Tan received the list, but he did not even look at it. Instead, he passed it respectfully to an old man seated next to him. \u201cMaster Er Chun, for your perusal if you wish.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cEn.\u201d The elder named Er Chun was wearing a blue robe with a silver crescent symbol embroidered on the left breast.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Opening the list, Master Er Chun swept his gaze through it swiftly before saying passively: \u201cThere are more than a hundred participants who have registered for these trials\u2026 that is far too many. Pass the order down: only those who are four-Jeweled and above need stay; the rest will be disqualified.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Sang Tan started momentarily before saying in an awkward tone, \u201cMaster\u2026 are you sure that\u2019s okay? Previously, our rules stated that the participating limit was three-Jewels!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Er Chun glared at him coldly, and Sang Tan instantly felt a cold chill run down his spine. \u201cThis Elder does not wish to waste so much time here. You just need to announce that this is the decision made by our XuanTian Palace. Do you think our XuanTian Palace needs to answer to those little independent cultivators? If their power is insufficient, what\u2019s the point of joining the trials?\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Sang Tan wiped away the sweat on his forehead, as he thought to himself inwardly.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course your XuanTian Palace isn\u2019t afraid, but I\u2019m just the W\u2019Batu Governor, I\u2019m still afraid of these Heavenly Jewel Masters causing trouble!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The selection process for the XuanTian Trials was extremely harsh, and Physical Jewel Masters and Elemental Jewel Masters were rejected outright, with only Heavenly Jewel Masters allowed to participate. Originally, the criteria was for them to be below the age of thirty, and at the three-Jeweled stage or higher. This was already considered very strict prerequisites, yet they were now increasing it to the four-Jeweled stage! How could the independent cultivators not be resentful? Of course, they wouldn\u2019t dare do anything about the resentment; after all who dared to offend the XuanTian Palace?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, after the news was proclaimed, it caused a large disturbance among the participants. Several of the young three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters who were confident in their strength, Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills were all complaining. After all, they had already paid to register for the Trials. Of course, just as the W'Batu Governor Sang Tan imagined, though they were dissatisfied and complaining, none of them dared to actually cause trouble. They would not dare offend the XuanTian Palace. This Master Er Chun seated beside Sang Tan was merely the representative for the XuanTian Palace in their W\u2019Batu City, yet his arrogance was already so high that his chin was almost touching the sky!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er were currently in the crowd of participants. Hearing the dissatisfied voices around them, Zhou Weiqing spoke in voice-transference to Shangguan Bing\u2019er. \u201cIt looks like although this XuanTian Palace is extremely powerful in the XuanTian Continent, they do not own the hearts of the populace!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shangguan Bing\u2019er replied in a similar fashion. \u201cThis is natural. Since the XuanTian Palace is so powerful that they have a monopoly, their disciples and subordinates will definitely be extremely arrogant. How could they gain the hearts of the normal populace? However, since they are suppressed by power, these folk will only dare be angry but not speak out or take action. Even so\u2026 if the XuanTian Palace does not take care and continues on this path, the XuanTian Empire could possible fracture from within.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After the proclamation, the original number of participants of more than a hundred had shrunk by more than half, with only slightly more than thirty remaining.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the VIP platform, Sang Tan asked Er Chun, \u201cMaster, can we begin now?\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Er Chun did not even move his head, just grunting out an \u201cEn\u201d.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Only then did Sang Tan stand up to proclaim, \u201cOur annual XuanTian will officially begin now. Powerhouses of W'Batu City, please display your strongest prowess, and work hard to enter the finals and the chance to enter the Heavenly City! Alright, the first round shall begin, the Heavenly Energy test.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the contestant stage, workers had carried in five stone pillars, each about one metre tall. On top of each pillar was a transparent crystal. Clearly, this was for the purpose of testing the participants\u2019 Heavenly Energy.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the VIP platform, Master Er Chun slowly stood up. In a somewhat \u2018show-off\u2019 fashion, he strode into the air before landing on the stage. As soon as he appeared, the entire audience fell silent.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This arrogant elder put his hands behind his back as he instructed passively, \u201cThose participants at the four-Jeweled stage and above, take turns to undergo the Heavenly Energy examination. Begin, five at a time. We will record the strength of your Heavenly Energy.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Along with his entrance, a middle-aged man dressed in similar blue robes walked out from the side. If one examined both closely, the symbol embroidered on his chest was a silver star, and his status was clearly below that of Master Er Chun. He was holding a large book in his hands, which looked to be used for recording purposes.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Very quickly, the remaining thirty-odd participants began to ascend the stage in fives, led by assigned personnel.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er were both positioned at the back. As they watched, the first batch of five ascended the stage. As soon as the middle-aged man gave the order, the five of them immediately circulated their Heavenly Energy.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Instantly, the five crystals on the pillars lit up, giving forth a faint white light. As more Heavenly Energy poured into them, the white light slowly rose. By now, they could all see the differences. The white light would rise to a higher level for those with higher cultivation levels.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This continued for almost five more minutes, at which point the columns of white light were no longer rising. The one-starred XuanTian Palace executive member who was recording the results waved his hands, indicating that their exam was over. Soon, the second batch of five ascended the stage, undergoing the same test.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing smiled as he spoke to Shangguan Bing\u2019er in a low tone, \u201cThat is rather interesting, to go through a Heavenly Energy examination. However, if it\u2019s just a normal test on Heavenly Energy, it is still insufficient to determine how powerful a Heavenly Jewel Master is. I guess that there will be other tests after this.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded and was about to reply when all of a sudden, a disharmonious voice rang out from behind them. \u201cEven if there are other tests, it will not have anything to do with people like you. You will never be selected.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This voice was rather sharp and piercing, giving them a very uncomfortable feeling. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s brow furrowed as he turned his head, only to see a youth of over twenty years of age, drooling as he stared at Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s pert buttocks. When he saw Zhou Weiqing turn to look at him, he immediately raised his head in an extremely arrogant fashion.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A cold light flashed in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes before disappearing, but his face maintained its smile. \u201cWhat do you mean by those words? We have not even gone through the examination; how would you know our cultivation isn\u2019t sufficient to be selected?\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Do you know how many Blood Red Hell powerhouses we faced that day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he had told many people about the fight between them and the Blood Red Hell powerhouses, he did not mention the number of his opponents at all. Of course, he was unsure as well but he had a rough estimate. However, he feared his ladies would be worried to death about him so he decided to keep this to himself. During the battle, the bloodcurdling energy ripples that were released were so strong that Heavenly Jewel Masters who were below the Heavenly King Tier could not even watch in close distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat day, four Heavenly Emperors from the Blood Red Hell were present during that battle. Their lowest cultivation base was at least at the Mid-Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier and two of them were at the Maximum Level. Not only that, there were eight other Heavenly King-tier powerhouses and a few Heavenly Zong-tier masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the results, the both of you should know best since you all witnessed it yourselves. We won beautifully and naturally, the key player in that battle was none other than your husband, me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they heard about the number of Blood Red Hell powerhouses who came for the battle, the two girls were completely stunned. Even though they had their own estimates regarding the number of people who came, it never crossed their minds that it would actually be this many. They did not put much thought into it after the battle had ended. After all, Zhou Weiqing and his group managed to achieve a beautiful win in that battle. They really thought that the enemies could not be that strong.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled, \u201cI also managed to achieve my Heavenly Emperor cultivation base after that battle. I\u2019ll just be frank with the both of you, I might not lose even if I\u2019m going against a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse now. So, do you still think that I won\u2019t be able to suppress the Heavenly Demon Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er gently shook her head. The shock in her eyes was gradually replaced with a puzzled expression. It was not that long ago when Zhou Weiqing was just a small unknown person, and she was the heir of the Number One Saint Land in the world. At that time, the gap between them was very huge. However, in just a few short years, he had already possessed the power to start his own Saint Land. The leap was so huge to the point that it shook her to the core.</p><br/><p>Right now, Zhou Weiqing had reached a place where they had to lift their heads up just to look him. It was a position that was evenly matched with a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. That was right! He was now qualified to start his own Saint Land. On top of that, the power of this Saint Land was not weak as well.</p><br/><p>Even if one did not take into account the number of Jewel Masters in the Peerless Battalion that was at the Sixth Jewel cultivation base or higher and there was still a huge number of mighty powerhouses. They had the three great Heavenly Emperors; Zhou Weiqing, Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and the Demonic Emperor. Apart from that, they also had the six Heavenly Kings who were originally from the Heavenly Demon Sect. Bing\u2019er was also about to become a Heavenly King. Let\u2019s not forget about Duan Tianlang, the God Tier Heavenly King. One could say that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Peerless Sect had already met all the requirements to create a Saint Land. Not only that, he also had the support of the Heavenly Bow Empire that had just expanded its territory into an area twice its original size. He could easily command and mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops anytime he fancied. In fact, the current Zhou Weiqing was gradually becoming one of the top powerhouses in the mainland.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er was not as shy as Shangguan Xue\u2019er. She wrapped both of her arms around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck and said, \u201cLittle Fatty, I never thought that you\u2019ll become so powerful!\u201d</p><br/><p>He gently stroked her delicate face as he replied, \u201cFei\u2019er, thank you for working so hard in these few years. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll use my remaining years to make it up to all of you. From now on, I won\u2019t leave you all for no good reason. I\u2019ve also worked equally hard in these few years. The Grand Tournament of Saint Land that\u2019ll be held in six months time will be the Peerless Sect\u2019s time to shine. I\u2019ll leave it to you all to decide whether you want to remain in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace or join the Peerless Sect with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er chuckled happily as she said without any hesitation, \u201cOf course I\u2019ll join the Peerless Sect. I\u2019m the wife of the sect leader after all. Not only that, I also want to become the chief instructor of the Peerless Sect. Can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed out loud. \u201cOf course you can!\u201d As he was answering Fei\u2019er, his eyes fell on Shangguan Xue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er immediately understood what he was thinking. With a small sigh, she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve already won me over from my uncle so why are you asking me this now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing released Fei\u2019er\u2019s hand and walked forward to pull Xue\u2019er into his arms. \u201cOf course I have to ask you. I\u2019ll never force you to do anything you don\u2019t want to do. Even if you decide to inherit the Palace Master position in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, you\u2019ll still have my full support. However, if that\u2019s really the case, then in ten years time, I\u2019ll definitely lead the Peerless Sect over and take over the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace so that you\u2019ll once again return to my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Arrogance could be heard in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s last sentence. Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er could feel a supremely powerful aura emitting from his body. He did not purposely emit the restrictive aura, it was an inherent trait. They would never doubt the veracity of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s statement.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s body trembled slightly as she glared at him speechlessly. \u201cAren\u2019t you forcing me to follow your way now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cNo, no, this is totally different! What I\u2019m most concerned about now is when will the both of you consummate your marriage with me! Or, should we all do it together? Yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d The two women lifted their foot up at the same time and sent a certain someone flying with their kicks.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a strong energy ripple could be felt coming from the sky. It prompted the three of them to look up at the same time.</p><br/><p>An intense silverish white light mixed with a faint green light suddenly rushed towards Bing\u2019er in a frenzy. A halo could be vaguely seen forming slowly as it emitted from the center of her chest.</p><br/><p>The color of the halo was extremely strange. The center was silverish white but the outside was green in color. It looked a little similar to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Heavenly King-tier Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core. Instead of Saint Energy, the thing that was surrounding the Saint Nucleus Core was Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy. However, this Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy was also mixed with a silverish white halo. It was very beautiful and pleasing to the eyes. There was also a faint golden light in the center of the Saint Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>\u201cDone!\u201d Zhou Weiqing stepped out. And in the next second, he was already in mid-air, standing 100 meters away from Shangguan Bing\u2019er. He did not get too close to her in fear that the aura from his body would affect her last absorption.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er undoubtedly had also become a Heavenly King.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing silently breathed in the energy ripple that was radiating out of Bing\u2019er\u2019s body. Based on his knowledge of cultivation base and Saint Energy, he immediately knew what was going on.</p><br/><p>After another 15 minutes, Bing\u2019er who was hovering in mid-air slowly opened her eyes. A faint greenish and silverish sparkle could be seen gleaming in her beautiful eyes. At that instance, she looked as graceful as a fairy. It was as if her entire being had merged with the air, soaring freely in the sky.</p><br/><p>The wings behind her retracted at once. Her delicate body swayed gently before she threw herself into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s warm arms. She could not contain the excitement in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty! I made it! Yes! I\u2019ve succeeded! I\u2019ve also advanced now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing hugged her before he lowered his head to kiss her on the forehead. \u201cCongratulations, Bing\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them slowly descended from the sky and landed next to Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er. Embarrassed, Bing\u2019er quickly pulled herself out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, my Nucleus Core seems to be a little peculiar. I have a feeling that I can merge with the air. What\u2019s going on ?\u201d Although Shangguan Bing\u2019er had already succeeded in solidifying her Nucleus Core, she did not seem to understand much about it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cWell, technically, it shouldn\u2019t be called a Nucleus Core. Instead, it\u2019s a Saint Nucleus Core. However, it\u2019s not as pure as the real Saint Nucleus Core. You didn\u2019t have any Saint Attribute in your body when you were solidifying it. It was all thanks to the Saint Energy I infused into your body. Your own attribute is not repressed by it, that\u2019s why the Saint Nucleus Core that you have right now is a mixture of the Wind and Saint Energy that has evolved. For this reason, the Wind Attribute that you possess is no longer the conventional Wind Attribute but one that\u2019s infused with the Creation Energy. To put it simply, at the very least, your Wind attribute will not be subdued by the Destruction Attribute of the Blood Red Hell. Not only that, the range and power of your Wind Attribute are also much greater than the average Wind Attribute Heavenly King. As for how you should use it, you\u2019ll have to slowly explore on your own. Although it\u2019s not a true Saint Nucleus Core, at the very least it has some of the traits of a Saint Nucleus Core. It\u2019s something like a sub-Saint Nucleus Core. Since it has merged with your Wind Attribute, let us call it Wind Spirit Saint Nucleus Core.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er obediently nodded her head. A gentle smile could be seen on her delicate face.</p><br/><p>Both Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er who were standing by the side was green with envy.</p><br/><p>Fei\u2019er leaned towards Zhou Weiqing as she grabbed onto his right arms and gave it a good shake, \u201cI don\u2019t care! I\u2019m going to become a Heavenly King too! You must help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue\u2019er burst out laughing as she watched them. The coldness on her face immediately melted into a warm smile. \u201cSilly girl, do you even know what a Heavenly King is? You think it\u2019ll come so easily to you?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cWell, even though it won\u2019t come so easily, breaking through to the Heavenly King Tier is not that difficult since we\u2019re all a family. I have the easiest way for you to become a Heavenly King in the shortest time possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he finished his sentence, let alone Fei\u2019er, even Xue\u2019er could not help but be interested as well. They blinked their wide eyes as they looked at him hopefully.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied solemnly, \u201cActually, this method is very simple. As long as you do THAT with me, you\u2019ll break through almost immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d Without warning, Fei\u2019er gave him a hard shove. She wanted to fiercely push him away. However, Zhou Weiqing was no longer the Little Fatty Zhou that was easily pushed around by other people. He stood firmly on the ground without moving an inch.</p><br/><p>Xue\u2019er stared at him with a look of disdain as well.\u201dUgghh! You only have those dirty things in your mind all the time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied with an innocent face, \u201cWhat dirty things? Why don\u2019t you ask Bing\u2019er whether it\u2019s true that you\u2019ll be able to elevate your cultivation base just by sleeping with me? Hey, I\u2019m a Heavenly Emperor now, you know. As long as I take a little care when we\u2019re doing that, I can transfuse the essence of my Saint Energy into your body in the most direct way. With the exchange between our Yin and Yang, you\u2019ll really be able to make a breakthrough. I really am not lying to any of you! You can always give it a try, you know. And if this method fails, I\u2019ll let you hit me any way you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Fei\u2019er was about to agree to it, Xue\u2019er suddenly pulled her over and whispered to her, \u201cShould we even try? We\u2019re just letting him take advantage of us if we agree to it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er finally came to her senses. Embarrassed and slightly annoyed, she gave him a few hard punches.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said helplessly, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t blame me for not helping the both of you then. Okay, how about this? I\u2019ll ask Little Witch to give it a try first for your sake. After you\u2019ve seen the results, you can always look for me anytime you want. Hehe!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

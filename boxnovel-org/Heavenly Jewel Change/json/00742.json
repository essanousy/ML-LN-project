A satisfied but small smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Zhou Weiqing continued to speak, his tone suddenly taking a serious dip, \u201cI hope that there won\u2019t be any more changes this time around. Else, we will no longer seek your approval any further for the marriage between Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, Bing\u2019er and I!\u201d</p><br/><p>He sounded particularly stern. After all, he was not some clay-figurine that you could mold as you like, let alone the fact that even a clay-figurine would harden over time. The Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace indeed had a huge amount of influence and power. However, Zhou Weiqing still refused to always let them take advantage of him.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian knitted her brows together. Just as she was about to say something, Bing\u2019er gripped her hand tightly. She could clearly feel her daughter\u2019s anxiety. Slightly stunned, she continued to hold her tongue. As the saying went, when a girl was of age, she must be married off. If a conflict rose in between them and prompted Zhou Weiqing to abduct and elude with her three daughters, she would definitely come to regret it.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue had his head slightly bowed downward as if he had not heard the words that Zhou Weiqing had just uttered. Although it might seem like he always picked on Zhou Weiqing, In truth, his father-in-law was in fact truly concerned and had been helping him in secret without fail. As a matter of fact, Shangguan Tianyang \u2014 the smiling tiger \u2014 was the most difficult to appease. After all, he was the true person-in-charge of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. At this moment, Shangguan Tianyue did not plan to say anything at all. After all, he did find Shangguan Tianyang to be a little bit of a bully right now. Earlier, before Zhou Weiqing went to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, Shangguan Tianyang had already hinted that he would allow the three Shangguan sisters to marry Zhou Weiqing but with all these new conditions, anybody would be upset if they were in his shoes.</p><br/><p>As expected from Shangguan Tianyang, the Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Faced with such a provocative discourse from Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s smile did not even waver one bit. Instead, he nodded his head and replied, \u201cThis time around, I purposely waited for you to come back to settle this problem regarding the marriage problem. I promise, there won\u2019t be any other changes any longer. Do you want to take a rest first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s alright. As long as this matter is still unsettled, I won\u2019t be able to have peace of mind. So, I wonder. Where should we settle this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang smiled, \u201cAt the arena of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had never been to the arena of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace before. Now that he had first stepped into it, he could not help but be taken aback by surprise.</p><br/><p>The arena appeared to be just an open space that was surrounded by clouds and fog. However, in truth, this was a small parallel realm.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was no longer the same as before. He did not know what switch Shangguan Tianyang flipped but he was absolutely sure that they were teleported here by something.</p><br/><p>Other than the people present in the meeting hall earlier, Zhan Lingtian was there in the arena as well. To be more precise, he had been cultivating here until a moment ago. Shangguan Tianyang saw him and motioned for him to stay and watch instead. Zhan Lingtian was also Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s disciple as well. Such a battle would bring varying degrees of benefits to any Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>Although this was a parallel realm, it was no different than the Boundless Mainland at all. The sun was still shining brightly. The only difference was the arena that was surrounded by clouds, making it look like paradise.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang guided Tang Xian, Bing\u2019er, and Ling Zhantian to stand far away in the distance. He nodded his head towards Shangguan Tianyue as his mouth moved ever so slightly as if trying to tell something to his younger brother.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue furrowed his brows together but he gave a slight nod as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not bother to hide the twitch on his lips. He did not even have to guess to know that Shangguan Tianyang must be telling Shangguan Tianyue to show him no mercy and go all out to beat him up so they could keep Xue\u2019er\u2019s as the heir.</p><br/><p>A foot-long sandalwood stick appeared from Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s hand and proceeded to float in mid-air. After all, he was the Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, he does indeed, live up to his reputation here.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Shangguan Tianyue and Zhou Weiqing had walked to the arena, standing far apart from one another while facing each other. Indifferently, Shangguan Tianyue said, \u201cJust go at me with all you have. I won\u2019t show you any mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing bowed to him politely before he replied, \u201cAs you wish, Father-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue was absolutely pleased with the respects that he was shown. He secretly thought to himself, \u201cLooks like my painstaking efforts have not been in vain after all.\u201d In fact, had he not been secretly helping Zhou Weiqing behind the curtain, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace would not even be here to support Zhou Weiqing and the Heavenly Bow Empire so soon. Not only that, it never would have given Zhou Weiqing so many opportunities to be in touch with the three Shangguan sisters. As a matter of fact, the only person who actually appreciated Zhou Weiqing\u2019s talent the most was none other than Shangguan Tianyue. It was just that he had been putting on a dissatisfied facade in front of Zhou Weiqing all along so that this kid would not get too self-absorbed in his own talents.</p><br/><p>Apparently, it was now clear that Zhou Weiqing had come to realize Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s intentions so he was being very polite now.</p><br/><p>Then again, all of these had nothing to do with the battle at all. This duel between them still must go on. Not only that, Shangguan Tianyue would give all his might as well. With his older brother watching from the side, he would certainly see through his own intention had hie shown Zhou Weiqing some mercy. Without a doubt, this would naturally lead to more twists and turns.</p><br/><p>However, Shangguan Tianyue could not help but think to himself, \u201cOh my dear brother, do you really think that Zhou Weiqing is such an easy opponent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before this, when Zhou Weiqing had just landed on the island, Shangguan Tianyue had tried to get a sense of his power and though it was easy to just say \u2018I can\u2019t see through him\u2019, but when you have the eye power of a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, those words carried a significant nuance.</p><br/><p>Lasting for 30 minutes \u2014 note the word \u2018last\u2019, not \u2018defeat\u2019 \u2014 would not be an impossible task for him. Shangguan Tianyue was feeling kind of conflicted right now. \u201cHow could I possibly let this bastard off so easily by letting him marry all three precious daughters of mine at the same time?\u201d Yet, he was somewhat looking forward to seeing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s true strength.</p><br/><p>The son and father-in-law stood apart facing each other. A force as huge as the ocean suddenly radiated from Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s body. Yet, peculiarly, it did not have any effects on the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart gave a sudden jolt. Immediately, he understood what this was. This arena had a special power that severs its connection with the Atmospheric Energy from the outer world. In other words, this meant that neither he nor Shangguan Tianyue could borrow power from Atmospheric Energy. They could only rely on their cultivation base during the battle. If this was the case, all of the power intensity generated would be greatly reduced. Otherwise, if the true power of a Heavenly Emperor-tier master suddenly exploded on the Heavenly Jewel Island, even Zhongtian City might be affected as well.</p><br/><p>Faced with such large amounts of Heavenly Energy ripples emitting from Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s body, Zhou Weiqing stood there motionless, looking plain and simple as if he was merely an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Standing beside Shangguan Tianyang, Zhan Lingtian stared at Zhou Weiqing without even blinking. He had long heard that Zhou Weiqing had just made another breakthrough in his cultivation base. For this reason, he immersed himself in a hellish load of cultivation and finally broken through the Ninth Jewel-tier just a moment ago. In reality, he absolutely resented Zhou Weiqing, his love rival. This was also the driving force behind his mad cultivation practice.</p><br/><p>Even though he did not understand what was happening right now, it still came to him as a shock seeing Zhou Weiqing wanting to challenge Shangguan Tianyue. He was a Heavenly Emperor-tier master for goodness sake! Let alone 30 minutes, even he himself would not be able to resist a single blow from Tianyue blow. Could it be that Zhou Weiqing had reached a stage where he could withstand the second Palace Master\u2019s blow now? This was impossible, right?</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, Shangguan Tianyang was feeling bewildered as well. After all, he was a Heavenly Emperor-tier master who was at his peak now. Yet, Zhou Weiqing calmness has shaken him to the core. Like Shangguan Tianyue, he could not see through this young man as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s begin,\u201d Shangguan Tianyang announced as he waved his right hand. The tip of the sandalwood stick that was floating in the air lit up and clouds of smoke spiraled up gracefully.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not bother to make the first move. Instead, his left foot took a half-step back as he stared eagerly at his father-in-law.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue immediately understood what he meant. With a snort, he slapped a right palm into the air and a gush of powerful surge brushed past Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body in an instant. He just sent the first blow.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled. His Heavenly Jewels had already appeared on both of his wrists. When Shangguan Tianyang, Zhan Lingtian, and the rest saw the ten jewels encircling each of his wrists, they eyes widened in astonishment.</p><br/><p>Heavenly King Tier. Was he already in the Heavenly King Tier? At this moment, Zhan Lingtian went rigid with cold. At first, he thought that he would have the qualifications to challenge Zhou Weiqing after he had raised his own cultivation base to the Ninth Jewel but it seemed like the gap between the two of them had widened to the point of no return. As a person who was born in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, he naturally knew how great the gap was between someone with a Ninth Jewel cultivation and someone in the Heavenly King Tier. To put it simply, though the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace had many strong powerhouses, the number of Heavenly King-tier powerhouses were at least ten times fewer than those who had a cultivation base of Nine Jewels! It might look like a small distance, but in fact, it was far apart! Worse still, Zhou Weiqing was very much younger than he was.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Shangguan Tianyue had began to give his all all out. True to his words, he had no intention to show Zhou Weiqing any mercy.</p><br/><p>An almighty force burst out of his body without warning. The Heavenly Expanse Infinitum itself was known for its almighty power. Under his control, this powerful force instantly solidified and charged towards Zhou Weiqing forcefully.</p><br/><p>This was the difference between a Heavenly King-tier and a Heavenly Emperor-tier master. Although a Heavenly King-tier master possessed such strong power as well, they could never be able to control their own imposing stance like how a Heavenly Emperor-tier master could.</p><br/><p>Facing such tremendous pressure, a layer of faint gold light radiated from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Among all the people present, apart from the two involved, only Shangguan Tianyang could feel the changes in the air, simply because his cultivation base was actually high enough to allow him to feel it.</p><br/><p>Though Tang Xian did not understand the degree of the battle between Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Tianyue, she could clearly see that the faint smile that was usually on Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s face was now gone, without a trace.</p><br/><p>What did he just see?</p><br/><p>In truth, the scene that he saw was this \u2014 when Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s highly condensed almighty force charged against Zhou Weiqing, it simply parted into two streams the moment it touched his body, slipping away from him as they brushed passed his side without causing any harm on his body. Even though the faint golden light radiating from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body appeared to be very weak, it had formed a kind of protective air shield that even Shangguan Tianyang could not understand around his body.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue did not unleash his Consolidated Equipment. As an elder, how could he possibly unleash before Zhou Weiqing had done so? This was the dignity of a powerhouse.</p><br/><p>Seeing how Zhou Weiqing could resist his own powerful attacks so easily, a look of approval flashed across Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes. He smashed his right fist up into the air, and quickly, an arrow that was formed by the condensation of the surrounding fog shot straight toward Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>What Shangguan Tianyue was using now was the purest form of Heavenly Energy. A highly condensed Heavenly Energy that had no attribute.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face remained nonchalant but his body remained indifferent. He raised his hands up to his chest before slowly pushing them out.</p><br/><p>A faint pale golden light formed a transparent, thin layer in front of his palms.</p><br/><p>A light \u2018thud\u2019 resonated in the air. After the fog arrow hit the thin layer, it immediately turned into fog once more as it dissipated in the air.</p><br/><p>From a third party point of view, this collision might have seemed not to be not a big deal. Yet, the moment the fog dissipated in the air, a thundering hissing noise reverberated in the entire arena. Without wasting another second, Shangguan Tianyang quickly cast a barrier that blocked the scattered fog from approaching. Needless to say, one could see just how strong the previous attack was.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Shangguan Tianyue scorned faintly. Right at the next moment, he materialized before Zhou Weiqing with his hands shot out at the same time. His actions appeared to be completely serene, with no sense of ferocity at all. Yet the area within several dozen meters of him and Zhou Weiqing as the center instantaneously distorted without warning.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had a more serious look on his face now. A golden light flashed past and a pair of wings that were radiating a faint golden light appeared on his back. Within seconds, the wings swept forward and enveloped his entire body. In the end, he was still forced to use his Dragon-Tiger Transformation.</p><br/><p>However, those who were well-acquainted with him could clearly notice that his Dragon-Tiger Transformation now had changed dramatically compared to the past. From its appearance, aside from the additional two wings and the stronger golden light emitting from his body, there was no other transformation that could be seen on his body. The originally tyrannical appearance had now gone without a trace.</p><br/><p>WHAM \u2014</p><br/><p>Without any garish movements, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s palms slammed hard onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s wings. At once, Zhou Weiqing was sent flying in the air like a cannonball. The faint golden light was still radiating from his body even when he was in mid-air.</p><br/><p>This time, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s face had completely changed. If the attacks before were just tentative, he had used up 60% of his Heavenly Energy in the last attack earlier. Even though there was no boost from any Consolidated Equipment or any other attribute, this was still the domineering force of a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse.</p><br/><p>Still, he could clearly sense that the attack that he had just launched had already been dispersed in ripples after it was blocked by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s wings. Though it might have looked like Zhou Weiqing was sent flying by his attack, he had in fact, not managed to cause any injury to him at all.</p><br/><p>What power was this? This was the first time Shangguan Tianyue encountered such a crazy defensive force. He could not help but wonder whether his own brother would be able to withstand his own attack without the chance of a counterattack.</p><br/><p>After being sent flying through the air for over 100 meters, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s spread his wings and hovered in the air with a smile on his face. As it was his own father-in-law, he had allowed him to cast three blows first, facing the three strikes with only defensive techniques. Though it might seem like he had withstood the three blows easily, the amount of force that he received was not as feeble as it looked. He did not even know what was the limit of the punishment he could endure. From the few attacks earlier, he noticed that after he had solidified his Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core, though he had already given himself a very high estimate, it still seemed like he had kind of underestimated his own strength. In other words, his true strength was much stronger than what he first thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out, Father-in-law,\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s clear voice resonated from above the air, showing the fact that he was not injured at all. Without warning, he drew a circle in front with both of his hands before drawing another triangle with each of his hands. At the very next moment, the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation materialized beneath his feet.</p><br/><p>Unlike the previous times, aside from the six Heavenly Jewels that appeared on the six corners of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, there were another four floating above Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head, shining with a dazzling brilliance.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could be pretty cunning sometimes. At this moment, he refused to unleash his legendary armor set. Well, his Ringless Ground Purging Set was still incomplete so it was completely impossible for him to fight with Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s full legendary armor set. As long as he did not unleash his Ringless Ground Purging Set, Shangguan Tianyue would never unleash his own legendary armor set as well, especially with his stature. As a result, the gap between the two of them had been reduced imperceptibly.</p><br/><p>Now that the first three strikes had already been struck, Zhou Weiqing has decided to reveal his true nature. Just the fact that he was able to withstand the three strikes earlier had already left the spectators present on the scene agape with shock. Yet, this was only the beginning.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing pointed his right hand forward and a peculiar scene unfolded at once. A silhouette of a strange-looking cat-shaped Heavenly Beast suddenly flashed in the sky before setting its sight toward Shangguan Tianyue. There was no need for him to charge his energy at all during the entire process.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue waved his sleeves. Now that Zhou Weiqing had cast a technique, he would naturally not back down as well. In a blink of an eye, an icy-blue spear shot out and make its way towards the silhouette rapidly.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly Skill Projection? No, the technique that Zhou Weiqing had just cast did not have a Heavenly Skill Projection at all.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, a strange scene started to unfold in front of their eyes. When the cat-shaped Heavenly Beast clashed with the ice spear, its body twisted in a peculiar manner without warning and the ice spear just flew through it. At the same time, the cat fell on Shangguan Tianyue without warning.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Bewilderment could be seen in Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes. The next instant, he could feel his body began to slow down.</p><br/><p>Mimicking his right hand, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s left hand quickly pointed forward as well. Abruptly, the air in front of him collapsed and a glimpse of silverish light flashed across before a thundering explosion followed. The highly condensed ice spear vanished into countless spots of light in an instant. That was the advanced version Spatial Rend that was cast using his Saint Energy \u2014 Spatial Collapse.</p><br/><p>As for the Heavenly Beast that looked like a cat, well, that was just the advanced, reincarnated version of Absolute Delay.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing was casting his technique, he did not give off a powerful aura at all. Everything seemed to be just flowing so casually from his fingertips, there was no pause at all in the entire process.</p><br/><p>He did not rush to retract his both hands back. With his hands still in front of his chests, he seized this opportunity where Shangguan Tianyue was still trapped in Absolute Delay and interlaced his fingers, forming a hand seal that looked like a butterfly. On the other side, rays of lightning emerged beside Shangguan Tianyue. It turned out that Zhou Weiqing had just bound twelve Fetters of Wind in succession onto him.</p><br/><p>What incredulous speed that he just displayed! Though it looked like this was the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation that was modified from one of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperors, Long Shiya\u2019s Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation, Zhou Weiqing had always had Saint Energy as a base for all his techniques. For this reason, the technique that he had just used was completely different from those of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperors, Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>Put simply, though they were still the Fetters of Wind, the one that Zhou Weiqing cast was at least three times more powerful than other Heavenly Jewel Masters who were in the same tier as him. He could elevate a seven-star rated technique to become one that was equivalent to the level of ten-stars. Now that he had just cast twelve Fetters of Wind onto Shangguan Tianyue in a row, even a Heavenly Emperor-tier master like him would not be able to break free from it so easily.</p><br/><p>Even though they could not mobilize any Atmospheric Energy from the outer world, the Atmospheric Energy here itself was already extremely rich. After he had cast the twelve Fetters of Wind, Zhou Weiqing did not stop for even a second. Instead, he turned his palms and faced them towards each other. All that the spectators could see was the bluish-purple light that suddenly flashed in between his palms. At the next instant, a giant lightning dragon burst out from his palms, charging straight towards Shangguan Tianyue.</p><br/><p>The lightning was so fast that even after it had transformed to become a dragon, it still retained its speedy characteristics.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue who constrained had been completely thrown into utter chaos by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Fetters of Wind. Before he could break free from the bindings, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lightning dragon had already appeared right before his eyes.</p><br/><p>The true power of the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse could completely be seen at this moment. Though he had not yet fully broken free from the shackles of the Fetters of Wind\u2019s, a glimpse of light flashed across Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes and without warning, a crystal clear ice shield materialized before him. The ice shield had a diameter of about three meters and completely shielded his body behind it. Being unable to move physically did not mean that one could not cast any techniques at all.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s control of his techniques was not that simple as he thought. Just as the lightning dragon was about to crash onto the ice shield, it suddenly changed its path and went around the side of the ice shield before slamming down hard onto Shangguan Tianyue.</p><br/><p>In the midst of the loud crash, a bluish-purple light suddenly radiated from Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s entire body. After a great deal of struggle, he had finally broken free from the constraints of the Fetters of Wind. At once, a strong stinging numbness spread throughout his entire body.</p><br/><p>The lightning dragon was actually formed by Zhou Weiqing after multiple simulations of the Lightning Suffering Skill. In fact, even Long Shiya who possessed the Lightning Attribute would not be able to cast this kind of attack. After all, he did not have any Saint Energy at all!</p><br/><p>A black light suddenly appeared without warning. As a matter of fact, this black light actually emerged directly from below Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s feet. A black hexagram was formed as it emerged.</p><br/><p>As a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, Shangguan Tianyue possessed quite a stout body. For this reason, he did not suffer from any injuries although he was attacked head-on by Zhou Weiqing. However, the black light suddenly appeared too suddenly. Still suffering from the numbness, he could not manage to break free from this in time. A blackish-red light suddenly flashed across his head, forming a strange sigil above of him.</p><br/><p>This was the Curse of Doom. Naturally, it was an advanced version as well.</p><br/><p>While casting all of these spells, Zhou Weiqing did not show any sign of hesitation at all. It could be said that all of these spells were unleashed one after the other without pause. Not only that, each and every one of them was so extremely powerful.</p><br/><p>After the Curse of Doom was unleashed, he paused his movement for a while. Both his hands were clasped before his chest. A rich, intense, silver light suddenly broke out from his hand and as he turned both of his palms inward at the same time, he made a gesture like he was casting something. The moment his palms were opened again, a Silver Emperor rose up to the sky before picking up speed as it continued to soar. The Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce was cast before it was closely followed by the fusion technique of Spatial Rend and the Silver Emperor Wing Slash \u2014 the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend. In an instant, the Silver Emperor had already appeared in front of Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>From the start of their battle until this moment, the sandalwood stick had just only burned a little. However, in this short amount of time, Zhan Lingtian\u2019s back was already completely drenched in sweat. Other than his bewilderment, there were no other emotions in his heart. It had never crossed his mind that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength was now so immensely powerful to the point that he could even suppress Shangguan Tianyue. Zhan Lingtian was not a weak person. He was very familiar with the two palace masters here. Naturally, it was clear to him that other than his Consolidated Equipment, Shangguan Tianyue had already used up all his might in this battle. Be that as it may, he was still being suppressed by Zhou Weiqing under such circumstances.</p><br/><p>Ever since the smile vanished from Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s face who was now standing beside Zhan Lingtian, it had never reappeared again on his lips. What he could see was naturally much more profound than that of Zhan Lingtian. He also possessed all the techniques that Zhou Weiqing cast, but all of these techniques that were cast in the battle were actually released by the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. In other words, he was merely imitating all these techniques. and yet Zhou Weiqing\u2019s imitation techniques were no less weaker than the real ones he possessed.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a dazzling golden light erupted from Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s body, more specifically, from his chest. As the golden light dispersed, it covered his entire body with a saint-like aura. Within seconds, he eliminated the numbness of his body as well as the Curse of Doom\u2019s effects. A glimpse of light flashed across his eyes. Without warning, a golden ray was shot out from his mouth, transforming into a golden blade before it collided with the Silver Emperor head-on.</p><br/><p>In a thunderous crash, the Silver Emperor was thrown backward instantly. Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s shoulder was also wavering slightly. After all, this technique of his was cast in a dire situation with all his might. It was a pity to him that he was not able to destroy the Silver Emperor in just one blow.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the arena, Zhou Weiqing maintained the pace of his onslaught of attacks. After the Silver Emperor was sent flying, two different lights emerged from his hands and the back of his body.</p><br/><p>The light that emerged from his back was burgundy in color while the one that was released from his hands were dark purple in color. When the two lights were being released, it stunned his movements but just as Shangguan Tianyue blasted the Silver Emperor backward, he had completed casting his technique.</p><br/><p>Six wings flapped vigorously as the Hell\u2019s Angel rose up to the sky. That was the consolidated matter that was formed by the dark purple ray. It took a step forward and floated five meters in front of Zhou Weiqing. Countless dark purple light orbs smashed toward Shangguan Tianyue relentlessly. On the other hand, the Silver Emperor flew towards him from the side.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a strange seductive creature that had a human torso with the lower body of a snake also appeared from behind Zhou Weiqing. A flash of burgundy rays shot out from its eyes, aiming directly toward Shangguan Tianyue.</p><br/><p>In just a short amount of time, Zhou Weiqing had completed his resurrection of the Silver Emperor, Hell\u2019s Angel and Demonic Dragon Lady. Three strong powerhouses, launching their attacks at Shangguan Tianyue at the same time.</p><br/><p>After completing the three resurrections, Zhou Weiqing finally slowed down his attacks. Resurrecting the Silver Emperor and the Hell\u2019s Angel was not a big deal for him because after all, these two were only at the Heavenly King Tier. With his cultivation base, he could easily revive them like he was taking a stroll in the park. However, the Demonic Dragon Lady was a Heavenly Beast who was at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Emperor-tier. Resurrecting it put a slight toll on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. The Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core had somehow dimmed a little.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength was now even more apparent to the others. Although the Starcrux Nucleus Core had somewhat dimmed, the golden color radiating from his body was obviously enhanced. The Atmospheric Energy with all kinds of attributes in the air was now rushing towards him at a speed that defied all comparisons. Even Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s cultivation base of a Heavenly Emperor-tier did not have such influence over Atmospheric Energy like he did.</p><br/><p>The moment he saw the emergence of the Hell\u2019s Angel and the Demonic Dragon Lady after he had managed to strike off the Silver Emperor in one blow, Shangguan Tianyue had a momentary lapse in the impression he had toward his opponent. For a moment, he felt like the person that he was fighting against right now was the one of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperors himself.</p><br/><p>Though originally, this match was conducted with the aim of having Zhou Weiqing lasting 30 minutes in his hand from mercy but in truth, he was completely beaten in a passive position ever since the match began. He did not deliberately lose to Zhou Weiqing at all. It was just that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s speed of casting his techniques was far too fast for him. On top of that, he had used different attributes in his techniques and each of them was cast in an extremely controlled manner. Zhou Weiqing had completely thrown Shangguan Tianyue off his guard.</p><br/><p>As an elder, he originally had the intention to show his junior a little color but now the situation seemed to have completely reversed. This kid was so insanely powerful to the point that it had far exceeded his previous judgment.</p><br/><p>Had it been a normal Heavenly King-tier master who went against a Heavenly Emperor-tier master, the former would most likely be shaken to his core before the match even began. However, it was not the same for Zhou Weiqing at all. When he first came back from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, he had already battled it out with a Heavenly God-tier master, let alone a Heavenly Emperor-tier master. He did not have any fear at all in his heart.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing was actually feeling a little dissatisfied as he thought to himself, \u201cThe Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace is trying to use this method to stop me from marrying Xue\u2019er right? Alright, fine! I\u2019ll just use my strength to prove them wrong and shut their mouths!\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint hazy golden halo radiated from Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s body, blocking the attack from the Hell\u2019s Angel. Concurrently, he clasped both of his palms together. When he finally removed them apart, a golden sword had already appeared on his right palm.</p><br/><p>This sword was three feet and six inches long with a width of three fingers. A gigantic dragon\u2019s silhouette also appeared behind Shangguan Tianyue. The dragon circled behind him and a golden ray shot out from its mouth, countering the Dragon Silencing Seal Laser that was shot out from the Demonic Dragon Lady\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Jewels that Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s possessed were also of many different attributes. Among them, the attribute that was the most powerful was no other than the Light Attribute. The sword in his hand and the light dragon behind him were the most powerful techniques that he possessed, having obtained them from the Heavenly God-tier Heavenly Beast \u2014 the Lustersaint Dragon. The Lustersaint Dragon was the palace guardian of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, its position was equal to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s Blackfiend Dragon.</p><br/><p>With the assistance of these powerful techniques, he was able to stand firm and barely had to resist any of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>After all, a true Heavenly God-tier technique was not something that could be matched by the Demonic Dragon Lady, the pseudo God-tier technique. Not only that, be it the partial Evil Attribute of the Demonic Dragon lady or the Darkness Attribute of the Hell\u2019s Angels, both of them had to have a certain degree of restraint when they came face to face with the Light Attribute. Immediately, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s aura increased greatly as an almighty force spread out from his body, forming layers of solid golden light that were fluctuating towards the two resurrected Heavenly Beasts.</p><br/><p>Still, Shangguan Tianyue did not choose to attack at the first opportunity. After all, he also needed to catch his breath after taking on the onslaught of attacks from Zhou Weiqing earlier. Especially at the speed of how Zhou Weiqing was madly consuming Atmospheric Energy from the air earlier, he would lose his chance to replenish his energy if he did not do so now.</p><br/><p>The Silver Emperor flew by his side while the Demonic Dragon Lady and the Hell\u2019s Angel were blocking his vision in front of Zhou Weiqing. What exactly was he doing now?</p><br/><p>With his palms slightly curved as they arched before his chest, a circular space was formed in between his palms. The golden light on his body was slowly getting stronger now. Strips of golden light ribbons began to appear and spread out from Zhou Weiqing before it swirled around his body.</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s almighty force was cast under the assist of his Heavenly God-tier technique, it did not seem to have any effects on Zhou Weiqing at all. When these golden light ribbons materialized from the air, the air of the entire arena seemed to shake violently.</p><br/><p>Taken aback, Shangguan Tianyang immediately released his own Heavenly Energy to maintain this realm. Still, he could clearly feel the bloodcurdling suction energy that had just erupted from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Even his own Heavenly Energy was being sucked by him now.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Shangguan Tianyue was even more astonished than the rest. This was because when the realm was shaken just now, he realized that he could no longer absorb Atmospheric Energy from this realm. The Atmospheric Energy here seemed to have found their master and all of it was rushing madly toward Zhou Weiqing now.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly Emperor-tier master who was robbed of Atmospheric Energy. This was something that had completely surpassed Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s knowledge.</p><br/><p>He did not dare to make an attempt at replenishing his energy any further. In reality, without Atmospheric Energy, there was nothing that he could use to replenish his energy any longer. No matter how Zhou Weiqing managed to do all these, a prompt and short battle was the most advantageous route for Shangguan Tianyue now.</p><br/><p>Another golden light flashed across. Resisting the Demonic Dragon Lady and the Hell\u2019s Angel\u2019s attacks, Shangguan Tianyue lunged forward head-on. The powerful force from the Lustersaint Dragon\u2019s effects allowed him to completely overwhelm the two resurrected techniques before him.</p><br/><p>A sky-shattering blade of light suddenly flew past them. The Hell\u2019s Angel was the first to receive the blow. In an instant, it vanished into nothingness in the golden light. Darkness and light were completely antagonistic to each other. The difference in their level left it with no ability to resist at all.</p><br/><p>However, just as the Hell\u2019s Angel perished by the blade, a gush of monstrous Evil Attribute exploded from behind it.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Shangguan Tianyue had already gained the upper hand with the help of the Lustersaint Dragon in terms of power. He forced the Hell\u2019s Angel and the Demonic Dragon Lady to be unable to release their full powers. However, right this moment, all that he could feel was that his breathing had suddenly become stagnant. A devilish Evil aura that shook his soul immensely to the core smashed down on him from the sky like a direct blow on the head.</p><br/><p>W-What was this?</p><br/><p>The color drained from Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s face. The Demonic Dragon Lady\u2019s aura? I-Impossible! This was impossible! Even the true Demonic Dragon Lady could never take him on as his opponent, let alone exude these horrendous energy ripples.</p><br/><p>If it was not the Demonic Dragon Lady, what it was then?</p><br/><p>Immediately, a grey phantom began to enlarge gradually behind the Demonic Dragon Lady. The moment the grey figure materialized, the area around the entire arena began to tremble as if it was in great fear.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was still hovering in the air. One could clearly see that the strips of light ribbons spiraling out from his body were constantly absorbing the Atmospheric Energy without stopping. Even the other energies in this realm were sucked by it while the Evil Energy continued to be released from behind him. It was all due to the appearance of this figure that the light radiating from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body that was originally a pale golden color had now completely changed to a grey color. A grey that was decorated with stars.</p><br/><p>This did not happen only to Zhou Weiqing. Even the Demonic Dragon lady in front of him had now been dyed with the same grey color. Her body was trembling ever so lightly and a look of intense excitement could be seen on her face. The force radiating out of her body seemed to have grown by many folds. She no longer seemed to fear the Lustersaint Sword on Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s hand nor the Lustersaint Dragon\u2019s aura that was being emitted from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better watch out, Father-in-law,\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s voice suddenly reverberated in the air calmly. Then, another burgundy-colored laser was shot out from the Demonic Dragon Lady\u2019s eyes. This time, the dazzling light that was blasted out from the Lustersaint Dragon\u2019s mouth could not even stop the burgundy light. The light was heading directly onto Shangguan Tianyue now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

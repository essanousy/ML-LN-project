Due to her kindness and heart of gold, she paid the greatest price and put herself in an extremely weakened state. Because of this, her body is now left with more space to absorb Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Like a blood transplant, the Elven Queen\u2019s initially large reservoir of Life Energy was now converted into pure Nebula Saint Energy, thanks to Zhou Weiqing. In the middle of the Elven Queen\u2019s chest, lay something similar to a Heavenly Core Nucleus \u2014 the Life Core. This was also the symbol of the Elven Queens from the past dynasties.</p><br/><p>The Life Core will not only bring her even greater power, for should the Elf Tribe be in grave danger, the Elf Queen would be able to use her life as a form of sacrifice and use the Life Core as a seed while she provided nutrients to nurture the Ancient Tree of Life once again. This would prolong the Elf Tribe\u2019s survival.</p><br/><p>Hence, the position of the Elven Queen who held the Elven Heart and the Life Core is one of absolute supremacy. Even with the twelve elders combined, they could not be compared to her.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the outer area of the Elf Queen\u2019s Life Core was completely wrapped in a layer of pure Saint Energy. As Saint Energy continued pouring in, the Life Core continued to secrete powerful Life Energy. Not only was this replenishing the Elf Queen\u2019s lost Life Energy within a short period of time, it was also following the Saint Energy as it orbited back and forth from Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>The Life Core continuously released layer after layer of green light. At the same time, the green surface of the Life Core slowly began to peel, as if layers of silk were beginning to peel off, and started a transformation towards a shade of gold.</p><br/><p>Just like how the Elven Queen, while in combat, was absolutely sure that the Elven Heart could help heal Zhou Weiqing, but was not aware that it would create such a huge effect, Zhou Weiqing also knew that his full usage in pouring Saint Energy into the Elven Queen\u2019s body to help her recuperate, would help her replenish the life energy that she had lost. However, he was not too clear on the benefits that she would receive from this.</p><br/><p>With Saint Energy\u2019s stimulation, the Elven Queen\u2019s Life Core began to transform. Furthermore, it seemed to evolve as well. To a Heavenly God-tier cultivator like her, this was definitely considered to be a fundamental change.</p><br/><p>However, even though the Elven Queen was probably feeling really good, things for Zhou Weiqing were beginning to take a more gloomy turn. The Elven Queen\u2019s body was like a bottomless pit. Based on the purity of his Saint Energy, he assumed that even without the help of the Galaxia feedback, his own Saint Energy should be able to help replenish the Elven Queen\u2019s life energy in a short period of time.</p><br/><p>However, when he was actually doing it, he did not feel like it was a short period of time at all. After absorbing the Galaxia feedback and a large portion of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s converted Saint Energy, the Elven Queen\u2019s body still seemed like a bottomless pit. No matter how much energy Zhou Weiqing poured into her, she would receive it with great ease.</p><br/><p>This cannot go on! Is the Heavenly Energy of a Heavenly God Tier that horrifying? If she continues her absorption, I\u2019m going to die from excessive ejaculation!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing thought sorrowfully while increasing his absorption of the Atmospheric Energy.</p><br/><p>With the help of the Nebula from the sky, he managed to replenish his Saint Energy at a rather rapid speed, especially after the completion of his Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation. The most shocking thing to Zhou Weiqing was, that he was not only able to absorb Atmospheric Energy from the air, he was also able to absorb and convert the energy from beneath the ground. This also included Atmospheric Energy, Evil Energy, and other similar types of energies. In the face of his Nebula Saint Energy, everything could be turned into nutrients. It was because of this support system that he was able to continue pouring into the Elven Queen. Besides, the fact that he had the power to continue pouring in even more energy was what gave him even more resolve. If he found himself unable to continue, he could stop. It did not mean that he would be sucked dry.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing would not stop so easily, not before he was finished. This was especially since he had received so many benefits from the other party. Only heaven knew what kind of transformation would happen to the Elven Queen. Logically speaking, the Life Energy in her body should have gone back to normal long ago, so why did she not shown any signs of awakening?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had a hunch that the Elven Queen had entered a cocooned stage. Not only was she unable to wake up, she had entered the deepest slumber. Was this due to overconsumption? Zhou Weiqing could not say for sure. However, for the sake of the Elven Queen\u2019s safety, he could only continue pouring his Saint Energy into the Elven Queen.</p><br/><p>Time continued to pass, and the extreme darkness in this part of the skies would naturally draw the attention of people passing by. However, it was also fortunate that this was a desolate area outside of the city, not many people could really see the changes in the sky. Even if there were cultivators among that small amount of people, once they entered the area around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Nebula Divine Territory, their substantially limited powers would make them choose to flee the area immediately.</p><br/><p>Anyone who had experienced the Nebula Divine Territory would be able to discern that this was the Divine Territory of a Heavenly God-tier cultivator. Who would dare offend the whiskers of a Heavenly God cultivator! Unless of course, that person is courting death?</p><br/><p>However, the earliest to realize the problem at hand was the Elf Tribe.</p><br/><p>That day, Zhou Weiqing took the Elven Queen and traveled through her realm. It\u2019s been three days and three nights since he had left. Initially, the Elf Tribe didn\u2019t react too much to it. They fully trusted their Elven Queen and waited quietly.</p><br/><p>However, not too long after Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen\u2019s departure, a large number of leaves on the Elf Tribe\u2019s Ancient Elven Tree began to fall, all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>One should know that the Ancient Elven Tree was the Elven Queen\u2019s residence, and also the core of the Elf Tribe. You might say that it was closely linked to the Elven Queen. Whenever something happened to her, the Ancient Elven Tree would react as well. A huge change in the Ancient Elven Tree shows, very clearly, that the Elven Queen was in trouble.</p><br/><p>After careful consideration, the twelve Elf Tribe elders managed to surmise, that the Elven Queen had used the Elven Heart.</p><br/><p>How could this be? Just how powerful was the enemy, to have forced the Elven Queen into doing this! The members of the Elf Tribe instantly plunged into panic. However, they could not leave the Sealed Land of the Elf Tribe so easily. The seal on the Sealed Land was not only directed to the world outside, more importantly, it was directed to the world inside. Even the Elf Tribe elders could not not leave at will without the help of special magical tools.</p><br/><p>The first thought that came to the Elf Tribe elders\u2019 minds was that something had happened on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s end. They have all seen Zhou Weiqing\u2019s power, and have had personal experiences with the terrifying might of the Demon God Sword. In their eyes, Zhou Weiqing was at least on par with the Elven Queen, so he must have done something terrible to her, which resulted in Her Majesty\u2019s usage of the Elven Heart.</p><br/><p>The Elf Tribe did not have a lot of good sentiments towards humans, so naturally, they were used to thinking ill of them. In their point of view, it was very likely that Zhou Weiqing was in league with the enemy. Therefore, the Elf Tribe viewed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s five female companions with extreme hostility. If it were not for the fact that Shangguan Xue\u2019er had stepped out to reveal her identity from Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, the Elf Tribe might have moved against her already.</p><br/><p>After waiting for yet another day and still seeing no sign of the Elven Queen\u2019s return, the Elf Tribe had no choice but to send two elders to forcibly break out of the seal, in hopes of finding the Elven Queen and bringing her back.</p><br/><p>Now, these two elders were already in the outer area of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Nebula Divine Territory, but did not dare step in. Not only have they seen the Nebula Divine Territory, they also saw the powerful Demonic Dragon Lady and Hell\u2019s Angel. Without a doubt, Her Majesty should be inside this Divine Territory, and the power in this Divine Territory had completely surpassed their previous assumptions.</p><br/><p>What could they do? They could only choose to return to the Elf Tribe.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? A Divine Territory that turns day into night, and a large helix-shaped Nebula? Where did this cultivator come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>The twelve elders assembled, all of them filled with anxiety. The Elven Princess was kidnapped, and now something had happened to the Elven Queen. This, to the Elf Tribe, was definitely a disastrous predicament! If something happened to both the Elven Queen and the Elven Princess, then the survival of the Elf Tribe would be greatly affected as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ask those humans. Perhaps they would know.\u201d The First Elf Tribe Elder suddenly remembered Shangguan Xue\u2019er, Tian\u2019er and the rest of the five wives.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the twelve Elf Tribe elders appeared in front of the five wives once again.</p><br/><p>Even though the Elf Tribe did not make any direct move against them, after receiving knowledge of Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s identity, they still placed them under house arrest. While their powers were not exactly weak, they could not leave without Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lead from this Sealed Land, even if the Elf Tribe did not do anything to them. Hence, they had no choice but to stay in the Elf Tribe for the time being.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Nebula Divine Territory?\u201d The five wives looked at each other after hearing the Elf Tribe elders\u2019 description.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know whom the Nebula Divine Territory belongs to?\u201d The Elf Tribe\u2019s First Elder questioned impatiently. The hostility in his eyes increased. To them, if Zhou Weiqing and his companions\u2019 had not disturbed the peace in the Elf Tribe, none of this would have happened.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er nodded, \u201cI think I know. Perhaps that is not a Divine Territory, but that\u2019s definitely Weiqing\u2019s ability. I can guarantee you all, that if the Elven Queen is with Weiqing, her safety would not be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ability?\u201d Hearing this, a dull look momentarily flashed across the twelve Elf Tribe elders\u2019 faces. Then, an even more powerful sense of hostility exploded from their being.</p><br/><p>The Elf Tribe\u2019s First Elder replied in a dark voice, \u201cRegardless, we want to see Her Majesty. No matter where you\u2019re from, it\u2019s come to a point where we have no choice but to commit an offense. Take them away first, then find that Zhou Weiqing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The twelve Elven Tribe Elders surrounded the five wives instantly. Among the five wives, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was the calmest, the most gentle was Shangguan Bing\u2019er. However, if you wanted to point out the one with the worst temper, it would naturally be Tian\u2019er and Fei\u2019er. Especially Shangguan Fei\u2019er who has never been placed under house arrest throughout her entire childhood into her adulthood. Back in the Heavenly Bow Empire, her position was equivalent to the prime minister. Only Zhou Weiqing would dare say he was above her rank. Even a great number of soldiers had to respectfully address her as chief instructor whenever they met her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

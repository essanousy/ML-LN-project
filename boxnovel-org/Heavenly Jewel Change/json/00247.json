Zhou Weiqing could already see a violet-red vortex appearing about Dreamwake\u2019s head. <em>Heh heh!\u00a0Easy.\u00a0Once I make it temporarily impossible for you to use your Stored Skills or your Consolidated Equipment, you won\u2019t stand a chance against me</em>!</p><br/><p>However\u2026 just as that purple-red light shot out, Dreamwake suddenly pointed her draconic claws at Zhou Weiqing, causing a streak of black light to shoot at him.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing wasn\u2019t able to dodge either.</p><br/><p>The two streaks of light landed simultaneously.\u00a0Dreamwake\u2019s body trembled, followed by all of her Legendary Set items vanishing without a trace.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing wasn\u2019t much better off.\u00a0He discovered, to his amazement, that he had lost connection to his Hate Ground No Handle set.\u00a0Although the set remained on his body, it had lost all of its strength-multiplying effects.\u00a0And\u2026 he didn\u2019t seem to be able to summon any further techniques at all?</p><br/><p><em>No way.\u00a0That\u2019s a crazy coincidence.</em> Shocked, the two stared at each other with rather strange and puzzled looks in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Although there were differences in the techniques they had just used, the effects had been essentially the same.\u00a0Both made it temporarily impossible to use Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills.</p><br/><p>Dreamwake\u2019s technique was a bit faster than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dragon Silencing Seal, but Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dragon Silencing Seal could be used multiple times.\u00a0It was hard to say which technique was superior.</p><br/><p>Since he had lost his connection to the Hate Ground No Handle set, Zhou Weiqing went ahead and discarded it.\u00a0He stared suspiciously at Dreamwake.\u00a0\u201cWhat was that technique just now?\u00a0How could you use such a powerful technique without needing time to accumulate energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dreamwake snorted coldly.\u00a0\u201cAnd why should I tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged his shoulders helplessly.\u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to explain, just forget about it.\u00a0However\u2026 this is just the beginning.\u201d\u00a0He suddenly leapt off the ground with his right leg, shooting straight towards Dreamwake.\u00a0It was quite the coincidence, or perhaps some sort of unspoken accord, as Dreamwake did exactly the same thing as Zhou Weiqing made his move.</p><br/><p>In truth, the two were thinking the exact same thing.\u00a0Neither knew how long the enemy technique would last for, and once their own sealing techniques wore off the opponent would be able to regain their Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills.\u00a0If that happened, doom would be swift and certain.\u00a0It was best to seize the advantage and deal a game-ending blow before that happened.</p><br/><p>Without their Legendary Sets, both were now far slower and weaker.\u00a0The speed at which they used Heavenly Energy, however, was just as fast.\u00a0In the end, Dreamwake was a bit faster and she delivered a clawing strike with her right hand towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing wasn\u2019t able to use any techniques, and even his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation having been sealed by Dreamwake.\u00a0In the face of this attack, he only revealed a faint, odd smile on his face.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dodge.\u00a0Instead, he struck out with twin claws of his own.\u00a0It looked as though he was aiming at Dreamwake\u2019s shoulders, except\u2026 they seemed to be inching downwards slightly.\u00a0This was a direct \u2018attack\u2019, which naturally would be faster than a sweeping attack.\u00a0This meant that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strike would land first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou pervert!\u201d\u00a0Dreamwake was enraged.\u00a0She leapt upwards, delivering a kick towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s flank.\u00a0Both were fighting at the six-Jeweled cultivation level.\u00a0Although they were now slower than previously, they were still quite fast.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t dodge, instead lifting up his own right leg and using it to block Dreamwake\u2019s kick.</p><br/><p>A hint of a cold smile appeared at the corner of Dreamwake\u2019s lips. <em>Previously, when you had the Hate Ground No Handle set, I was indeed weaker than you.\u00a0But now that you aren\u2019t strengthened by any set, do you still think that you are stronger than me when I have the benefit of dual Physical Jewels?</em></p><br/><p>Boom!\u00a0Their legs collided in midair.\u00a0A piercing pain spread throughout Dreamwake\u2019s entire body from her right leg, which had just dispelled that earlier feeling of numbness.\u00a0Once more, she retreated lightning-fast.</p><br/><p>She had lost again.\u00a0She could clearly sense that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right leg didn\u2019t just vastly surpass her in strength, it was also incredibly tough.\u00a0She felt as though she had just kicked a steel pillar!\u00a0Although her leg wasn\u2019t broken by the collision, it had suffered a significant injury.</p><br/><p><em>How was this possible</em>?\u00a0Unfortunately, Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t give her any chance to consider this question.\u00a0After winning in that clash of kicks, he used his right leg to propel himself off the ground and pounce like a hungry tiger towards Dreamwake.\u00a0If he actually managed to land this pounce\u2026 ehehehe.\u00a0Not even Shangguan Xue\u2019er had \u2018survived\u2019, much less a Dreamwake who was limited to the six-Jeweled stage.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lecherous skills were quite outstanding.</p><br/><p>Dreamwake\u2019s eyes suddenly narrowed and darkened.\u00a0Until now, she had yet to truly view Zhou Weiqing as a worthy adversary for herself.\u00a0Even though she had lowered herself to the six-Jeweled stage, she still innately viewed herself as a Heavenly King powerhouse.\u00a0By all rights, she should vastly surpass Zhou Weiqing in both battle experience as well as understanding how to apply Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>However, reality had proven that this fellow was even harder to deal with than she had anticipated, and there was clearly something strange about his right leg.</p><br/><p>Dreamwake\u2019s power suddenly increased explosively.\u00a0As Zhou Weiqing pounced at her, Dreamwake suddenly flew backwards and launched a vicious kick at the ground with her left leg.\u00a0She borrowed from the counter-force to spin through the air to dodge Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pounce, then used her right hand to deliver a chop at the back of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck.\u00a0At the same time, she delivered a lightning-fast kick with her left leg at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s waist.\u00a0Her long, lithe leg stretched out, allowing her left foot to \u2018hook\u2019 itself around his waist and fasten herself to him.</p><br/><p>Her flexibility was simply incredible!\u00a0Zhou Weiqing hurriedly lowered his head, dodging Dreamwake\u2019s chop.\u00a0However, by now Dreamwake had already moved into close-combat range thanks to her hook-foot.</p><br/><p>Clearly, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to throw her off.\u00a0Dreamwake had already begun to make her move.\u00a0She twisted downwards, sending Zhou Weiqing flying in the opposite direction while latching onto the clothes on his back and sending him smashing into the ground.</p><br/><p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing should\u2019ve celebrated the fact that Dreamwake still wasn\u2019t able to use any strength with her right leg.\u00a0If she was, it wouldn\u2019t have been a simple grapple/toss.</p><br/><p>Crack!\u00a0Zhou Weiqing was sent smashing into the ground, quite dazed.\u00a0He skidded over ten meters forwards before finally managing to come to halt.\u00a0Dreamwake didn\u2019t press the attack, because she was still feeling tremendous pain pulse into her from her right leg.\u00a0She had to temporarily pause and press both hands against her right leg, sending pulses of faint blue light into it which made her feel a bit better.</p><br/><p><em>How could his muscles and his bones be even tougher than mine?\u00a0I\u2019m\u2026</em></p><br/><p>She stared intently at him as he skidded away.\u00a0This was the first time Zhou Weiqing had come off the worse in their battle, and a questioning look was in Dreamwake\u2019s eyes.\u00a0His actual combat ability had been far stronger than what she had imagined.\u00a0She was absolutely certain that not even a max level six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master would be able to gain an advantage over him in combat.\u00a0How many secrets did he contain?!\u00a0He was a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, but it didn\u2019t seem as though he had used some sort of special technique to increase his powers.\u00a0How could he have so much actual combat experience?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing flipped to his feet.\u00a0Given his toughness and tenacity, this fall wasn\u2019t able to injure him at all.\u00a0However, he felt a bit depressed.\u00a0In terms of close combat ability, he still wasn\u2019t able to match those who had flexibility-enhancing Physical Jewels.\u00a0Fei\u2019er had dominated him in a similar fashion long ago, and now history was repeating itself.</p><br/><p>Both had their own thoughts, but neither lessened their wariness of the other.\u00a0She continued to rub her leg, while he quickly replenished his own Heavenly Energy.\u00a0They were both hoping for the other\u2019s sealing skill to disperse, allowing them to put on their Legendary Sets once more.</p><br/><p>Alas, this entire exchange had taken less than ten seconds.\u00a0Their respective skills weren\u2019t even close to being finished.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes spun craftily, a naughty and delighted smile appearing within them.\u00a0He stood there without moving, simply flipping over his left hand and producing a long bow within it.\u00a0This wasn\u2019t Consolidated Equipment, it was nothing more than an ordinary and real longbow that had been fashioned from Star Wood.</p><br/><p>He nocked the bow with three arrows, almost instantly pulling the bow to a full draw.\u00a0Then, with an ear-piercing twang, he sent all three arrows towards Dreamwake at lightning speed.</p><br/><p>At such close distance, Dreamwake wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge even if she used her Heavenly King cultivation base.\u00a0She had no choice but to strike out with both palms, unleashing an awesome flood of Heavenly Energy which formed a shield to block those three arrows.</p><br/><p>These first three arrows were simply intended as a probe.\u00a0As they shot out, he hurriedly retreated backwards while shooting out one arrow after another.\u00a0Some he shot into the skies, some he shot straight at her, while some he shot in arcing curves.\u00a0Every single one of the arrows filled the skies with ear-piercing whistles as they shot out.\u00a0Every so often he would use the Twisting Bowstring Archery Skill, pouring his powerful Heavenly Energy into the arrows to give them even greater destructive force.</p><br/><p>After just a few brief seconds, Dreamwake was unable to defend any longer.\u00a0She never would\u2019ve imagined that Zhou Weiqing had this sort of technique at his disposal.\u00a0His archery skills could only be described as \u2018godly\u2019, as no matter where he fired the arrows would invariably come crashing down towards her at the most penetrating angles.\u00a0In addition, the arrows were filled with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Heavenly Energy.\u00a0Since both of them were limited to six-Jeweled Heavenly Energy, the only way for her to block these penetrating attacks was to use an even greater amount of Heavenly Energy.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arrows were so fast and densely aimed that she didn\u2019t even have the chance to use her Heavenly Dao Energy to absorb atmospheric energies to replenish her own energies.</p><br/><p><em>This bastard!</em> Dreamwake was enraged, but there was nothing she could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou forced me to do this,\u201d Dreamwake roared angrily. Suddenly, a surge of dense black energy exploded forth from her body. The dense Tenebrous Attribute energy instantly skyrocketed in power, forming an enormous black globe of light around her. When the endless stream of arrows Zhou Weiqing fired at her entered the range of that black globe of light, they fell completely silent and then were instantly corroded to the point of disappearing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Sitting down opposite of Zhou Weiqing cross legged, she started cultivating; but making sure she kept as far as possible.</p><br/><p>The inside of the tent had been cleaned and aired by Zhou Weiqing, and though it was small, it was relatively clean and comfortable. However, with just the two of them in such a small area, they could even hear each other\u2019s heartbeats. Shangguan Fei\u2019er felt a light burning sensation on her face.</p><br/><p>Carefully peeling off the mask, starting from the neck area, Shangguan Fei\u2019er finally revealed her own original face, showing the slightly blushing beauty below.</p><br/><p>Alas, the current Zhou Weiqing did not manage to witness that beautiful sight. He was seated cross-legged in a meditation state, cultivating his Immortal Deity Technique while pondering about the Ruffian Battalion.</p><br/><p>From Shen Bu\u2019s description, the Ruffian Battalion was undoubtedly the best place for him to start. That was because it was very separate from the normal command structure, and would not be given much orders, perhaps not even considered part of the army in the others\u2019 eyes. Furthermore, for those soldiers to be sent to the Ruffian Battalion, they should definitely have some power. After all, it was not easy to survive as a ruffian or scoundrel.</p><br/><p>Of course, just like what Shen Bu had said, this Ruffian Battalion was not so easily controlled, and he had to plan for the worst.</p><br/><p>Mu En had once taught Zhou Weiqing that no matter what happened, he had to think of all the worst case scenarios. If he felt that the first case scenario was barely acceptable, or survivable, then he should go ahead with it daringly. If not, he would have to consider again.</p><br/><p>Entering the Ruffian Battalion, the worst case scenario for him should be being chased out. Zhou Weiqing dismissed the possibility of being killed there; besides his confidence in his own power, he also had the two Icy Soul Heavenly Bears with him and the Silver Emperor Little Red Bean with him. That was not even counting Shangguan Fei\u2019er together with him. Zhou Weiqing was confident that protecting themselves would not be an issue at all.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at Zhou Weiqing quietly. That rascal actually started cultivating without looking at her. Was he shy or something? Hmph! If that rascal could be shy, there would not be any shy people in the entire world! \u201cHmph! That scoundrel!\u201d She muttered to herself softly.</p><br/><p>Before entering the tent, she was still worried that Zhou Weiqing might try to do something untoward to her. However, seeing him so well behaved, she suddenly felt a slight sense of disappointment. This was truly the paradox of a woman, under some unique circumstances, they would have such a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>This night would prove to be a very well behaved night for Zhou Weiqing, and he cultivated through the whole night, until the sun had come up outside.</p><br/><p>The tent\u2019s \u2018protection\u2019 against the sun rays were nothing to brag about. As soon as the morning came, the tent was bright and hot as well.</p><br/><p>The instant that Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes, he felt himself fall into a dazed trance. Just right in front of him was that unbelievably familiar face that he had longed for so much, causing his eyes to freeze on them.</p><br/><p>The light passing through the tent landed on her face, a gentle glow that accentuated that familiar countenance! Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart heated up, and he subconsciously leaned forward closing in on those beautiful lips.</p><br/><p>The closed eyes suddenly opened wide, blurry with sleep. However, when she saw that large face right in front of her, she instantly exclaimed in surprise, her body moving back and legs sweeping forth subconsciously.</p><br/><p>The leg struck out at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest, and lost in the midst of his tender feelings, how could he have any preparation. With a tearing sound, he was sent flying out of the tent, breaking through the thin tent.</p><br/><p>*Swoosh* Shangguan Fei\u2019er charged out after him. That earlier kick had not been a soft blow, but it did not have any Heavenly Energy imbued.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Little Fatty! What were you trying to do!?\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er glared at him angrily, as he clambered up from the ground, rubbing his chest.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly and said: \u201cUhhh\u2026 mistaken identity\u2026 I did not mean it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mistaken identity? Originally, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was not that angry; after all she had not yet been kissed by him. Even if he actually did\u2026 well\u2026 it was not like it was the first time already\u2026 Alas, when Zhou Weiqing said the words \u2018mistaken identity\u2019, it was like igniting a barrel of gunpowder.</p><br/><p>Like a riled up little female tiger, Shangguan Fei\u2019er pounced at him ferociously. \u201cScoundrel! Bastard! I\u2019ll mistaken identity you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sounds of our dear Little Fatty meeting the ground rang out, yet he did not dare cry out loud. At this moment, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was not in disguise, and he did not want to draw attention; if anyone saw them like this, their entire act would be ruined.</p><br/><p>However, after persevering for a while, Zhou Weiqing could not take it anymore. Although Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not use Heavenly Energy, in her anger, she was still quite savage, throwing him around until he was dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough! Are you mad?! It\u2019s just a mistake, I already said it was mistaken identity!\u201d</p><br/><p>*PENG* \u201cI\u2019ll let you continue mistaking the wrong person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroine\u2026 have mercy\u2026 enough already!\u201d</p><br/><p>*PENG*</p><br/><p>*PENG**PENG*</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! If a tiger doesn\u2019t show his power, you\u2019ll think I\u2019m a mere sick cat!\u201d Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t take it anymore and yelled out.</p><br/><p>Absolute Delay, Fetters of Wind, Touch of Darkness and the Lightning Suffering Skills. All four landed almost simultaneously on Shangguan Fei\u2019er.</p><br/><p>In her anger, Shangguan Fei\u2019er had totally forgotten that this was not the usual practice fight between her and Zhou Weiqing, where both were not allowed to use their Stored Skills. Although her cultivation level and power was much higher than Zhou Weiqing, caught by surprise, she was struck full on by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s four powerful Skills, and her body froze in place.</p><br/><p>Seizing the chance, Zhou Weiqing grabbed hold of her, his left hand pushing down on the back of her neck, locking her in place. He then pushed her down to his legs, striking down with a palm to her pert buttocks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! I\u2019ll show you, hitting me for no reason, this is what you owe me, I\u2019ll collect my debt right now myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, Shangguan Fei\u2019er attempted to struggle. However, the vertebrae was main control center of the body, and once restricted, she was not able to use any strength. After a few slaps, she stopped struggling, lying down across Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lap</p><br/><p>Actually, only Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first three blows actually used some strength, and as the blows continued, they grew softer and softer. Towards beautiful ladies, his \u2018resistance\u2019 had always been extremely low, let alone this being Shangguan Fei\u2019er, how could he possibly strike her hard for real.</p><br/><p>After about a dozen slaps, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s body was trembling slightly. Zhou Weiqing started, his hand frozen in the air, as he heard her sobbing cries.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhm\u2026 why are you crying like this. You threw me around and punched me, I still didn\u2019t cry\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked embarrassedly at Shangguan Fei\u2019er, at a loss at what to do. He quickly released the hand on her vertebra holding her down.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard\u2026 you bastard.\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er got up abruptly, kicking him down before running back into the tent.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head, muttering to himself: \u201cWasn\u2019t I the one who got beaten up more?! This Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace Little Demon Girl truly lives up to her name. What was that about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to return to the tent as well, a troop of soldiers walked over. They were Shen Bu\u2019s personal guards.</p><br/><p>The one right in the front was holding a set of armour, with the helmet on top with a red feather. The guard behind him was holding several sets of army uniforms as well as commander\u2019s seals, plaques and the like.</p><br/><p>Seeing them, Zhou Weiqing did not return to the tent, instead standing there awaiting their arrival.</p><br/><p>The leading guard yesterday, who he had already seen yesterday, handed the armour to Zhou Weiqing before saying with a slight mocking lilt in his voice: \u201cCongratulations, Battalion Commander Zhou. Today, you have been assigned as the Battalion Commander for the Ruffian Battalion. This are the uniforms for you and your follower, as well as the equipment for Battalion Commanders. Please change now, and we will escort you to the Ruffian Battalion.\u201d</p><br/><p>What escort\u2026 this was clearly monitoring and supervising\u2026 to ensure he was sent to the Ruffian Battalion.</p><br/><p>Still, Zhou Weiqing did not burst their bubble. Smiling faintly, he picked up a few sets of army uniforms, throwing one into the tent for Shangguan Fei\u2019er. As for himself, he just changed into a set out in the open, before wearing his armour. His stature was massive, and wearing that armour with the red feather in his helmet, he looked valiant and inspiring indeed.</p><br/><p>Besides the armour, there was a longsword and a plaque made out of an unknown metal. On the plaque were the words \u2018Unique Battalion 1\u2019, this was likely the actual formation name of the Ruffian Battalion.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took the Commander\u2019s Plaque and sheathed his sword. In his heart, he felt a twinge, a strange feeling. Battalion Commander. How things had changed so quickly. He was actually a Battalion Commander now, in charge of a thousand men!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er came out of the tent, once again masked and disguised. Her figure was much more slender than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, and her equipment was much simpler as well. An army uniform over a light leather armor, and a plain knife.</p><br/><p>There were twenty of those personal guards in total, and they moved out very naturally in a formation around the two of them. The leader of the guards said: \u201cBattalion Commander Zhou, the horses have already been prepared outside the main gates. Please, let\u2019s head out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: \u201cAt least let us have breakfast before leaving right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, as Battalion Commander is no longer part of our Sixteenth Regiment, we did not prepare your breakfasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: \u201cVery well, let\u2019s go then.\u201d He pulled Shangguan Fei\u2019er away, who was clearly about to lose her temper. Under the \u2018escort\u2019 of the twenty guards, they moved out.</p><br/><p>Right outside the Sixteenth Regiment, twenty two fine horses had already been prepared. After all, it was quite some distance between here to the Ruffian Battalion on the front lines.</p><br/><p>Mounting the horses, the entire party started moving out in a cloud of dust, and before long they were galloping towards the north.</p><br/><p>The two sisters, Shen Bu and Shen Yi, were already dressed in their formal armour, standing at the main gates, watching Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er leave. Shen Yi\u2019s brow was slightly furrowed, and she said softly: \u201cSis, are we going too far in doing this? After all, that Zhou Little Fatty is really strong, a talent indeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Bu gave a cold humph and said: \u201cSo what if he is a talent? A talent who cannot listen to orders, what use is he in the army? Let him stew in the Ruffian Battalion for a short while; it shouldn\u2019t take long for him to run back to beg me. At that time, hmph hmph.\u201d Thinking about that Zhou Little Fatty\u2019s hateful actions yesterday, she couldn\u2019t help but feel the anger rise up in her again.</p>\n</div>"}

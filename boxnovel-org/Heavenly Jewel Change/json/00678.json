Everybody\u2019s heart immediately sank. Hui Yao\u2019s gigantic body seemed to have turned into a gigantic dragon corpse once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoooooo\u2026\u201d Duo Si uttered a heartrending cry as she rushed forward. Opening up her wings, she hugged Hui Yao\u2019s head in her arms as devastating cries filled the air. Her head was lifted up high as tears of pain dripped down from her eyes.</p><br/><p>Just one step short of success, her hopes crumbled to dust. Duo Si\u2019s originally agonized heart could no longer withstand such a heavy blow.</p><br/><p>With a pale face, Tian\u2019er slumped into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms weakly. Her eyes were still staring unblinkingly at Hui Yao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Lowering her head, Duo Si cast a glance at Hui Yao before looking at Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er, the tears in her eyes had suddenly stopped flowing, \u201cHumans, I\u2019ve said before, in any case, I still want to thank you all. I no longer have the strength to save our children so please, I beg you, please save my children once you leave this place. I\u2019ll go with Hui Yao very soon and this Lustre Spatial Realm will not be destroyed. Without him, I really can\u2019t live anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her gaze had become very gentle. After waiting for so many days, everything still failed on the eve of success. It had completely shattered the last ounce of hope in her heart. Right now, all she wanted was to go with her husband even if it meant that she would have to go to another world.</p><br/><p>The three Shangguan sisters were already choking with tears. Looking at the tragic scene of the pair of dragon spouses, they were also immersed in deep sadness.</p><br/><p>Creases crept up between Zhou Weiqing\u2019s brows. He could not say anything that would stop Duo Si from killing herself. This was a female that was willing to die for love and for the sake of her husband. On top of that, she was a powerful dragon for God\u2019s sake. It was absolutely impossible for him to stop her. Even if he managed to stop her this time, it did not mean that she would not try to seek for death again the next time.</p><br/><p>Duo Si slowly closed her gigantic eyes. The originally strong vitality in her almost instantly dimmed down. She was intentionally shutting her heart down. Once her heart was completely shut down, she would lose her life. To kill a dragon, one would have to pay a terrible and painful price but for a dragon to take its own life, was actually a very simple matter.</p><br/><p>Whether it was Zhou Weiqing or the three Shangguan sisters, right now, their eyes were all filled with heartbreaking sadness. Such a powerful being was ending its life in such a way. How could they possibly not feel sad over the loss?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Duo Si, d-dont.\u201d Without warning, a low and weak voice rumbled.</p><br/><p>The moment the voice sounded out, Duo Si\u2019s rapidly deteriorating vitality became stable almost instantly. Zhou Weiqing and the girls\u2019 eyes were widened in surprise. Each of their gazes landed on the gigantic body. W-What was that? What had just happened?</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, an enormous terrifying tyrannical aura suddenly erupted out of Hui Yao\u2019s body. Like an erupting volcano, a shade of eye-catching red light suddenly broke free from all constraint as massive energy gushed out into the air. The rich and terrifying Atmospheric Energy dyed everything within the proximity into red all at once.</p><br/><p>Duo Si\u2019s eyes that were originally closed flickered open immediately as she lowered her head to look at her husband.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao\u2019s body that was lying on the ground gradually began to move. Even though the speed was slow, it was stable and powerful. First, he lifted up his proud head as his gigantic body followed suit. Slowly, he finally stood up on his own.</p><br/><p>The enormous dragon\u2019s eyes slowly opened, his huge thick wings unfurled and wrapped Duo Si in his embrace. A strong sense of vitality quickly filled the air. At once, the petrifying dragon aura shot out of his body, piercing through the clouds up to the sky.</p><br/><p>Yes, he was back! Hui Yao the dragon who once controlled the Lustre Spatial Realm was back.</p><br/><p>A strange peculiar energy radiated from the dragon\u2019s body as it transformed into five red halos. Instantly, the halos enveloped Zhou Weiqing, Tian\u2019er, and the three Shangguan sisters.</p><br/><p>To their surprise, the five of them could feel a wave of strange energy fluctuating and entering their brain from the point between their brows. In the next moment, their brains immediately went blank.</p><br/><p>There were no changes in their strength and the Heavenly Energy in their bodies but at this very moment, their mental energies seemed to be bursting out almost infinitely.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao\u2019s gaze landed on his wife and the moment their eyes met, their gazes never left each other again.</p><br/><p>Duo Si took the opportunity to strengthen her vitality again. Her claws clutched tightly at her husband, it was so, so tight as if she was afraid of letting go. She was extremely scared, scared that all of it was just an illusion. However, feeling the dragon aura in Hui Yao\u2019s body that was getting more powerful with every passing second, she knew that her husband had finally, FINALLY, returned to her side.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the pair of dragons only had one thought in their minds, \u201cHow nice it is to be able to live.\u201d Even if they had already lived for tens of thousands of years, at this moment, they still found life to be a precious thing.</p><br/><p>The red halos gradually disappeared from the five humans. Their eyes had once again regained their lights as they looked at each other in surprise. Their mental energies and soul energies seemed to have been elevated to another level. Zhou Weiqing who was already at the Ninth Jewel level could vaguely feel that in those short moment of ascension, his mental energy had risen to the Heavenly King level. Without a doubt, it was a great advantage for his next cultivation. It would be extremely useful in helping him to break through the Heavenly King tier and solidify the Saint Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>With a powerful soul energy, along with the energy in his veins, he was no longer daunted by the pressure of facing a Heavenly King-tier opponent.</p><br/><p>This was the repayment from Hui Yao. He had used the most primitive force of his dragon clan to help elevate the soul energy of the five humans even though such a feat would greatly hurt his primordial qi.</p><br/><p>Now that his vitality was restored, Hui Yao the dragon was completely resurrected. Tian\u2019er\u2019s Resurrection technique was a great success after all. Not just that, the Saint Energy would be useful to him, too. Of course, what was even more important was the fact that he could finally see his wife again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, humans. Thank you for saving my life,\u201d Hui Yao\u2019s gaze finally moved away from his wife and landed on Zhou Weiqing and the girls. Deep gratitude could be seen from both of the dragons\u2019 eyes. Although they did not say much, the raw emotions in their eyes said plenty.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled lightly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank us. We just hope that the both of you will continue to protect this Lustre Spatial Realm instead of destroying it. That would be the greatest way to thank us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao studied Zhou Weiqing. Just as Duo Si nodded her head at his side, he suddenly shook his head and growled in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they heard his words, Zhou Weiqing, and the girls were taken completely by surprise. Shocked, they stared confusedly at Hui Yao. From their point of views, they just saved his life for f*ck sake! Why the hell would he not agree to such a simple condition?</p><br/><p>Hui Yao continued to stare at Zhou Weiqing. It was apparent from his eyes that he was not willing to compromise on the issue at all, \u201cMy children have been abducted! For the sake of my children, I\u2019ll have to destroy the Lustre Spatial Realm. Only after I leave this place that I can rescue them. Even if you are the one who saved my life, you cannot stop me from rescuing my children. The most I can do is to let you take my life after I rescue my children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was instantly placed in a difficult situation, he could not say anything to stop Hui Yao at all. After all, as a father, how could he possibly live with the fact that his children have just been abducted? If Zhou Weiqing was in his shoes, he would probably do the same thing.</p><br/><p>Smiling awkwardly, Zhou Weiqing asked, \u201cIs there any other way? Perhaps, we can rescue your children on your behalf?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao stared at Zhou Weiqing with his flashing red eyes. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing felt as if he was being x-rayed. A faint golden layer emerged out of thin air as it enveloped his body, as if the layer could sense that he was being threatened.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Hui Yao asked in shock, \u201cT-This is the energy that saved me? Wha\u2026 What attribute is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing decided to tell the truth, \u201cThis is the Saint Energy. It\u2019s an energy that is refined from the Divine, Time, Spirit and Evil attributes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At once, a light gleamed in the dragon\u2019s orbs, \u201cSaint Energy? It\u2019s actually the energy that\u2019s formed from the solidification of the four Great Saint Attributes? How is this possible? You\u2019re only a mere human! W-Wait\u2026 Perhaps, it is actually possible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was a little confused by his words, \u201cSir, as long as you don\u2019t destroy the Lustre Spacial Realm, we will definitely give all our might to do whatever you want. Maybe I\u2019m not strong enough at the moment but once I\u2019ve succeeded in solidifying my Saint Core Nucleus, I definitely would be able to fight to the end even if my opponent is a Heavenly Emperor tier master. Please let us humans solve the dispute among humans ourselves. I promise that I will do my best to save your children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding his head, Hui Yao\u2019s eyes twinkled, \u201cWith the strength that you have right now, it\u2019s far from enough. Even I do not have the confidence to say that I can successfully save my children. That energy is just too horrifying! It\u2019s as if it came fro\u2026 from\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was surprised, \u201cFrom where?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Hui Yao replied, \u201cFrom the Netherworld.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taken aback, Zhou Weiqing asked, \u201c\u2026 N-Netherworld? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His greatest love was undoubtedly Shangguan Bing\u2019er, and between he and Tian\u2019er was a relationship that had sparked after years of being together. Now, with Shangguan Fei\u2019er, it was a confusing, rather indescribable thing between the two.</p><br/><p>Although he had successfully lured Shangguan Fei\u2019er out of her tent, Zhou Weiqing did not know how to continue with the conversation. Staring at her blankly, he remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you a question! You actually still fell for that little girl of the Heavenly Snow Mountain?!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er continued asking angrily. However, the hand that was grabbing onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shirt released it. She had never seen such a befuddled look in his normally cunning eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSometimes, feelings cannot be controlled. When they come, whether or not they are logical or not, no matter how much you try to suppress them, they will still come. I love Bing\u2019er so much, but I also love Tian\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo doubt, I admit, I am a bastard, but I will not let go of any one of them.\u201d As he said that, Zhou Weiqing paused, looking at Shangguan Fei\u2019er with a heated gaze. \u201cJust like how after I saw you cry on my behalf, I won\u2019t give you up either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s flames of anger were suddenly doused by that last line of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing took a step forward and held onto her hands.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er felt as if a bolt of lightning had coursed through her, and she quickly snatched her hand back, a rather flurried look on her face. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 didn\u2019t you say you wanted to go to the TianBei City? Let\u2019s go then.\u201d As she said that, she jumped up, releasing her Ghost Demon Horse in mid air and landing neatly on its back, galloping away in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave himself a slap, muttering to himself: \u201cZhou Weiqing, you are truly an asshole. A man whose heart is not content is like a snake which tries to swallow an elephant 1, you are just too greedy. But\u2026 I really do like them\u2026 how? Instead of causing them pain by rejecting them, isn\u2019t it better to spread the love, I don\u2019t mind labouring harder\u2026 An able man is a busy man.2\u201d</p><br/><p>Scratching his head, even he himself felt that his logic was rather shameless. However, to chose between face and having his wives, who cared about face!? Being bold, attentive, shameless\u2026 those were keys to chasing girls!</p><br/><p>The single horned Ghost Demon Horse appeared, looking stronger and fiercer in the night, and Zhou Weiqing swiftly mounted it, chasing after Shangguan Fei\u2019er.</p><br/><p>All the way, Shangguan Fei\u2019er concentrated on galloping at top speed. Although Zhou Weiqing tried initiating conversation a few times, she ignored him, refusing to speak at all.</p><br/><p>Over two hundred li of traveling, but with the sheer speed of their Ghost Demon Horses, they soon neared the TianBei City. In the distance, they could see the bright lights of the northern camp. When they were about ten li from the main camp, Shangguan Fei\u2019er finally stopped, and Zhou Weiqing reined in his Ghost Demon Horse behind her. If they continued forward, they would be spotted by the guards on the watchtower.</p><br/><p>Both of them dismounted, and without speaking, they sent their Ghost Demon Horses back into their Spatial Rings as if with uncanny tacit agreement. Shangguan Fei\u2019er said in an exasperated tone: \u201cYou, shameless one, how are we getting across?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but say huffily: \u201cWhat do you mean Shameless One?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er gave a humph and said: \u201cThat\u2019s right, you are shameless indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cDon\u2019t you have wings? Carry me and fly us across, that would be the easiest way. Otherwise, it will be a trouble to cross the army camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCarry your head. Hmph, snatching you up is more like it.3\u201d As she said that, she released out her two God Tier Consolidated Wings, and before Zhou Weiqing could even react, she appeared behind him, grabbing him by the side and holding his entire body away from her. With a flap of her powerful wings and circulation of Heavenly Energy, she soared away in the night skies with Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>In such a position, as long as Zhou Weiqing did not try and reach out, he would not be able to touch Shangguan Fei\u2019er at all. However, suspended in midair in such a position, that was not a comfortable feeling at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cOei, beautiful lady, hold on steadily\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart raced fast. He had a slight fear of heights, and as the biting cold northern winds blew on him, and with suspended like that with no place to grab onto, that was indeed a horrible feeling for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t die. In truth, this young lady\u2019s greatest capability is not close combat, but aerial combat.\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s cold voice rang out from above.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn? Aerial combat?\u201d Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in surprise. \u201cAerial combat against who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said: \u201cOf course it\u2019s those people from the Heavenly Snow Mountain. In terms of individual power, the members of the Heavenly Snow Mountain are actually top notch amongst all the Great Saint Lands\u2026 that is because they are all not human, a group of top end Heavenly Beast who have cultivated to human form. As such, besides the ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master power, they are still able to resume their original forms to fight. One of their greatest advantages is their aerial combat superiority due to that. In fact, when the three great God Tier Masters custom designed this Legendary Set for my Duo Physical Jewels, their focus was aerial combat. This Legendary Set of mine is also named for that, the Illustrious Aerial Tyrant Set, and with its help, the three Great Masters hope that I can be a tyrant in the skies, to fight on equal terms with the Heavenly Snow Mountain in that area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cLooks like your aerial combat skills are indeed powerful. When we get back, show me a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er gave a cold humph and said: \u201cWhy should I show you? You don\u2019t have any wings of your own, can your Legendary Set let you fly? Hmmm\u2026 how about I show you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, okay, I\u2019m scared of you\u2026 I have Acrophobia!\u201d Zhou Weiqing said helplessly.</p><br/><p>By this point, Shangguan Fei\u2019er had already brought him soaring high in the air, at least five hundred metres above the ground. In the dark of the night, it was almost impossible to spot them. Even if they were spotted, what could be done about them? At such a distance, ordinary archers would not be able to reach them.</p><br/><p>A mischievous smile suddenly appeared over Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s face, and she thought to herself: I\u2019ll show you little scoundrel, making me all flustered, let me teach you a lesson! Once again, the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace had resurfaced.</p><br/><p>Abruptly, Zhou Weiqing felt his body turn upside down, starting to fall downwards, causing him to yell out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s calm voice, laced with a hint of mischief, rang out. \u201cI\u2019m showing you my aerial tyrant powers! Be careful! Here comes the \u201818 Dragon Shadow Roll\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, the twin wings behind her back underwent a strange change. Under the control of her will, the wings folded in abruptly, and with just a tiny movement, her entire person flipped over along with Zhou Weiqing. As they dropped down in a falling motion, they actually started spinning in a whirlwind fashion.</p><br/><p>At that point, Zhou Weiqing could not even differentiate where was the sky and the earth, feeling everything turn about around him at top speed, it was as if his heart was in his throat as his face turned ashen.</p><br/><p>The instant the eighteen \u2018rolls\u2019 were complete, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s wings spread apart at once, and they stopped in midair, levelling again in a perfectly executed, beautiful motion. Next, she lifted her head, pushing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body outwards once more before executing another ninety degree roll upwards before starting her rise back high into the sky once more.</p><br/><p>Although she was carrying someone, her movements were still unbelievably quick, and more so, steady, coordinated and agile. As for Zhou Weiqing, at this point he was almost scared senseless. They were after all at a height of several hundred metres up in the sky! Even with his cultivation level, if they were to drop from this point, he would still be smashed into bits. Despite the fact that in his heart he knew that with Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s control and skill, she would never let him fall, it was still nearly impossible for a person to control such a fear, especially since this was the first time he was being spun around in midair like that.</p><br/><p>In the end, Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not want to overdo it, and as she rose up in the air, she did so stably. \u201cNext time, see if you dare try to be funny with me again. In the future, I won\u2019t beat you up anymore\u2026 in front of your bunch of brothers, I must let you save some face. However, this midair game is so exciting and fun right! We can do that more instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not make any sound, or even move at all.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er was slightly startled, and said: \u201cHey, are you okay? You haven\u2019t been scared silly yet right? Or did you faint?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Still no sound, or movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty\u2026 Little Fatty!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s voice grew louder, and more urgent. He wouldn\u2019t be scared to death right?</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Shangguan Fei\u2019er suddenly felt Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body go through an abrupt change, starting to shudder violently, the tremors growing as a strange icy cold Evil aura reached her arms, causing her to shiver as well.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on? This time, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was shocked. Due to the cold, evil aura, she almost dropped Zhou Weiqing, but luckily she gritted her teeth and held on.</p><br/><p>At the same time, along with the icy cold evil aura, another burst of extreme heat suddenly burst forth in an instance. This time, Shangguan Fei\u2019er could not hold on, and in a shocked cry, her arms went numb, and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body fell from her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er accelerated at once, chasing after the falling Zhou Weiqing. At this point, they had barely passed the northern camp, and were still about seven hundred metres above the ground. One could just imagine what would happen if he were to fall right down from that height.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er had not been bragging or exaggerating about her aerial capabilities. In a matter of moments, she had already caught up with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s falling body. However, when she looked upon his face, she was given a big fright.</p><br/><p>Currently, the colour of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face was constantly changing. Suddenly bright red, then pale white, changing at a terrifying rate, almost once a second. His eyes were tightly shut, his fists gripped tightly as he continued shuddering violently in fits, as if in deep pain.</p><br/><p>How could this happen? What is going on? Pain and regret lanced through Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s heart, and she grabbed onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s clothes in an attempt to hold him without being invaded by the twin cold and heat auras. Alas, when she did so, his clothes actually evaporated into ash, dissipating into the sky.</p><br/><p>Indeed! Even Shangguan Fei\u2019er could not withstand that intense heat and cold\u2026 how could the ordinary army uniform he was wearing do so?</p><br/><p>Their falling speed was extremely fast, and by this point, they had already fell more than two hundred metres, and they were continually accelerating.</p><br/><p>Gritting her teeth down hard, Shangguan Fei\u2019er took a deep breath, and once again, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Ultimate Skill, Infinite Saint Flame, which she had used earlier in the day appeared around her once more. At the same time, she did not hesitate and hugged Zhou Weiqing.</p>\n</div>"}

Frankly, it\u2019s impossible for me to have absolutely no desire because I\u2019m a man after all. However, the moment I thought of you all, I immediately kept my hands to myself. On top of that, the Elven Queen is the highest and purest being in the Elf Tribe. How could she possibly let me do anything to her? I swear to God, if I really did something to the Elven Queen, all of you will stop loving me. This is terrible enough\u2026 Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they heard him saying this, even Shangguan Fei\u2019er who had been relentless in pursuing the issue, stopped the interrogation at once. She chuckled and said, \u201cAlright then, we\u2019ll trust you this time. Since you\u2019re so well-behaved, I\u2019ll reward you when we go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er added nonchalantly by the side, \u201cYeah, I can prove that the relationship between him and the Elven Queen is indeed pure. Although she also received the infusion of Saint Energy from Weiqing, that kind of infusion feels different from the type of infusion that we received after we did that. The infusion is merely superficial. On top of that, Weiqing\u2019s scent is not on the Queen at all. Because Weiqing and I cultivated the Saint Energy together, I can feel all of this with my senses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stunned, Zhou Weiqing looked at her, \u201cOh, darling! Why didn\u2019t you tell them earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er blinked her eyes innocently as she said, \u201cWell, they didn\u2019t ask me! Moreover, since you\u2019re such a playboy anyway, it\u2019s good if you\u2019re taught a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing was a little exasperated.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er instantly burst out laughing, \u201cWhat? Do you want to hit me now? Come on then!\u201d As she was saying these words, she even protruded her stomach towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright fine, you win!\u201d Exasperated, he looked at the five girls who were smirking happily, \u201cIt looks like I only have hard days ahead of me now. It\u2019s fine, just keep on joining hands and bully me together. Watch out though, I might run away one day, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare?\u201d The five girls said almost in unison.</p><br/><p>Due to his cultivation base being elevated again, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s speed in returning to the Heavenly Bow Empire with his five girls was even faster than when they first came. In just a few days time, they had already returned to the Heavenly Bow City.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya and Wu Yueyun were still in their closed-door cultivation with the help of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy. Ming Yu, on the other hand, had already returned to the frontline long ago. In this period of time, the Baida Empire was extremely peaceful but even then, nobody dared to lower their guard at all. After all, even if the Heavenly Bow Empire had already conquered and annexed the Kalise Empire, it still could not be compared to other orthodox power empires like the Baida Empire.</p><br/><p>The first thing Zhou Weiqing did was to pay a visit to both his godfather and real father. After he made sure that the Heavenly Bow Empire was safe, he proceeded to find Duan Tianlang.</p><br/><p>Now that he had brought back their most important ingredient \u2014 the Elven Queen\u2019s Blood, there was no doubt that his next step was to forge the eleventh piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set\u2019s Consolidated Equipment Scroll with Duan Tianlang. Zhou Weiqing had no idea how long it would take for them to complete it but one could easily imagine the difficulty it would bring forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Master, I\u2019m back.\u201d He knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you bring it back with you?\u201d Duan Tianlang\u2019s eager voice could be heard first before he appeared. The door opened and at once, his unshaven face appeared behind the door. The instance he saw Zhou Weiqing, he quickly pulled him into the room.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cOf course I\u2019ve brought it back with me. You asked me to do it personally. How can I possibly fail the mission that you\u2019ve given me? The Elf Tribe had even promised me that I have free access to their resources anytime I want from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang jeered at him, \u201cYeah, continue to brag, won\u2019t you? Hurry! Quickly show me that thing!\u201d The second he heard Zhou Weiqing had brought back the Elven Blood, Duan Tianlang immediately became very excited. His eyes were lit up brightly as he extended both of his hands out.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing passed the Elven Blood to Duan Tianlang as he asked, \u201cJunior Master, so how\u2019s the design blueprint now? And all the other materials as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang chuckled out loud, \u201cEverything is ready. I\u2019m only waiting for this baby that you brought back.\u201d Looking at the small green bottle that Zhou Weiqing passed to him, he turned and walked towards his work desk before pointing at the table in front of him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing walked forward to have a look and sure enough, the blueprint laid on the table was different from the previous one that he saw. Although the original design was also almost perfect, there were some places where the details were unrefined. However, now the blueprint in front of him was much more refined and elaborate.</p><br/><p>Usually, an ordinary person would be confused looking at such a complicated design, and they would barely be able to make out the lines on the blueprint. Yet, Zhou Weiqing was looking at it to the point that his eyes were shining with glee.</p><br/><p>A solemn look could be seen on Duan Tianlang\u2019s face as he held on tightly to the bottle that contained the Elven Queen\u2019s blood. \u201cWeiqing, everything\u2019s ready now. The only thing lacking is the final forging process. I have confidence in my experience but my cultivation base is not good enough. I\u2019ll need to have a cultivation base at the Heavenly Emperor Tier and above if I want to forge the last piece of the eleven-piece legendary armor set\u2019s Consolidated Equipment Scroll. For this reason, I can only instruct from the side and you\u2019ll need to complete the final step by yourself. This is a very long process and no interruption is allowed in between. You must be prepared!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Duan Tianlang and nodded his head earnestly, \u201cJunior Master, rest assured, I can control Time Reversal and can correct my mistakes in the past. Not only that, my cultivation base is elevated again after my trip to the Elf Tribe\u2019s land. I think it\u2019s most probably around the Maximum-Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier now. I\u2019ve faith that I won\u2019t disappoint you. However, Junior Master, you must promise me something. Once we\u2019ve completed the final piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set, you must take good care of your body and give me a chance to be filial to you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang smiled, \u201cYou silly boy. Do you think that I really want to die? Moreover, other than making the Consolidated Equipment Scroll, I still have another wish you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? What\u2019s that?\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked at him in surprise. In his eyes, other than making Consolidated Equipment Scrolls, Duan Tianlang did not seem to have any other hobby.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang continued, \u201cWell, the other wish of mine is to see you continue creating miracles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wham \u2014</p><br/><p>Instantly, a warm feeling showered Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Heat crept up in his eyes as tears threatened to fall down on the ground, \u201cJ-Junior Master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, get a grip on yourself. We\u2019re going to start now. Hand over the process of making the Consolidating Ink to me, and calm yourself down first. Make sure you adjust your body to its best state, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zhou Weiqing replied respectfully and sat down cross-legged in front of Duan Tianlang\u2019s work desk before he entered the cultivation state.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang walked to the other side and carefully took out a palm-sized earthen bowl. The bowl was fully transparent but was turquoise in color. This was the Imperial green glass-type emerald. It was also the purest high-grade emerald in the world. Not only did it represent the breath of life, it also had the highest prestige among all the gems. It was exactly material like this that could stabilize all of the other valuable ingredients to make the Consolidating Ink.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang\u2019s eyes were filled with emotions as he gently stroke the bowl in his hand. This earthen bowl had a beautiful name. It was called \u201cAqua Tide\u201d. Ever since he had gotten his hands on this treasure, there were not many occasions that were worthy for him to use this bowl. After he had become a God Tier Master, he had only used it a total of five times. Out of the five times, it was used twice to craft the final piece of Long Shiya\u2019s Hiltless Heavenly Purging Set and the tenth piece of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Ringless Ground Purging Set. The first five times he made Consolidating Ink with Aqua Tide brought him great success. The Consolidating Ink were of the highest quality and in turn, it helped in completing the crafting process of the scrolls.</p><br/><p>In Duan Tianlang\u2019s opinion, even if the previous five successful completions were added up together, they would still be unable to compare to the current one. The process of making this Consolidating Ink now was the most important to him in his entire life.</p><br/><p>All this while, Zhou Weiqing had always been very grateful towards Duan Tianlang. However, he did not know that Duan Tianlang was equally grateful for his existence, too. Duan Tianlang was a God Tier Master who had no equal in his time. He was the only God Tier Master who was a successor of the Strength Legacy. Even if he had a close relationship with Long Shiya, it was not to the point that he would help take care of Zhou Weiqing to such a degree. All these years, the reason he spared no pains in doing everything for him was because of Zhou Weiqing himself.</p><br/><p>First of all, Zhou Weiqing, who possessed the Strength Legacy, had the highest likelihood to become a God Tier Master. The situation had proved to be true since he had successfully become a true God Tier Master himself. At the same time, he even managed to help complete a few of Duan Tianlang\u2019s most important, unfulfilled wishes in his entire life.</p><br/><p>Just the existence of the Ringless Ground Purging Set itself was already enough to rekindle Duan Tianlang\u2019s passion and faith. The shocking and touching moments that he felt at that moment was so earth-shattering that it still remained strong in his heart till now.</p><br/><p>One could easily imagine how much it meant to the God Tier Master, who was peerless in his time, that he was able to help Zhou Weiqing create the Ringless Ground Purging Set, and he could see with his own eyes this set existing together at the same time with the Hiltless Heavenly Purging Set.</p><br/><p>If Zhou Weiqing had not shown up at all, Duan Tianlang might have already died working his entire heart out. It was Zhou Weiqing who gave him this second life. With the infusion of the Saint Energy, he finally had the ability to thrive at a higher level as a God Tier Master. He was personally involved in designing and making the legendary armor set that had a total of eleven pieces.</p><br/><p>In fact, Duan Tianlang only had a cultivation base at the Heavenly King Tier. Moreover, regardless of the circumstances, his Heavenly King-tier cultivation base could no longer rise to the Heavenly Emperor Tier. In reality, there had never been any record of a Heavenly King-tier Jewel Master who was able to create the eleventh piece of a legendary armor set. That was why this would absolutely be a miracle in this world. Duan Tianlang had no more regrets in his entire since he was able to achieve this miracle, complete the design blueprint and even personally forge this legendary armor set\u2019s Consolidated Equipment Scroll.</p><br/><p>He turned his head to look at Zhou Weiqing who was sitting by the side while he adjusted his state of mind. A determined look could be seen in his eyes. He only had one chance. There was only room for success, not failure!</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang shut his eyes and quickly entered a meditative state as he carefully lifted the Aqua Tide before him with his two hands. This was also one of the advantages that Saint Energy had brought him. He did not have to do much adjustment to enter his best state of mind in a short amount of time. Of course, this was not the case for his cultivation base state but his state of mind.</p><br/><p>Without warning, Duan Tianlang opened up his eyes wide and instantly, two determined lights gleamed in his eyes. He rubbed his hands together. His left hand was pushed inward while his right hand was pushed outward. With the rich silverish Spatial Heavenly Energy holding up the Aqua Tide in the air, a \u2018swoosh\u2019 could be heard as the Aqua Tide suddenly started spinning violently in mid-air. A turquoise light immediately spread out from the spinning bowl.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Furthermore, her health was clearly not in a good condition. Judging from the meridians that were entangled in her body, it was obvious that she had just recovered from severe injuries.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing cautiously injected Saint Energy into her body to aid her in her bodily system\u2019s regulation. Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to console her, the look in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes suddenly changed and he abruptly directed his gaze outwards.</p><br/><p>A red light shot towards them at lightning-speed like a shooting star aiming for the moon. When Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze turned cold, the ball of red light seemed like it crashed into a barrier. Its speed declined sharply before it came to a stop in front of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>It was a letter. The entire letter was a fiery red. However, within that fiery red was a ball of black flames that gave off a dominating aura that flowed amidst the evil.</p><br/><p>Because he was hugging Little Witch, Zhou Weiqing did not attend to the letter. However, his face darkened abruptly within a few moments.</p><br/><p>Little Witch could sense that something was wrong. When she lifted her head, she finally noticed the letter. Suddenly, she cried out in shock, \u201cThe Blood Red Hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since the Heavenly Demon Sect received the almost fatal blow from the Blood Red Hell, she had been like a frightened bird. For her to suddenly see a letter from the Blood Red Hell, how could she not be astonished?</p><br/><p>With a wave of his arm, the letter fell into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palm. The red background on top of the black flames was the symbol of the Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>When he opened the letter, there was only a single sentence on it. \u201cTomorrow noon. Final battle outside Heavenly Bow City. Otherwise, destruction of the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sentence might be brief but it carried with it a strong pressure and threat. Those few words were written in a very direct manner. Nobody could make Zhou Weiqing feel this way unless it was a Heavenly Jewel Master with an extremely powerful cultivation base.</p><br/><p>The light in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes brightened, \u201cThis came fast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch released her hold on Zhou Weiqing as traces of worry appeared in her eyes, \u201cWeiqing, it\u2019s all my fault that you\u2019re pulled in to this. I did not expect the Blood Red Hell to act this quickly. What should we do? We\u2019re not their opponents. They\u2019re aiming to destroy the city!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing hugged her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There\u2019s me. Who says that we\u2019re not their opponents? This is the Heavenly Bow Empire, not the Bai Da Empire. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Little Witch not be concerned? The Blood Red Hell had left a strong and lasting impression on her. She mumbled, \u201cWeiqing, you might not know this but the Blood Red Hell has a lot of powerhouses. Three Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses came during the attack on the Heavenly Demon Sect, It wouldn\u2019t have ended so tragically if that\u2019s not the case. Since they dare to come this time, they must be well prepared. We, we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled calmly and said, \u201cOf course I know they\u2019ll come well prepared. This is what they\u2019ve been working towards. Not only to annihilate the entire Heavenly Demon Sect, but also to crush the backbone of the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s forces at the same time. With this, there\u2019ll be no more forces in the west mainland that can restrain them. I must admit that their plans are well thought out. However, will they really win?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had long predicted that once the battle had reached a certain stage, the people from the Blood Red Hell would definitely show themselves. He just did not expect that they would make an appearance so soon.</p><br/><p>The arrival of the powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell had also made their intentions clear that the Dandun empire was seriously about to begin their advance on the Zhongtian Empire. Otherwise, they would not be in such a hurry to resolve the matters regarding the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, these powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell had chosen to uphold their dignity and stayed away from the military. If they did, the consequences would be much worse. From another perspective, it was also good if they came because the Blood Red Hell would not focus all their forces here. Although it was an opportunity for the Blood Red Hell to annihilate them, since things had progressed to this stage, it could be a chance for them to weaken the power of the Blood Red Hell as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing naturally had his own opinions. In the previous battle at the palace in Heavenly Bow City, he did not let any of the six the Blood Red Hell powerhouses escape. The main reason was to stop the Blood Red Hell from understanding the extent of their real power. \u2018Will it matter even if they know that I\u2019ve raised my cultivation to the Heavenly King Tier? Heavenly Kings are quite resilient. I think they\u2019ve yet to discover that they\u2019re already strong enough go against a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse,\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>When he thought about this, Zhou Weiqing said to Little Witch, \u201cYuehan, hurry up. We need to go after father-in-law. We have to draft out our plans. Since the people from the Blood Red Hell has arrived, there\u2019s no need for them to go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuehan could see the confidence in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes. Her emotions had also been influenced by him to a certain extent. She had also sensed that the boy who had been inferior to her back then had grown into a true powerhouse. The Saint Energy Zhou Weiqing had injected into her body also aided Yuehan in calming down. Nodding her head, she pulled his hand and led him out.</p><br/><p>It was no longer important whether the Heavenly Demon Sect changed its name or not. Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cLet\u2019s first focus on solving the current threats that the Blood Red Hell posed. If Heavenly Demon Sect survives this, everything is possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing really looked forward to this battle. The chances presented to each party were equal. If the Blood Red Hell managed to emerge victorious in this battle, the Blood Red Hell would not leave anyone alive. If Zhou Weiqing managed to win, he would be able to demonstrate his true powers in front of the powerhouses of the Heavenly Demon Sect. Under such circumstances, it would be much easier for him to establish it as one of the Saint Lands and take Heavenly Demon Sect under his wings.</p><br/><p>Within a day, in just a blink of an eye, as the sun rose to the center of the sky, it was already the time of the agreement.</p><br/><p>The weather today was exceptionally good. The sky was clear and no clouds could be seen. The Star Forest that initially appeared lifeless now bloomed with liveliness under the illumination of sunlight.</p><br/><p>However, amidst the forests, there was a discordant color.</p><br/><p>There were more than twenty people standing in silence. Each of them was wearing similar, fiery red armor that were in contrast to the verdant woods.</p><br/><p>These people were not young. The youngest looking one appeared to be in his forties or older. Among them, the ones standing in front were four old men who appeared to be at least in their eighties. Nevertheless, their age did not conceal their edge. The looks in their eyes were filled with immense killing intent.</p><br/><p>The others that stood behind them further emphasized the statuses of these four elders.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already noon. They really dare not come?\u201d One of the four old men said coldly.</p><br/><p>These four were the Four Elders of the Blood Red Hell. They resided in the Blood Red Hell all year long and seldom made appearances. However, they held extremely high ranks in the Blood Red Hell. Even the current Hell Lord of the Blood Red Hell was a rank lower than them.</p><br/><p>There were no doubts that these four possessed Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivation bases, and they were the pillars of strength for the Blood Red Hell. Several months ago, the ones who had led the assault on Heavenly Demon Sect were two of the four elders.</p><br/><p>The one who had spoken was Third Elder. Among the four, his temperament was the most volatile.</p><br/><p>First Elder said flatly, \u201cIf they dare to not show up, they better be prepared to receive our fury.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fourth Elder said, \u201cBig brother, are we really destroying the whole city? I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll invoke dissatisfaction from the Heavens\u2019 Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain. It\u2019s not yet time for us to lay all our cards on the table.\u201d</p><br/><p>First Elder\u2019s demeanor was nonchalant as he said, \u201cSo what if it\u2019s a showdown? Even if we don\u2019t attack, will the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace not do anything to us? Resolving the issues in the West first will allow us to place all our focus on dealing with the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Elder grunted and said, \u201cMeng Gui, that useless fellow. If it wasn\u2019t for him, we wouldn\u2019t have needed to come again. We don\u2019t even know if that useless man managed to escape or if he was killed. Outsiders like him are just unreliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>First Elder spared a glance at him, \u201cEnough. Just complete what we\u2019re supposed to do. Don\u2019t look down on this Heavenly Bow Empire. Meng Gui\u2019s cultivation isn\u2019t weak. He had the support of six Heavenly Kings and he was still defeated in this Heavenly Bow City. There must be some intrinsic power lying within the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Elder said in disdain, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter even if they have a foundation. Disregarding Heavenly Bow City, with the four of us present, we can even easily destroy the Fei Li Empire if we wanted to, let alone the Heavenly Bow City. I\u2019m afraid that Meng Gui\u2019s previous defeat has something to do with the Heavenly Demon Sect. It\u2019s not possible for him to deal with so many people with only the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor at his back.\u201d</p><br/><p>First Elder suddenly said, \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d While he was speaking, he raised his long fiery red eyebrows. He did not have to give any orders, and the twenty the Blood Red Hell powerhouses behind him instantly scattered away. However, they did not hold back from emanating their strong aura.</p><br/><p>Several silhouettes entered the sights of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses. There were three people walking in front. However, what surprised the Blood Red Hell powerhouses was that among the three, the one in the center was neither Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue nor Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya. Instead, it was a young man.</p><br/><p>This young man in black gears looked to be in his twenties. Judging from his appearance, he looked like an ordinary young adult who had just recently become a Heavenly Jewel Master. The Blood Red Hell powerhouses could not sense a threat from him.</p><br/><p>After them, there were six others who were dressed in all red. These six were the last remnants of the Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s forces. The six Heavenly King-tier powerhouses. Only a total of nine people came.</p><br/><p>On the Blood Red Hell\u2019s side, apart from the four Heavenly Emperors, not all of them were Heavenly King-tier powerhouses. There were eight Heavenly Kings and the rest were Heavenly Jewel Masters with cultivation bases of either nine jewels or eight jewels.</p><br/><p>Even though the Blood Red Hell had been accumulating their powers for a long time, it was not that easy to nurture a single Heavenly King-tier powerhouse. The obstacle that required a Heavenly King to possess a Heavenly Nucleus Core was simply too difficult to overcome.</p><br/><p>It was not like the Heavenly Demon Sect had no powerhouses of eight or nine jewels. However, none of them had appeared this time. Only the nine of them came.</p><br/><p>The facial expressions of the Four Elders of the Blood Red Hell looked bad. There were only nine people before them. \u2018What does this mean? Does it imply that they\u2019re looking down on us? Or perhaps, the followers of the Heavenly Demon Sect have escaped?\u2019 they wondered.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

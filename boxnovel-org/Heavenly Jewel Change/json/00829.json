However, if the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley still had any opportunities remaining, it would be in the battle between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian had to defeat Zhou Weiqing, and he needed to defeat him before the Elven Empress defeated the two dragons. Only then would it be possible for this battle to continue.</p><br/><p>Fortunately for the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley, their strongest advantage was the ancestral powerhouses they revived, most of whom were not self-aware. Therefore, even after the war was no longer in their favor, these powerhouses would still fight desperately.</p><br/><p>The Demon God silently looked at the Destruction God. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s voice calmly rang in the air, \u201cFen Tian. Surrender. You no longer have a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian\u2019s cold voice was vicious. \u201cThe victory is not yet final. How can you be so sure that I won\u2019t have a chance? Zhou Weiqing, you underestimate the Blood Red Hell. Huang Xingyun may have been rubbish. However, I, Fen Tian, was destined to become the master of this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing asked, \u201cFen Tian. You seem to be so obsessed with this, even until this day. I can never understand you. Is power really so important to you? Isn\u2019t your life comfortable enough in the lands under the Blood Red Hell rule as a Saint Land?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian then replied, \u201cZhou Weiqing. You\u2019re still young and won\u2019t understand. In this world, it\u2019s either rule or be ruled. What do you think the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands is? The winner of the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands is essentially the ruler of this world. Why does the most fertile land on the mainland belong to the Zhongtian Empire? If it wasn\u2019t due to the Heavenly Expanse Palace winning the championship at the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands successively several times, do you think the other countries would agree? If the Heavenly Expanse Palace could do it, why can\u2019t the Red Blood Hell do it? Power is a desire. A supreme desire. It\u2019s my life\u2019s goal to rule the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a flash of light in the Demon God\u2019s demonic eyes. Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to say, \u201cIn that case, there\u2019s nothing left for us to say to each other. Let\u2019s determine the winner by virtue of strength. Ignoring the fact that you may not defeat me, even if you do, the ultimate winner of today\u2019s battle won\u2019t be you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Destruction God shook his head. \u201cZhou Weiqing, I have already said this before. You still underestimate me. I wouldn\u2019t have come here today without absolute confidence. I\u2019ve been preparing for this moment for ten; no, twenty years! Destruction will always be destruction. How can your power of creation stop me? Let me just show you, what true destruction really means.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, the Destruction God slowly raised his arms. The heavy sword in his hand disappeared. He then clasped his heart with both hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d For some reason, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt anxious. He became especially vigilant when he looked at Fen Tian. Zhou Weiqing was actually very depressed now. Originally, he thought that his cultivation had already reached the peak of the Heavenly Emperor Tier. It should only be a minute away from the Heavenly God Tier, and he should be have been able to use the Sword of the Demon God. However, he had already tried it several times before. He could not deploy the Demon God\u2019s sword at all.</p><br/><p>He once used the Sword of the Demon God to defeat the Elven Empress and ger twelve Elven Elders. Although they were not as strong then as they were now, it was still a Heavenly God coupled with twelve Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses at that time! If Zhou Weiqing could use the Sword of the Demon God again, he was seventy percent certain that he could get rid of Fen Tian.</p><br/><p>A gray Qi spread out from within the body of the Demon God. His right leg kicked out like a bolt of lightning, and a gray blade of light broke out, flying toward the Destruction God. Zhou Weiqing was testing the water, as he did not know what Fen Tian was going do at the time.</p><br/><p>The Destruction God saw the attack coming from the Demon God. However, the look in his eyes did not change in the least bit. It was as if it did not see the Demon God\u2019s movements at all.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that the pattern of the large black crab on the chest of the Destruction God lit up. It turned from black to a bright purple. A dazzling halo of purple light then spread out.</p><br/><p>Hummmm.</p><br/><p>A strange scene unfolded. The blade of light was kicked out by the Demon God, and silently turned into nothing when it arrived about a hundred meters from the Destruction God. Not even energy ripple remained.</p><br/><p>\u2018What happened?\u2019 With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s sharp perception, he immediately discovered that the Destruction God\u2019s energy had undergone tremendous changes.</p><br/><p>The originally powerful Destruction Energy had been concentrated. It was as though all the Destruction Energy had undergone a thorough change. In every available space, the Destruction Energy was vibrating at a terrifying speed. This made it even more powerful. Moreover, the Destruction Energy was now incredible condensed, making it feel as though the Destruction God had completely transformed into a black hole.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fen Tian was already at the peak of the Heavenly God Tier. The Destruction God he transformed into was still evolving. How did he do it?\u2019 Zhou Weiqing was full of questions but he could not wait.</p><br/><p>The Demon God spread out his arms on both sides of his body. His whole body shook forcefully. Numerous gray balls of light shot out from the body of the Demon God. Each gray ball of light contained energy with multiple attributes.</p><br/><p>This was the Dark Demon God Thunder. However, it was not the original Demon God Thunder. When Zhou Weiqing summoned the Demon God, he made full use of all of his attributes. He relied on the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation to create this new version of the Demon God Thunder by fusing the six attributes together in an orderly manner. It could be said that any one of the balls of light from the Demon God Thunder could make a Heavenly King-tier powerhouse freeze in shock, in absolute amazement. Moreover, thousands of them appeared at the same time. Its power could only be imagined.</p><br/><p>The terrifying Demon God\u2019s Thunder shot to the sky instantly. It then swiftly headed for the Destruction God. But Zhou Weiqing controlled the Demon God and remained still because the Destruction God floating before him continued to give Zhou Weiqing a sense of peril. It seemed as if a disaster would befall him the very moment he got close.</p><br/><p>This time, there was finally a roar. It was as though there were a thousand thunders cracking in the air. Thunder rolled and the sky turned bright. Time, space, darkness, wind, thunder, and evil created a moving melody, albeit a destructive one.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was confident that with such an attack, even a regular Heavenly God-tier powerhouse would suffer heavy damage. Moreover, his current objective was to interrupt whatever Fen Tian was doing.</p><br/><p>The horrifying fluctuation of energy severely distorted the space around them. Zhou Weiqing could no longer see the appearance of the Destruction God clearly. Surprisingly, he was still able to see the bright glowing light from the purple crab.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, it is futile. Since you forced me to do this, All of you will die. Here, today, right now. Except for me, there would be no one else left alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian\u2019s voice seemed to have changed. It was filled with an unexplainable depth, as if he had transformed into a bottomless abyss.</p><br/><p>The violent energy fluctuation gradually calmed down. The Destruction God still hovered in the sky. However, the bright purple crab that was originally imprinted on his chest had flown out and floated before Fen Tian.</p><br/><p>The Destruction God\u2019s body was already large enough. However, when this bright purple light spread out, it was three times larger than that.</p><br/><p>At this moment, it no longer showed a bright purple light. Instead, the center was dark like a black hole, surrounded by a bright purple and misty light.</p><br/><p>It was pure Destruction Energy. Zhou Weiqing turned pale with shock because he could clearly feel that the Destruction Energy emanating from the silhouette of the large crab had already surpassed his Nebula Saint Energy in purity. This meant that this was the first time ever since he possessed the Saint Energy, that he encountered a person with a purer Destruction Energy than his Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fen Tian still has something like this up his sleeves?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that the Destruction God made a move that Zhou Weiqing could not understand. It kneeled down mid-air, on both knees as it faced and worshipped the large crab.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Lord. Please, give me strength.\u201d Fen Tian\u2019s voice reverberated through the air. At the same time, the purple radiance shrouded the Destruction God\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing wanted to attack again but alas, he suddenly heard the voice of the Elven Empress in his mind. \u201cIt\u2019s useless. He has tapped into the power of the Netherworld. Although I don\u2019t know how he did it, the intensity of energy around the body of the Destruction God is already equal to one you\u2019d find in the Netherworld.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was aghast as he asked, \u201cThen, what should we do? The Netherworld\u2019s power is probably not confined to the powers of a Heavenly God. How are we going to deal with this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress then said, \u201cRest assured. He can only borrow the energy from the Netherworld. However, he cannot directly control the energy for an attacks. It\u2019s similar to you, only being able to create the projection of the Demon God but it isn\u2019t the real deal. If I\u2019m not mistaken, he should be using the energy from the Netherworld to enhance his own strength, and his cultivation base will ascend to a greater height soon. As for how much he\u2019ll be able to improve himself, I can\u2019t determine. However, since he\u2019s only a Netherworld servant, it\u2019ll be impossible for his cultivation to ever be able to compare to the Netherworld. On top of that, the Nether Lord is extremely greedy. It must\u2019ve cost Fen Tian a hefty price to borrow his energy. All we can do now is wait. Once the outer layer of the Netherworld\u2019s energy disappears, your attack will become effective. You should quickly cultivate to the next level now, or we won\u2019t have a chance at all.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

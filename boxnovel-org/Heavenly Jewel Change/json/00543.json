Since Zhou Weiqing was not around, she wanted to head back to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to talk to Bing\u2019er first, before returning to look for Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Before she left, this mischievous Little Demon Girl had schemed a trap for her own sister\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, I am going back now, but I am still worried about the Peerless Battalion. Anyway, no one can recognize the difference between you and me. As long as you do not use your Consolidated Equipment, you\u2019ll be exactly the same as me. Those Peerless Battalion fellows, without me to keep them in their places, who knows what they will end up doing? You take my place for now to suppress them and help train them ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, also\u2026 Little Fatty is such a playboy, you help me look after him. Don\u2019t let me bring back another few more women. Big sis, help me please. For mine and Bing\u2019er\u2019s sake, you must keep watch on Little Fatty. Ok?\u201d Just like that, after countless wheedling and begging, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had finally agreed to take her position after she left. Just like Shangguan Fei\u2019er had predicted, no one recognized her after that, especially since the close combat training of the Peerless Battalion was already on the right track, and Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s cultivation level was even above Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s, naturally they would not have any issues in that area. As such, in this period of time, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had slowly eased into her sister\u2019s position without any problems.</p><br/><p>Today, when Shangguan Xue\u2019er saw Zhou Weiqing bringing Tian\u2019er back, how could she not furious? This little bastard had already seduced her two sisters, and was still going after other women?! Even though she had seen Tian\u2019er in her \u2018Fat Cat\u2019 form before, she had never seen Tian\u2019er before. As such, she had not been able to resist in calling Zhou Weiqing out. In her original plan, she would beat him up savagely first before informing him of her identity, and getting him to dump Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Who knew that the heavens would play such a huge joke on her. Zhou Weiqing had truly taken her for Shangguan Fei\u2019er, and with her Acupuncture Point suppressed, she had not been able to resist\u2026 and the events had played out as such.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stood there staring at Shangguan Xue\u2019er dazed, unable to even say a word. All his plans and shameless ideas for Shangguan Fei\u2019er had suddenly turned into being against Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2026 and that was a whole different matter!</p><br/><p>Oh Heavens! What had he done!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s outer clothes had been thrown to the side by him, and she did not have much covering her any longer; even her pants were halfway down.</p><br/><p>The heavens were falling, and the earth was sinking. That was his own sister in law!</p><br/><p>No matter how intelligent and cunning Zhou Weiqing was, faced with such a scenario, he was totally at a loss. Having almost committed such an evil act, he wished that the earth would open up and swallow him whole. If Bing\u2019er or Fei\u2019er knew about this, he would truly be a goner!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er remained sobbing bitterly on the ground, even forgetting to wear her clothes. From young, she had always been the most hardworking, the most disciplined, as she knew the responsibilities that weighed down on her young shoulders. In the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, she was the First Young Miss, above all. Let alone anyone daring to violate her, most people would not even dare to look at her in the eye. Even Zhan LingTian, who had feelings for her, would keep some distance when he spoke to her.</p><br/><p>Previously, when Shangguan Xue\u2019er had lost her first kiss to Zhou Weiqing by accident, she had already been in much pain and suffering. However, for the sake of her little sister, she had forced herself to tolerate it. However, that hate in her heart for Zhou Weiqing for stealing away her first kiss had never disappeared, thus holding that grudge in her heart all this time.</p><br/><p>Yet, just right now, Zhou Weiqing had actually even done far worse to her, doing all sorts of intimate things to her forcefully. Currently, the only thing left in Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s confused heart was utter sorrow.</p><br/><p>The two just remained there, one standing there at a loss, the other crying her eyes out.</p><br/><p>At last, it was Zhou Weiqing who recovered first. The situation had already occurred, and it was no point in trying to avoid it. No matter what, he would have to face it. Carefully, he walked to the side and picked up Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s clothes, carefully covering her with them. Bracing himself, he said softly: \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I really did not know it was you, I thought it was Fei\u2019er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about\u2026 how about\u2026 you beat me up. Will that make you feel better? I will not fight back at all, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a sudden swoosh, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s head abruptly lifted, her eyes that were red from crying were filled with flames of hatred. Her teeth gritting hard, she had already charged forward in a flash. An intense killing intent burst forth like a sharp blade from a sheath. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d Her eyes were bloodshot, and with a single palm strike to the chest, Zhou Weiqing flew all the way out.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had kept his word, allowing her palm to strike hard on his chest without any resistance, and he was instantly sent flying back.</p><br/><p>The powerful defensive capabilities of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation saved his life here; luckily he had been in that state all this while.</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s palm struck his chest, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body glowed in a purple light. If Shangguan Xue\u2019er had been in a calmer state, she would have instantly sensed that her blow was scattered by the purple light, as if the strength behind the blow was separated to every inch of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. As such, though it seemed like he had been savagely blown away by that palm strike, Zhou Weiqing was actually not injured at all.</p><br/><p>The defensive capabilities of the Dragon race could be said to be top notch even amongst all Heavenly God Tier Heavenly Beasts, and they themselves were considered one of the strongest amongst all their peers. Furthermore, the Dragon-Tiger Transformation was not just the sole Dragon bloodline alone, but with the power of the Dark Demon God Tiger behind as well. With Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s seven-Jeweled cultivation level, her palm strike wasn\u2019t able to actually hurt Zhou Weiqing, even if he did not defend himself, and could only cause his chest to hurt.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing crashed onto the ground, skidding back almost a dozen yards before he came to a stop. At that moment, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s killing intent finally locked down upon him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart gripped in shock. She was really trying to kill him! If Shangguan Xue\u2019er was going to beat him up, he would allow her to do so without any question, even if he was severely injured. After all, he was the one in the wrong! However, if she wanted to take his life, he couldn\u2019t possibly lay his life down just like that!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s body was like a gust of icy cold wind, and as Zhou Weiqing was struck back by her palm, she flew forward in chase. In midair, her entire body suddenly burst forth with a brilliant dark-gold light. The three chi long snow-white sword that Zhou Weiqing had once seen before appeared in her hands, pointing right towards his chest.</p><br/><p>Even though he was still in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, even with that snow white blade only just pointing at his chest, Zhou Weiqing felt a slight sensation of pain.</p><br/><p>The blade in Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s hands was the Boundless Infinitum Sword from the Boundless Infinitum Set. In the world today, the Boundless Infinitum Set was currently the only Legendary Set that consisted of eleven pieces, known as the God Set. It was also the greatest treasure of the entire Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2026 how could it be ordinary?</p><br/><p>Currently, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s eyes were covered with a film of blood red. Any pure and innocent girl who met such a huge shame and humiliation, how could one remain calm?</p><br/><p>A snowy white light flashed through the skies, drawing a beautiful arc that raced right towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart. In that instant, Zhou Weiqing could only sense that the distance between him and Shangguan Xue\u2019er seemed to warp strangely. Even with his powerful senses, he was actually unable to sense which area Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s Heavenly Energy was targeting and locked on to.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the white light had reached Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest area.</p><br/><p>A lean to the side, a sidestep, a Blink Skill. Only then did Zhou Weiqing escape instantly. At the same time, two triangles of bright light appeared on each of his hands, as he quickly released his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation.</p><br/><p>He had no choice but to do so! Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s cultivation level was higher than his, not just at simply a seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, but already at the maximum of the seven-Jeweled stage, barely a thread away from reaching the eight-Jeweled stage. More importantly, with the Boundless Infinitum Set\u2019s terrifying pressure, Zhou Weiqing could sense that without using the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, he would not be able to even survive. However, even at the same time as he used his Blink Skill, his heart relaxed slightly inwardly. That was because the position that the white light had been about to strike at his heart, but at the last split second before he blinked he sensed it move to the side very very slightly. It was only a slight movement, barely even noticeable, but if it had landed on him, it was the difference between a fatal wound and a severe wound. That was to say, although Shangguan Xue\u2019er was in a berserk rage, she still held a thread of sanity, perhaps not willing to actually kill him off.</p><br/><p>Having her blow dodged by Zhou Weiqing and seeing the glow of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation appearing below his feet, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s face grew even frostier. Six more bouts of dark gold light appeared, and in the cover of the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, the magnificent looking Boundless Infinitum Set appeared around her.</p><br/><p>The pieces of the Boundless Infinitum Set that Shangguan Xue\u2019er currently had were the two shoulder pauldrons, chestplate, girdle and belt, war kilt, and greaves for her right leg. Just like any Legendary Set which had not been completed, her current Boundless Infinitum Set items were still dark-gold in colour, but the tattoos and inscriptions around them were one of the most beautiful that Zhou Weiqing had seen from any God Tier Consolidated Equipment or Legendary Sets.</p><br/><p>The tattoos and inscriptions around the Boundless Infinitum Set items were like beautiful Cloud Dragon Tattoos, surreal and even ethereal. From the surface of the armour, these Cloud Dragon Tattoos seemed to come to life, like many little cloud dragons twirling around Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s body.</p>\n</div>"}

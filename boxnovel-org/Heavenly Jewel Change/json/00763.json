She did not have the extremely pure Saint Energy like Tian\u2019er, hence she needed some time. Zhou Weiqing brought the three ladies down from the sky and he let out a long sigh after they descended to the ground. He held Tian\u2019er tightly in his arms and kissed her softly on her forehead. If Tian\u2019er did not get to him in time, he would have been badly injured even if he did not die. As soon as something went wrong with his soul, no matter how miraculous his Saint Energy was, it could have resulted in death for him. Although the Star Reflection was good, it also had to be used at the right time!</p><br/><p>Although the upgrade was successful, Zhou Weiqing was exhausted at the moment. It might seem like he had everything under control in the battle today. However, the reality was he had expended a lot of effort. He could not afford to make any mistakes or else it would be disastrous. Especially in the beginning, if he did not bait them by surrendering as a whole, it would have been impossible for him to get the opportunity to fight one-on-one with the people from Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue approached him together. Long Shiya\u2019s eyes were sparkling when he looked at his beloved disciple. He could not be more satisfied with him. Wu Yunyue smiled and bowed slightly to Zhou Weiqing, \u201cWeiqing, thank you very much. I agree with the suggestion that you mentioned earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing forced out a smile and said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s talk about it when we get back. I need to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three ladies around him felt sorry when they saw how exhausted he was. Shangguan Xue\u2019er looked at Shangguan Fei\u2019er and said, \u201cGo back with Tian\u2019er. We\u2019ll stay here to look after third sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhou Weiqing nodded to them. At that moment, he felt like he could not open his eyes at all. The energy drain and the upgrade overwhelmed and exhausted him. All he wanted to do at that moment was to get a good sleep.</p><br/><p>When he got back to the Heavenly Bow City, Zhou Weiqing fell asleep almost as soon as he went into his room. He slept for a day and a night. The Heavenly Bow Empire went to work immediately. They locked down all information regarding the battle earlier so that Blood Red Hell would only receive the news at a later time. At the same time, Shangguan Xue\u2019er personally wrote a letter to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to inform them about what happened. However, it was hard to guess what Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s priorities were because she neglected to inform them of the most important news; Zhou Weiqing had broken through to the Heavenly Emperor Tier. Perhaps she had subconsciously treated him like family ever since he had helped in alleviating her stress.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s breakthrough was still ongoing. It had not ended even after Zhou Weiqing</p><br/><p>had woken up from his sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat felt so good.\u201d Zhou Weiqing woke up from his sleep and stretched his body with all his might.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, that\u2019s not right.\u201d He hid his aura instinctively and looked at his surroundings. Tian\u2019er who was lying next to him was woken up by his actions. She could not help but burst out laughing when she looked at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur bedroom might turn into ashes if you continue stretching a little longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Zhou Weiqing had just entered the Heavenly Emperor Tier, he had yet to have control over his aura. The simple act of him stretching had caused a rampage in the Atmospheric Energy where massive amounts of Atmospheric Energy rushed towards him. If he did not stop in time, the building might have collapsed directly from the overly rich and dense Atmospheric Energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing pulled Tian\u2019er who was laughing into his embrace softly. \u201cThank you, Tian\u2019er. If it wasn\u2019t for you the other day, perhaps\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er rolled her eyes with annoyance, \u201cDo we need to thank each other? Just don\u2019t leave me behind next time when you head out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing then placed his hand carefully on Tian\u2019er\u2019s tummy, \u201cIs our child really alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er nodded and placed her hand on top of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s. There was a motherly glow on her beautiful face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only is our child fine, it\u2019s a lot more active than before. It didn\u2019t move at all previously but now it\u2019ll move occasionally. What\u2019s with the Saint Energy the other day? How did our child release such a pure energy? It seems like it\u2019s even purer than your Saint Energy after upgrading to the Heavenly Emperor Tier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing forced out a smile and said, \u201cI\u2019ve no idea but I\u2019m sure if I can trade my Saint Energy with an energy so pure, I\u2019ll definitely surpass a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. I\u2019ve always thought that I\u2019m talented but it seems like there\u2019s a huge gap between me and our child! This little fellow is already so powerful even before it\u2019s even born. Won\u2019t it surpass my ability once it\u2019s born?\u201d</p><br/><p>The both of them looked at each other, feeling confused. They found it hard to believe that a child that was just born would possess an ability that was beyond that of a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. However, the extremely pure Saint Energy it gave off could not be simulated. Zhou Weiqing knew even his father-in-law, the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain, pure energy that the child released seemingly out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lay down with Tian\u2019er in his embrace. He started touching her as he lowered his head next to her ear and said, \u201cMy dear, I want to go inside and see our child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so naughty\u2026\u201d Tian\u2019er was so shy that her face turned red.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful. Look, none of you accompanied me these past few days. I\u2019ve been miserable! Come here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint scent of arousal was released into the air. A pregnant woman could get sexually aroused as well, in fact sometimes even more than a normal woman. Zhou Weiqing took her gently as the scent of arousal filled the entire room.</p><br/><p>In the Heavenly Bow Empire Admiral meeting room, Zhou Weiqing instructed someone to get the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue to see him. The most important battle had ended so it was time to settle the other matter. Besides, that was also the main reason why Zhou Weiqing came back this time. What he said to Di Feng Ling was not a joke, it was his goal.</p><br/><p>Although the Heavenly Bow Empire now possessed a powerful army, it was still a small country after all and the foundation was not deep enough. Zhou Weiqing was not greedy but he sure hoped that his homeland could grow. It was absolute, like how greatness was dependent on one\u2019s ability. If the Heavenly Bow Empire could have a Saint Land of its own, who would dare to casually invade in the future? Not only that, Zhou Weiqing wanted to build places like a Storing Palace and a Consolidated Pavilion in the Heavenly Bow Empire. Perhaps it would not instantly attract many Heavenly Jewel Masters here. However, it was crucial for a country\u2019s development.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue was all smiles as he walked into the room and said to Zhou Weiqing, \u201cWeiqing, you\u2019ve gotten your rest? I hope all is well with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cMy rest wasn\u2019t bad or I wouldn\u2019t have invited you here so soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The truth was Wu Yunyue had long noticed that Zhou Weiqing was up when he released a wave of Heavenly Emperor-tier energy as he woke up. This kid took almost four hours to get here, how was that considered soon?</p><br/><p>Naturally, Wu Yunyue did not expose him. To him, this Zhou Weiqing kid had his share of flaws, being promiscuous in particular. However, in this world, every powerhouse had a companion from the opposite sex with them. It was the same in the Heavenly Beast world. The more powerful a Heavenly Beast was, the more companions it would have. Zhou Weiqing was undoubtedly powerful. Wu Yunyue would have found it strange if he only had one woman.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue instantly cut to the chase as he said, \u201cWeiqing, I\u2019ve told you the other day that I agreed with your suggestion. Ever since we\u2019ve defeated the Blood Red Hell, I\u2019ve discussed this with everyone. Everyone agreed to you taking over our Heavenly Demon Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cSir, you\u2019re too kind. If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s naturally no problem on my side. Regarding the new name of our Heavenly Demon Sect, do you have any suggestions on what we should change it to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue smiled even wider when he heard Zhou Weiqing said the word \u2018our\u2019. He had given up on managing the Heavenly Demon Sect, why would he still bother with the matter of who should rename it?</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master, it\u2019s better if you come up with the name. However, I\u2019d love to be the Deputy Sect Master! Hehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled secretly. It made sense that this sly fox still could not relinquish all of his power.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it before. I started off by depending on the Peerless Unit. It was then renamed as the Peerless Regiment. Although Physical Jewel Masters occupy most of the Peerless Regiment, the Peerless Unit is made up of Jewel Masters. Since we\u2019ve decided to merge the Heavenly Demon Sect, let\u2019s just call it Peerless Sect. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeerless Sect?\u201d Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue sighed secretly. He knew that as soon as he gave his consent, the Heavenly Demon Sect would be history. However, he had no other choice now. He could at least keep some of his dignity and preserve the Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s legacy if he collaborated with Zhou Weiqing. If he gave this collaboration up, the other Saint Lands might not show mercy to the Heavenly Demon Sect and Blood Red Hell might attack them.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was calm as he watched the Demonic Emperor struggle with his emotions. Nobody would be happy to have a Saint Land of an entire generation change its name.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather-in-law, there\u2019s another matter that I need to discuss with you. Yuehan had given her body to me so I\u2019ll definitely take responsibility for that. Besides, I like her very much. All of my wives come from Saint Lands so I can\u2019t be taking sides. This is my plan. It won\u2019t be long until the next Saint Land competition. I\u2019m planning to organize my wedding directly after the competition and marry all of them. They\u2019ll all be on equal standing. There won\u2019t be a ranking system and the matter of who comes first. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

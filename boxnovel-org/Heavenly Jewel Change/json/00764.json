Yes! This young man was his son-in-law after all. What more could he ask for since the heir of the Heavenly Demon Sect would be his grandchildren if he passed the sect down to Zhou Weiqing? Besides, even though this young man\u2019s future was unpredictable, he was sure that as long as Zhou Weiqing was alive, he would definitely surpass the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain one day and would need his guidance.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s all set then. My child Yuehan has her heart set on you since the beginning. Weiqing, please treat her well. I\u2019ll call you by your name in private but in public, I\u2019ll address you as Sect Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cThen our Peerless Sect shall be established today. Dear father-in-law, I know you feel sorry because this is something you\u2019ve built throughout your life. I can guarantee that you won\u2019t regret the decision that you made today. Very soon in the future, the Peerless Sect will definitely become the most powerful in the Boundless Mainland. It would truly be the No.1 Saint Land.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue\u2019s body shivered slightly and there was a sparkle in his eyes. He nodded to Zhou Weiqing and said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for that day to come. I\u2019ll get Ming Yu to pass you the name list of the members who survived. From now on, they\u2019re all your subordinates.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, father-in-law, for fulfilling my wish.\u201d Zhou Weiqing then bowed at Wu Yunyue.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue stood up and left after nodding at him. He needed time to heal the wound in his heart. It was a tough decision for him to make but he strongly believed that his decision was right. At least among the Saint Lands, he was the only one who merged with Zhou Weiqing. Perhaps since his daughter would only come after the rest of his wives, his sincerity was incomparable to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain. Perhaps things would prove itself in the Saint Land competition that was happening soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe discussion is over?\u201d Long Shiya\u2019s magnetic voice sounded. His plump body appeared in the room in a flash.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Zhou Weiqing greeted his teacher. He helped Long Shiya to the main seat as he chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it that I feel that your smile is very cunning!\u201d Long Shiya teased.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled again, \u201cHow is it even cunning? Even if it is, I learned it from you! I\u2019m your disciple after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya said in an annoyed voice \u201cOh please, I didn\u2019t teach you this. Your mischievous behavior was taught by Mu En. I\u2019m considered kind because I didn\u2019t teach him a lesson. Though I must admit, your father has a broad vision. Although you bastards are always doing embarrassing things, at least your survival skills will grow even stronger. Tell me, what do you need from me. Stop smiling at me like that. I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing switched to a playful expression, \u201cMaster, you know me so well! Actually, it\u2019s nothing much. It\u2019s just that I think you\u2019re not young anymore. It\u2019s not good for you to wander around. I\u2019ll need to plan for your retirement as your disciple! Why don\u2019t you stay here? Don\u2019t leave anymore. I\u2019ll do my best to get my wives to give birth to some children to entertain you. What do you think of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya burst out laughing and said, \u201cOh, please. Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know what your plans are. You want me to support you in the Peerless Sect now that you\u2019ve gotten the Demonic Emperor to hand the sect over to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing pretended to be shocked, \u201cMaster, can you predict the future? However, I don\u2019t expect you to manage the sect for me! All I want is to be filial. Please give me this chance. Moreover, what\u2019s mine is yours as well. As long as you\u2019re willing, you\u2019ll naturally be the Peerless Sect Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft, please. Aren\u2019t you taking away my freedom by asking me to be the Sect Master? I won\u2019t, and I don\u2019t want to do it. I\u2019ve been enjoying freedom all my life. Why would I work for you, you little bastard? Especially when I\u2019m already so old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya rolled his eyes and ignored Zhou Weiqing\u2019s begging. He knew this kid too well so he did not want to fall into his trap. The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was a free bird. Almost all of the Saint Lands had invited him but none had piqued his interest. Moreover, his disciple had matured now. He did not think he would be able to help even if he stayed. However, he was interested in the retirement plan that Zhou Weiqing mentioned. After all, he was not young anymore. Even though Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy had rejuvenated him, his mentality was no longer young.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at his master and suddenly turned ferocious, \u201cMaster, please don\u2019t force me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya was stunned to see such an expression on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face that seemingly came out of nowhere. He scoffed and teased, \u201cStop pretending. So what if I\u2019m forcing you? I\u2019ll still force you no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re forcing me to perform my ultimate move!\u201d Zhou Weiqing was enraged.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya then looked at him in shock, \u201cWhat kind of ultimate move can you perform to make me obey you? Please show me! I\u2019d love to see it. I don\u2019t believe anyone can threaten me. No one has been able to threaten me all my life. Bastard, could you be the exception?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing then put away the rage on his face and sighed, \u201cAlright then, seems like you\u2019re better than me. In that case, forget about it. I was planning to have one of my children take your family name Long and give it to you as your grandchild. But\u2026 since you\u2019re unwilling to stay, I think I won\u2019t be able to be filial to you. You can leave if you want to. Since you want your freedom, as your disciple it\u2019s not nice for me to stop you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds about right.\u201d Long Shiya smiled gleefully. Suddenly, his face turned stiff. He turned around and grabbed Zhou Weiqing who was about to leave, \u201cWait, wait a minute. What did you say just now? What grandchild and grandfather. I didn\u2019t hear you clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>His head was clouded with happiness since he thought there was no way that Zhou Weiqing could threaten him. He did not pay attention to what Zhou Weiqing was saying, and now he was stunned when he recalled what Zhou Weiqing said.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled happily and said, \u201cNothing, nothing. Since you\u2019re leaving, it doesn\u2019t matter if I tell you or not. It\u2019s alright if you didn\u2019t hear me. I still have things to do, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, how dare you mess around with me? Tell me now, or don\u2019t you dare blame me for hurting you. Hmph.\u201d Long Shiya showed him his plump fist. Naturally, even he himself did not think it was threatening. That aside, it was possible that he could not even handle Zhou Weiqing with his current cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing turned around and faced his master. This time, he put away the smile on his face and kneeled before Long Shiya. He then said with utmost sincerity, \u201cMaster, I really hope that you\u2019ll stay. It\u2019s not that I want you to support the Peerless Sect. You\u2019re over 100 years old now and you\u2019ve been a wanderer all your life. I wish to give you a home, please stay. It\u2019s safe to say that without you, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve what I\u2019ve achieved. You only have disciples but not children. I\u2019m your son, and my children will be your grandchildren. Please stay so that I can serve you. You don\u2019t need to do anything. All you have to do is enjoy your life. I\u2019ll have one of my sons bear your family name. He\u2019ll be your grandson and inherit your family name. Can I do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya looked at Zhou Weiqing blankly. Naturally, he could feel that Zhou Weiqing was being sincere at the moment. He placed one of his hands on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shoulder. Zhou Weiqing was shocked to find that Long Shiya\u2019s hand was trembling despite his cultivation base. He then looked up at him immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya looked at him with tears in his eyes. His lips were trembling but no words were coming out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you\u2019re scaring me!\u201d Zhou Weiqing got closer to him and patted Long Shiya\u2019s chest immediately as he carefully infused Saint Energy into his body.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya shook his head, \u201cWeiqing, you\u2019re not just saying that to make me happy right? Are you being serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not know if he should laugh or cry as he said, \u201cMaster, since when am I so mean? I\u2019m being serious. How can I be joking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya said in annoyance, \u201cYou looked sincere when you were cheating the people from Blood Red Hell the other day and they were fooled by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you compare yourself to them! Master, I\u2019m really not joking with you. All I want is to serve you until you\u2019re old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya lifted both his hands and grabbed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shoulders tightly. Tears were streaming down his face, \u201cThank you, boy. It\u2019s been almost 90 years since I last felt like I was at home. My old life shall depend on you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was over the moon, and he gave Long Shiya a big hug.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya seemed to have calmed down and he said after wiping his tears, \u201cGo, your Junior Master Duan is looking for you. You\u2019re now a Heavenly Emperor. Finish the last Ringless Ground Purging Set as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Master is looking for me?\u201d Zhou Weiqing let go and looked at Long Shiya who had calmed down and immediately said, \u201cMaster, then I shall leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The respect Zhou Weiqing had for Duan Tianlang was not any less than the respect he had for his master. He did not dare to delay when he heard that his Junior Master Duan was looking for him since it was rare for his Junior Master to look for him. Long Shiya waved, motioning for him to leave. Zhou Weiqing turned around and heard an indescribable chuckle behind him as he stepped out of the door, \u201cHahaha, hahaha, finally I\u2019ll have grandchildren. I have an heir now. Hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was stunned when he heard the sound but soon after, he revealed a genuine smile. He knew his master too well. Although Long Shiya desired to be free, not having a family and love had always been his biggest regret. As a disciple, it was only natural that Zhou Weiqing would ease the regret for his master! How could lack children when he had five wives? Moreover, even if the son bore the Long family name, he would still be Zhou Weiqing\u2019s son.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

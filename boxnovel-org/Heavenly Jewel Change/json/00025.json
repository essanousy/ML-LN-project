Do you know why I did so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er shook her head in confusion.</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou continued saying: \u201c That\u2019s because, the army camp is the best place to temper a person, since you chose to be a soldier, then everything needs to start from within the army camp. Only when you\u2019ve experienced everything for yourself, when you\u2019ve seen true bloodshed, seen soldiers\u2019 lives pass before your eyes, then can the future you know your path, know what you are working towards. Your resignation, I accept it. In the future, if and when you return to the army camp, you will resume your commission as Battalion Commander. At that time, I believe that you will not tell me the two words \u2018I resign\u2019 again.</p><br/><p>After he said that, Admiral Zhou returned to the commander\u2019s chair and sat down, saying with a solemn voice: \u201cShangguan Bing\u2019er, your orders are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er knelt down on a single knee: \u201cThis subordinate is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou said: \u201cPermission granted for Shangguan Bing\u2019er to be relieved of her duties as the 5th Regiment, 3rd Battalion Commander. The Battalion Commander position will be taken over by Xiao Se. Tomorrow morning, Shangguan Bing\u2019er will return to the Heavenly Bow City, and you will report to the Heavenly Bow Unit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the 3 words \u2018Heavenly Bow Unit\u2019, Shangguan Bing\u2019er noticeably trembled a little. When she once again lifted her head towards Admiral Zhou, her beautiful eyes showed an unrestrained joy. Admiral Zhou said with profound meaning hidden in his eyes: \u201cThe Heavenly Bow Unit is an even better place to temper a person. This time, there is no more backing down. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes full of excitement, even fervour, Shangguan Bing\u2019er said: \u201cI understand. Thank you Admiral, for giving me this opportunity. No matter what price I have to pay, I will do my best to become a true member of the Heavenly Bow Unit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou nodded and said: \u201cVery good. Return to pack your things then, you will leave tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d With a respectful agreement, Shangguan Bing\u2019er stood up, glancing to docile and submissive Zhou Weiqing kneeling down at the side, before walking out of the tent.</p><br/><p>As soon as Shangguan Bing\u2019er left the tent, Admiral Zhou\u2019s face turned black, even blacker than the bottom of a pan. Looking at Gao Shen and Qian Zhan Tian at the side, he said: \u201cBoth of you can head off now. Without my permission, no one is allowed to interrupt me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two officers were considered some of the highest ranking military officers in the whole Heavenly Bow army, but they did not hesitate at all in obeying Admiral Zhou\u2019s orders, bowing respectfully and heading out instantly. At this moment, there were only three people left in the tent, Admiral Zhou, Zhou Weiqing and Xiao Ru Se.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn little brat, come over here!\u201d Admiral Zhou shouted angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrh.\u201d Zhou Weiqing stood up and walked forth with a gloomy face, and as he passed by Xiao Ru Se, he shot her a quick glare.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ru Se gave a helpless shrug. <i>Little Wei, in the army, knowing information and not reporting upwards is a huge and serious crime. If Uncle Zhou didn\u2019t come, I\u2019d still be able to hide it, but since he came personally, if I didn\u2019t tell him the truth and something happened to you in the future, how could I possibly face him?</i></p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to say something, Admiral Zhou\u2019s foot came flying over without warning. *BANG*, Zhou Weiqing was knocked back 5 metres, rolling on the ground before lying down there.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ru Se\u2019s jaw dropped in shock; although she knew that Admiral Zhou had a fiery temper, but she did not expect that he would be able to be so ruthless towards his son.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d Admiral Zhou\u2019s eyes showed a tinge of surprise. When he had kicked Zhou Weiqing, at the point of impact, his foot had felt a soft, supple and flexible strength shifting most of the impact away.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lay down on the ground, weeping [1. Our Oscar winner strikes again!] as he said: \u201cDad, I\u2019m wrong! After all, I\u2019m your only son, for mom\u2019s sake, can you hit lighter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou said coldly: \u201cYou still know your mom? She\u2019s almost angered to death by you. Stop acting and get up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t dare keep acting in front of his father, and immediately vaulted up, causing the Wind Hat on his head to drop down. With a wronged look upon his face, he stole a quick glance at his father. That appearance, it was as if he was a mere punching bag; coupled with his honest, sad face, even Xiao Ru Se\u2019s heart ached upon looking at the scene.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Xiao Ru Se had seen Admiral Zhou lecturing Zhou Weiqing, and she thought to herself: <i>This father and son pair are sure a match for each other, the father kicking the son 5 metres away, yet Little Wei is still totally fine.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDad, give me a chance to explain! This time it\u2019s really not my fault!\u201d As Zhou Weiqing said that, he sidled closer to Xiao Ru Se. If his father tried to hit him again, he would run over to her side!</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou gestured to the floor in front of him: \u201cCome over here, kneel down and give your explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said with a woebegone expression: \u201cDad, in front of Ru Se Elder Sis, can\u2019t you save me some face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou rolled his eyes and glared at him again: \u201cFace? You still want face? Do you believe that your Father, I, will hit your face instead? Hmph. Let me tell you, you little brat, your father, I, have a stomach full of pent up anger now, if you\u2019re going to talk some rubbish, I\u2019ll beat you up until your mom doesn\u2019t even recognize you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was also used to being beaten, and had no choice but to kneel down, thinking to himself: <i>If you beat me up until my mom doesn\u2019t recognize you, she\u2019ll beat you down!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what happened was as follows. That day, I went to the Stars Forest to take a nice bath. That\u2019s the usual spot I bathe in. Who knows that I would bump into the princess who also happened to take a bath there! It was really a coincidence! That Difuya was just too arrogant and obstinate, and she totally did not listen to my explanation, and used her Elemental Jewel to attack me, you almost lost your son then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you just ran like that?\u201d Admiral Zhou said coldly. In truth, Difuya had already told the truth about what happened that day, as she knew how serious things were and didn\u2019t dare hide anything. As such, he had already known what happened. If not for the fact that Zhou Weiqing wasn\u2019t in the wrong, it wouldn\u2019t have been a single foot greeting him just now. With Admiral Zhou\u2019s temper, he would have already beaten Zhou Weiqing into a true Zhou Little Fatty. No. Perhaps he would be swollen into a Zhou Big Fatty. [2. Lol, I really cracked up here. I know it sounds kinda awkward in English, but that\u2019s pretty much the literal translation]</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said aggrievedly: \u201cHow could I not run? Who knows what Difuya would say when she went back, if she blamed me instead, with your temper, wouldn\u2019t you have broken my leg? For the sake of your future grandson, I decided to save my life first, so I decided to go out and forge a name for myself first. When I returned, wouldn\u2019t that be a proud thing for you to see? I just happened to see the recruitment, and so I signed up to join the army.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at his father, he thought to himself: <i>Looks like Ru Se Elder Sis did not fully tell on me. Dad doesn\u2019t know about my Heavenly Jewel Awakening yet. Heh heh.</i></p><br/><p>Listening to his son\u2019s explanation, Admiral Zhou\u2019s expression eased up a little. He knew his own temper, and in truth, if Difuya had turned the tables and lied about what happened, he probably wouldn\u2019t have easily forgiven Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, tell me, since you entered the 3rd Battalion, what name have you forged for yourself?\u201d Admiral Zhou said passively. Before Zhou Weiqing could even open his mouth, Xiao Ru Se who was standing at the side quickly replied: \u201cUncle Zhou, Little Wei\u2019s performance has been exemplary. Not only did he win the most outstanding recruit award in the Fresh Recruit Tournament and got himself the rank of Squad Leader, but he also was appointed personally by Commander Shangguan to be her Personal Aide. Furthermore, in the earlier ambush when Commander Shangguan was being attacked, it was his arrows that reversed the situation on the battlefield and saved her life. If we just talked about his credit on the battlefield, he can be promoted to a Company Leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ru Se\u2019s words made Admiral Zhou\u2019s expression ease up and look much better, and he said warmly: \u201cRu Se, are you praising this little brat too much? How can I not know his standards, how could Bing\u2019er need saving from him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ru Se smiled faintly and said: \u201cUncle Zhou, I\u2019d better let Little Wei tell you himself. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. A scholar who has been away three days must be looked at with new eyes. [3. That\u2019s the literal translation of \uff0c, basically as the words suggest, it means a momentous change in someone you\u2019ve parted with for a while] The Little Wei now is no longer the same Little Wei as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Admiral Zhou looked suspiciously at his son. He totally did not consider the fact that Zhou Weiqing might become a Heavenly Jewel Master, after all he knew his son\u2019s condition very well. With his meridians being blocked, there was no possibility of him cultivating Heavenly Energy. Admiral Zhou had spent many years trying out various methods, putting much time and energy into attempting to change that fact, but even with his mid level Zong Stage cultivation level, he had not been able to do anything about his son\u2019s meridians. By now, he had already lost hope about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak, what\u2019s that about?\u201d Admiral Zhou said coldly as he looked as his son.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhou Weiqing straightened his back and stood up tall, thinking to himself: <i>Heh heh, I can finally stand up proudly in front of dad. </i>Grinning, he said: \u201cDad, your son is now a Heavenly Jewel Master!\u201d As he said that, the little rascal pulled back his sleeves and revealed both his wrists. Manipulating his Heavenly Energy, the Icy Jade Physical Jewel and the Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye Elemental Jewel simultaneously appeared around his wrists and started revolving.</p><br/><p>Looking at the Heavenly Jewels surrounding Zhou Weiqing\u2019s wrist, Admiral Zhou started. The next instant, his face turned black and he shouted out: \u201cYou scoundrel!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhou Weiqing was rather startled by the scolding as he thought to himself: <i>What\u2019s going on? I\u2019m already a Heavenly Jewel Master and he\u2019s still scolding me?</i></p><br/><p>You little\u2026 how dare you pretend to be a Heavenly Jewel Master to try and deceive me and escape punishment? Furthermore, you still pretended to be a Blue Cat\u2019s Eye Jewel, don\u2019t you know how to act properly? Hmph, making your Father, I, happy for a minute, wait till I beat you to death!\u201d As he said that, Admiral Zhou took a step forward and his hand whistled towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>In truth, it was not surprising that he did not believe Zhou Weiqing. After all, preconceived ideas have a strong hold on people, and for him, someone who had suffered and tried everything for more than ten years in order to try and fix his son\u2019s meridians and failing to do so, it was a rather sore spot for him. As such, he had instantly thought Zhou Weiqing was lying. Furthermore, it was now in the day, and the blue Cat\u2019s Eye Jewel that showed was extremely unique; naturally he would not think of such a rare gem like the Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye.</p><br/><p>As his furious palm came hurtling down, it was indeed an a scary amount of strength thrown in a moment of anger. However, it was after all his son, and halfway through, before it reached him, he had managed to change the course of it, targeting Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shoulder instead. If not, once that palm hit his face, Zhou Weiqing would become Zhou 'Toothless'.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuu Wuu\u201d, an angry cry sounded out, and a cute little white head perked out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s leather armor, baring its little fangs at Admiral Zhou. Of course, Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t stand there to take the blow this time, and with a *swoosh* sound, his right leg tapped the ground and his body leapt back a few metres, dodging the blow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

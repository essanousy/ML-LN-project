Such a massive gathering of power, even if they were to take on the Terror Sea Dragon head-on, though they would never be able to win, they would be able to hold it off for some time. Furthermore, they had spent so much time and resources preparing for this moment, using many precious treasures\u2026 all of it for this instant, the chance to finish off the Terror Sea Dragon.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Terror Sea Dragon was sent flying back into the ocean waters. Alas, as it dove deep into the waters, they were no longer the same as before.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The pitch black ocean waters was no longer translucent at all, and as soon as it was immersed into the waters, the Terror Sea Dragon could clearly sense its own body being enveloped by a massive amount of Tenebrous energies. The pressure that gave it a suffocating feel was instantly pushing at it from all directions. Originally, the surroundings had been full of water attribute energies, but they had now vanished totally. Instead, the surrounding waters seemed to have totally become liquid formed from Tenebrous Attribute energies.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Without Water Attribute energies, without the support of the ocean, how could the massive Ocean Cage continue holding the Tenebrous Demon Dragon?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHahahaha, bet you never imagined this right? Although we knew it would be impossible to lure you to the shores just like the previous time, we still have this method. Now, in the\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tenebrous Sealing Formation, how much of your power can you actually use?\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Tenebrous Demon Dragon laughed smugly. The Terror Sea Dragon had finally fallen for their trap, the painstaking efforts they had gone through had indeed pain off. This\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tenebrous Sealing Formation formed by so many powerhouses, even if the Tenebrous Demon Dragon wasn\u2019t within as well, it would take the Terror Sea Dragon quite some effort to break out of it.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The effect of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation was formidable indeed, with the thick Tenebrous Attribute energies within causing the\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s power to greatly increase. As the saying goes, as one waxes, the other wanes. The original inferior position had been reversed to a vastly superior one now.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">*hwalala* The sound of water falling rang out as the massive body of the Terror Sea Dragon burst out of the ocean waters. In that instant, its entire body seemed to become transparent, somehow turning into a bluish crystalline state. This was its method of pushing its cultivation to the maximum. With its Heavenly God state of power, even without the aid of the ocean, its power was not to be underestimated. At the same time, a unparalleled loud and resonant dragon cry resounded from its throat.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">To the surprise of all the Xuantian powerhouses, although it was in a tight corner, the Terror Sea Dragon did not seem panicked at all.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Tenebrous Sealing Formation might be able to trap its body, to block out all of the Water Attribute energies, causing it to be filled with Tenebrous energies\u2026 but it was unable to block out its penetrating voice.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cNo good! Quick, take action now, we need to kill him now! I\u2019m afraid he has a companion!\u201d Even hidden behind her mask, Dreamwake\u2019s expression changed. With her intelligence, how could she not see through what was going on?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Even when driven to such a tight corner, the Terror Sea Dragon did not seem worried or anxious, instead giving out such a resounding cry. The only explanation that made sense could only be that. Furthermore, its companion was definitely of high cultivation as well, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t remain so calm.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake were emphatically connected, and with a thick mass of Tenebrous Attribute energies, they charged towards the Terror Sea Dragon like a flash of lightning.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At such levels of power, many Skills had already lost their meaning. Their powerful bodies could even withstand some Heavenly God Tier Skills without too much issues. Only by using their Personal Fusion Skills to launch attacks could they actually deal serious injuries to their opponents.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">*PENG*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once again, the two massive bodies slammed savagely into each other in midair.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Tenebrous Sealing Formation\u2019s effect was definitely strong indeed, and the previously arrogant and all-powerful Terror Sea Dragon was actually sent flying back this time. The\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear in Dreamwake\u2019s hands directly left a row of holes on its body.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, the life force of a Dragon was just too strong. Despite its injuries, it gave off a furious roar before launching a flurry of crazed attacks at both the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A Heavenly God Tier powerhouse was a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse after all! With the Terror Sea Dragon going berserk and going all out in a desperate fight, even though the Tenebrous Sealing Formation giving the two of them an absolute advantage, both Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon could not possibly kill it in such a short period of time. Naturally, with this advantage, given enough time they could easily drag it to death. Without replenishment from atmospheric energies, its berserk fighting style would never be able to last for a long period of time. Alas, since it had chosen this method of fighting, it definitely had no fear and was likely emboldened by its incoming companion! No matter Dreamwake, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, or the other Xuantian powerhouses, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a vague sense of unease.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The power fluctuations in the Tenebrous Sealing Formation was extremely violent, and each exchange of blows caused a strong shockwave that resulted in the twelve pillars of black light also shuddering.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the end, it was Zhou Weiqing who was entirely outside of the formation that was now the most comfortable. With the separation of the entire Tenebrous Sealing Formation, he was not even the slightest affected.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Once again, he flew out from the ocean waters. At last, he had the feeling of watching two tigers fight from a hilltop.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Although the Terror Sea Dragon was pitting its life in a desperate fight, it was clearly much weaker in the Tenebrous Sealing Formation. Zhou Weiqing could only watch on helplessly. It looked like it would not be able to last too long.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The most critical issue was the\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear in Dreamwake\u2019s hand. It was just too powerful, and every time it struck out, it would leave an injury on the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s body. What kind of level had its offensive power reached? Zhou Weiqing could not even begin to imagine it, but he knew that if this continued for much longer, the Terror Sea Dragon would definitely die. That was to say.. Perhaps he might not even get to see the Spatial Teleportation Gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt his soul pulse strongly in warning. Subconsciously, he looked into the distance, and as soon as he did so, he drew a cold breath as goosebumps appeared all over his body, his hair standing on end.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Far in the distance at the horizon, a clear, eye-catching \u2018shoreline\u2019 was speeding towards their direction. When he looked closer, Zhou Weiqing realised that was not any shoreline, but an immense wave that seemed to reach the skies! Outside of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, his senses were once again heightened to the max, and he could clearly feel a terrifying pressure appear once more. Although it was slightly weaker as compared to the first appearance of the Terror Sea Dragon, since there also wasn\u2019t the Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s aura to help counter it, Zhou Weiqing felt as if the new, powerful aura was pressuring so hard that he could barely breathe.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If it were any other time, even if it was today before he witnessed the fight, perhaps Zhou Weiqing\u2019s judgement would be slightly inaccurate. However, having just witnessed the clash between the Heavenly God Tier powerhouses, which had left such a deep impression on him, how could he forget?!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Heavenly God Tier! That pressure was actually from another Heavenly God Tier powerhouse! How\u2026 how could this be?!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Alas, the facts spoke for themselves. In this world, never deem anything impossible. That massive wave that soared to the skies was indeed speeding towards them at a nearly impossible rate.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Since Zhou Weiqing had seen it, naturally those within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation had also seen it.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cDamn. What is going on?! How could there be another Terror Sea Dragon?\u201d The Tenebrous Demon Dragon howled in both shock and anger. Another resounding explosion, as his huge tail flung out, slamming into the trapped Terror Sea Dragon once more, causing it to be slammed into the barrier of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation again.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHahahaha! You all never imagined this right? Today will mark all of your death anniversaries. Did you really think I was so foolish to make the same mistakes as my father? Since he fell to you contemptible humans and your trickeries in the past, This Dragon has naturally made preparations. If not for the fact I was waiting for my little brother to also reach the Heavenly God Stage, would I have waited until now? Although he has only just reached this stage, and hasn\u2019t properly stabilized it fully, it is more than enough to take care of you all. Your rubbish formation might be difficult to break out of, but if it is attacked from outside\u2026? Hahaha, you are all dead!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Terror Sea Dragon snarled hysterically, its berserk state growing instead of receding. Although it would sustain great injuries and hurt its primordial qi, as long as it could endure until the incoming Terror Sea Dragon reached them and destroyed the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, with the combined might of the two of them, none of those present, not even the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, would be able to survive.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, this trapped Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s judgement was extremely accurate. The Tenebrous Sealing Formation was targeted towards those trapped within, and even a Heavenly God powerhouse would not be able to break free so easily. However, if one attacked from outside\u2026 the situation would be vastly different.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In order to greatly increase the internal defenses, the majority of the power of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation was naturally focused within. Once an external attack came, it would be much easier to injure those who were made out the structure of the formation. If that other Terror Sea Dragon really reached them, all of them would definitely die. Without the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, the trapped one would even recover its full power; even though it was already injured, both Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon had expended a lot of energy to deal those injuries. The end result would be a single Heavenly God powerhouse against two\u2026 Naturally, let alone defeating them, even surviving would be an issue unless they made use of the\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Spatial Teleportation Gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The mantis stalking the cicada, alas unaware of the oriole behind. This Terror Sea Dragon actually had its own cunning scheme! Despite all their preparations, the Xuantian powerhouses were now facing the awkward situation of their possible incoming deaths!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">If those two Terror Sea Dragons really succeeded, then the highest power in all of the Xuantian Continent would be destroyed in one fell swoop. Just like what the Terror Sea Dragon said earlier; if that really happened, even if they were Ocean Heavenly Beasts, they could still conquer the entire Xuantian Continent easily. After all, they were still Heavenly Gods!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How fast could a Heavenly God powerhouse move? In just the short period of time, the Terror Sea Dragon in the distance had already closed half the gap. If not for the fact that it had been hiding its aura and not wanting the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and the other Xuantian Palace powerhouses to discover it, and if it chose to hide much closer, perhaps they would already be facing their deaths right now.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Dreamwake gritted her teeth as she continued attacking in unison with the Tenebrous Demon Dragon. At the same time, she asked it: \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Tenebrous Demon Dragon was currently feeling slightly panicked. Although it had lived for more than ten thousand years, it still did not wish to die now!</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

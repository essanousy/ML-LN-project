The other members of the Fei Li Battle Team also had ugly expressions on their faces. Just a moment ago, they had all been celebrating together, filled with brotherly emotions and happiness for their achievements together. Yet, just a short moment later, Zhou Weiqing had suffered such a nigh-fatal blow.</p><br/><p>In a white flash, Fat Cat warped into Tian\u2019er, softly standing by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side. She received him from Lin TianAo\u2019s hands, embracing him fully.</p><br/><p>Normally, if this happened, Zhou Weiqing would be unbelievably delighted, definitely seizing the opportunity to take advantage of her. However, the current him was staring ahead with empty eyes, as if zombified and devoid of will, and he did not even attempt to move at all, letting Tian\u2019er hold him limply.</p><br/><p>At such a time, no one knew how to comfort him. His homeland had been invaded and destroyed, an entire Empire. Friends, family\u2026 even the land which he had grown up in was now the property of its invader\u2019s. Such a massive blow, it wasn\u2019t something that could be easily recovered from.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er supported Zhou Weiqing back to his room. Regarding her identity, the other members of the Fei Li Battle Team knew only a little, but no one would ask more questions at this time. In their hearts, Tian\u2019er was at least much more acceptable than Little Witch; after all, she had been following beside Zhou Weiqing since they met him.</p><br/><p>Helping Zhou Weiqing to sit on the bed, Tian\u2019er rested his head on her bosom. At this time, she did not have any thoughts of steering clear or avoiding him, allowing him to rest on her bountiful chest, as if trying to use her warmth to comfort his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, at such a time, you must be strong. Shangguan Xue\u2019er is right, you are the last hope of the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not make any sound, but the tears in his eyes slowly stopped, and the glaze behind his eyes slowly disappeared as his vision consolidated once more. However, his eyes seemed totally different from the past now; no longer was there that spirited and cheerful light, just a cold resolution.</p><br/><p>Sitting up slowly, Zhou Weiqing took a few deep breaths, calming down his body\u2019s trembling. He turned to Tian\u2019er and said: \u201cCould you go out for a while, I just need to be quiet and alone for a short while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er hesitated a moment, before standing up. Hugging his head, she gave him a light kiss on his forehead before turning and walking out, closing the door behind her. She believed that her Weiqing would definitely be able to pull himself together.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Zhou Weiqing sat there, silent, unmoving. It was as if he had become a statue. Although he did not enter the Demonic Change State, in the dark room, his eyes were clearly bloodshot.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In Lin TianAo\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo looked at the rest of the team, then said softly: \u201cNo matter what Weiqing decides, I will go together with him. If the rest of you have any other plans, you should leave now. I will not blame you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody knew what Zhou Weiqing would decide upon doing; if he made up his mind to return to the Heavenly Bow Empire, then it would definitely be entering the dragon\u2019s den, a hazardous, almost suicidal mission indeed. As such, Lin TianAo spoke those words. If they wished, for them to leave before Zhou Weiqing made such a decision.</p><br/><p>Drunken Bao said angrily: \u201cBoss, what kind of people do you treat us as?! At such a time, it is even more important for us to be by Weiqing\u2019s side. Hmph. Even such an impossible task as the Heavenly Jewel Tournament championship, we have accomplished it, what else is there to be afraid of?! What kind of bullshit is this Bai Da Empire, Your Father, I, have long since wanted to look for trouble with them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Little Four both nodded their heads in agreement. Crow furrowed her brow and said: \u201cIt looks like I will have to delay looking for my fiance for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Paopao said: \u201cI will not be joining you guys, adding just me alone won\u2019t make a difference. I will head back to the Fei Li Empire immediately; my father is the Premier, and if we can launch an attack from the Fei Li Empire towards the Bai Da Empire, that will be the greatest help to Weiqing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo nodded and said: \u201cThat is a good choice. Paopao, you return to the Fei Li Empire then, at least find out everything you can about the Heavenly Bow Empire, especially what happened to Weiqing\u2019s family. As long as they are still alive, then we have a chance to rescue them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Paopao nodded and said: \u201cThere is no time to waste then, I will leave immediately. I will do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he immediately packed up and left the Heavenly Jewel Island. After all, though it was difficult to enter the Heavenly Jewel Island, there was no restrictions on leaving at any time.</p><br/><p>Ye Paopao had left swiftly, but the next day was was a slow torturous one for the rest of the team. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s room remained silent, and though they tried several times to go see him, they were stopped by Tian\u2019er who was standing outside the door. The current Zhou Weiqing needed time alone, quiet.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next morning, when Zhou Weiqing appeared in front of them again, it gave them a shock. Just from appearance alone, he did not seem very different, but those blood red eyes and pale skin was indeed terrifying. It was clear that he had not slept in that whole day and night.</p><br/><p>In truth, not only did Zhou Weiqing not sleep at all, during the whole time he had sat there unmoving. He was only seventeen years old this year, but now he suddenly looked as if he had aged and matured, as if he were the same age as Drunken Bao or Little Four.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, no matter what you decide to do, we have already decided to follow you\u2026\u201d Lin TianAo stepped forward, giving Zhou Weiqing a big hug.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing also clapped him on the back and said: \u201cEveryone, do not worry. I am alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drunken Bao waved his fist in the air and said: \u201cWeiqing, in that case, let\u2019s charge to the Heavenly Bow Empire and kill all those Bai Da Empire bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>To everyone\u2019s surprise, Zhou Weiqing shook his head. The current him was cold and calm, almost to a terrifying degree.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we will not return to the Heavenly Bow Empire. We need to stay in the Heavenly Jewel Island for a short while more. I estimate\u2026 at least ten days to a month, then we shall return to the Fei Li Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words left the entire Fei Li Battle Team confused.</p><br/><p>Returning to the Fei Li Empire, they could understand it. Without question, that was the best thing to do at this moment. Heading to the Fei Li Empire as a base of operations before deciding their next step was definitely better than charging into the Heavenly Bow Empire without a plan and virtually committing suicide. However, the wait was what confused them all.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cYou all do not need to worry about me, just stay here for a while. I will be gone for a time; when I return, we can leave for the Fei Li Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he vanished in a flash, leaving the inn swiftly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is he going?\u201d Drunken Bao asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo furrowed his brow, shaking his head to signal that he was also not sure.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s voice rang out: \u201cHe should be heading to the Heavenly Jewel Island\u2019s Skill Storing Palace. If my guess isn\u2019t wrong, he should be trying to bring his cultivation level to the fourth Jewel stage, to power up as much as possible before leaving the Heavenly Jewel Island. I do not know what he was thinking about yesterday, but I am sure that he must have thought things through clearly and planned ahead about the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, Tian\u2019er\u2019s guess was not wrong. Zhou Weiqing was currently in the Skill Storing Palace, once again choosing Heavenly Beasts with the Darkness and Demonic Attributes, using the Devour Skill to cultivate as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>Previously, when he had accompanied the three Masters and was watching and learning as they created the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for the thirty seven days, he had also been cultivating. After all, his Immortal Deity Technique did not require him to specially cultivate and would automatically continue improving due to the energy whirlpools. This was especially so in an environment like the Heavenly Jewel Island, with its intense and thick atmospheric energy.</p><br/><p>As such, although Zhou Weiqing had broken through to the fifteenth stage of the Heavenly Energy not long ago, but he had already stabilized and improved, and he believed that he was not too far from the sixteenth level. Furthermore, under such an external stimulation, his training regiment was far different from anything he had done previously.</p><br/><p>No moderation. No control. Just a near insane-level of frenetic cultivation.</p><br/><p>Every time he used the Devour Skill, it was as if Zhou Weiqing was a devil, squeezing the most out of his body. He would absorb Heavenly Energy to his limits, and beyond, pushing himself far and above what was humanly possible. Furthermore, he spent most of that time in the Demonic Change State, pushing his boundaries in all manner, before finally sitting down to cultivate and absorb the energy.</p><br/><p>He did not sleep, did not rest, and did not eat, only taking tiny breaks to sip water for survival. The current him was using the methodology of the three-thousand tempering in Devouring and cultivating his Heavenly Energy!</p><br/><p>The Devour Skill was undoubtedly powerful, but such a method of cultivation was a massive toll on the body. Luckily, he had already broken through fifteen Death Acupuncture Points, and the fifteen energy whirlpools could help him sustain himself and help relieve the pressure. Furthermore, his body had already gone through evolving twice, and his physique was definitely much stronger, tougher and flexible than it had ever been. As such, even despite this almost suicidal method of pushing his limits, he barely managed to survive.</p><br/><p>The pain and agony from the body was one matter, but the more important thing was the changes in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s psyche. If previously one were to describe him as a cunning, wily but cheerful person, then the current him seemed to be growing colder and colder as he went through this training.</p><br/><p>His Demonic Change State was indeed controllable, but spending so much time in such a state, and especially so with such a sleepless, restless and almost self-harming training schedule, plus the continued usage of the Devour Skill, caused Zhou Weiqing to start having a cold aura about his disposition, the killing intent surrounding him increasing daily.</p><br/><p>During this period, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had gotten news of what he was doing and came to see him once, and she had since reported it to her uncle, Shangguan Tianyang. However, Shangguan Tianyang did not send anyone to stop Zhou Weiqing. The reason was simple, the current Zhou Weiqing needed some way to vent, to release stress. This method might be harmful to his body and psyche, but if he did not vent in such a manner, perhaps he might do something even worse.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er even asked Shangguan Tianyang whether or not they should tell Shangguan Bing\u2019er about the matter. Without question, allowing Bing\u2019er to speak to and comfort Zhou Weiqing was the best solution.</p><br/><p>However, Shangguan Tianyang overruled her suggestion, telling her: As a man, there are some things that one has to face and overcome by himself, only then can he truly grow up. Having Bing\u2019er comfort him is only the easy way out, not the best way.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Zhou Weiqing did not eat for almost twenty three days, with only some clear water to sustain himself, cultivating with all his might without sleep or rest, until the day came he could breakthrough his next Death Acupuncture Point\u2026</p><br/><p>Zen: Damn, you know Zhou Weiqing is in a bad state when he can\u2019t even take advantage of Tian\u2019er in his usual perverted self!

At this point, none of them had any mood to play around any longer, their faces bleak and serious. Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense the heart of the flames was extremely close, the sheer amount of energy bursting forth was just so terrifying.</p><br/><p>The four girls did not hesitate to follow Zhou Weiqing, each of them releasing their respective Legendary Sets. As for the other three girls, Zhou Weiqing had actually seen their Consolidated Equipment previously, but this was the first time he saw Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s new Legendary Set Consolidated Equipment.</p><br/><p>The familiar dark gold light sprang forth, and behind Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s back, a pair of dark gold wings appeared. However, in contrast to Shangguan Fei\u2019er, her wings seemed much larger, even folded in behind her back, it could actually still cover her entire body from the back. Besides that, Shangguan Bing\u2019er also had a beautiful looking breastplate covering her front, and though it was also dark gold in colour, the center of it had a faint green gemstone that was filled with a thick Wind Attribute aura.</p><br/><p>Breastplate, girdle and war kilt, two pieces of Consolidated Equipment in total, yet Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s current cultivation level was at the sixth Jeweled stage 1</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqnig was a Consolidating Equipment Master in his own right, and with a single look he could tell that the wings behind Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s back were not ordinary at all, actually made out of four Consolidated Equipment. It had to be known that those were all God Tier Consolidated Equipment! For the pair of wings to require four whole God Tier Consolidated Equipment to form, one could just imagine their strength. Furthermore, it looked like this was going to be an entire Legendary Set, perhaps nine pieces in total, or maybe even ten. Having been in closed door cultivation for three entire years, although her cultivation level had not reached the seventh Jeweled stage, it was clear that she was catching up to the rest of her sisters. Besides a freak like Zhou Weiqing, it was only the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace which had the power to groom a Heavenly Jewel Master to such heights in just three short years, and even so, that must have taken an unimaginable amount of resouces.</p><br/><p>Seeing the dark gold light spring forth around the four girls almost simultaneously, each with their own gorgeous and brilliant Legendary Sets, added on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s own \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set, the worry in his heart was mostly dispelled. It could be said that the five of them were the top of the entire young generation now, With the five of them working together, even if they met a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse, they should be able to take him down.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er, Bing\u2019er, come here.\u201d Zhou Weiqing beckoned towards Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Both girls headed towards him, and Shangguan Fei\u2019er asked curiously: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cHeh heh, come, let me kiss you.\u201d As he said that, he did not even give her a chance to react as he pulled her into his embrace, kissing down onto her lips, which were opened from surprise.</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Fei\u2019er was known as the Little Demon Girl, being kissed forcefully in front of her sisters and Tian\u2019er, how could she not be embarrassed. However, she quickly realised that Zhou Weiqing was not just trying to be intimate with her.</p><br/><p>A strange but thick and pure energy entered her mouth from Zhou Weiqing, and with a weird energy reverberation, she suddenly felt as if all of her pores opening at once, the soothing and comfortable feeling causing her eyes to widen in surprise, as she subconsciously put her arms around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck and leaning into the kiss.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing released her lips. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anymore ohh\u2026 I\u2019ll be squeezed dry like that, I still have to leave some for Bing\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at that wicked smirk right in front of her, but she was unable to retort at all, as the energy that had entered her body was slowly circulating around towards her DanTian.</p><br/><p>With a swipe of his arm, Zhou Weiqing pulled Shangguan Bing\u2019er in his embrace. Similarly, kissing her red lips. She was even more embarrassed than Fei\u2019er, trying to struggle free, but was tyrannically held in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Saint Energy. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing was infusing them with some Saint Energy. Of course, though it was possible to transfer the Saint Energy by holding hands, how could Zhou Weiqing give up a perfect opportunity like that to righteously be intimate with them?</p><br/><p>After kissing Shangguan Bing\u2019er and infusing her with Saint Energy as well, Zhou Weiqing restrained the wide smile on his face. In a serious tone, he said: \u201cI have given each of you ten drops of Saint Energy, do not unwilling to use it or think it is a waste. When you use a Skill, if you infuse it with Saint Energy, it will greatly increase its power. This is not for you to attack enemies, but to protect yourselves. After all, the possible danger is just too great\u2026 but with the Saint Energy protecting you when you use any defensive Skills, you should have sufficient time to activate the Lustre Gem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at him exasperatedly and said: \u201cIf you dare surprise attack me like that again, I\u2019ll bite you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cHeh heh, if I were to spread the news about giving ten drops of Saint Energy for a kiss, who knows how many girls will flock over. Even if the condition was to marry me, they would definitely agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he spoke those words, he was in big trouble, stirring up \u2018public\u2019 anger. Four angry glares fixed on him, and all of a sudden, Tian\u2019er who had been silent for most of the time spoke up: \u201cI\u2019m afraid at that time, even men will flock over to look for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing also knew that he had spoken out of line, and he quickly put on a serious face, saying: \u201cCome on, let\u2019s head out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant his words landed, all of a sudden, the dark red world seemed to surge violently, and a powerful force abruptly struck at them from the front.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, and the Ice Cold Perception it gave him. In terms of cultivation level he might not be the highest, but his reaction was actually the fastest.</p><br/><p>His Dual Legendary hammers struck forward at once. Time was just too limited, and he did not have time to even use any Skills.</p><br/><p>A resounding explosion, and a loud resonant dragon\u2019s cry rang out in their ears. Zhou Weiqing remained standing, but in front of him a golden red fire dragon had been sent flying back.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing was not excited just because he had successfully blocked the attack. The golden red fire dragon was not a real dragon, just one formed out of pure energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Spirit?\u201d Both Tian\u2019er and Shangguan Xue\u2019er exclaimed instantly. Zhou Weiqing did not recognize it, but the two girls who had come from a top level Great Saint Lands background instantly did.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Spirit? What is that?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked subconsciously, even as he prepared himself for another attack from the fire dragon.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said: \u201cWhen there are flames that are raised to the maximum in both quality and quantity, it is possible to birth a Fire Spirit. They can be said to be the ultimate essence and core of the flames. Although they do not have any intelligence, they are able to instinctively attack any enemies which enter their territory. The concentration and potency of the flames here have actually reached such a degree.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, the fire dragon once again charged towards the group. By now, the entire group could clearly see that the fire dragon was about a dozen metres long, baring teeth and fang aggressively. Besides being much smaller than a normal dragon, its appearance was no different from a real dragon.</p><br/><p>Having clashed with it earlier, Zhou Weiqing had a clearer picture of this fire dragon\u2019s power. Its offensive strength was equal to that of an ordinary seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, and with the power of the \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set and its terrifying boost to his strength, he had been able knock the fire dragon back with relative ease. This time, however, he did not use his Legendary Hammers to face the incoming attack.</p><br/><p>Holding both hammers in his left hand, Zhou Weiqing grabbed outwards with his right hand right towards the incoming flying fire dragon in an abrupt move.</p><br/><p>The four girls only saw a sudden thick grey light burst forth from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. In that instant, the dragon scaled tattoos around his body which appeared whenever he was in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation suddenly seemed to come to life. A thick grey swirl appeared in front of the fire dragon, and as it slammed into the grey, a strange dragon cry emitted from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>With the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, Zhou Weiqing had the purest bloodline of Dragons in his blood, and this fire dragon was clearly formed from the flames that the Dragons had unleashed. With this dragon\u2019s cry of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, it actually had a pretty good effect in restraining the fire dragon.</p><br/><p>In the next instant, the fire dragon was swallowed up by the grey whirlpool. The Legendary Hammers in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s left hand suddenly disappeared as he grabbed Tian\u2019er\u2019s small hand. Next, the three Shangguan Sisters could clearly see that where the duo\u2019s hands were connected had lit up with a silver white light.</p><br/><p>As soon as the fire dragon entered the grey whirlpool, it immediately began to struggle violently. Alas, it was facing Zhou Weiqing\u2026 the strongest Skill of the Demonic Attribute, the Devour Skill.</p><br/><p>Ever since Zhou Weiqing had gained the Saint Energy, especially after having summoned the Projection of the Demon God previously, his understanding of the Demonic Attribute and especially the Devour Skill had grown substantially, and he was growing to understand how truly tyrannical and powerful this Skill was.</p><br/><p>If it was only him alone here, he would naturally not take the risk to attempt to Devour such a massive amount of Fire Attribute energy. After all, such a massive amount of extremely pure Fire Attribute energy, even if he tried to devour it, it would take far too long to absorb and transform it, perhaps causing adverse side effects to his cultivation and body.</p><br/><p>However with the Saint Energy, especially with Tian\u2019er\u2019s aid, it was very different. Although his and Tian\u2019er\u2019s Saint Energy still could not be cultivated by themselves when they were alone, but when they joined hands to form the large Saint Energy whirlpool, any Attribute energy which entered it could only be absorbed, assimilated and then purified to become their own.</p><br/><p>Earlier, when they had taken the short rest in the Lustre Spatial Realm, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er had already experienced the benefits of absorbing the thick fire attribute energies from the atmosphere, and how it had actually grown their Saint Energy. Currently, seeing that the fire dragon was not actually of real danger to them, how could Zhou Weiqing let go of such a perfect opportunity?</p><br/><p>This time, Zhou Weiqing only infused a single drop of Saint Energy into his Devour Skill. This was a new method of using the Saint Energy that he had just discovered not long ago. By only infusing a single drop of Saint Energy when he was doing so, instead of doing so uncontrolled, he would no longer experience the uncontrollable drain of Saint Energy for the powerful Skills.</p><br/><p>Even with just a single drop of Saint Energy, the power of the Devour Skill was greatly increased. Added on to the suppression of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s bloodline, although the fire dragon was still struggling violently, it could not break free from the whirlpool of the Devour Skill no matter how hard it tried.</p><br/><p>Ever since his cultivation level had reached the sixth-Jewel stage, Zhou Weiqing no longer needed to touch his target with his palm to use the Devour Skill, and its power was slowly starting to really show itself.</p><br/><p>At the start, the struggles of the fire dragon could still give Zhou Weiqing a little bit of trouble, but as the Devour Skill began to take effect, the struggles grew weaker and weaker.</p><br/><p>By the time the fire dragon disappeared totally, both Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er had expressions of being pleasantly surprised on their faces. That was because just this seven-Jeweled fire dragon alone had actually given them twenty drops of Saint Energy\u2026 each! The \u2018loss\u2019 of Saint Energy from infusing to Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er had been recovered just like that.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression turned strange as he laughed heartily: \u201cIt looks like\u2026 danger is often accompanied by opportunity as well!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

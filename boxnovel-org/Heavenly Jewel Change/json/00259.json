(1)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>When Tang Xian realized that Zhou Weixing was actually about to marry all three of her precious darlings, she was instantly enraged.\u00a0She had caused a huge ruckus at Heavenly Jewel Island, cursing Shangguan Tianyue senseless.\u00a0This was the reason why she was standing apart from him just now.</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Tianyue had an exalted status, Tang Xian was the woman he had loved the most in all his life, and he had always felt rather guilty towards her.\u00a0Thus, although Tang Xian caused a huge ruckus, there was nothing he could really do.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing ascended the island, Tang Xian and Shangguan Tianyue had immediately received word and so they had both come out.\u00a0She missed her daughter, but she was also enraged by the fact that the little bastard Zhou Weiqing was going to take advantage of all three of her baby girls.\u00a0Whenever she thought of this, she was so angry she had to hit something\u2026</p><br/><p>And so, we now have before us the sight of the mother-in-law drubbing the son-in-law.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was rather astonished by Tang Xian\u2019s sudden attack, but as a clever person he immediately knew what was going on.\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er let out a startled cry, but Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t dodge or block.\u00a0He allowed Tang Xian to land that palm on his chest.</p><br/><p>A sickening thud sound rang out, followed by a dense blast of Fire Attribute energies exploding. That wasn\u2019t all. Tang Xian was by nature an impulsive woman. When she saw how Zhou Weiqing neither dodged nor blocked, she instantly took it the wrong way. <em>Is this little brat belittling me?\u00a0I still have a nine-Jeweled cultivation base!</em></p><br/><p>Rage filled her heart, and so her next attack showed very little mercy.\u00a0She struck out with both palms, landing a total of eighteen blows across Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue had just learned that Zhou Weiqing had broken through to become a Heavenly King, and so he wasn\u2019t too worried about Tang Xian\u2019s attacks.\u00a0For a mother-in-law to whack her son-in-law a few times wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u00a0If this resulted in Tang Xian calming down, it would actually be a good thing.\u00a0And so, he didn\u2019t intervene.</p><br/><p>But once Tang Xian actually attacked, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes bulged out.\u00a0She was holding back nothing at all!\u00a0Her two hands blazed such scorching energy that they turned a red-gold color.\u00a0This was her supreme technique, the Crimson Inferno Palm.\u00a0It was a type of a technique, but it was an internal technique which accumulated Fire Attribute energies to an extremely dense degree, allowing for an incredibly powerful attack.\u00a0Not even Shangguan Tianyue would dare to allow her to strike him with this palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cXian\u2019er, show mercy!\u201d\u00a0By the time Shangguan Tianyue reacted and said these words, Tang Xian had already finished unleashing her eighteen palms.</p><br/><p>In his heart, Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but think disparagingly to himself about his father-in-law. <em>What\u2019s the point of saying it now?\u00a0She already hit me.</em></p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er flew over, hugging her mother from behind.\u00a0Just now, Tang Xian had blocked her and so she didn\u2019t manage to see what sort of technique she used to attack Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0All she had heard was a series of muffled booming sounds.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian immediately felt some regret after finishing her eighteen palms.\u00a0She had heard that Zhou Weiqing had reached the nine-Jeweled level and so she didn\u2019t worry too much about her attacks at first.\u00a0She was one of the first to know that Zhou Weiqing had six Attributes, and so she understood that his cultivation level couldn\u2019t be weak.\u00a0But, who would\u2019ve thought that the kid would just stand there without even blocking, allowing all eighteen palms to land?\u00a0Although she didn\u2019t use her full power, her Crimson Inferno Palms were able to melt gold and steel alike.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t that easy to take!</p><br/><p>What Zhou Weiqing did next stunned everyone present.\u00a0After taking all eighteen palms, he continued to smile.\u00a0Suddenly, he fell down on his knees and kowtowed three times respectfully towards Tang Xian.\u00a0\u201cMother-in-law, your humble son-in-law greets you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue had wanted to go help heal Zhou Weiqing, but his uplifted hand slowly froze in midair.\u00a0Tang Xian\u2019s eyes bulged out.\u00a0\u201cA-aren\u2019t you hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>The kid didn\u2019t seem to be hurt at all, no matter how she stared at him.\u00a0His breathing was even, he had a smile on his face, and most shockingly of all\u2026 her incredibly hot Crimson Inferno Palms hadn\u2019t even managed to leave a mark on his clothes.\u00a0But she had clearly sensed her palms exploding into his body!</p><br/><p>After finishing his kowtowing, Zhou Weiqing stood up and said honestly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to be hurt.\u00a0If I did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to live up to the favor of Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, and Bing\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Tang Xian had just calmed down a bit, but upon hearing these words her rage built again.\u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for Shangguan Bing\u2019er holding her tightly from behind, she would\u2019ve attacked again.\u00a0\u201cYou little son of a bitch!\u00a0You came here to piss me off, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly.\u00a0\u201cMom, I would never dare to piss you off!\u00a0If you are still angry at me, you can hit me a few more times.\u00a0Your humble son-in-law wouldn\u2019t dare to dodge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue ambled over, casting Zhou Weiqing an unhappy glance before saying to Tang Xian, \u201cShould I do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck off already.\u00a0I\u2019m going to teach this brat a lesson.\u00a0This is none of your business.\u00a0You aren\u2019t any better than him.\u00a0The two of you are birds of a feather.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s jaw dropped at the berating. <em>I was asking for that, wasn\u2019t I?\u00a0Why the hell did I get involved in you teaching your son-in-law a lesson?</em></p><br/><p>Tang Xian charged back towards Zhou Weiqing angrily.\u00a0\u201cYou little son of a bitch, the only thing you ever learned was how to be a playboy.\u00a0Was my Bing\u2019er not good enough for you?\u00a0You ended up sleeping your way through half the world.\u00a0Did you think it was easy for me to give birth to my three daughters?\u00a0And now, you bastard, you\u2019ve taken all three of them.\u00a0If you don\u2019t give me a good response right now, I\u2019ll never let you hear the end of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart clenched.\u00a0He scratched his head, then knelt down once more and said sincerely, \u201cMilady mother-in-law, please allow me to marry Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, and Bing\u2019er.\u00a0I\u2019ll definitely treat them well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTHIS is your response?\u201d\u00a0Tang Xiang nearly laughed out of rage.\u00a0As the saying goes, no one reaches out to slap a face which is smiling at you.\u00a0The brat had put on a show of being completely filial and obedient.\u00a0It was as though he was saying, \u2018Come and hit me, I definitely won\u2019t fight back or argue with you.\u00a0As long as you give me your daughters, you can do whatever you want.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s skills in shamelessness had definitely improved by leaps and bounds.\u00a0Most importantly, he was able to be shameless in such a sincere way!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded sincerely.\u00a0\u201cMother-in-law, aside from this response, I don\u2019t know what else I can say.\u00a0I just hope that you can marry Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, and Bing\u2019er to me.\u00a0I\u2019ll agree to any request at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xian glared at Zhou Weiqing, but her anger seemed to have subsided a bit.\u00a0\u201cAny request at all?\u00a0You said it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could tell that she was easing up on him.\u00a0He hurriedly nodded obediently, as though he was a little chicken.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian pointed a finger at the nearby Shangguan Tianyue.\u00a0\u201cFine.\u00a0My request is simple.\u00a0Go over there and kick his ass, and I\u2019ll let my three daughters marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh!?\u201d\u00a0Zhou Weiqing stared stupefied at Tang Xian.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian snorted coldly.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u00a0Are you afraid or are you unwilling to obey?\u00a0I\u2019ve wanted to kick his ass for a long time now, but I can\u2019t beat him.\u00a0If you can beat him up for me, I\u2019ll accept this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing turned to look at Shangguan Tianyue awkwardly. <em>Sweet father-in-law, say something!</em></p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue said irritably, \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u00a0If you have the courage to offend your superiors, step up!\u00a0I\u2019ve been wanting to kick your ass as well.\u00a0You seduced all three of my daughters.\u00a0Did you think that didn\u2019t piss me off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a stately voice boomed out.\u00a0\u201cEnough.\u00a0Haven\u2019t you embarrassed yourselves enough?\u00a0Come back to the palace, all of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this voice, even the enraged Tang Xian toned herself down slightly. This was the voice of Shangguan Tianyang, and Tang Xian still felt several degrees of respect for this Palace Lord of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. She snorted, then pulled Shangguan Bing\u2019er as she headed towards the palace.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded towards Hua Feng in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Little Wei, did you manage to solve your blocked meridian problem? I haven\u2019t seen you for over a year, and you\u2019ve already grown so much!\u201d Mu En said with a surprised expression. He knew Zhou Weiqing\u2019s actual age, and also the state of his body previously; as such, he did not expect that Zhou Weiqing would actually become a Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said with some dissatisfaction: \u201cTeacher, that time you left without saying a word! Your disciple hasn\u2019t just solved the blocked meridians issue. Look!\u201d As he said that, Zhou Weiqing lifted up his right hand, and as he circulated his Heavenly Energy, his Heavenly Jewels appeared. Around his right wrist, the Icy Jade glittered as it orbited the wrist, showing its purity in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>Mu En blinked his eyes; although he was the oldest in the group, but his eyesight and vision was incomparable, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have the nickname of God Eye Scoundrel. When the absolutely pure Icy Jade appeared in front of him, Mu En was immediately stunned.</p><br/><p>Luo Ke Di\u2019s gaze immediately drifted to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s left hands. Alas, Zhou Weiqing was already rather experienced, and his left hand was totally covered by his sleeve.</p><br/><p>Hua Feng\u2019s eyes seemed to flash with an excited light, looking at Zhou Weiqing with a very gentle gaze. His eyes seemed to have a hint of bewilderment and recollection, as if he were trying to think of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible! It\u2019s only been slightly over a year since we\u2019ve met, even if you solved your blocked meridian issues, it shouldn\u2019t be possible for you to Awaken your Heavenly Jewels! You\u2026 little brat\u2026 are you a fake?\u201d As he said that, Mu En took a step forward, his hands reaching for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face and pinching them.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said smugly: \u201cIf you\u2019re jealous, then just say you\u2019re jealous! I\u2019m so suave, so handsome, who could possibly successfully masquerade as me! You know my dad\u2019s temper, he would never resort to do anything for personal gain. If not for the fact that my Heavenly Jewel Awakened, how could he possibly let me come to the Heavenly Bow Unit together with Shangguan Bing\u2019er? Teacher, let me introduce you, this is my wife, Shangguan Bing\u2019er, our Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s top beauty! Heh heh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er rolled her eyes at him, but did not refute it.. Perhaps it was because she had met the \u2018Rogue\u2019 and the \u2018Scoundrel\u2019, and did not feel safe, and needed Zhou Little Fatty to help her feel safe.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, this little rascal\u2019s smug look made them want to hit him, but the fact that his Heavenly Jewels actually Awakened definitely shook the three Heavenly Bow Unit members present. After all, before Zhou Weiqing, there were only the two Heavenly Jewel Masters in the entire Empire, one was Admiral Zhou, and the other was the young genius of the generation, Shangguan Bing\u2019er. Perhaps an additional Heavenly Jewel Master wasn\u2019t that important for a large Empire, but to such a small Empire like Heavenly Bow Empire, it could be something that totally changed the state of affairs in their entire Empire, something important that could totally change their fate in the next few dozen years. It can be said that if the Heavenly Bow Empire did not have the 8 - Jeweled Admiral Zhou to protect them, with the addition of the Heavenly Bow Unit, perhaps the Empire would have been exterminated by now.</p><br/><p>Luo Ke Di looked towards Mu En and said: \u201cOld Scoundrel, his Physical Jewel is definitely real. When I was testing their strength earlier, he used a piece of Consolidated Equipment, a bow, on me. Its strength was rather impressive.</p><br/><p>Hua Feng said: \u201cLet\u2019s go, we should head to the official meeting hall to discuss more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRogue, go over and call Arrow Tower and Cannon over as well.\u201d As he said that, he walked over to Zhou Weiqing, patted him on the shoulder, and headed towards one of the largest wooden houses.</p><br/><p>The rest of them followed him into the wooden house; it was empty and only had a huge long table in the middle, surrounded by many round chairs. Obviously, this was where they normally held their meetings. Hua Feng sat down at the main seat, and Luo Ke Di brought the other 2 members in as well. \u201cBoss.\u201d Han Mo and Gao Shen greeted Hua Feng, who smiled faintly and said: \u201cEveryone, sit please.\u201d Everybody took their seats, and Zhou Weiqing sat together with Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Hua Feng turned his gentle gaze towards Zhou Weiqing and said: \u201cLet me introduce these two. This young lady is our Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s young generation\u2019s greatest genius, Shangguan Bing\u2019er; previously when Admiral Zhou came he had mentioned her, and that she will be joining us for two years for training. As for this young lad here, he is Admiral Zhou\u2019s only son, Zhou Weiqing. Previously, he had studied under Mu En about survival for two years. Now that his Heavenly Jewel has Awakened, he has become our Empire\u2019s third Heavenly Jewel Master, and will also join us together with SHangguan Bing\u2019er for training. Miss Shangguan, you are a dual agility type Heavenly Jewel Master, while I am a Wind Attribute Elemental Jewel Master; are you willing to take me as your teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er started a little, and an excited look came over her face. Towards the Heavenly Bow unit, she had heard many tales about them and had always yearned to join it. Earlier, she had witnessed Luo Ke Di\u2019s amazing archery, and now that the Heavenly Bow Unit\u2019s leader, who even had the same Elemental Jewel Attribute as her, wanted to take her in as a disciple, how could she not be willing? Furthermore, among the five members of the Heavenly Bow Unit they had seen so far, it seemed like only this leader was relatively normal...</p><br/><p>As such, Shangguan Bing\u2019er stood up and walked up to Hua Feng. Kneeling down, she called out \u201cTeacher.\u201d As she said that, she bowed down three times.</p><br/><p>After she had finished bowing, Hua Feng helped her up. \u201cYou can follow me from now on, and I\u2019ll pass on everything I know to you. You are a talented Heavenly Jewel Master, and I\u2019m confident that you will surpass me before long.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Shangguan Bing\u2019er returned to her seat, Hua Feng turned to Zhou Weiqing and said: \u201cSince your Heavenly Jewel Awakened, you should be of the Darkness Attribute like Admiral Zhou. Unfortunately, we do not have anyone with the same attribute as you, so I recommend that you continue learning from Mu En. In our Heavenly Bow Unit, Mu En might not be the strongest person, but his archery is definitely the top.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Hua Feng said that, instantly 3 soft humphs sounded out, naturally it was the other 3 members of the Heavenly Bow Unit.</p><br/><p>Luo Ke Di\u2019s humph was filled with disdain, Gao Shen\u2019s was filled with provocation, while Han Mo\u2019s was rather fierce and forceful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys humph-ing about! Any of you want to compete in archery? Within 100 yards, even if all 3 of you face me, I\u2019ll still beat you.\u201d Mu En said airily, slumping back in his chair comfortably.</p><br/><p>With the cool eye of the bystander, Zhou Weiqing saw that when Mu En said that, the other 3 eyes wandered and nobody met his gaze.</p><br/><p>Hua Feng laughed heartily, saying: \u201cIf we\u2019re just talking about archery, I\u2019m confident that in this world, in the 100 yard distance, Mu En is unbeatable. Little Wei, Bing\u2019er, in the future I\u2019ll just call you that alright, let me introduce the Heavenly Bow Unit to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Heavenly Bow Unit has been set up for around 130 years, and it has acted 3 times previously when the Heavenly Bow Empire was on the verge of extinction, and turning the tides. As such, 86 years ago, our Heavenly Bow Empire changed name to honour our Heavenly Bow Unit, and from then on our Heavenly Bow Unit was considered the crack unit, known as the God Bow of the Empire, and this land is considered sacred land in the Empire. The first generation of the Heavenly Bow Unit as also 7 people, and from then on, it has always been maintained at 7 people. We are all considered the second generation of the Heavenly Bow Unit, and each of us have inherited a different type of archery, which I can hope you can carry on and improve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Heavenly Bow Unit had also once contained Heavenly Jewel Masters, though there haven\u2019t been many. Admiral Zhou was actually supposed to to lead the Heavenly Bow Unit, but due to some other reasons, I had to take over instead. Currently, amongst the 7 of us, I\u2019ll do a simple introduction of our attributes and unique points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a 7 Jeweled Wind Attribute Elemental Jewel Master, and as the leader of the Heavenly Bow Unit, I\u2019m mostly in charge of strategy and direction, as well assassinations. My nickname is called \u2018Ultimate Assassin[1. has many meanings, it can mean final blow, assassinate, just kill alone etc. While  also has the connotation of ultimate/ final. Hence I chose the name Ultimate Assassin, though he is also likely using it with multiple meanings, as evidenced by the next paragraph.]\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Hua Feng said the two words, \u2018Ultimate Assassin\u2019, even though he was smiling, but both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er both felt a chill run down their spines.</p><br/><p>Hua Feng turned to Mu En and said: \u201cMu En, 6 Jeweled Physical Jewel Master, half agility and half strength, and he is mainly in charge of destruction and sneak attacks, able to killing and sniping enemies in any conditions or environments. He is also in charge of disguises and hiding identities. With the best vision in our entire unit, his nickname is called \u2018God Eye Scoundrel\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Ke Di, 5 Jeweled Physical Jewel Master, half coordination and flexibility, and he is mainly in charge of scouting, survey, tricking enemies, and is the only scout of our unit. His nickname is Drunken Rogue, and partners with Mu En, which is what they call the Unparalleled Liu Duo.\u201d At the side, Mu En gave a humph, saying: \u201cBeing in charge of scouting, that just means he is the weakest amongst us all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ke Di said angrily: \u201cWhat do you mean weakest? I have lived a dozen years less than the rest of you.\u201d Although he said that, it was clear that he was only acting fierce. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er exchanged looks, both of them couldn\u2019t hide the shock in their hearts. Being the weakest in the unit, Luo Ke Di\u2019s archery was already so impressive, they could barely imagine what the others\u2019 could be like.</p><br/><p>Mu En curled his lip in disdain, but Hua Feng ignored him and continued: \u201cHan Mo, 6 - Jewelled Physical Jewel Master, toughness and stamina, and he is extremely skilled in keeping up a constant barrage of strong attacks. In our unit, he is in charge of continuous attack and suppressing fire. His nickname is Arrow Tower, with the meaning that he is just like an arrow tower, firing unceasingly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGao Shen, 6 Jeweled Elemental Jewel Master, Fire Attribute, and is just a master of destruction and attacking. His nickname is Cannon, and under a normal circumstance, the pair of Gao Shen and Han Mo working together can easily suppress a more than a thousand ordinary soldiers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua Feng said: \u201cThere are two other members as well, but they are out in a mission right now. I\u2019ll introduce them to you both when you meet them in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cLeader, what do you mean by mission? Do we go on missions for the Empire?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

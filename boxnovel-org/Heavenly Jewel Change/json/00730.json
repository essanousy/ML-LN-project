It was only at this moment that Dongfang Hanyue was donning the accessory.</p><br/><p>He subconsciously touched it with his hand. The touch did not mean much, but Zhou Weiqing quick-wittedly sneezed.</p><br/><p>It could not be felt from the outside, but when he touched the pendant with his hands, he discovered in shock that the diamond-shaped pendant actually encompassed great amounts of energy waves of the Spatial Attribute.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing himself possessed the Spatial Attribute as well as Saint Energy. Therefore, his ability to sense energy was extremely strong. Although the materials of the metallic outer layer of the pendant were unknown, it had shielded the Spatial Attribute energy inside it from being detected. However, when he touched it with his hand, he immediately felt the uniqueness of it.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s\u2026 what\u2019s this?\u2019 he pondered.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was in a daze and eyed the penchant suspiciously. His hand fell from the penchant and caressed Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s chest. Even in his thoughts, his despicable characteristics would never change.</p><br/><p>With a soft sigh, Zhou Weiqing mumbled to himself, \u201cAh, you\u2019re the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master but I must return. There\u2019s no way you would be willing to come with me. Since we\u2019re together for a day, I\u2019ve to leave you something. Just treat it as a memento; only God will know if we\u2019ll ever have the chance to meet again in this life.\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying that, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand stopped its motions on Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s chest. A concentrated wave of Saint Energy flowed from his palm into Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s body along her meridians, before gathering in her pubic region.</p><br/><p>If it were to be someone else, they would experience strong repulsion of the Heavenly Energy from Dongfang Hanyue. Especially with Zhou Weiqing, he could feel that in the centremost position of Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s chest, there seemed to be a large energy sphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat should be the Heavenly Nucleus Core!\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>However, he had no such time to appreciate the wonders of the Heavenly Nucleus Core. Furthermore, the Heavenly Nucleus Core was different from the Saint Nucleus Core he was aiming for. Thus, he just proceeded to guide the Saint Energy to gather in Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>One of the distinct characteristics of Saint Energy was that it would be repelled by energies of other attributes as pure Saint Energy was not destructive. Only when it was channeled into a technique and had its attribute transformed, there would be heightened power upon the release of the technique.</p><br/><p>Thus, when the Saint Energy had been injected into Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s body, her own energies did not repel it. On the contrary, they accommodated for Saint Energy which made it easier for Zhou Weiqing to channel his Saint Energy to concentrate in her Dantian.</p><br/><p>With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current cultivation, injecting Saint Energy into a person felt different than it was in the beginning. Furthermore, he was not stingy with the amount of Saint Energy he was giving Dongfang Hanyue. He immediately activated his purest Saint Energy, which was like a galaxy.</p><br/><p>This Saint Energy in Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s Dantian gradually formed a tiny galaxy-like whirlpool, spinning and establishing itself into a system. Although it could not upgrade itself like Zhou Weiqing can, but with the pure Saint Energy Whirlpool, as Dongfang Hanyue breaks through the bottleneck of the Heavenly God Tier in the near future, this whirlpool would surely aid her in her breakthrough as a tonic that would give her a huge boost. The initially impossible breakthrough of her bottleneck will no longer be difficult.</p><br/><p>Guarding the shaping of the whirlpool with caution, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s forehead was already drenched with beads of fine sweat when he had finished everything. It was his first time constructing a Saint Energy Whirlpool for others by channeling the most essential part of his Saint Energy. It may not be all of his energy, but it was quite a large portion of it. Without a duration of anywhere from ten days to half a month, Zhou Weiqing would not be able to recover to his most ideal condition.</p><br/><p>After completing everything, a soft smile could be seen on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face, \u201cYou\u2019re now my woman. I\u2019ve not treated you badly and this is my gift to you. It wouldn\u2019t be too much for me to take something from you as a memento, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was speaking to himself the whole time, Dongfang Hanyue had been sleeping well in his embrace.</p><br/><p>While speaking, Zhou Weiqing carefully extracted the pendant from Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s neck and wore it around his own. He smiled as if his actions were justifiable and mumbled, \u201cThere are some things in this world which may be found in other places, but my Saint Energy is unique.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he was mumbling, he lifted Dongfang Hanyue from his embrace cautiously and gently placed her on the blanket.</p><br/><p>Letting out a breath and changing into new clothes, he was about to leave but he could not bring himself to do so. He returned to Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s side and pecked her on her cheek. After caressing some exceptionally soft parts of her body, he then turned toward the ocean and walked toward that direction.</p><br/><p>He released his Dragon-Tiger Transformation wings. In an instant, two wings spread open. With a soft flap, the wings propelled his body u to the sky and flew toward the sea.</p><br/><p>Right when he had just left, Dongfang Hanyue who had been sleeping soundly on the blanket opened her eyes slowly.</p><br/><p>Slight fury was evident on her pretty face as she spoke to herself, \u201cBastard, he never forgets to freeload even before leaving. Such a bad guy. A bastard and a dirty-minded fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>She sat up and redressed herself. Sitting on the blanket, her glance fell onto the pool of red on the blanket, and two red blushes appeared on her lovely face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, you know what? I don\u2019t regret it. Really, I don\u2019t.\u201d She manipulated her senses and immediately detected the galaxy-like whirlpool in her Dantian. The energy encompassed in it may not be that much, but the purity, especially the attribute which seemed like it could engulf everything, was so touching.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes were dazed. To become the Mysterious Heavenly Palace master, she had been exposed to the best education possible as a child, and she herself was extremely smart as well. However, in front of the bastard, she could not help but lower herself.</p><br/><p>At the first time she had met him, she had been attracted by the confidence radiating from his core. Although he was not that handsome, the concentration he displayed while he was creating the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll along with his talents and confidence had left a vivid impression on her.</p><br/><p>In their following moments of contact, he displayed his extraordinary talents in various fields. Even she herself who had been addressed as a genius could not help but feel inferior. If not for her inheritance from her father, she might not even be close to being compatible with him in any aspect.</p><br/><p>Until that day, the bastard had freeloaded from her when he had jumped off the cliff. In the beginning, she really had the intention to kill him. However, she could not bring herself to do it. At that point, she had convinced herself with the excuse that she could not have murdered the genius, but was it really that simple? The truth should be that he was the only man she ever had her eyes on.</p><br/><p>Maybe, most ladies had their eyes locked on a man\u2019s physical appearance. However, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master Dongfang Hanyue had seen too many handsome men, so the only thing she placed her interest in was inner beauty. Regardless of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s later behaviors which were either despicable or dirty-minded, those behaviors had done nothing to make her disregard the extraordinary talents he possessed.</p><br/><p>After that, Dongfang Hanyue had ignored Zhou Weiqing for a long time, not because she was angry, but also because she felt lost.</p><br/><p>The battle they had where she had brought him to another place might very well be the source which had led to the changes.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue had never thought that she would lose in the only aspect she had thought to surpass Zhou Weiqing. In fact, she had already sensed part of the abilities in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s meridians. She had genuinely felt fear, especially during the final Demonic Devour.</p><br/><p>Thus, she lost the bet. Even by early last night, she still could not figure her own heart out. She had only thought of the bet and surrendered her body so that she did not owe him anything.</p><br/><p>However, it was clear to her now.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue started developing feelings for him during the battle for the bet. Zhou Weiqing had won and had also helped something within Dongfang Hanyue to emerge victoriously.</p><br/><p>What made Dongfang Hanyue fell in love with him was the battle against the two ferocious Dreadfiend Sea Naga. During the pinch, he had flown toward the other Dreadfiend Sea Naga without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, falling in love with someone takes only an instant and Dongfang Hanyue had been conquered by Zhou Weiqing at that very instant.</p><br/><p>A man, regardless of his usual behaviors, in times of life and death, if he were to be able to voluntarily sacrifice himself for his woman, he would be considered the most responsible man who deserved all her love.</p><br/><p>At that moment, concealed by her mask, Dongfang Hanyue was crying. She also understood her heart, realizing that she had already helplessly fallen in love with the bastard.</p><br/><p>Even if the powers he had displayed later on had far surpassed her imaginations, and even if she came to know the true purpose of his arrival in Mysterious Heavenly Palace, Dongfang Hanyue will not be infuriated by his lies \u2013 not even the slightest. On the contrary, she had fallen deeper for him.</p><br/><p>He was here for the Spatial Transportation Stone. At that time, he was not required to make a move. Even if he did not escape, he could remain as a bystander. Without other options, Dongfang Hanyue would have no choice but to use the Spatial Transportation Stone and would even take care of him. That would be his best chance of snatching the stone.</p><br/><p>However, he did not do that. Instead, he chose the silliest course of action and even proceeded to tell her the truth after coming here.</p><br/><p>At that point, he was not completely safe, and this could be seen when the huge shadow he had summoned was destroyed with ease. \u2018He was gambling!\u2019 she thought. If the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was to launch his assault blindly, it would be difficult for him to even escape alive.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Go and cultivate! Y-You guys need to let the Saint Energy fully integrate into your bodies after receiving such a vast amount of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er burst out laughing, \u201cOh? Are you feeling embarrassed right now with that thick skin of yours? Hmmph! I didn\u2019t see that at all when you were kissing all of us just now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing quickly retorted, \u201cT-That was merely for the sake of devouring the Destruction Energy, okay? I\u2019m off to cultivate!\u201d Right now, with him being on his own, it was clear that he would not be able to win against the four girls. Without a word, he sat down on the spot and began to cultivate.</p><br/><p>Now that his body\u2019s Saint Energy was already full, the Saint Nucleus Core still did not emerge as he had imagined. To Zhou Weiqing, this was a huge problem. Right now, the revolving of his Death Acupuncture Points were all being driven by the Saint Energy. Yet, he did not dare to absorb anymore Atmospheric Energy from the outside, otherwise, he would start to swell up again as he did previously. In other words, if he did not solve this problem as soon as possible, he would be unable to continue with his cultivation.</p><br/><p>Similar to him, Tian\u2019er was facing the same issue as well. For this reason, she proceeded to sit cross-legged on the ground and started her cultivation.</p><br/><p>Be that as it may, there was no sign of impatience or panic in Zhou Weiqing at all with the condition of his body. After all, he could always use up the Saint Energy and make space in his body. Still, of course, this would be his last resort. Now that he had finally absorbed 3,000 drops of Saint Energy after going through such a trouble, he did not have the heart to waste them just like that.</p><br/><p>With his Death Acupuncture Points revolving, though he did not dare to take in anymore Atmospheric Energy from the outside, he could still activate his Immortal Deity Technique.</p><br/><p>Inside his Dantian, the originally small Saint Energy Whirlpool had now grown multiple times bigger and was now almost as large as the huge Saint Energy Whirlpool that he formed with Tian\u2019er just now.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing tried to mobilize this Saint Energy and found no problem with it but the problem of him not being able to cultivate any further due to his body being fully filled had yet to be resolved.</p><br/><p>He tried all kinds of methods again and again but still, he could not find a plausible solution to the problem. Slowly, he opened his eyes and turned over to look at Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>What entered his field of vision next shocked him to the core.</p><br/><p>At this very moment, there was a thick layer of Saint Light that was coming off Tian\u2019er\u2019s body. The rich, flavorful Saint Energy was emphasizing her delicate body, making her look like a saintess. Even Zhou Weiqing could feel the hint of coercion from that sacred invincible atmosphere.</p><br/><p>In an instant, he realized that Tian\u2019er was actually deep in her cultivation process now. Not only that, the speed that she was absorbing the Atmospheric Energy was so nimble that it could only be described by the word \u2018horrifying\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe actually found a way to cultivate? B-But how?\u201d He was completely taken aback.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, all of a sudden, Zhou Weiqing could see that the Heavenly jewels on her hand started to slow down from its originally fast rotating speed. A faint shadow suddenly appeared on both her hands and slowly solidified into matter.</p><br/><p>In an instant, he was hit with a hard realization. Fiercely slapping his thighs, he thought to himself, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Why am I so stupid? Why didn\u2019t this simple method cross my mind at all?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing really wanted to slap himself hard. How could he miss such a simple theory? He was the one who overcomplicated the entire thing. In fact, the solution to this problem was actually very, very easy.</p><br/><p>That was right! Though the Saint Energy had already fully filled up his and Tian\u2019er\u2019s body, it was only in his veins, not his entire body. On top of that, even if the Saint Energy was already enough, their own cultivation level was still far from being able to solidify the Saint Nucleus Core. This was the reason why they needed to achieve a breakthrough with the Saint Energy instead of trying to cultivate or mobilize it. It was only after they had reached the upper Heavenly Zong-tier that they could have the opportunity to solidify the Saint Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>At the thought of this, Zhou Weiqing suddenly came to his senses like he had just been enlightened by something huge. Without wasting another second, he quickly entered his cultivation again and quietly recited his Immortal Deity Technique, activating his Saint Energy and pounded on his 29th Death Acupuncture Point.</p><br/><p>Different techniques of cultivating the Heavenly Energy would have different breakthrough methods but it could not get any easier than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation method. Right now, his Immortal Deity Technique was only needed to break through his Death Acupuncture Point.</p><br/><p>Before this, during his last breakthrough, he had only used Heavenly Energy before in entering his 28th Death Acupuncture Point. He had never used the Saint Energy in the past to make this leap. After all, he did not have much Saint Energy so he was not willing to use them at all in the past. However, since there was nothing else left other than the Saint Energy in his body, he could only use this to help him with his progress in his cultivation journey.</p><br/><p>Under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s urge, the silverish white Saint Energy rushed straight towards the 29th Death Acupuncture Point under the guidance of the Immortal Deity Technique.</p><br/><p>The fourth stage of the Immortal Deity Technique \u2013 The Death Acupuncture Points on the head and neck.</p><br/><p>The first point was the Renying. It\u2019s known as Man\u2019s Prognosis Point which and is located 1.5 inches away from the Adam\u2019s apple that he had successfully opened before. Right now, the point that he was aiming for was the second Death Acupuncture Point on his head and neck region \u2013</p><br/><p>The Wind Pool Point.</p><br/><p>It was located on the lower border of the occipital bone in the depression between the origins of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. These functioned as the meeting point of the gallbladder and Sanjiao Channels with the Yang Motility and Yang Linking Vessels. When it was hit, it would impact the medullary center and could cause the victim to become unconscious.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy continued to revolve and move around his veins. Under the attack of the Saint Energy, the veins that were originally closed was pried open bluntly one after the other. Not only that, under the creativity of this energy, it was increasingly being consolidated and broadened, leaving no scruples in attacking the Death Acupuncture.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Zhou Weiqing also noticed that when he began to activate his Saint Energy to raid the Death Accupuncture, the energy had begun to be slowly be consumed in his bloated body. Though the consumption was low, it was at least gradually being used up in his cultivation.</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>Without any hardship, the Wind Pool Point was broken just like that. What astonished Zhou Weiqing was the fact that the Saint Energy broke through the Wind Pool Point without him feeling even the slightest amount of pain, not even a little bit. On the contrary, his body felt rather light and in that instance, the Saint Energy in his body rushed out as it created a Death Acupuncture energy whirlpool at the Wind Pool Point. The situation where his power leaked out during his breakthrough when he used Heavenly Energy did not happen this time, let alone any other dangers.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s it?\u201d Zhou Weiqing was stunned reflecting on his success in breaking through the 29th Death Acupuncture Point. He watched the surging of the great amount of Saint Energy to the point and how it began to change his body.</p><br/><p>Just like that, 300 drops of Saint Energy disappeared in a blink of eyes. The bloated feeling that he felt a while ago dissipated along with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, who knew using Saint Energy for my breakthrough was so easy?! Could it be that my Immortal Deity Technique was specially tailored to use Saint Energy?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

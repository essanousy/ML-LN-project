With this connection, we can say that there\u2019s a magical resonance in the Life Energy between us. In a certain way, we\u2019re like a single entity. It allows us to feel the spiritual waves between us within a certain distance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was relieved to hear that the connection was only within a certain distance. It was fine as long as they could not sense each other at any time or anywhere. Otherwise, that would be rather awkward. The Elven Queen then proceeded to say, \u201cOur lives are merged into one across time, space, and any form. That being said, unless both of us die at the same time or the shared Life Energy between us is drained, neither one of us will die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because they were connected by spirit, Zhou Weiqing knew very well that the Elven Queen was not kidding. His mouth was wide open in surprise as he looked at her exquisite and flawless face. Was it a good or bad thing to be sharing lives, and to be spiritually connected to the Elven Queen? On the surface, it was clearly a great thing. The Elf Tribe originally possessed strong and powerful Life Energy. The abundant Life Energy was a basic guarantee of their survival. Sharing lives with the Elven Queen who was a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse would mean that it would be difficult for Zhou Weiqing to die even if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>From another perspective, this relationship was akin to something that tied Zhou Weiqing with the Elf Tribe. With that, he would be duty bound and should a crisis befall the Elf Tribe, he would have to do everything in his power to rescue them with no question asked. Otherwise, if the Elven Queen\u2019s Life Energy was drained from the enemy\u2019s attack, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Life Energy would be drained as well. Although the possibility of something like this happening was unlikely, it would be almost fatal if it did happen.</p><br/><p>Since Zhou Weiqing was thinking that, the Elven Queen naturally had the same thoughts as well. Her expression became extremely complicated as she looked at Zhou Weiqing. She had never thought that she would have such a complicated relationship with a human in her life. A while later, Zhou Weiqing finally recovered from the shock and mumbled as he looked at the Elven Queen, \u201cCould it be possible that this happened because you were absorbing my Saint Energy while I was absorbing your Life Energy during the energy exchange?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen looked at Zhou Weiqing and frowned, \u201cIt seems like you\u2019re averse to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 No, it\u2019s not that.\u201d Zhou Weiqing explained immediately, \u201cIts just too shocking. Your Majesty, what ability did you use to rescue me? How did you weaken yourself so much? To be honest, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem with my recovery with my Saint Energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen\u2019s expression dimmed when she heard him say that. She let go of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands that were hugging her and pushed him away gently. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really didn\u2019t know that you did that to save my child. I\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t intend to hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the matter had passed, and the both of them were safe, the Elven Queen was filled with guilt. Zhou Weiqing was almost killed by her slap that carried her full force behind it due to her rage. In the end, he only did that to save her daughter. Nobody would be able to accept such a mistake without feeling any guilt.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled in a carefree manner and said, \u201cI figured you\u2019d definitely attack me out of anger when I released Saint Energy into your daughter\u2019s body. I was 80% confident that your attack would at the most injure me badly and it won\u2019t be fatal. My skin\u2019s so thick.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen was stunned because she could feel what Zhou Weiqing was feeling. She realized immediately that he really did not mind. Such open-mindedness impressed her, and she said softly, \u201cSince you figured that I might attack you, why didn\u2019t you hint me before you made a move?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said helplessly, \u201cI can\u2019t do that! At that moment, that person was extremely panicked. Moreover, he\u2019s a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse. He would\u2019ve noticed the slightest changes in our expressions. Your beloved daughter that was in his hands was too weak. I couldn\u2019t take the risk so I had to personally take the hit. If I could deceive you, I could definitely deceive that person. However, you should really thank me for your child. The Saint Energy that I inserted into her body is even purer than the one that I used to rescue you. It took almost all of my Saint Energy otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be hurt so bad if I had the Saint Energy to protect myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The Elven Queen said softly. She was not sure of the reason but she did not dare to look Zhou Weiqing in the eyes.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Little Fatty Zhou was much more proper than he used to be. He did not take the advantage to flirt with the Elven Queen, and he comforted her instead, \u201cIt\u2019s over now. You don\u2019t have to take this personally. I guess it\u2019s fate that we have such a connection. I can feel that your body has changed in certain ways and it\u2019s just beginning to break through the surface. Try to feel the changes now. The effect will be the best if you\u2019re able to feel it right now. Let\u2019s head back to your Elf Tribe after this. I\u2019ve no idea how long the cultivation this time took. Your people must be worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was worried when he thought about his wives who were still in the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land. It must have been some time since the both of them cultivated here, he was not sure if the Elf Tribe people caused any harm to his lovers. The Elven Queen sensed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s concern immediately and shook her head lightly at him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, that won\u2019t happen. My evolution this time is unprecedented. Actually, you\u2019re not the only one that I\u2019m spiritually connected and share lives with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Zhou Weiqing could sense the Elven Queen\u2019s thoughts, and he looked at her in shock. \u201cThe Ancient Tree of Life? The Ancient Tree of Life is also sharing lives with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen nodded. She looked at Zhou Weiqing as a look of intense gratitude appeared in her eyes. \u201cWith your help, both I and the ancient tree of the Elves evolved at the same time. My Natural Energy and the original Life Energy have evolved into Life Saint Energy. That\u2019s the energy of the Elven Heart that I used to heal you earlier. All of the former Elven Queens in the Elf Tribe could only release Life Saint Energy using the Life Heart. However, now that my Life Core has evolved into the Saint Life Core, the Ancient Tree of Life has evolved following my evolution. The benefits from the evolution of the Ancient Tree of Life are indescribable to the Elf Tribe. Within a short period of time, our people will have improvements in their abilities from the Ancient Tree of Life. It\u2019s you who gave us all this. Thank you, Weiqing. I would like to thank you on behalf of the Elf Tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen performed a kneeling ceremony that the Elf Tribe would only perform to the most honorable guest as she spoke. She closed the distance between them slightly and used the tip of her ear to touch Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face. Even though it was just a touch, the Elven Queen\u2019s ears turned red in an instant. The pointy ears were extra cute like that. Zhou Weiqing had no idea that the most sensitive part for the Elves were their ears. The act of using their ears to touch another person signified that they were willing to give their lives to that person. Safe to say, it was the most honorable ceremony, disregarding the fact that it was the ruler of the Elf Tribe who performed such a ceremony for him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave her a gentle hug. As the Elven Queen looked up, she placed her right hand before Zhou Weiqing and opened her hand. There was a tiny bottle containing her blood within her palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was what you wanted. Take it.\u201d The Elven Queen passed the tiny green bottle to Zhou Weiqing. The bottle contained much more than just three drops of the Elven Queen\u2019s blood. Zhou Weiqing did not show any modesty in front of the Elven Queen and put it away in his Sumeru Ring.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen sat down legs crossed. Just like what Zhou Weiqing had said, she needed to adapt to the changes in her body, and it was best for her to do it right now. As the Elven Queen was adapting to the changes of the Life Energy in her body, Zhou Weiqing was doing the same. After the cultivation, his body that had just evolved and his cultivation base were perfectly integrated. The sky was spinning with nebula. Zhou Weiqing no longer felt small under the nebula like he used to. On the contrary, he felt like the heavens, the earth, and the dazzling starry sky were all within his control.</p><br/><p>As he waved both of his hands lightly, two glows that were not far away faded. With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s protection, the Demonic Dragon Lady and the Hell\u2019s Angel were no longer needed. He had also dismissed his Nebula Divine Territory at the same time. Just a mere Divine Thought allowed him to monitor everything that was within 100 kilometers. The Spatial Travel earlier had brought Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen hundreds of kilometers away from the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land. His current cultivation base did not allow him to sense so far away.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen\u2019s cultivation did not take too long. She opened her eyes slowly four hours later. As she opened her eyes, she was surprised by her cultivation and state of mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing.\u201d She looked up at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to thank me, you don\u2019t have to. I know exactly what you\u2019re feeling right now. Let\u2019s head back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d The Elven Queen stood up slowly. She had a tremendously magical feeling in her heart at that moment. Although she was spiritually connected and shared her life with the Ancient Tree of Life, it was not human after all even though it had its wisdom! It was not a living man like Zhou Weiqing. It was a magical feeling having her spirit connected to a man. It was a feeling that she could not describe. All she felt was that it seemed like there was no more loneliness in her life. Instead, it was replaced with a unique satisfaction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

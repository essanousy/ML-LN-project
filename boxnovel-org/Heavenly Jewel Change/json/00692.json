However, that expression turned cold almost immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worthy of witnessing the making of a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll. Tell your Palace Master that if he wants to test me out, we can do that, sure. I\u2019m a reasonable person. Since I came all the way here, I\u2019ll definitely show my sincerity. But do you really think that you\u2019ll be able to tell if I made the God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll myself based on your ability alone? With my skill, I can easily switch it to another one. I\u2019ll give you a list. Go back and prepare them. Pick a place in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace that\u2019s suitable for scroll making and bring your best Consolidated Equipment Master. Only a Consolidated Equipment Master is eligible to test another Consolidated Equipment Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing flipped his hand as he spoke and a piece of paper landed in his hand. He picked up the quill that was prepared by the hotel and started writing. Soon, the paper was filled with all the materials required to make the Consolidated Equipment Scroll.</p><br/><p>After writing them down, he passed the paper to Fei Lun. \u201cYou can leave now,\u201d he said casually.</p><br/><p>Although Fei Lun was not pleased with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attitude, he did not show his temper. Whether or not the young man who was standing in front of him was a real God Tier Master, his attitude was definitely similar to one. Looking at him, he might really be what he claimed to be. Although Fei Lun was an Elder in the palace, he did not dare to offend Zhou Weiqing in case he was a real God Tier Master. As a person who held a high position in Mysterious Heavenly Palace, he had to think about his family and disciples as well as the many Consolidated Equipment Scrolls that were coming his way!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. If that\u2019s the case, please give me some time to prepare, Master. I\u2019ll report to the Palace Master as you\u2019ve requested.\u201d Fei Lun nodded to Zhou Weiqing and left.</p><br/><p>As soon as the door was shut, Shangguan Bing\u2019er could barely continue to maintain her smile.. She was about to say something, but Zhou Weiqing gestured for her to keep quiet with his finger as he said to her telepathically, \u201cDo not speak. The walls have ears..\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er stuck out her cute, little tongue at him. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, her eyes blossomed with love. Her little fatty was really capable. Ever since they came to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, Zhou Weiqing had been coming up with plans and solving problems along the way without panicking at all. He would deal with anything that came their way, without feeling the need to hurry or rush. Shangguan Bing\u2019er acknowledged in her heart that if it was her, she would not be able to do what Zhou Weiqing had done. Looking at that confident disposition of the love of her life, her love for him grew even deeper. It felt like as long as she was with him, there was nothing that she would have to worry about even if they were in dangerous situations.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing could not possibly have everything under his control. However, Mu En had taught him since he was young that, in order to be a true lowlife, he would have to always think that he was right no matter what. He should not admit it even if he was exposed. Because of that mentality, Zhou Weiqing managed to live a prosperous life in the Boundless Mainland. Although the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland could be considered as a whole other world for them, Zhou Weiqing was different from who he used to be as well. With his Saint Energy, he had sufficient power and ability to face whatever situation he encountered with the utmost confidence. And with that sense of confidence, the enemies would definitely not be able to see through his weaknesses.</p><br/><p>They spent the rest of the day resting in the hotel room. After that, he even brought Shangguan Bing\u2019er out to try the local delicacies in Heaven City.</p><br/><p>The food was very different from the cuisine of the Boundless Mainland. For example, the food in Heaven City was heavier and spicier compared to the Boundless Mainland. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er enjoyed themselves with the food. After they were done eating, they walked around a little and purchased some cheap and worthless craft pieces.</p><br/><p>Naturally, there were people following them when they were out. It seemed like they were protecting him, but in reality, they were watching him. However, the people from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace had no idea why the God Tier Master would buy crafts that even they would not bother looking at. Of course, they had no idea that Zhou Weiqing was buying gifts for his family. After all, he was in a foreign land. Would the wives who were waiting for him at home forgive him if he did not bring anything back for them?</p><br/><p>The Mysterious Heavenly Palace sent someone to see them again on the third morning of their arrival.</p><br/><p>It was Fei Lun again, but Er Chun was nowhere to be seen. It was possible that he had returned to Ubaatar City.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, we\u2019re done preparing the stuff you requested. At your behest.\u201d Upon meeting with Zhou Weiqing, Fei Lun did not wish to waste time on any incessant chatter as he got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>The materials that Zhou Weiqing requested earlier had brought a lot of trouble to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. It was difficult for the powerful Mysterious Heavenly Palace to look for so many precious materials. Although the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland had many things that were considered precious and rare in the Boundless Mainland, the items were still expensive even if they were not rare in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded at Fei Lun and brought Shangguan Bing\u2019er to leave the hotel with him.</p><br/><p>The carriage was already waiting outside. However, upon boarding the carriage, Zhou Weiqing was surprised that the carriage was not heading into the city. Instead, it was leaving Heavenly City.</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, the strong fear nothing. Zhou Weiqing was not afraid since he was powerful.</p><br/><p>Fei Lun was riding in the same carriage and seated right across Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er. From time to time, he would cast his gaze at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>If it was someone other than Zhou Weiqing, that person would have felt uncomfortable and unnerved being watched by a Heavenly King Master. However, Zhou Weiqing was an exception. Fei Lun could watch all he wanted. From time to time, Zhou Weiqing would even kiss Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s soft cheeks as he shot looks of taunt over back at Fei Lun.</p><br/><p>Fei Lun pretended that he did not see anything. He did not even speak to Zhou Weiqing throughout the journey.</p><br/><p>After about two hours plus into the journey, it felt like they were going on a higher terrain. Even though he did not look out of the window, Zhou Weiqing could feel that the carriage was going up a mountain. There were many guards along the path, but once they saw the carriage was from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, they were instantly granted access.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is the Mysterious Heavenly Palace located outside of Tian City?\u2019 Zhou Weiqing thought to himself. However, his expression did not change at all.</p><br/><p>The carriage finally stopped moving after about an hour later. Fei Lun descended from the carriage after he nodded at Zhou Weiqing. Following which, he opened up the carriage doors for him personally.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing descended next, followed by Shangguan Bing\u2019er. When they got out of the carriage, they were stunned by the sight in front of them.</p><br/><p>They were looking at the beautiful scenery in a valley surrounded by greens. Various plants could be seen and there were even valuable plants among them. Because they were in a valley surrounded by flowers, light, flowery fragrance could be detected in the air. It was very refreshing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could sense more than 20 auras within this valley alone. There were at least two Heavenly King Masters among them. Anyone could tell the place was important to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. However, it was obvious that this was not the palace itself.</p><br/><p>Everything in the valley could be seen in a glance. There was only a cottage in the middle of the valley and three simple wooden houses that could accommodate up to eight people at the most. How could this be the headquarters of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace?</p><br/><p>Fei Lun started speaking when he noticed Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s curious expressions. \u201cWe have two God Tier Masters who reside here on a permanent basis. Didn\u2019t Master Zhou ask for a place that\u2019s suitable to make Consolidated Equipment Scrolls? I\u2019ve given it some thought and decided that this is the best place. With that, I decided to invite you over, Master. Everything you need is in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and attempted to walk to the cottage, but he was stopped by Fei Lun.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Fei Lun in bewilderment while Fei Lun returned his look with solemn eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about everything Master Zhou did back in Ubaatar City. Even if Master Zhou is not a God Tier Master, the fact that you managed to create a Master Level Consolidated Equipment Scroll proves that you\u2019re still an exceptional talent. So, there\u2019s still time for you to take back your words. It\u2019ll be too late if you can\u2019t prove that you\u2019re a God Tier Master after stepping into the cottage.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he meant was obvious. If Zhou Weiqing admitted that he was not a God Tier Master, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace would still accept him by virtue of his talent. However, once he stepped into the cottage and still could not prove that he was a God Tier Master, no matter how talented he was, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace would not let him go alive.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and did not say a word. He pushed away Fei Lun\u2019s hand that was blocking his way and ran towards the cottage while pulling Shangguan Bing\u2019er along.</p><br/><p>Fei Lun could not hide the surprise on his face as he watched them. He thought to himself, \u2018Could it be that this young man really is a God Tier Master?\u2019 If that was true, he would be an unparalleled genius that had never once appeared in the history of Consolidated Equipment Masters!</p><br/><p>According to Fei Lun\u2019s knowledge, the youngest God Tier Master on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland was over 50 years old. In fact, that was only someone who had existed in the books of history. Could it be\u2026?</p><br/><p>Time did not allow him to think further. As Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er arrived at the cottage door, Fei Lun caught up to them hurriedly while the rest were left outside. None of them were allowed in.</p><br/><p>When they were standing in front of the cottage, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cold perception rose. He could clearly sense that there were two humans in the cottage. What shocked him was the fact that he could not sense their cultivation level.</p><br/><p>Although they had yet to meet, his cold perception was extremely sensitive with the help of Saint Energy. With even the slightest disturbance, he would be able to sense the presence of a Heavenly Jewel Master. If he couldn\u2019t sense the cultivation levels of those within, this could only mean one thing. The two people in the cottage were at least at the maximum level of the Heavenly King Stage.</p><br/><p>In fact, they could be even higher than that.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

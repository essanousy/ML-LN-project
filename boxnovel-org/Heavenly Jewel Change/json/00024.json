At that time, Zhou Weiqing did not hesitate and held out the white little tiger to Shangguan Bing\u2019er, saying: \u201cHere, a gift for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked at Zhou Weiqing in surprise. \u201cLittle Fatty, don\u2019t you know the value of a youngling Heavenly Beast? Even a youngling of one of those Forest Direwolves that we just killed, each of them can be sold for more than a thousand gold pieces. This little white tiger of yours, I can\u2019t even imagine the price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said suavely: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter, I wouldn\u2019t be able to bear to give it to anyone else, but it\u2019s totally different for you.\u201d [1. +1]</p><br/><p>Listening to him say that, Shangguan Bing\u2019er blushed once again, but she did not reject him this time. She really did like this cute little white tiger, it was just too adorable, and she reached out for it.</p><br/><p>However, a strange scene appeared; when the little white tiger saw that Zhou Weiqing was giving it away, it grew angry, its four little claws unsheathing as it bared its fangs at Shangguan Bing\u2019er fiercely. Alas, it was just too small and cute for that, and the ferocity was just not convincing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh, seems like it does not like me.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er said curiously.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing also discovered the same thing; earlier when he had picked up the little white tiger, the little fellow had not put up any resistance at all. They both exchanged looks and Zhou Weiqing muttered: \u201cPerhaps this little thing was attracted by the tiger\u2019s roar I let out during my Demonic Change last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said: \u201cThat\u2019s very possible, why don\u2019t you hug it and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing followed suit and hugged the little tiger, and as expected, it stopped struggling, instead snuggling close to his chest and rubbing against it, stretching itself in a comfortable position and closing its eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stroked the little tiger\u2019s back, playing with its fur as he felt amused in his heart. Of course, he really liked this little thing as well. In his eyes, there were two animals that he considered the most beautiful, one was horses, and the other was tigers. Horses\u2019 beauty lay in their vigorous and healthy body and shape, while tigers\u2019 beauty lay in their imperious aura, their beautiful lines and their grace and poise.</p><br/><p>Although he had never touched a tiger\u2019s fur before, he could still sense that the little thing was very special. Normally, no matter how gorgeous or colourful a tiger\u2019s stripes were, its fur shouldn\u2019t be this soft, yet caressing this little thing felt as if he was stroking a piece of silk, and was extremely comfortable. Furthermore, it felt so soft and pliable as if it were boneless; although it was still rather tiny, but no matter where he touched it, it felt soft and meaty.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing flipped the little tiger around in his embrace, and gave a strange laugh, saying: \u201cHaha, it\u2019s a little female tiger! Bing\u2019er, look, these little protrusions, do you think they\u2019ll be for feeding milk next time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er flushed once again, knocking him hard on the head and said: \u201cWhat\u2019s your head filled with! You\u2019re not allowed to bully it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little white tiger was also very angry, as it cried out, struggling to turn around, and giving Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand a bite. However, it did not bite very hard, now even breaking his skin.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, saying: \u201cLook! It even knows how to be shy, such an interesting little fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said exasperatedly: \u201cYou better spend more time thinking of how you\u2019re going to head back to the camp. Are you going to go back in this state?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing scratched his head embarrassedly, then his eyes lit up as he thought of a plan.</p><br/><p>When the two of them stealthily entered the camp, the Personal Aide Zhou Little Fatty was dressed in a common soldier\u2019s attire, and a poor sentry of the Heavenly Bow Empire was stripped naked...</p><br/><p>When they finally reached their tents, the two heaved a huge sigh of relief. Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked at Zhou Weiqing with a complicated look in her eyes and said: \u201cLittle Fatty, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing paused for a while, finally sighed and said: \u201cBing\u2019er, honestly speaking, you are very kindhearted by nature, and I do not think your nature is suitable for joining the army. A soldier needs to be cold and ruthless, and that\u2019s something your nature will not allow. I do think it\u2019s the right decision for you to resign as Battalion Commander, and perhaps to leave the army too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked a little dazed, and asked: \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing immediately stuck out his chest and said proudly: \u201cOf course I\u2019ll follow you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho wants you to follow me.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er muttered softly, but her gentle voice held a tinge of happiness. Her radiant beauty at that moment caused Zhou Weiqing to stare, transfixed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like my Heavenly Energy is a little off, I\u2019m heading back to my tent to cultivate. As for the future\u2026\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er hesitated a little before continuing: \u201cI\u2019ll wait for the orders from headquarters before deciding.\u201d After she said that, she disappeared in a flash, going back into her tent.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and headed back to his own tent feeling rather satisfied, hugging the little white tiger. In his heart, he was thinking to himself: <i>Looks like, this wife will not escape!</i></p><br/><p>As he entered his tent, he prepared a basin of water and cleansed the dirt off his body. He couldn\u2019t help but look at his reflection in his water and said smugly: \u201cZhou Weiqing, you\u2019re really getting more and more handsome everything! Wahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not notice that the little white tiger which he had thrown at the side, had now very cutely lifted its two front paws, covering its eyes in a very human-like manner, even rolling its eyes at him.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p><i>The place where the Forest Direwolves and the Direwolf King had died.</i></p><br/><p>Two shadowy white figures appeared out of nowhere; they were two middle aged men, both dressed in white with a head of silver, blue eyes shining and a majestic aura surrounding them.</p><br/><p>The white robed man on the left furrowed his eyebrow, asking in puzzlement: \u201cHer Highness\u2019 aura stopped here, how is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man on the right looked at the surrounding corpses, his eyes filled with a thread of fear. \u201cCould it be\u2026 these Heavenly Beasts killed Her Highness? If not for that, how could this be possible, with our Snow God Perception, we would definitely be able to sense her aura.</p><br/><p>The white robed man on the left said solemnly: \u201cDon\u2019t make wild guesses. Even if Her Highness is weak during this period of her transformation, such weak Heavenly Beasts could never be able to injure her, let alone kill her. If Her Highness releases her aura, these Heavenly Beasts would have been literally scared to death. Lao Er [2. Literally means Old 2nd, usually an affectionate tone to call, like 2nd brother], check how these direwolves died.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d After a short while, the man on the right returned after his checks, with surprise and doubt in his eyes as he said: \u201cSuch a strange, evil aura. These direwolves died around 8 hours ago, but the evil aura from the has not dissipated. The most terrifying thing is that there isn\u2019t any of their Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy remaining in their bodies, as if they had been drained completely. A powerful Heavenly Beast must have came here, perhaps even a Heavenly Evil Beast. I understand now, Her Highness must be together with that Heavenly Evil Beast, and its aura is covering her aura, that\u2019s why we aren\u2019t able to detect it. Big bro, what do we do now?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

For Zhou Weiqing to be able to press her to such a state, he could already be proud of himself.</p><br/><p>To Shangguan Xue\u2019er, the Boundless Infinitum Sword was like her own life. However, she did not wish to lose the fight just like this, and more so, did not wish to marry Zhou Weiqing. Yet, she also could not bring herself to kill him. Left with no choice, she could only compromise with this worst choice.</p><br/><p>As the Boundless Infinitum Sword left Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s hands, it vanished instantly. In the next moment, her right hand slammed savagely towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>However, at that very instant, Shangguan Xue\u2019er saw the crushing despair in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Indeed, it was despair. Zhou Weiqing opened his mouth, and a mouthful of blood spat out, and his entire body fell back down before Shangguan Xue\u2019er could even strike at him. His entire chest was stained red with blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2026 no good!\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er was caught by surprise, immediately realising that Zhou Weiqing had been severely injured by her sword. Not the sword that had pierced right through his right chest, but the strongest blow that she had struck earlier!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! Facing that strongest sword of hers, even a nine-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master might not be able to take it head on, let alone Zhou Weiqing with his six-Jeweled cultivation level. Oh no\u2026 was he really about to die?</p><br/><p>Shanggua Xue\u2019er\u2019s original palm strike turned into a grab, holding onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s left hand as she pulled the falling body back up. With a step forward, she held onto his body.</p><br/><p>However, before Shangguan Xue\u2019er could even examine his wounds, her hand had been counter grabbed by Zhou Weiqing. The Devour Skill appeared once more. This time, it was direct contact, and was far stronger than when it was executed through the Boundless Infinitum Sword.</p><br/><p>His legs lifted up abruptly, wrapping around Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s waist in a clinging fashion and with a wrestler\u2019s twist, he had forced her onto the ground below him.</p><br/><p>In truth, after the previous period of recovery and the Devouring, his Heavenly Energy had already reached a point above Shangguan Xue\u2019er. The reason why he continued using such shameless methods was because he did not want to face any more invincible techniques from Shangguan Xue\u2019er if it wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><br/><p>Alas, by the time Shangguan Xue\u2019er had realised it, it was already too late. The remaining Heavenly Energy in her body was being drawn out bit by bit by Zhou Weiqing, and her body was being pressed down by his. The masculine scent from Zhou Weiqing, along with the smell of blood, and the drain of Heavenly Energy\u2026 coupled with the fact that she was so angry, with a muffled groan she actually fell unconscious.</p><br/><p>It was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s turn to be frightened, and he quickly stopped the Devour Skill. Subconsciously, he patted her on the face, ensuring that she was alright before he relaxed. At this point, he was panting hard, the intense pain from his chest and hands causing him to grimace. However, after that, he was still feeling smug. No matter what, he had won this fight. Earlier, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had even sworn that she would marry him\u2026 right?</p><br/><p>Foursome\u2026 Triplets! Was there anything more joyous than that?! With such sudden evil thoughts coming to his mind, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt like his chest wasn\u2019t hurting as much anymore.</p><br/><p>In truth, when he had descended from the skies, he had already prepared for this. Of course, he knew why Shangguan Xue\u2019er was so quick to agree to his bet. In that circumstance, it would have been impossible for him to defeat Shangguan Xue\u2019er with a direct clash. As such, he had came up with such a plan. If Shangguan Xue\u2019er had pierced towards his heart, he had his own way of dealing with it as well.</p><br/><p>Previously, up on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia had given Zhou Weiqing a present \u2013 a Stored Skill that belonged to her! This Skill did not have any offensive capabilities, but it was a miraculous defensive Skill. The Skill name was also a simple \u2018Nether State\u2019.</p><br/><p>When he activated the \u2018Nether State\u2019, he would enter a state of being totally immune to any physical attacks for the next three seconds. Although it was just three seconds, but what did being immune to physical damage mean! That means any weapons could not wound him. If timed correctly, that was tantamount to three seconds of total immunity!</p><br/><p>Previously, Zhou Weiqing had actually used this very Skill when he had clashed hard with Shangguan Xue\u2019er, so that he did not take any damage from her sword intent as well. The greatest benefit of the \u2018Nether State\u2019 Skill was that it could be instantly activated without any sign, and at his level he could use it a maximum of three times daily.</p><br/><p>Since Zhou Weiqing had already used it once, if Shangguan Xue\u2019er really tried to kill him, he could make use of the \u2018Nether State\u2019 Skill once more to protect himself as he activated his Devour Skill. It would still leave him with one more chance of using the \u2018Nether State\u2019 Skill in case of any unforeseen circumstances; for example if Shangguan Xue\u2019er really tried to cut off his hands, he would have activated it instantly. As such, no matter what, Zhou Weiqing had a contingency plan for almost all possible outcomes.</p><br/><p>Of course, he definitely would not wish to use such a contingency plan. Furthermore, he had strong confidence that Shangguan Xue\u2019er would not actually strike to kill. As such, he had gone through his daring plan that was almost like betting his life. More so, the smartest part of his plan that he would actually allow himself to be stabbed right through by Shangguan Xue\u2019er, and she would never expect to what degree that Zhou Weiqing could control his own body and even innards.</p><br/><p>With the toughness and power of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, although it seemed like Zhou Weiqing was entirely pierced through his right chest, due to the fact that he had more than sufficient to prepare to receive that blow, in the instant that his right chest was pierced through, Zhou Weiqing had actually forcefully shifted his lungs to the side, allowing the sword to pierce right through the gap between his sternum. As such, although it was a thorough wound that looked horrifying, in truth it was not too serious. Zhou Weiqing had also managed to avoid injuring any of his important meridians as well!</p><br/><p>This was the miraculous power of his body in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state. Under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s meticulous control, he did not even bleed at the start. It was only at the end when he wanted to delude Shangguan Xue\u2019er that he controlled the blood to flow out of those wounds, creating the illusion that he had been severely wounded. After he had forced out a decent looking amount of blood to cover all the wounded areas, he had actually closed off the wounded area once more. He did not even need anyone to help heal him, with just the regenerative powers of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation State, that horrifying looking wounds could be recovered fully in just a relatively short period of time.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s loss could be said to be truly an unjust win, yet at the same time, not at all. She had lost to the sheer experience of Zhou Weiqing\u2026 not in terms of combat abilities, but experience in terms of being shameless and perfect acting skills. In this manner, perhaps no one else could compare with our dear Zhou Little Fatty. In a manner of speaking, it was no shame to lose to Zhou Weiqing like this\u2026 after all she was not the first, or even the most powerful person to lose to him that way!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lay down on the floor, recovering his Heavenly Energy at the same time as he healed his wounds. The Dragon-Tiger Transformation state was truly quite disgusting; his skin and muscles were originally already extremely tough and flexible, and the damage taken was smaller than it seemed. As Zhou Weiqing lifted his hands, he could clearly see the muscles, meat and even skin knitting themselves together. It was the same scenario for the wound on his chest. Though he had lost quite some blood, with the toughness of his body it was not a big deal.</p><br/><p>One could say that in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, his physical regenerative capabilities were almost as disgusting as his Heavenly Energy recovery rate! In just a short period of time, both wounds on his hands and chest were almost fully healed. His Heavenly Energy recovery was even more terrifying, with his tank almost back up to full. However, after that, he did not change to a fresh set of clothes, instead holding Shangguan Xue\u2019er in his arms like before. This time, he did not press down on her, instead laying on the ground and having her lie atop him. He then closed his eyes and concentrated, slowly circulating a thin thread of Heavenly Energy into her body to rouse her back to consciousness.</p><br/><p>Acting pitiful to gain sympathy. Such an \u2018art\u2019 had long since been perfected by Master Zhou\u2026</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er was after all not injured at all; it was a mixture of an excessive consumption of Heavenly Energy as well as too much rage at once that caused her to faint. Her physique might not be comparable to Zhou Weiqing in his Dragon-Tiger Transformation State, but it was far stronger than any ordinary human, or even most Jewel Masters. With the aid of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Heavenly Energy, she quickly regained consciousness.</p><br/><p>With a small movement, Shangguan Xue\u2019er slowly opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2014\u201d The first thing she saw when she opened her eyes was a mess of red. That was because she was lying right on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest, and was given a sudden fright by the blood soaked clothing.</p><br/><p>In her fright, she did not even realise that those wretched hands of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s were rested on her pert buttocks. Vaulting up into a sitting position, she pressed her hand onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest as she examined his heartbeat worriedly.</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, acting had to come in a full package. Zhou Weiqing had released the Dragon-Tiger Transformation and was controlling his heartbeat to a feeble slow rate.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, Zhou Weiqing, how are you?\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er wanted to use her Heavenly Energy to help him heal, but at that moment she barely had any left, and she was unable to do anything. In such a state, she was extremely worried, helping his upper body up into her embrace as she tried to wake him up.</p><br/><p>After a time, Zhou Weiqing gave a soft mumble as he slowly \u2018awakened\u2019, though the light in his eyes were dim, as if he was about to \u2018go out\u2019 at any time.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er\u2026 did\u2026I\u2026 win\u2026?\u201d Zhou Weiqing said faintly and disjointedly.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er held on this his hand and said urgently: \u201cIn this situation, you still can\u2019t forget about all that? How are you feeling?\u201d She was all too familiar with the power of her Boundless Infinitum Sword. Once someone was struck by it, the boundless power would instantly destroy all meridians and internal organs in reach. That was the reason why Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not have any suspicions about Zhou Weiqing being severely injured.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head gently, looking so horribly weak. \u201cXue\u2026 er\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can make it. It\u2026 it doesn\u2019t hurt, just\u2026 numb\u2026 Xue\u2019er\u2026 it counts\u2026 as my victory right? Help\u2026 help me\u2026 tell Bing\u2019er\u2026 and Fei\u2019er\u2026 that I really love them. I might have some \u2026 philandering ways, but\u2026 I truly\u2026 love them\u2026 cannot control\u2026 my own\u2026 emotions\u2026\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

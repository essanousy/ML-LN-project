He instantly used his Saint Energy to suppress it. His heart constricted in panic even more the moment the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s voice rang out.</p><br/><p>With such a situation before him, apart from the Heavenly God Tier Blackfiend Dragon, all of the masters from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace were here. If one of them felt suspicious toward him, it would be extremely hard for him to escape this entire ordeal. Even if he managed to escape, what about Bing\u2019er who was still in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, after the \u201cEh\u201d from the Blackfiend Dragon, it did not take any further action.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this young man? Your newly-trained disciple? I sense a familiar and cordial aura from his body,\u201d the Blackfiend Dragon asked curiously.</p><br/><p>After hearing the words \u2018familiar\u2019 and \u2018cordial\u2019, Zhou Weiqing secretly sighed in relief. He had already gotten his arguments ready as it was unrealistic for him to flee forcibly out of this situation. On top of that, he still had a mission to complete. Even if his cultivation base was discovered, he still stood a chance of winning their trust by quibbling his way out. He was from another mainland after all. Nobody on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland would be able to prove that he harbored ill will toward the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>Dumbfounded, Meng Xing stared at Zhou Weiqing and asked, \u201cFamiliar and cordial? D-Did you sense it wrongly? He\u2019s not a disciple that we nurtured. The fact that he\u2019s able to come all the way here and see you proves that he has a high rank in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Let me introduce him to you. This is Zhou Weiqing, the newly recruited Honorary God Tier Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod Tier Master? A God Tier Master with a Sixth Jewel cultivation base?\u201d Under the concealment of the Saint Energy, even the Heavenly God-tier Blackfiend Dragon could not sense Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Astonished, Meng Xing asked Zhou Weiqing, \u201cYou just broke through?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled before he replied, \u201cYeah, I just entered the Sixth Jewel tier.\u201d The reason why he deliberately revealed a slight improvement to his strength was to better conceal his true strength. The moment he learned that he might have to face a Dreadfiend Sea Naga, he had been slowly adjusting his aura.</p><br/><p>Staring at him in amazement, Meng Xing nodded to the Blackfiend Dragon. \u201cHe has proven that he\u2019s a God Tier Master with his abilities. Honorary Master Zhou has spectacular Spiritual Energy talent. It\u2019s so much more powerful than the average person. He\u2019s very close to reaching the Heavenly God tier. Not only that, his Heavenly Jewels are made up of the three attributes of Wind, Spatial, and Time. With the powerful abilities of the Time Attribute controlling the crafting process of the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, he can reverse time quickly. For this reason, he can make sure that no mistakes are made when he is crafting the scrolls. He even managed to craft a God Tier Consolidated Equipment because of this. That was why we decided to appoint him as a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. Although Honorary Master Zhou is still in his early twenties, his future is beyond promising.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon had no intention of letting Zhou Weiqing off so easily even though Meng Xing had put in a good word for him. A pair of demonic red eyes stared at him as the dragon asked, \u201cYoung man, can you tell me? Where does this familiarity and cordiality that I sense from your body come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite being insulated by Meng Xing\u2019s protective ring, Zhou Weiqing could still feel the intense and unparalleled sense of intimidation under the dragon\u2019s gaze. This sense of intimidation came from a spiritual level.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he would have to play some of his cards now.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied respectfully, \u201cI\u2019ve seen you before, sir. I think I know the reason why you sense a feeling of familiarity and cordiality from my body. Perhaps, it\u2019s because my Heavenly Jewels attributes are in harmony with yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon asked, \u201cIn harmony with mine? My attribute is pure Blackness. The ones that you possess are Wind, Time, and Spatial. How could yours possibly be in harmony with mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled lightly. The more he faced this kind of enormous pressure, the clearer his mind became. Moreover, he still possessed one distinguishing trait\u2014he was not easily intimidated. The situation at the moment was similar to the situation when he first met the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. It was the same situation all over again. Before he became a Heavenly Jewel Master, Mu En had taught him that the more dangerous the situation that he faced, the calmer he had to be. The more calm and composed you were, the safer you would be.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, Honorary Master, Meng Xing only mentioned a part of my Heavenly Jewels attributes. Actually, my Heavenly Jewels Attributes are my biggest secret. But in front of you, I no longer want to conceal it. I have a unique cultivation technique. Please give me some guidance.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, he took a few steps forward and stepped out of Meng Xing\u2019s protection ring.</p><br/><p>The moment he walked out of the protection ring, Zhou Weiqing immediately felt a sudden increase in the pressure of his surroundings. It left him slightly breathless. Still, he forced himself to stand straight as he endured it with sheer willpower.</p><br/><p>At the moment, Meng Xing looked somewhat displeased with the situation. The pair of eyes that were staring at Zhou Weiqing were completely filled with wrath. This bastard was so cowardly that he needed to hug her when they were leaping off the cliff but now he actually walked out of her protection ring so confidently in the face of the Heavenly God-tier Blackfiend Dragon? How could he possibly be scared of jumping off the cliff in the first place? What an asshole! ASSHOLE!</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for the unusual situation that they were in right now, Meng Xing would have probably given him a hard slap in the face. Still, she had to admit that the way Zhou Weiqing walked out of her protection ring, and the way he faced the Blackfiend Dragon alone was very, very manly!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing released the Heavenly Power Jewels. There were six each on both wrists. When the Alexandrite Cat Eye\u2019s Gems appeared on his left wrist, the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s pupils constricted in an obvious manner.</p><br/><p>When he waved his left hand, the six Alexandrite Cat Eye\u2019s Jewel floated in the air. At this moment, the six jewels suddenly started to change colors.</p><br/><p>Wind, Thunder, Darkness, Space, Time, Evil.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, the most shocking jewel was naturally the colorless but distorted Time jewel and the pure grey Evil jewel.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing waved both of his hands. Two equilateral triangles formed in front of him. Under the astonished gaze of the others, the six Heavenly Jewels slowly merged into one.</p><br/><p>Swoosh!</p><br/><p>The dense and intense Heavenly Energy vibrated vigorously as the brilliant light shone in every direction instantly. Six different colored halos slowly rose up to the sky. It formed a light shield that enveloped Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body. At this moment, the pressure that he felt earlier on his body decreased significantly . As he waved both of his hands again, the hexagram slowly descended and remained silent at his feet. The six halos surged up into the enshrouding mist. It appeared so dazzling and lustrous in this dark world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the people present had a much higher cultivation base than Zhou Weiqing, the moment they saw the emergence of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, nobody could suppress the look of bewilderment that crept onto their faces.</p><br/><p>The higher the cultivation base, the better a person could discern the uniqueness of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. Particularly the resonance technique that was formed by placing all six attributes on one balanced point. For those who were present, this had completely toppled their understanding of the Heavenly Jewels. On top of that, those were six different attributes!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes lighted up without any warning, and six different lights immediately appeared around his body.</p><br/><p>Wind Blade, Lightning Pearl, Compressed Spatial Cannon, Time Delay, Ball of Corrosion, and the Demonic Jewel of the Evil Attribute.</p><br/><p>These were the basic skills of the six attributes. However, being able to cast the skills of all six different attributes in an instant was something quite significant. Everybody could see that a Heavenly Jewel Master with talents like Zhou Weiqing would never store such lowly skills, but what did he actually mean when he cast them all at once?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhou Weiqing, who was in the center of the six lowly skills, calmly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy six attributes are Wind, Thunder, Darkness, Space, Time, and Evil. I think the reason why you feel the familiarity and warmness is because I possess both Darkness attribute and Evil attribute at the same time. This coincides with the Blackness attribute of yours, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, the Blackfiend Dragon had a profound interest in him. He reduced his intimidation force as much as possible as he lowered his big head down to look at him. \u201cWhat is the resonance technique that you just cast a moment ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chuckling, Zhou Weiqing replied, \u201cThis is the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation that I created myself. After I gained possession of all the six attributes, I kept wondering how I could maximize the power of the six attributes. For this reason, I have done many experiments. When I finally broke through to the Sixth Jewel tier just recently, I somehow managed to create this by chance. The secret to my Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation lies with simulation and guidance. It can guide the Atmospheric Energy in the air to greatly boost my Heavenly Energy regeneration speed, giving me greater endurance in battle. Not only that, with the help of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, I can also simulate any stored techniques of the six attributes that are six stars and below. However, since I just created it recently, I still need some time to get used to it. Still, I believe that as my strength improves, the power of my Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation will become greater and greater as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Self-created? The moment this word came out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mouth, a series of sharp gasping noises could be heard coming from behind.</p><br/><p>The gaze that Meng Xing used to look at him had become extremely strange. At first, they thought he was a genius of his generation in the field of crafting Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. However, it seemed like it was not only in this field after all. He was a prodigy in terms of cultivation as well! Six Heavenly Jewels coupled with a Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation? Seeing that he was only still in his early twenties, who would dare say that he would not become a peerless expert in the future?</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, it is the Evil Attribute. I\u2019ve not seen such a pure Evil Attribute in a very long time. That\u2019s great. Alright, from the looks of it, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace has a brighter future now. Perhaps, you can even become a great existence like me in the future. If it\u2019s not for the fact that you\u2019re still too young, you\u2019d be a great help in the war against the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon nodded his large head. He did not even bother to hide his admiration toward Zhou Weiqing. In fact, its Blackness Attribute was still a little inferior to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Evil Attribute. Sensing the energy ripples that were filled with a devilish aura, its admiration towards the young man had gone up a few notches.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied respectfully, \u201cAlthough my cultivation base is still low, since I\u2019ve joined the Mysterious Heavenly Palace and am already part of the palace, I\u2019m willing to fight against strong enemies alongside you and the other Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s comrades.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing knitted her brows as she asked, \u201cDo you have a death wish?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

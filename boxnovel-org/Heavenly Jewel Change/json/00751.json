They held their breaths and stared at him from time to time.</p><br/><p>The most nervous would naturally be Zhou Weiqing and his mother, as well as Di Feng Ling and his people. To them, the safety of Admiral Zhou was extremely important. If they could not revive Admiral Zhou, everything that Zhou Weiqing had done would be left with no meaning. He had given his all, and was really afraid that all his efforts would be in vain. If that was the case, he might not be able to take it.</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou\u2019s facial muscles twitched again, and little shivers appeared on his body, upon seeing this, Zhou Weiqing hugged his mother tightly. He was close to not being brave enough to see what happens next. After all, his father\u2019s body had almost completely collapsed due to the Fate Denying Seal\u2019s destruction. Under such circumstances, how easy would it be to aid his father in recovering his body? Prior to this, he was just trying his best to channel his Saint Energy Galaxia into his father to have the creative energies injected. He was not entirely sure if he could resurrect his father, how could he not be nervous?</p><br/><p>\u201cHu -\u201d Admiral Zhou let out a breath. The shivers on his body gradually stabilized, and he slowly opened his eyes. A faint layer of dark airflow radiated from his body. Pure Darkness Attribute circulated around his body, and nine pairs of Heavenly Jewels simultaneously appeared on both of his wrists.</p><br/><p>It was only at this point that Zhou Weiqing was relieved, and the facial expressions of the people at the sidelines brightened at the same time.</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou\u2019s eyes seemed a little lost. He stared at the people in front of him, stunned for a while, and spoke with a slightly hoarse voice, \u201cWhere\u2019s this? Am I still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, this is the Heavenly Bow Empire! Of course you\u2019re still alive, so is everyone else,\u201d Zhou Weiqing released his embrace from his mother, quickly strode two steps forward, and kneeled down before his father. He hugged his father\u2019s legs with both his arms and cried loudly.</p><br/><p>His emotions had been suppressed for too long. He had finally resurrected his father and rescued the people of the Heavenly Bow Empire. Upon his relief, all the pain and sorrow he had been holding in for long had all been released instantly. While he may be a formidable opponent who could even kill a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse moments ago, he was now only an ordinary person who was back in the arms of his parents.</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou was indeed Admiral Zhou. Looking at his grown-up son hugging his legs while sobbing, his face darkened abruptly, and lifted Zhou Weiqing by grabbing his shoulder, \u201cWhat are you crying for? I\u2019m not dead. Now tell me, what has happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, he was overwhelmed with questions, and so were the people who had just been released from the seal. He had been certain of his impending death upon casting the Fate Denying Seal. However, he came back to life now and his son had returned. \u2018What on earth was going on?\u2019 he wondered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld bastard, can\u2019t you be gentler? Without the reinforcements led by your son, none of us will be alive. My son is the hero of the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Admiral Zhou was still treating Zhou Weiqing like he did before, Ling Zihan failed to contain herself and headed over furiously. She seemed to have forgotten how much she had cried, as she was worried about her husband\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>\u201cReinforcements? Weiqing, tell me what happened. Hadn\u2019t I taught you that a true man sheds only blood and no tears?\u2019</p><br/><p>Upon being lectured by this father, Zhou Weiqing could not continue his sobbing. Right then, his heart had been overwhelmed with happiness. Even if his father were to give him two slaps, he would not have minded at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, this is how it went\u2026. Back then, when I learned of the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s annihilation of Heavenly Jewel Palace, I went to the Zhongtian Empire and returned to our Heavenly Bow Empire. I have also established armies, assembled the original soldiers of the Heavenly Bow Empire, and finally we\u2019ve attacked Heavenly Bow City. With everyone\u2019s help, we\u2019ve invaded the city, annihilated the enemies, and removed the Fate Denying Seal you\u2019ve cast.\u201d</p><br/><p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing had summarized everything he had done all these years as briefly as he could. It may sound simple, but he did not wish to mention the sufferings he had experienced ever again.</p><br/><p>While he spoke, Zhou Weiqing led his father to Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, \u201cDad, let me introduce someone to you. This is my Master, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor who everyone refers to as The Strongest in The World, and goes by the family name of Long.\u201d He did not feel comfortable to address his master\u2019s name directly, so that was all he could say.</p><br/><p>Although Long Shiya had restrained his Heavenly Energy, he was still a Heavenly Emperor. His strong aura was still unique despite being held back. After all, Admiral Zhou had entered the realm of Nine Jewels, thus, he could clearly sense the terrifying powers of Long Shiya. He quickly bowed, \u201cThank you senior, for saving Heavenly Bow Empire from disaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the few words of the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse were enough to throw the people of the Heavenly Bow Empire into shock. They had never met any Heavenly Jewel Masters of such a level!</p><br/><p>Long Shiya chuckled, and said, \u201cYou have a wonderful son. Since I\u2019m his master, let us speak on equal terms. You don\u2019t have to address me as senior either. I\u2019m Long Shiya.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, Admiral Zhou was not familiar with the name Long Shiya. It was even his first time hearing that name. With his cultivation back then, he had not been qualified to have any knowledge of Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your aid, senior\u201d Admiral Zhou bowed once again, but it was not just for himself this time; it was also for his people and his son.</p><br/><p>With a flash of his plump silhouette, Long Shiya did not accept his respect, \u201cAdmiral Zhou, you\u2019ve mistaken. It wasn\u2019t I who had saved your life, it was somebody else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing his words, Zhou Shui Niu was stunned momentarily, and thought, \u2018It wasn\u2019t him?\u2019 However, he very well understood the best extent of powers of his Fate Denying Seal. It would be challenging even for a Heavenly King-tier powerhouse to remove it. Since Zhou Weiqing had been able to have a Heavenly Emperor come to his aid, it should obviously be the senior who had saved them! No matter what, he still could not identify anyone among the crowd who had the abilities to destroy his Fate Denying Seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t joke with me, senior. Other than you, who else is capable of rescuing the Heavenly Bow Empire from the disaster?\u201d Zhou Shui Niu said, puzzled.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya chucked, and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this simple? The person is just right in front of you. He\u2019s your beloved son! I have to admit that I\u2019ve not done much; it was his own powers that had saved your Heavenly Bow Empire. If you must, you should thank him, which brings me to the fact that the whole of your Heavenly Bow Empire should be thanking him well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing?\u201d disbelief appeared on Admiral Zhou\u2019s face. He thought secretly, \u2018How could I not know my own son? This brat may have become a Heavenly Jewel Master, but with his cultivation base, how is it possible for him to destroy my Fate Denying Seal?\u2019</p><br/><p>At this moment, Di Feng Ling had already walked to Admiral Zhou\u2019s side, \u201cBrother, let\u2019s not discuss this as the battle is still ongoing outside. It won\u2019t be too late to resume our conversation after we\u2019ve solved the pressing matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou quickly nodded in agreement, \u2018Weiqing, bring me to the battlefield.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, and said, \u201cRelax, dad. I have everything under control. This battle won\u2019t be needing you at all. The seal had just been removed; you need to rest now. Godfather, why don\u2019t you have the guards and servants clean up the palace? Then, all you have to do is just wait for our victorious return. Oh, that\u2019s right! My wives, come over and meet your father-in-law and mother-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shangguan Triplets and Tian\u2019er rushed forward, and bowed at Admiral Zhou and Ling Zihan, \u201cNice to meet you, uncle and auntie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou stared in astonishment as the four beautiful ladies, and could not regain his senses for a brief moment. He pointed at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cBrat, they, they\u2019re all your\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing cackled, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, dad, they are all mine, and these are your daughter-in-laws as well. Aren\u2019t I great?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Shui Niu glared at them, but said softly, \u201cStand, ladies. After things have wrapped up, I\u2019ll treat you well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four ladies had heard from Zhou Weiqing that Admiral Zhou was rather short-tempered, but when they saw that they could still hold a conversation with their future father-in-law, they let out a breath of relief. They bowed once more and retreated to the sides.</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling also became more occupied. There was also an advantage for all the people of Heavenly Bow Empire to be gathered, as a large number of guards and servants were still present. As it had been sealed previously, the place did not suffer much damage and thus cleaning it up would not be difficult.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said to Di Feng Ling, \u201cGodfather, I\u2019ll have a look outside. I think our big armies will be advancing here soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like what Zhou Weiqing had said, the battles outside may still be happening in full swing, but there were no longer any concerns.</p><br/><p>The key point of this war was the element of surprise. Although there were responses from the army union of Kalise and Bai Da, their first response was that something had happened in Heavenly Bow City. The higher-ups of the army union knew that there were numerous powerhouses on guard in the city. Therefore, they did not bother much about what was happening. It was only until the armies of the Heavenly Bow Empire had begun their advance that the fire descending from the sky almost instantly presented them with the conclusion of the war.</p><br/><p>All this while, Peerless Regiment had been a formidable force which was capable of turning the tables around during the whole war. At the Northern Border, they had managed to eliminate a huge number of their enemies, although their opponents were the strong armies of the Wan Shou Empire. As time went by, the overall powers of Peerless Regiment had been on the rise, and this time, the entire Peerless Regiment had participated in the war.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Because of the spiritual connection between them, he did not dare to have any filthy, lusty thoughts at all. For someone as wretched as him, it was undoubtedly a painful torment.</p><br/><p>Naturally, in addition to this torture, he also felt a bit of triumph in his heart. After all, the Elven Queen was sharing a life with him for goodness sake! The alliance between them now could be described to be rock solid. No matter how close the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace was with the Elf Tribe, it looked like his own Peerless Sect was about to replace the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and become good friend with the Elf Tribe, forming a relationship that more tightly knitted.</p><br/><p>Two figures rose to the sky. The next moment, Zhou Weiqing took the queen\u2019s hand and as a silver light flashed, the two of them faded into the sky.</p><br/><p>Now that they had this spiritual connection between them, he could clearly pinpoint the location of the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land with the help of the Elven Queen. After all, what was faster than Spatial Travel? Even though he would have to consume a higher amount of Saint Energy, he did not really mind much as he was too anxious to see all his loved ones. Not only that, now that his cultivation base had once again elevated, he really did not care about the amount of energy consumed at all.</p><br/><p>This time, the Spatial Travel that he used was completely different from the one that he unleashed when they were chasing the enemy previously. Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel the tremendous reduction in his Saint Energy consumption now. More amazingly, maybe due to the fact that he was holding the Elven Queen\u2019s hand and how they had a spiritual connection now, the Elven Queen was actually sharing the Saint Energy consumption load with him. In other words, they could now go to a much farther distance with their Spatial Travel, something that not even a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse could do.</p><br/><p>Right now, the Elven Queen\u2019s heart seemed to have calmed down a little. In their peculiar Spatial Travel, she never once had her heart changed at all. Zhou Weiqing also tried to restrain his thought as best as he could. Not daring to have any dirty thoughts, the Elven Queen was merely a friend in his mind.</p><br/><p>A silver light flickered and when the two reappeared again, they had already returned to the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land. With the Elven Queen by his side and his own Saint Energy in his body, the sealing effect of the Sealed Land did not impact him at all.</p><br/><p>The moment they stepped foot again in the Sealed Land, Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen could clearly feel the changes to this place. Originally, the Sealed Land was already full of vigor but at this moment, they were astonished to find that the vitality here was so dense to the point that it was almost visible to the naked eye. Just taking several deep breaths was already more than enough to make one\u2019s vitality palpitate with eagerness. The natural elements here were so rich that it even automatically elicited a faint green light from the Elven Queen. Due to the fact that Zhou Weiqing was now sharing a life with her, he could clearly feel the vitality that was increasing at a breakneck speed in her body. The speed was so terribly fast that it could only be described as horrifying. Even his own vitality was elevated along with it.</p><br/><p>What a wonderful feeling this was! Now that they were already the ultimate powerhouses in this world now, an increase in their vitality might not be too much help towards their cultivation bases. However, it still brought along with it amazing benefits to their physical strength. On top of that, the Elven Queen could now absorb the natural elements here directly. Zhou Weiqing was absolutely certain that the Elven Queen was now the most invincible individual on the entire mainland. Unless he could increase his own cultivation base to the Heavenly God Tier and use his Saint Energy to mobilize the natural elements here, there was no way for him to even compete with her at all.</p><br/><p>Levitating in mid-air, the Elven Queen fixed her gaze in a single direction. She appeared to be utterly stunned as her delicate body started to tremble ever so slightly.</p><br/><p>When they had returned to the Elf Tribe, Zhou Weiqing originally wanted to let go of her hand to prevent the other Elves from misunderstanding. To his surprise, the Elven Queen actually held on to his hand tighter, refusing to even let go.</p><br/><p>Her little hands were a little cold. Still, he could clearly feel the excitement in her heart from the spiritual connection between them.</p><br/><p>After being stunned for about five minutes, the Elven Queen slowly regained her senses. Her heart started to flutter at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s really no need to,\u201d Sensing the thoughts in her, Zhou Weiqing could not help but say.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen turned around to look at him. Both her eyes and thoughts were clear and firm as she made her decision. Not long later, her body gave off a layer of green light that was crystal clear. The light was filled with radiance, made of vitality and endless breaths of life as well as a</p><br/><p>Not long after that, a layer of rich green light that was as clear as crystal was exuded from her body. Glorious light shot out to the surroundings from the layers of light; it was full of endless life and a verdant allure. As the green light rose to the skies, Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel the light trembling throughout the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land. Another azure green light could be seen soaring up to the sky as well in the distance.</p><br/><p>This time, it was the Elven Queen\u2019s turn to lead Zhou Weiqing. Under the rich pulsating light of the Life Energy, she took a step out into the void. At once, everything turned into a blur and he was able to feel the intensity of the fluctuations in the surrounding life energy through his senses. Immediately, the enormous amount of Life Energy transformed into a bridge and transported them to another place.</p><br/><p>At the next moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze was immediately attracted by the amazing before him.</p><br/><p>It was a huge tree that he had never seen before. Even the size of the giant trees in the Luster Spatial Realm paled in comparison. This tree before him was at least 300 feet high and had an azure green trunk as if it was carved out of emerald. Still, how could there possibly be such a huge piece of emerald in this world?</p><br/><p>The huge tree canopy spread through the air like a huge platform. At first glance, one could clearly see the clear green fog that was gleaming with steam on top. That was the essence of the Life Energy. One could not help but wonder how much vitality it had to have in order to cope with such a monstrous amount of Life Energy!</p><br/><p>The size of the canopy itself was so massive that it was almost the same size as the Zhongtian Public Square in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s. Every leaf and branch appeared to be so crystal-clear and transparent and the branches hung low all over the place like a waterfall. The rich breath of life made the entire place look as if one was in a dream. Such a wonderful scene was undoubtedly something that Zhou Weiqing would never come across again.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen who was holding Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand at the moment suddenly turned completely transparent. The azure green radiating from her body also gradually transformed to a peculiar golden color. Though it was still a golden light, it was not the energy ripple that she once exuded. Instead, it was a vigorous vitality that was even more massive than what the gigantic tree before them had.</p><br/><p>Facing the gigantic tree in front of her, tears streamed down the Elven Queen\u2019s face as she muttered, \u201cI-It\u2019s evolved! Finally! It\u2019s really evolved now! It\u2019s been so long that we Elves have lived in this Sealed Land, trembling in fear every single day for fear that this Ancient Tree of Life would wilt and die at any time. Weiqing, do you know that the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution means that we Elves have regained the possibility of dominating the mainland once again? With the enormous vitality of the Ancient Tree of Life, it\u2019ll be able to envelop at least a third of the Boundless Mainland once we\u2019ve broken the seal. By that time, the Elven warriors would be almost invincible in that world. The Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution would also increase our life extension threefold. It would only take a hundred years at most for us to regain the power to strive for hegemony and unify the entire mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not say anything but he knew that what the Elven Queen said was possible. The vitality coming from the Ancient Tree of Life in front of him now was absolutely horrifying; so terrible that it could no longer be judged or measured at all. It was not an exaggeration when she said that its breath of life could cover a third of the mainland. Heck, that remark was an understatement in itself.</p><br/><p>If the vitality of the Elven Ancient Tree of Life covered the entire mainland, this would mean that the Elven Warriors would come to possess extremely powerful combat abilities under its cover, making it very hard to kill them. Coupled with the fact that the Elven Queen would be almost invincible under the envelopment of the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s vitality, it was not impossible for them to end up ruling the entire mainland. She had even given a duration of a hundred years for them to accumulate enough vitality to take over the mainland.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could feel chills running down his spine. If all of this was to become a reality, the Elves would most likely cause massive bloodshed in the near future. After all, it was all due to the rise of mankind that had caused them to imprison themselves in the Sealed Land in the first place. There was no doubt that the Elves had a bad impression toward the human race. On top of that, he was the also initiator of the events that had yet to come. Had he not infused his Saint Energy into the Elven Queen to rescue her in the first place, this Ancient Tree of Life would most probably be unable to complete its evolution.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen turned her head and looked at Zhou Weiqing. At that moment, he was astonished to find that he could not read her emotions at all.</p><br/><p>Gently shaking her head, a warm smile appeared on her delicate face, \u201cDo you know that after the Ancient Tree of Life has evolved, it has now become sentient. In certain ways, it\u2019s actually my body and I\u2019m its heart. Because of this, it no longer needs to root itself in a solitary place any longer. It now can move as freely as it likes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he heard what she said, Zhou Weiqing could no longer keep his cool. With eyes full of bewilderment, he looked at her as he shouted out loud, \u201cYour Majesty! You must think twice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being able to move anywhere meant that the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s tremendous vitality could shroud any corner of the mainland at its whim! The Elves already commanded horrifying strength and within a few years, a large number of Elven powerhouses would be produced. By that time, the Elves would potentially become a terrible nightmare for the humans.</p><br/><p>At once, as if acting as a backdrop for the words uttered by the Elven Queen, a huge number of Elves flew towards them from every directions and innumerable places. A group of Elves had also gathered not far behind Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen. Yet, seeing the rich golden light emanating from her body, they did not dare to come nearer for fear of disrupting them. They only kneeled and bowed close to the ground respectfully from afar.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

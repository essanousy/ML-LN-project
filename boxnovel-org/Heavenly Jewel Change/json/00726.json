The huge energy waves made everyone shiver from the depths of their hearts.</p><br/><p>At the instant of explosion, the damage to the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing were obviously the greatest, as they were the nearest to the scene. At the very last moment, the Blackfiend Dragon shielded Meng Xing with its wings and protected her as best as it could with its Heavenly God-tier body. The complete set of the Blackfiend Dragon Armor Set on Meng Xing also played its key role which prevented Meng Xing from being torn to pieces.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, the terrifying explosion still flung everyone away, and the huge shockwaves caused them to be scattered across the ocean within a hundred miles.</p><br/><p>The six Heavenly King-tier elders turned into dust immediately. It was at this time that the strengths and weaknesses of one\u2019s cultivations were being demonstrated. The five Heavenly Emperor-tier elders survived. Although they were all gravely injured, they managed to stay alive thanks to the protection of the Ward of Darkness.</p><br/><p>Similarly, another who survived was Nie Han. Although he did not possess the cultivation base of Heavenly God-tier, he was still on a level of Heavenly King-tier. Most importantly, he was wearing a nine-piece legendary armor set In terms of defense, he far surpassed the regular elders.</p><br/><p>However, from the horrifying explosion, even the other Dreadfiend Sea Naga had been flung away, it was only normal for them to be thrown to different directions by the explosion, with all of them being separated from each other.</p><br/><p>Also during this horrifying explosion, at the core area of the explosion, the ocean seemed to have instantly plummeted hundreds of feet. Even the sand on the seabed had sunken, followed by huge, tidal waves.</p><br/><p>With the powerful shockwaves along with the huge waves, it happened in an instant. Even if there were to be anyone who was still partly conscious, they would not be able to see anyone anymore.</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing was not really injured by the fearsome explosion, the Demon God he had summoned had vanished into nothingness. At the same time, he felt as if he had lost the connection with that particular bloodline, thus rendering him unable to summon the Demon God once again, no matter how much he managed to channel his Saint Energy in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>In the same manner, the final powers of the Demon God had protected his body but were unable to stop the explosion from flinging his body away. Everything in the surroundings had turned unrealistic \u2014 being on the sea surface at a second and under the torrential waves at the very next. After an unknown amount of time had passed, the surroundings calmed down.</p><br/><p>The strong concussion may not have caused grave damage to Zhou Weiqing, but he still slumbered into unconsciousness due to the stress that affected his body.</p><br/><p>Regardless of how fearful the previous explosion had been, the sea was still the great ol\u2019 sea. Even with the destructive force of such a scale, it was insignificant to the vast ocean.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the ocean had regained its serenity. Everything had quieted down while things were now tranquil.</p><br/><p>After an unknown amount of time, Zhou Weiqing felt like something was touching its face. He gradually recovered his senses and subconsciously opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>In the next instant, he shut it because when he had his eyes opened, the first thing he saw was the blinding sunlight.</p><br/><p>Shielding his face with his palm, Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes again once he had familiarized himself with that blinding light. Blocked by his hands, he could not clearly see what was happening outside. Right then, he had recovered his consciousness as well as his memories and had recalled the previous events. What surprised him was that he felt as if he was on land, and not floating on the sea.</p><br/><p>Through the gaps between his fingers, he saw the body of a female. Naturally, it was clothed!</p><br/><p>He sat up abruptly and Saint Energy seemed to flow through his entire being instantly. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation had not weakened. A layer of silverish white light seemed to completely engulf his body in an instant.</p><br/><p>The person adjacent to him was unperturbed despite his reactions, and after Zhou Weiqing had taken a good look, he could not help but exclaim, \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sitting not far from him, a pale pretty face laced with surprise and other complicated emotions appeared before Zhou Weiqing. \u201cIsn\u2019t this Meng Xing,\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, other than Meng Xing, there was no one else.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing had changed into a set of clean clothes but her face was shockingly pale which demonstrated that she was definitely unhealthy. Her whole being laid on the beach, making her look feminine and vulnerable. It seemed like even a gust of wind could blow away the female dragon-slaying warrior.</p><br/><p>Looking at the shining silverish white Saint Energy radiating from Zhou Weiqing, the corner of Meng Xing\u2019s lips curled, with evident sarcasm, \u201cYou\u2019re finally awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Staring at her weak but energetic gaze, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt his face heating up. During that time, there was no longer any reason for him to conceal his cultivation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Zhou Weiqing stood up and looked around. He then realized that they were on an island.</p><br/><p>The island did not look big, but it was only because the entire island could not be seen due to the rocks and reefs behind them, in comparison to the vast ocean right in front of them. At this point, the ocean looked really calm as if nothing had occurred before.</p><br/><p>The sun had begun to set in the West. It was still morning when they were fighting against the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. It seemed that he had been unconscious for four to six hours.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis should be a small island out in the sea, as for its distance from the mainland, I\u2019m not sure either. I\u2019ve only woken up an hour before you did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing spoke blandly, there were no emotions and her frigid words were uncomfortable to the ear.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing forced a smile and said, \u201cYou\u2019re indeed a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse. Your adaptability is much stronger than mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing suddenly laughed, although her face was pale and her hair was messy, nothing could conceal her beauty and elegance, \u201cA Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse? I\u2019ll be easily killed even by a Heavenly Jewel Master with a Three Jewel cultivation base right now. At least sixty percent of my meridians have been destroyed, and I have less than twenty percent of my powers left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon registering her words, Zhou Weiqing was stunned. Although he had guessed that Meng Xing\u2019s injuries were not minor, he had never expected them to be so serious.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s gaze suddenly turned sharp as she stared hard at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cYou, it\u2019s you who\u2019s the strong one! Facing a Heavenly God-tier Dreadfiend Sea Naga all by yourself without any support, you not only managed to delay your opponent but was able to retreat in one piece. How should I address you? Dear Mister Undercover?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s facial muscles twitched slightly, \u201cWhat Mister Undercover? I don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s right, I did hide some of my true powers, but it was only by means of self-defense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing sat up abruptly. Due to her movements affecting her injuries, the pain was evident on her pretty face. Zhou Weiqing hurried to help her, but Meng Xing shrieked loudly, \u201cDon\u2019t come close.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could only halt his steps.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing lifted one arm slowly and opened up her palm, revealing a ring. Zhou Weiqing was stunned and quickly lowered his head to look. It was then he realized that his Sumeru Ring had switched places.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing said furiously, \u201cDo you still want to lie to me? You should know better than I do about the content of this ring. I may not know the others, but how could I not know the Neptune Shuttle? Years ago, the Neptune Shuttle had long been lost on the Boundless Mainland, do I still need to elaborate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face froze. No matter how he would quibble, the evidence was right before them \u2013 he had no other choice.</p><br/><p>With a bitter laugh, Zhou Weiqing shook his head helplessly and said, \u201cAlright, since you\u2019ve found out, there\u2019s no meaning for me to continue concealing the truth. You\u2019re right, Bing\u2019er and I came from the Boundless Mainland, and we\u2019ve arrived here by the Neptune Shuttle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing stared coldly at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cThat despicable saint land in the Boundless Mainland\u2026 Have you forgotten the vow that year? Is it really just the both of you who came this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing answered, \u201cIt\u2019s only the two of us, and you\u2019ve misunderstood. We don\u2019t belong to any of the saint lands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still trying to lie your way out.\u201d Meng Xing was infuriated.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged, \u201cWhat reason do I have to lie to you? You\u2019ve said so yourself, even a Heavenly Jewel Master of a cultivation base of three jewels can easily take your life. How am I inferior to an Upper Shi Tier Heavenly Jewel Master? If it wasn\u2019t for the vow that year, the creatures which came this time around won\u2019t be of our levels. You\u2019ve seen it yourself, I may have concealed my powers but my cultivation base is only of nine jewels. If the promise was to be ignored, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for our Five Great Saint Lands of the Boundless Mainland to send a few Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the serious look on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face, Meng Xing could not help but partially believe his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, even if you\u2019re not from the Five Great Saint Lands of the Boundless Mainland, what\u2019s your purpose then? What\u2019s your motive for joining the Mysterious Heavenly Palace? You still dare to say that you\u2019re not undercover?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed, walked to Meng Xing and sat adjacent to her, \u201cYes, I\u2019m here undercover. That\u2019s right, I\u2019ve fooled you. I\u2019m here for the Spatial Transportation Stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s iris shrank instantly, and just as she was about to let out her rage, the words from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mouth had stunned her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you? Do you dare say you haven\u2019t lied to me? Should I call you Meng Xing, or the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master?\u201d Zhou Weiqing sounded cool, and at this moment, his demeanor had calmed down as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m no fool. It was obvious that your words were much powerful than those of the Palace Master named Dongfang. The elders below may not know, but the four Supreme Elders and God Tier Master Nie Han must\u2019ve known. For every crucial decision, your words have always been the final conclusion. Furthermore, during conflicts, they\u2019ll subconsciously direct their gaze toward you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Dark Demon God Lightning! (2)</b></p><br/><p>The members of the Fei Li Battle Team and Dan Dun Battle Team reacted almost instantly, as both sides leapt onto the stage as quickly as they could.</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing had somehow snatched victory, it was clear that he was also in dire straits. To be able to unleash a skill that not only took out Shen Little Demon\u2019s final blow, but also take her down, how could his current body possibly withstand such an immense power?</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo and the others did not even have time to be excited about their win. The only thing in their minds now was whether or not Zhou Weiqing was alright.</p><br/><p>As the members of both sides jumped onto stage, all of a sudden, a terrifying aura came pressing down onto the entire stage. Instantly, the members in mid air were suddenly forced down onto the ground, unable to move, or even breathe.</p><br/><p>No one knew when or how, but abruptly there was a man standing on the stage.</p><br/><p>Simple features, deep piercing eyes, and that immense and powerful aura. This man was the one who had been hiding in the shadows for the entire fight, Shangguan Longyin.</p><br/><p>Both sides, suppressed onto the ground, looked at Shangguan Longyin in confusion. No matter the Fei Li Battle Team or the Dan Dun Battle Team, none of them could understand why the overall main judge would appear on the stage at this time.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin swept his gaze across their faces, before finally recalling his aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, both sides. The two of them will not die so easily. As the main judge, I need to verify something to ensure the sanctity and fairness of this Tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he lifted his hand towards Zhou Weiqing, whose body was immediately brought towards him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was still conscious, but he was unable to make any movement, and could only watch as his body floated towards Shangguan Longyin.</p><br/><p>Hearing Shangguan Longyin\u2019s words, the faces of the Fei Li Battle Team changed. Only then did they remember that Zhou Weiqing had just unleashed the Demonic Change\u2026 the taboo of the entire mainland!</p><br/><p>Since the Fei Li Battle Team understood so quickly, naturally the Dan Dun Battle Team understood as well, their vexed faces turning slightly better. They were all eagerly waiting for Shangguan Longyin to announce that Zhou Weiqing was a heretic from the Heavenly Demon Sect, and the best case scenario would be that he would be put to death immediately, to assuage their anger and hate. How could their Leader possibly lose to such a mere fellow of three-Jeweled cultivation level\u2026 this was definitely a terrible insult and humiliation to not just the Blood Red Hell, but also the entire Dan Dun Empire.</p><br/><p>As for Little Witch, who was standing at the entrance of the Kalise Battle Team Rest House, a look of relief crossed her face. Only she truly understood what Shangguan Longyin was doing, and what the result would be.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was drawn directly in front of Shangguan Longyin, and he felt as if the entire air around him was sealed and congealed, causing him to stand there stiffly without falling through no effort of his own. He did not feel particularly weak, just totally numb, as if his own body did not belong to him.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin pressed his right hand onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s forehead, his palm shining with a crystalline white; it was the mark of the Heavenly Dao Energy, the final stage of the four great stages of Heavenly Energy. Without question, this Shangguan Longyin was at least of the Heavenly King Stage or higher.</p><br/><p>In an instance, the white light enveloped Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body. Currently, not only the members of the Fei Li Battle Team were watching anxiously, even the ZhongTian Emperor sitting at the VIP Stage, Shangguan Tianxin, as well as his niece Shangguan Xue\u2019er beside him, were equally nervous.</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Bing\u2019er had told them he did not have links with the Heavenly Demon Sect, but he could after all control his own Demonic Change. If Shangguan Longyin discovered that he was truly controlled by the Heavenly Demon Sect, then all their previous plans would be moot, and there would be no discussion of him marrying into the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianxin knew that this clansman of his had been impressed by this youth in front of him, and truly cherished such a great talent; at the same time, a killing intent was sparked in his heart. If Zhou Weiqing was from the Heavenly Demon Sect, he would not hesitate to finish him off. They could not risk having someone from the Heavenly Demon Sect infiltrate their Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace by marrying Shangguan Bing\u2019er, that could possibly cause the downfall of their Great Saint Land.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, if Shangguan Longyin could prove that Zhou Weiqing was a member of the Heavenly Demon Sect, he would definitely do everything in his power to protect this youth. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s talent and genius was visible to everyone present, almost to a terrifying level. If such a young man grew up to be their enemy, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace would not be able to sleep in peace! As such, this was a critical moment even for a Great Saint Lands like them.</p><br/><p>Several minutes passed, before Shangguan Longyin finally withdrew his right palm. His tightened face relaxed, and he glanced towards the VIP Stage, nodding imperceptibly towards Shangguan Tianxin.</p><br/><p>On his seat, Shangguan Tianxin sat back deeper into his seat, sighing in relief as a faint smile crossed his lips. Since Shangguan Longyin did not find any sign of seals or curses of the Heavenly Demon Sect in Zhou Weiqing, that meant that he was truly not of the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p><br/><p>He was not suspicious that this was some cunning plan of subterfuge by the Heavenly Demon Sect. After all, with such an outstanding talent like Zhou Weiqing, if the Heavenly Demon Sect actually got their claws in him, how could they not possibly want to control him? Why would they risk revealing him at this point?</p><br/><p>If Zhou Weiqing was not of the Heavenly Demon Sect, that meant it was truly an amazing news for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. With his six Attributes, and the ability to control the Demonic Change\u2026 in a few dozen years\u2026 heh heh\u2026 perhaps the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s slight advantage over the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace would no longer exist.</p><br/><p>As he thought up to this point, Shangguan Tianxin was put in a very good mood. Although Zhou Weiqing was currently not part of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, they were definitely in the advantage. After all, he was Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s man! <i>Looks like I\u2019ll have to have a good chat with Second Brother.</i></p><br/><p>Of course, back on the tournament stage, Zhou Weiqing did not know all the various repercussions his actions had brought about. Currently, he was feeling rather out of sorts, almost vexed. Being treated like a lab rat by Shangguan Longyin, how could he possibly be happy?</p><br/><p>He thought to himself. <i>Dammit, when your Father, I, reach the Heavenly King Stage in the future, I\u2019ll also play around with others like that. Hmph Hmph Hmph!</i></p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin looked towards the Dan Dun Battle Team, saying solemnly: \u201cAs the head judge, I have examined him closely. This Zhou Weiqing does not have the seal of the Heavenly Demon Sect, and the Demonic Change he used is a controlled Demonic Change. As such, he is not considered a heretic. The previous fight will still be counted, and the results remain unchanged. As the official judge, I proclaim, the final round of the preliminary heats, Third Group Fei Li Battle Team is the victor.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he waved his hands, and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body floated back down to land amongst Lin TianAo and the other team members. Shangguan Longyin continued, his voice softening a few notches: \u201cHe is totally exhausted, almost to the point of exhausting his life force, and he will need a lot to rest to recuperate. I\u2019m afraid that he will not be able to fight in at least the next round. However, for you all to be able to beat a seeded team in the preliminary heats, you have already made history.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Shangguan Longyin waved his hand again; this time Shen Little Demon was brought in front of him. Although in his heart he was on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side, he had to go through the motions to help both sides; after all, the Blood Red Hell was also a Great Saint Lands.</p><br/><p>As she was brought in front of him, Shangguan Longyin placed a hand on her wrist and extended his senses. Moments later, his face changed; even with his cultivation level, he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a shocked expression, glancing involuntarily to Zhou Weiqing, who was currently being carted away by Lin TianAo and the other Fei Li Battle Team members.</p><br/><p>After a short pause, Shangguan Longyin said: \u201cLet the tournament continue,\u201d before jumping off the stage with Shen Little Demon, leading the rest of the Dan Dun Battle Team members towards their Rest House.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Back in the Fei Li Battle Team Rest House.</p><br/><p>The team members carried Zhou Weiqing back to the Rest House, before staring at each other haplessly.</p><br/><p>Drunken Bao muttered: \u201cIs\u2026 is this real?! We actually defeated the Dan Dun Battle Team? Crow, give me a slap, I want to know if it hurts or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! I love requests like this.\u201d Crow lifted up her hand.</p><br/><p>Drunken Bao realised his foolishness at the last moment. \u201cWait! No! Don\u2019t! Not you\u2026 Xiao Yan, you do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glared at him exasperatedly and gave him a solid kick in the buttocks. \u201cYou useless bum!\u201d</p><br/><p>Drunken Bao stumbled forward from the kick, and twisting his neck back to look at the foot imprint on his pants, he blinked and said: \u201cDamn, it really hurt. Looks like this isn\u2019t a dream! We\u2026 we really won!\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, he was not the only one. Every member of the Fei Li Battle Team still had the feeling like this was not real, like the entire day was a dream. After staring at each other for a moment, their gazes finally rested upon Zhou Weiqing, and their expressions turned strange.</p><br/><p>For Zhou Weiqing to be able to beat Shen Little Demon, he did not only shock all the outsiders, but even their entire team was shocked as well. Three Jewels versus Six Jewels, Upper Level Shi Heavenly Jewel Master against a Upper Level Zun Heavenly Jewel Master\u2026 who would have thought?!</p><br/><p>The Fei Li Battle Team had indeed beaten the Dan Dun Battle Team, and even more so, it had done so by winning the 1v1 against two of their strongest members. Perhaps it could be argued that Little Four had won entirely by a stroke of luck, but Zhou Weiqing\u2019s fight was definitely not so. Shen Little Demon had not been underestimating him, and with her anger, she had definitely been out to kill. Yet, he had been on the upper hand from the start of the fight to the finish. Such a victory was indeed an honour, or perhaps, almost an impossibility. Even if it wasn\u2019t impossible to duplicate such a feat in the future, it was certainly a feat of history.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was still lying there gasping for breath, his entire body numb and senseless. He could not even speak, and his expression was ugly.</p><br/><p>Looking at him like that, Lin TianAo and the rest were at a loss on how to help him. They did not dare attempt to use their Heavenly Energy to help him, as they did not know what was the issue; lest they cause more harm than good.</p><br/><p>Luckily, Shangguan Longyin had said that Zhou Weiqing was only overly exhausted, and there should be no threat to his life.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, a soft, almost shy, voice sounded out: \u201cBig bros and sis, can I come in please?\u201d</p><br/><p>As everyone turned towards the entrance, their jaws dropped as an interesting look flashed on their faces. This shy voice belonged to that young girl who had almost killed them all, Little Witch!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan said slowly, his face full of distrust: \u201cWhy are you here? We do not welcome you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch said, a little aggrievedly: \u201cMy intentions are good, I am here to help him.\u201d As she said that, she pointed a small finger towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>*Swoosh* A white shadow blurred across the room, landing beside Zhou Weiqing. It was Fat Cat, and its eyes were filled with enmity as it glared at Little Witch, before roaring lightly at her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

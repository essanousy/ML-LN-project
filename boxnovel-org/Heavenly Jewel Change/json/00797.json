Even the Heavenly Jewel Masters did not know either. Only the Heavenly King-tier cultivators were able to make a vague guess. However, the further they guessed, the more terrified they felt. What kind of Consolidated Equipment Scroll needed this type of crafting process? The Consolidating Ink was even more astounding. It actually turned into a dragon.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s actions were very steady. The jade-green light expanded slowly in the air. It gradually started to take shape as it continued every stroke. It did not stop at all. However, a warped light would appear at certain times and it would cause the green color to retreat a little before it expanded once again.</p><br/><p>Down below, Duan Tianlang had somewhat recovered his mental strength with the help of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy. He then flew up to the sky. Even though Galaxia Sedimentation prevented him from getting any closer, he could see everything despite being so far away.</p><br/><p>\u2018Rhythm, rhythm,\u2019 Duan Tianlang muttered in his heart. He was more anxious than anyone else. Even more so than Zhou Weiqing himself. The success of this would be an unprecedented success of crafting Consolidating Ink. The blood that Elven Queen had willingly given was so pure, it resulted in the perfect fusion of every material and treasure at the final moment. It even protected the Aqua Tide. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s consolidation did not seem to be going too smoothly. Naturally he knew that every time there was a reversal, it was a sign that Zhou Weiqing was using Time Reversal to regain control. His control of it was already at the point of perfection.</p><br/><p>Perhaps a truly experienced God Tier Master would have a chance in completing it all in a single stroke. However, it was clearly impossible for Zhou Weiqing. So, what he needed was not only the cultivation base of a Heavenly Emperor-tier, but the superior powers of the Heavenly God Tier. Only with enough support from his Saint Energy can he continue using Time Reversal over the course of the entire consolidation process, hold on to the rhythm, and craft the scroll. Based on the current situation, even though he may not have reached a stage where it was smooth sailing, at least there were no issues throughout the entire crafting process. Just this fact alone made Duan Tianlang sighed in relief. Everything seemed to be on the right track. All that remained was to wait; wait for Zhou Weiqing to complete this miracle. If he succeeded, Duan Tianlang dared to say that this disciple of his senior brother, would definitely be the number one cultivator in less than ten years\u2019 time.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, outside of Heavenly Bow City, a group of of dark shadows flew towards the city at top speed. Their numbers were nothing to shout out as there were only seven of them. However, every one of them had speed that was like fleeting lights and sweeping shadows. It was as if every time their bodies flashed, they moved more than a hundred meters forward. It was not any slower than the speed of flight. However, they were definitely capable of flying based on the energy and auras their bodies emitted.</p><br/><p>These seven people were completely clad in black. Their bodies gave off an aura filled with darkness and destruction. If any normal person was to go near them, they would have fallen ill under the influence of this aura even if they were not attacked.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsolidating in the void. This is the method to craft the eleventh Consolidated Equipment Scroll. We must stop him. Does Duan Tianlang already have this ability?\u201d The man in black at the forefront of the group exclaimed in a hoarse voice.</p><br/><p>If one had a closer look, one would have noticed that the seven people clad in black had extremely slim and petite bodies and as they flashed across the sky, they did not even give off any energy ripples.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. 1, our task today is to kill that Zhou Weiqing. Not to create new problems and complicate the issue.\u201d Another person in black who was following him closely behind spoke in a malicious voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know. Eh, it isn\u2019t Duan Tianlang consolidating over there.\u201d The seven people in black had already reached the outskirts of the city. With a glance, they could tell that it was Zhou Weiqing who was in the midst of consolidating in the sky. When they saw the method that Zhou Weiqing had used to consolidate; which was to draw in the ink in the void, their black eyes that displayed a fiery blaze showed a hint of shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to argue this time. It\u2019s Zhou Weiqing who\u2019s consolidating right now.\u201d No. 1 produced a blueprint from his chest and spread it out. The drawing on the blueprint was a portrait of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s likeness.</p><br/><p>They could see the Heavenly King-tier and Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivators in the sky very clearly. Every person in black immediately masked their aura. However, they still felt the most suffocated by the Galaxia Sedimentation in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. 1, what\u2019s going on? How is this Zhou Weiqing releasing such a powerful aura? What Divine Territory is this? There\u2019s an error in our information. We won\u2019t stand a chance if he finishes consolidating when we attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. 2, you\u2019re too bold. Do you think drawing liquid in the void is that easy? If my guess is right, they would have to pay a great price simply to consolidate the ink. Zhou Weiqing will not possibly stop. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be so many people surrounding him in defense. We have lived for more than a thousand years. If it was not for Fen Tian\u2019s use of Destruction Essence to revive us, we would be nothing but a pile of bones. You\u2019re still able to consider your personal losses in a time like this? Do you really think that we\u2019ll be able to stay alive if we don\u2019t finish this job? Without Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Essence, we\u2019ll be dead as well. There will certainly be opportunities. Here. Based on the information, this young one is the most powerful one among them, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya. If the seven of us combine our powers, there\u2019s a high chance that they\u2019ll retreat with a single attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other five did not say a word. They stood stoically behind the two leaders. Waiting quietly.</p><br/><p>No. 2 momentarily fell silent before he nodded, \u201cAlright. However, No. 1, you must remember, there are precious few among those of us who have been brought back to life who have intelligence. The heavens gave us a chance at a new life, and I don\u2019t want to throw my life away here. If things become difficult, I would rather use them as scapegoats and escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I want to die? We have no time to lose. Get ready. We only have one chance. Besides, we can\u2019t let Zhou Weiqing sense that his life in in danger.\u201d No. 1 replied in a sinister manner.</p><br/><p>A moment after No. 1 and no. 2 had their discussion, the seven of them finally moved again.</p><br/><p>The seven men quickly lined up in a row. The five who had previously kept quiet were placed in front, and No. 1 and no. 2 lined up behind. The seven of them released black light filaments one after the other. If one looked closely, one would be able to notice them. The light filaments mostly came from No. 1 and No. 2. The light filaments from the other five were only released on the lead of the first two men.</p><br/><p>The black light filaments slowly condensed. The weirdest thing was these light filaments were similar to the Starlight Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing had previously released. They did not display any energy fluctuations. That also meant that, unless one looked closely, one would not have been able to sense what the group clad in black was doing. Otherwise, they would not have fearlessly condensed their energy out in the open.</p><br/><p>In order to ensure that the Astral Divine Territory\u2019s amplification was focused towards his own body, Zhou Weiqing confined the Divine Territory to the skies of Heavenly Bow City, and this was the outer edge of the Astral Divine Territory. The group in black might have been mildly affected by the Astral Divine Territory but in actual fact, they have yet to set foot into the Astral Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>They would never know how Zhou Weiqing managed kill the previous group sent by the Blood Red Hell. However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s possession of Saint Energy was no longer a secret. No. 1 and No. 2 knew very well that even though the energy they released could condense, concentrate and stabilize their auras, if it was to come in contact with the immensely different Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing would notice them immediately. It was similar to how they were able to use their Destruction Energy to sense Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Creation Saint Energy. Hence, they chose this dark corner on the outskirts of the city walls.</p><br/><p>The black light filaments slowly condensed. Like a Japanese creeper, it stuck closely onto the city walls as it slowly crawled up. It would occasionally grow thorns that were shaped like gnarly long legs, before transforming into shapes that were similar to arteries soon after. If anyone were to see this, they would immediately feel nauseous.</p><br/><p>When these black vines finally got close to the top, they slowly began to gather together. Soon after, they merged into a giant mass and countless branches began stretching out from the pitch black mass. It formed a shape that looked a lot like a crab.</p><br/><p>As the originators of this evil, the seven in black were completely covered in the black light filaments.</p><br/><p>The large black crab, formed through the condensation of the black light filaments, was not very big. It was only about one meter or so. However, at a glance, one would realize that it looked a lot like a black cave that could swallow even the slightest trace of light.</p><br/><p>Two turtles in front of the large black crab slowly eased out to explore the city walls. At this time, even though there were soldiers stationed at the city walls, their attentions were fixed on Zhou Weiqing who was drawing Saint Energy ink and consolidating it in the void. No one noticed the two unremarkable black lights.</p><br/><p>The two turtles slowly merged when suddenly, a devastating ray of dark light tore through the sky and shot directly towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Similar to before, this black light neither gave a warning nor showed an aura or energy fluctuation as it flew towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>However, just as the black light entered the city and into the Astral Divine Territory, countless people have already reacted. Tian\u2019er, Shangguan Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, Bing\u2019er, including Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya and Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue.</p><br/><p>They were able to notice it immediately not only because their personal cultivation bases were at a high level, it was also because they all had Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Discipline would largely repel and affect those who did not have Saint Energy. However, the Astral Divine Territory would boost the effects for those who had Saint Energy as long as Zhou Weiqing was not purposely driving them out.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er was the closest. In order to protect Zhou Weiqing, she had already strapped on the Boundless Infinitum Set. Once she sensed the powerful threat from the black ray, she flashed towards it and did what she had to do without hesitation. Her body and sword became one. In the air, a wave of white light akin to a plume of smoke descended from the heavens like a waterfall.</p><br/><p>The Boundless Infinitum Set\u2019s reputation as the number one legendary armor set in the world was not unfounded. Although Shangguan Xue\u2019er only had eight pieces on her currently, it was enough to provide her with the most powerful attack among all the wives. Moreover, her blade was dripping with Saint Energy. The Boundless Saint Nucleus Core was Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s achievement.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We have already prepared all the necessary procedures and documents to masquerade as merchants, so there should not be much danger, so on this part you all do not need to worry. This time, we will be going there to look for some materials, treasures that will enable us to make some secret medicines. These secret medicines will allow those with Heavenly Energy but not Awakened their Personal Jewels to do so. Of course, I am not clear whether or not we can actually manage to get those materials, or how many we can get, but I believe that this will be of great importance to those brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Can Personal Jewels still be Awakened after passing the requisite age?\u201d Wei Feng couldn\u2019t help but exclaim with great surprise as soon as he heard Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cYes, that is why we have to make this trip. Vice Battalion Commander Wei, you go back and gather everyone and tell them what I said. Also, tell them that amongst the eight hundred or so brothers who have not Awakened their Personal Jewels, only those who are the most outstanding will have the chance to gain the Awakening medicine. During the time that we are gone, let them all work as hard as they want. I believe that with such a motivation to become Jewel Masters, that will truly spark their motivation. Also, you can distribute the first batch of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Every Physical Jewel Master should get one longbow Consolidating Equipment Scroll. We already have three hundred of them, and Yun Li or Dou Dou will quickly finish the remaining ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that, I want you to choose one hundred and fifty of the most outstanding brothers who still have two empty Jewels after that, and to give them the Wing Consolidating Equipment Scrolls to Consolidate. If you aren\u2019t able to find that many, keep the Scrolls first. In that case, once anyone reaches the requisite cultivation level, you can give a set to him. Of course, you need to collect gold for all these Scrolls. As for how much, you decide according to how much they have at that moment. After all, we can\u2019t keep letting those fellows get gold from Your Father, I, it\u2019s time to get some back.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke up to that point, Zhou Weiqing laughed, but Wei Feng\u2019s eyes reddened slightly. He suddenly knelt down on the ground, saying: \u201cBattalion Commander, on behalf of all our brothers, I thank you sincerely.\u201d He knew that the so-called collection of payment was merely a token. After all, Wei Feng clearly knew the price of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls in the market. To let each and every one of the Jewel Masters of the Peerless Battalion be geared with Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, what kind of power, riches and boldness did one need to have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing quickly stepped forward to support him up. \u201cVice Commander Wei, this is just the beginning. We have many more good times ahead to look forward to. However, you must remind them that if they want to gain more Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, they better train hard with all their might. These are just merely Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for the first three Jewels\u2026 As long as they work hard enough, providing them all with all nine Jewels of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls should be no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng gave Zhou Weiqing a proper standard military salute.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cAlright, you go ahead then. Right, wait until we have left before informing the others, we do not want anyone else outside to learn anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without question, the \u2018anyone else\u2019 that Zhou Weiqing was referring to was definitely Zhan LingTian. Shangguan Fei\u2019er stood at the side and rolled her eyes at him.</p><br/><p>Wei Feng quickly took his leave, and Zhou Weiqing turned to Yun Li and Dou Dou and said: \u201cTonight, Fei\u2019er will send you back. The living arrangements, resources available and safety in the TianBei City is much better than here, and it is also easier for you all to buy any materials you need. Big Bro Lin will be joining me to go to the WanShou Empire, so Bro Yun you take charge of the finances. If you need to buy any materials, you just take care of it as required.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Li gave a humph and said: \u201cYou sure are squeezing every last drop out of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed again, saying: \u201cAlthough you are no longer my Follower, the previous bet we had about who would reach the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master stage first is still in effect. Of course, we will have to change the wager. If you become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master before I do, and help me in creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls before that, the day you become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master I will give you a copy of my \u2018Hate Ground No Handle\u2019 Set Design.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Yun Li\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cFor real?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing winked at him, looking at Little Miss Muddle at the side before saying: \u201cI\u2019ll count it as your wedding gift. However, you still have to get past Old Xing\u2019s judgement first. Also, I ask that you never spread the \u2018Hate Ground No Handle\u2019 Design to anyone else, you can only research it for your own learning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is no problem. You just prepare your set design for me then.\u201d To any Consolidating Equipment Master, what could hold more attraction than a Legendary Set Design?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cLater on, pass me those Consolidating Equipment Scrolls that you have completed. Besides giving some to our Peerless Battalion brothers, since I am going to the WanShou Empire as a merchant, I need to have some goods to trade. If we can trade for our requirements, we will not need to go hunting; that would save us a lot of time as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Li agreed contentedly. At that moment, he felt a burning within his heart, all he could think of was the \u2018Hate Ground No Handle\u2019 Legendary Set Design. After all, he had seen the design of one of the pieces previously, and in terms of quality, complexity and sophistication, even the effect, it was far beyond the nine-piece Legendary Set that he owned. More importantly, the design principles of the two sets of Legendary Sets were extremely different, and that would be the greatest benefit to him. Furthermore, with two Legendary Set designs in hand, he would have more confidence in the future if he really went to the Heavenly Jewel Island to ask Elder Xing for Dou Dou\u2019s hand in marriage. That was the true meaning in what Zhou Weiqing had meant by saying it was a wedding gift.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing turned to Lin TianAo and said: \u201cBig Bro, this time, heading to the WanShou Empire, you will have to follow me. Besides yourself, Fei\u2019er and me, who else do you think will be suitable to bring along?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had always been very respectful towards Lin TianAo, and truly treated him like a real big brother.</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo thought for a moment and said: \u201cI would recommend bringing Crow and Ma Qun. Ma Qun has improved at an outstanding speed. Furthermore, although his Physical Jewel is not of the Strength Attribute, his natural strength is extremely powerful. His improvement over the last few months has truly shocked us all, and with Dou Dou crafting custom Consolidated Equipment for him, he already has a three-Assembly Set Shield. With his supernatural strength in complement, he can hold his own in defensive capabilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh, that Ma Qun, he has improved so quickly?\u201d Zhou Weiqing was also caught by surprise.</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo smiled faintly and said: \u201cIf your strength is also weaker than your wife, you would probably be even more desperate in training than he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, there is another good news. However, that must be told to you personally by Crow and Ma Qun.\u201d He continued in a secretive manner.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me they already have kids?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo smiled faintly, but did not speak. At the side, Shangguan Fei\u2019er could not resist saying: \u201cDo you think everyone is like you, mind only full of dirty thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cI just like having dirty thoughts indeed. How about, you can also birth one for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Lin TianAo and the others\u2019 time to be given the surprise. Although they had previously seen signs that the relationship between Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er wasn\u2019t that simple, they had not expected things to have progressed so far between the two.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s beautiful face was flushed a deep red as she glared angrily at Zhou Weiqing, her eyes full of ill intent.</p><br/><p>How quick was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s reactions; seeing all that, he hastily changed the subject. \u201cThat said, what are we to do about that Bro Zhan of yours? We are leaving in about three days or so, are you able to send him off before that?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, once Shangguan Fei\u2019er heard Zhou Weiqing mention Zhan LingTian, she immediately furrowed her brow, saying: \u201cI will try my best. However, he will not listen to me. How about, you meet him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head, agreeing readily as he said: \u201cAlright, you bring him here then.\u201d He knew that it was unavoidable for him to meet Zhan LingTian.</p><br/><p>As such, Shangguan Fei\u2019er left to look for Zhan LingTian. Zhou Weiqing had already assigned everything to everyone, and according to their plans, they would leave in three days time. They would take the only trade route between the ZhongTian and WanShou Empires, heading directly into the heart of the WanShou Empire.</p><br/><p>Before long, the tent flap raised once more, and Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Zhan LingTian entered together.</p><br/><p>Strangely similar to Zhou Weiqing himself, Zhan LingTian was a lot thinner than the previous time Zhou Weiqing had seen him. Of course, that was because of the severe injury he had suffered previously.</p><br/><p>When he saw Zhou Weiqing, a strong enmity flashed in Zhan LingTian\u2019s eyes, and he subconsciously rubbed his fists.</p><br/><p>Since a young age, Zhan LingTian had always been outstanding, top of his generation in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Even compared to Shangguan Xue\u2019er, he was confident that he was comparable to her. If not for the fact that she had the Boundless Infinitum Set, she would not be that much stronger than him. However, this had also developed that pride and arrogant attitude.</p><br/><p>However, that day in the Lustre Spatial Realm, during the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, he had been metaphorically slapped in the face by Zhou Weiqing and sent smashing down from the heavens to the dust. Not only had he lost, but he had lost so terribly, sustaining such a heavy injury. If not for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace having a powerful Life Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master being able to help him heal, he would have been left crippled and permanently disabled.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, perhaps more importantly, all of that loss had been in front of all the top youths of the generation of the Great Saint Lands! Such a loss of face, Zhan LingTian could not take it. His hate for Zhou Weiqing could be said to be at a terrifying height. It was only until he heard that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s home had been destroyed, the Heavenly Bow Empire being annihilated, only then did his hate subside slightly.</p><br/><p>However, the blow to Zhan LingTian from that loss had a great effect on him, causing him to be lost in his hate for quite some time. Due to that, Shangguan Tianyang had to personally guide him for a period of time before he had finally been climbed out of the pit of fury and hatred. After all, no matter what, Zhou Weiqing was most likely going to be a son-in-law1, and Zhan LingTian could only hide that hatred deep in his heart.</p><br/><p>Towards that failure in the Lustre Spatial Realm, Zhan LingTian was not convinced or satisfied at all. After all, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation level was far below his. If not for the fact that he had been taken by surprise at a time when his Heavenly Energy had been very drained, and also with that terrifying Dragon Silencing Seal used, Zhan LingTian believed that he could tear into that little brat so quickly without any problem. Facing him, he just needed to be careful and not give him the chance to use that Dragon Silencing Seal, then Zhou Weiqing would definitely be no match for him!</p><br/><p>This time, when he was sent to the northern border to investigate, he had been greatly surprised to see it was Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er here. At that time, he had almost not been able to resist looking for trouble towards Zhou Weiqing. It was only after much thought, especially with Shangguan Fei\u2019er keeping watch on him, that he had abandoned that idea.</p><br/><p>Now that he saw Zhou Weiqing once more, although Zhan LingTian had done his best to control himself, that sheer hatred and enmity could not be hidden so easily.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing walked forward with a smile on his face, extending his right hand towards Zhan LingTian as he said: \u201cBro Zhan, how are you.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

From the start of the fight until now, the Kalise and Bai Da soldiers had all been thrown into the fight, but no one could even know the current death and injury toll. No matter atop the city walls or below, all that could be seen was a sea of corpses.</p><br/><p>*BANG* One of the eight-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters slammed his weapon savagely into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back, causing his entire body to smash into the city wall, almost sinking in with an explosive sound. At last, the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation below Zhou Weiqing\u2019s feet dissipated with the final violent blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Zhou Weiqing howled angrily, abruptly turning around and giving a furious swing with his Legendary Hammers, causing his enemies to step back momentarily.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because they saw the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation below Zhou Weiqing\u2019s feet dissipate, the Bai Da powerhouses surrounding him finally heaved a sigh of relief, their attacks stopping momentarily.</p><br/><p>These enemies were not in particularly great condition either, none of them remained injury free. More than a dozen Heavenly Jewel Masters! All of them had been surrounding a single person, Zhou Weiqing, all this time, and more so right on top of the city wall that was not wide at all\u2026 more than half of them had actually died at his hands.</p><br/><p>Besides the strong killing intent they had, all of the Bai Da Empire powerhouses couldn\u2019t help but look at Zhou Weiqing with a hint respect.</p><br/><p>This youth in front of them was just too powerful. Amongst any Heavenly Jewel Master they had seen before, in terms of six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters, no one could compare with him.</p><br/><p>The Mid Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master who had just struck Zhou Weiqing continued panting as he said: \u201cYoung man, surrender yourself. Your future is just too bright, with limitless potential behind you. Why do you need to sacrifice your life for an impossible dream, working to revive your empire\u2026 that is an empty and illusory dream for you. As long as you can bring your men and surrender to us, our Bai Da Empire will definitely welcome you with open arms, and treat you with top honours.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a temporary halt from his enemies, naturally Zhou Weiqing was more than happy for the delay. His personal regeneration speed for his Heavenly Energy and even his body was far beyond anyone else, and currently his twenty five energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points were working overtime, whirling at maximum to recover as much as possible before the fight started once more.</p><br/><p>These Bai Da Empire Heavenly Jewel Masters were far strong, far more persistent than he had imagined. Clearly, these were not just Heavenly Jewel Masters who were flowers grown in a greenhouse, each of them having a lot of battle experience. After one of their numbers had been destroyed by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Devour Skill, none of the other stronger powerhouses had given him the opportunity to Devour anyone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurrender?\u201d A faint, disdainful smirk crossed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lips. His voice was hoarse as he said: \u201cI am very afraid of death, and I truly do not want to die. However, if I surrender now, I might as well just die. Haha, come on then, I don\u2019t know if you believe me or not, but I will tell you now, even if you can kill me, I will ensure that all of you accompany me in death.\u201d At this moment, a sudden figure appeared in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mind, his father\u2019s broad figure, and it was as if he could see his father Admiral Zhou before his very eyes.</p><br/><p>Father, do not worry. No matter how afraid of death I am, I will never surrender to them. I am your son! Just like you, I can have a steel backbone. How could I possibly surrender to these fellows who caused you to end up like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him.\u201d Hearing those words, the Mid Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master did not want to give Zhou Weiqing any other chance to rest. Having fought this youth for so long, how could he not know that his recovery rate was just so astonishing? In the previous fighting, if not for the fact they had been able to cover each other, either helping each other take or soften Zhou Weiqing\u2019s blows, or just striking him to disrupt some of his blows, perhaps the fight would have already ended in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s favour.</p><br/><p>These Heavenly Jewel Masters from the Bai Da Empire were actually from the Bai Da Empire\u2019s Hundred Killer Hall. They had undergone the strictest training and many cruel, inhuman battles. Compared to most ordinary Heavenly Jewel Masters, their actual fighting capabilities were much stronger. Yet, this youth before them had caused them so much trouble, even causing them all to feel an unprecedented spark of fear in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Once again, all the Bai Da Empire powerhouses sprang towards Zhou Weiqing again. At the same time, a piercing light shot forth from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes, a silver white replacing the originally bloodshot eyes. Our dear Little Fatty was about to pit his life on the line. Even if there was just a single thread of chance for survival, he did not want to give it up. He still had one last ace up his sleeve, one that he dared not use previously\u2026 the last few drops, slightly more than a dozen, of Saint Energy. Zhou Weiqing believed that if he burst forth with the full potential of the Saint Energy, even if he was to be crippled or killed finally, he could bring these enemies down before he fell.</p><br/><p>Right at this very instant, all of a sudden a gold light descended from the skies out of nowhere, enveloping Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Zhou Weiqing felt a gentle warmth around his entire body, and his drained and exhausted body and Heavenly Energy actually started recovering rapidly in this warmth.</p><br/><p>A violent explosion, and the gold light shattered. The Bai Da Empire powerhouses had struck out, but the gold light had managed to stop their blows, and had actually knocked them back with the backlash.</p><br/><p>A figure appeared silently out of nowhere to land right beside Zhou Weiqing. It was Tian\u2019er!</p><br/><p>Currently, Tian\u2019er looked far better than Zhou Weiqing did. At least, she wasn\u2019t totally covered with blood. Even so, her white clothes had blood specks all over them, and her face looked pale and ashen.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er why have you come? Could it be\u2026 the north gate has fallen?\u201d Zhou Weiqing was caught by surprise.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er grabbed onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s left hand with her own right. \u201cLet\u2019s face these enemies first. The north gate is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>With her words, Zhou Weiqing heaved a sigh of relief. As the two of them held hands, the remaining Heavenly Energy in their bodies reacted almost automatically, fusing together with the four Saint Attributes, forming the familiar large Saint Energy whirlpool almost instantly.</p><br/><p>They had been training together for such a long period of time, and their tacit understanding of each other was extremely strong. Even their respective circulation of Heavenly Energy, how they reacted with each other, all of them was just too familiar to them, and with the four Saint Attributes drawing upon each other, there was no hint of any rejection possible.</p><br/><p>With Tian\u2019er by his side, it was without question that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s fighting capabilities were magnified severalfold. The Saint Energy whirlpool did not only just help them refine and transform Saint Energy, it also greatly increased the recovery rate of both their Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>The Bai Da Empire powerhouses senses were definitely clearest. Seeing Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er hold hands, they sensed the Heavenly Energy reverberation in the air around grow stronger. Despite their own cultivation level, it was as if they had been abandoned by the atmospheric Heavenly Energy, all of which were gushing towards Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er. At the same time, they could clearly see that around their linked hands, there was a faint silvery white light glowing.</p><br/><p>The seven Bai Da Empire powerhouses exchanged glances, seeing the shock in each other\u2019s eyes. Due to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s sheer power and performance in the past few hours, even though they could clearly see that Tian\u2019er only had seven Heavenly Jewels around her wrist, but Zhou Weiqing was already so strong\u2026 Furthermore, Tian\u2019er\u2019s Elemental Jewels seemed to also be that of the Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye, and her cultivation level was even higher. With these two joining forces, what kind of level would they reach? More importantly, it seemed like as they joined hands, they clearly had some sort of ability to fight together!</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack! Even if we can\u2019t kill them now, as long as we hold them back, we will still win the battle. Their soldiers cannot hold on for much longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, the fighting on the city walls was reaching its end. By now, most of the Peerless Regiment soldiers were driven to gather together, making their last desperate stand.</p><br/><p>The Kalise armies on the frontal onslaught were not just the strongest amongst all walls, but also numbered the most. Furthermore, all of the siege weapons and powerhouses were gathered here, especially the Bai Da Regiment. To be able to hold on for such a long time, the Peerless Regiment had already gone far and beyond their usual strength.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the only thing saving them now was the fact that there wasn\u2019t much space to stand anymore. Many of the Bai Da soldiers were now clearing some corpses away so they could properly surround the Peerless Regiment soldiers gathered together on the city walls.</p><br/><p>Still, pushed to such a corner, the Peerless Regiment soldiers showed their firm and unyielding spirit. Those too critically injured to fight were right in the middle of their formation resting, while those with light injuries were relatively outside, still resting for now to await their turn to fight. Gathered together, they were able to use this method to take turns resting before slaughtering their enemies once more. Although every time their resistance grew weaker and weaker, they were still the Peerless Regiment soldiers after all! And they continued killing \u2026 and killing.</p><br/><p>All of them cherished their lives so much. As long as there was still a chance to hold on, no one would give up easily!</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing had seen the danger the Peerless Regiment were in. Currently, with Tian\u2019er by his side, he suddenly drew in a deep breath, forcefully suppressing his own injuries. With some Heavenly Energy recovered, he pushed himself to enter the Dragon-Tiger Transformation once more, and the powerful aura burst free again.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here!\u201d A silvery white light flashed in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes, and his right hand grabbed out at one of the Bai Da Upper Level Zun Stage powerhouses closest to him.</p><br/><p>This Upper Level Zun Stage powerhouse was the most injured out of the remaining seven Bai Da enemies, his entire right arm had been destroyed by one of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hammer blows earlier, flopping uselessly at the side. With such a critical injury, he had also not participated as much in the surrounding fight. Currently, he suddenly felt an unbelievable suction force on him, and he stumbled, falling towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold!\u201d Just as the other Bai Da Empire powerhouses were about to spring to his aid, all of a sudden, Tian\u2019er shouted out loud. A thick purple light sprang from her beautiful eyes, enveloping the other Bai Da Heavenly Jewel Masters in an instant, covering them totally.</p><br/><p>Although Tian\u2019er was also exhausted, the Saint Energy whirlpool had given her Heavenly Energy a quick recovery boost in the last few seconds. With this shred of energy, she was able to use this spiritual attack to cause the other Bai Da Empire powerhouses to black out for a split second, delaying their rescue for that critical moment.</p><br/><p>In that moment, Zhou Weiqing had seized the chance and sprang into action. The wings behind his back flapped hard, and he carried Tian\u2019er along as they appeared in a flash right in front of the six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>The terrifying suction force caused the Upper Level Zun Stage to have no chance of resistance. He could clearly sense that the suction force was not just devouring his Heavenly Energy, but his life force and soul! He could only try his best to struggle, to do his best not to be Devoured, but he could no longer fight anymore.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was actually currently more than ten yards from him. For him to be able to use the Devour Skill at such a range, it was without question that he had used a drop of Saint Energy and infused it within his Devour Skill.</p><br/><p>Previously, when Zhou Weiqing was alone, he dared not do such a thing. After all, he was not confidence in success, and it might instead put him in peril as the other enemies struck out at him. However, it was far different now. With Tian\u2019er here to stop the others momentarily, and with the support of the Saint Energy whirlpool, using a drop of Saint Energy was no problem for him.</p>\n</div>"}

As the citizens felt the divine aura and the benefits it brought them, a large amount of gold light began to rise up from them, across the entire ZhongTian Plaza, gathering towards the six-winged Angel above Tian\u2019er\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>On the VIP Stand, Shangguan Tianxin couldn\u2019t help but stand up in shock, exclaiming involuntarily: \u201cThis\u2026 this is\u2026 the power of Faith!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s beautiful face revealed a sweet smile. By now, the six-winged Angel above her head was even more solid, and as the countless spots of light surged into its body from all directions, an unbelievably strong gold light burst forth from its body, so much so that no one could look directly at it, as the divine aura around it grew stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>In comparison, the Butterfly Goddess of Light was growing dimmer and dimmer.</p><br/><p>In a flash of the blade of light, the Butterfly Goddess of Light disappeared totally, destroyed fully as it dissipated into the air.</p><br/><p>In truth, when the Butterfly Goddess of Light had charged towards Tian\u2019er, it had already unleashed a powerful Skill on Zhou Weiqing, before being forced to block Tian\u2019er\u2019s attack. It could be considered to have been relatively weakened already. Furthermore, the six-winged Angel that Tian\u2019er had released was far more powerful than anyone could have imagined. At last, the six-winged Angel flew up into the air, and in a flash, it appeared right above XiHua and Butterfly Orchid.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s voice rang out casually. \u201cSurrender now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Butterfly Orchid still wanted to continue trying, but she discovered that behind her, XiHua had already removed his palms from her back, stepping forward with a helpless look on his face. With a sigh, he said: \u201cI never would have imagined that you have already grasped the power of Faith. In this entire plaza, no one below the Heavenly King Stage can possibly be a match for you\u2026 perhaps not even the heir to the Boundless Infinitium Set.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er stepped forward slowly, the six-winged Angel flew back to behind her, as if taking up a guarding position, silently standing there. At the other side, Zhou Weiqing had also broken free of the seal on him, although his Dragon Silencing Seal was no longer necessary now.</p><br/><p>Did we win just like that? Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart was filled with surprise, looking at the gold spots of light that were still continuously gathering towards Tian\u2019er, filled with both curiosity and surprise.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er smiled at Zhou Weiqing, extended her hand towards him. In a single stride, Zhou Weiqing returned to her side, holding her hands. Instantly, an extremely thick and rich amount of Light Attribute Heavenly Energy began to rush into his body, startling him suddenly. He quickly formed the large Saint Energy whirlpool with Tian\u2019er\u2019s help, and they began to transform the Light Attribute Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s voice rang softly in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ears: \u201cThe Divine Attribute\u2019s Faith is like the counterbalance to the Demonic Attribute\u2019s Devour, at the same level, considered the top powered Skill in their respective Attributes. I have only just comprehended and begun to grasp this ability in these few days of closed door cultivation with you. In fact, even Father has not comprehended this ability yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSimply speaking, Faith is not really a Skill, but a sort of attached Attribute to the Divine Attribute, and it can even be considered one of the top final forms of the Divine Attribute. Its greatest use is actually when the Divine Attribute aura is released, improving it and causing feelings of respect and prayer in people, which will then imperceptibly invoke the Power of Faith, which will slowly infuse into any Divine Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, strengthening their Skills and their Light aura. Once a Heavenly Jewel Master with such a Skill had sufficient followers, they could have a nigh-infinite source of Heavenly Energy. Unless one used a terrifying power far above their own to destroy them instantly, otherwise the Power of Faith would constantly sustain them, nearly forever.</p><br/><p>Even for the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the Divine Attribute Faith had not appeared for more than a thousand years, and had almost been relegated to an object of legend. Who could have imagined that Tian\u2019er would actually comprehend it so suddenly. With the six-winged Angel she had summoned, she decided to use the Divine Faith attached attribute for the first time, matching it with the Power of Faith, which was the reason why it had taken her so long to unleash the Skill.</p><br/><p>In the ZhongTian Plaza, there were more than a million audience watching, with so many affected by the Divine Faith\u2026 one could imagine the sheer amount of Power of Faith provided.</p><br/><p>Let alone XiHua and Butterfly Orchid, in the current situation, even if they added on TianFeng and TianMa to the opposing side, as long as they didn\u2019t use the Destruction Attribute to instantly kill Tian\u2019er, they would eventually lose for sure.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had never felt the Saint Energy whirlpool spin so quickly before. At the current moment, with the massive infusion of the Power of Faith, along with Tian\u2019er and himself controlling the Saint Energy whirlpool with all their might, drop after drop of Saint Energy was constantly being churned out, and the drops of Saint Energy were automatically separated evenly, flowing into both their bodies.</p><br/><p>After the major expenditure of Saint Energy from their previous fight, through this process they were recovering rapidly as the concentrated and thick Power of Faith covered both Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er with a layer of faint gold light.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Divine Faith was only effective on those with relatively weaker wills, more accurately, those ordinary living beings that were not Jewel Masters or Heavenly Beasts. To unleash the Skill with so many ordinary people gathered together was normally an impossible occurrence. Perhaps, one could even call it a chance that could only occur once in a blue moon.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Divine Faith power was a win-win situation; to be able to gain faith from the citizens, not only would there be any bad influence on the citizens, it would actually greatly improve their bodies and constitution, removing many impurities from them and was of great benefit to them overall.</p><br/><p>This was the biggest difference between the Divine Attribute and the Demonic Attribute. The Demonic Attribute\u2019s strongest power was the Devour Skill that was absolutely a great benefit to oneself at a major cost to others. In contrast, the Divine Attribute was a great benefit to oneself, but also benefiting others as well, and was definitely much easily accepted.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As the affected citizens and audience sensed the benefits and comfortable sensations, the stronger the Power of Faith would grow. Very quickly, the Saint Energy transformed in Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s body had grown to more than a hundred drops.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin looked towards the VIP Stand, where Shangguan Tianxin\u2019s brow was slightly furrowed. Although this Divine Faith was a good benefit to the citizens, it was also not a good sign for the ZhongTian Empire\u2019s governing. After all, if their citizens really had a strong faith towards someone from the Heavenly Snow Mountain, that was a very dangerous and unstable element deep within their borders.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianxin gave an imperceptible nod towards Shangguan Longyin, who immediately understood. Clearing his throat, he said solemnly: \u201cHeavenly Bow Battle Team has defeated the BaoPo Battle Team, advancing to the Top Four. This round is now over.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was low, but deep and resonant, instantly knocking Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er out of that mysterious state. The two of them looked at each other, but were helpless in the matter. Nodding to Butterfly Orchid and XiHua, they jumped off the stage to return to their Rest House. At the same time, Tian\u2019er quickly recalled the six-Winged Angel as well.</p><br/><p>Of course, the recalling process was as slow as possible. The longer they could draw in as much Power of Faith as possible meant another possible drop of Saint Energy, and she did not wish to waste such a rare opportunity to gain it.</p><br/><p>By the time she had no choice but to end the Skill, the little Saint Energy whirlpools within them had grown back substantially, with almost two hundred drops respectively as they spun happily.</p>\n</div>"}

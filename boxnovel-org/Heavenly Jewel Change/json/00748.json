Big Fatty Long, the Destruction Attribute is one that surpasses Saint Attribute. That Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation of yours may be fascinating, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be left here today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as his words fell, six rays of Destruction Energy, filled with insanity and a hysterical aura, almost rose from six directions simultaneously. The concentrated Destruction aura instantly compressed the six colors of Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation released by Long Shiya inward. On top of Meng Gui\u2019s direct confrontation, Long Shiya had been pressured into a disadvantageous situation within an instant.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya\u2019s facial expression changed immediately. Although he had heard of the Destruction Attribute from Zhou Weiqing, never had he expected for this Destruction Attribute to be so otherworldly. We would not have taken these people seriously if they did not possess the Destruction Attribute, but the situation right then was obviously different.</p><br/><p>A cold grin appeared on Meng Gui\u2019s face, \u201cI guess you\u2019ve expected this, Big Fatty Long. The Destruction Attribute isn\u2019t only powerful, its powers will also grow stronger the more its users are. If we\u2019re just using our own attributes, there\u2019s no way for us to hold you back. However, I now have similarities with them due to our possession of Destruction Attribute. Under the effects of the Destruction Attribute, you can only dream of leaving here. I\u2019ve long heard that you\u2019ve accepted a disciple; this battle today is prepared especially for you. Today, I shall not let you go anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the pressure of the Destructive Attribute which was being released at the same time by a Heavenly Emperor and six Heavenly King-tier powerhouses, Long Shiya\u2019s Six Ultimate Heavenly path Formation had been compressed to an area of merely several meters around his body, and this area was still shrinking. Once the Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation was no longer capable of protecting him, the blows he were to receive would be a deadly one from these seven mighty opponents.</p><br/><p>However, what puzzled the Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui was that Long Shiya could still laugh at a time like this, and he was laughing in disdain at that laughed in disdain.</p><br/><p>Out of nowhere, a shadow as black as ink appeared at the back of a Heavenly King-tier powerhouse on the left.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King from Blood Red Hell kept on activating his Destruction Attribute and did not notice the shadow behind him at all.</p><br/><p>Even a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse like Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui had not noticed how the person appeared.</p><br/><p>Heavy, strong fists easily gripped onto the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King\u2019s neck. Everything was too sudden for the Heavenly King. Due to his cultivation base that was at that of a Heavenly King-tier, the Heavenly Energy within him seemed to have exploded in an instant from the ambush.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King was also extremely cruel. He had chosen to detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>To have his neck grabbed by someone without any warning, what did it mean? It meant that the individual\u2019s cultivation was far superior to his. Only by detonating his Heavenly Nucleus Core and activating his strongest attack to frighten his enemies would he have a chance to stay alive. Once one had reached the rank of a Heavenly King, one\u2019s wisdom would escalate along with the development of the cultivation base. Without any hesitation, he had made the right choice.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, while his decision was correct, the reality was different from what he wished for.</p><br/><p>The terrifying powers of devour made the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King instantly feel as if his body was caught in a whirlpool in the depths of the ocean. His will to ignite the Heavenly Nucleus Core had momentarily frozen. Then, his Heavenly Energy began to flow out of his body, whereas his Heavenly Nucleus Core was no longer under his control. It was absorbed by an attraction force out of nowhere to the extent that it was stuck.</p><br/><p>With the sudden decrease in the Destruction Attribute\u2019s Heavenly Energy\u2019s suppression, Long Shiya\u2019s lights of six colors brightened substantially. It was only when the explosion had brought along huge energy waves, only did the group from Blood Red Hell notice that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>In unison, they directed their gaze to the heavenly King-tier powerhouse who had been ambushed. However, when they had come to their senses and wanted to go to his rescue, it was too late.</p><br/><p>Blocked by the Heavenly King-tier powerhouse\u2019s body, there was no way for them to see what had struck the Heavenly King-tier powerhouse. What they had seen was only his body flying backward at top speed, moving far away.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Blood Red Hell powerhouses did not dare to make a move. The famed Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was so powerful that only their great number managed to suppress him. One must know that even for Meng Gui, his cultivation level only laid in the middle ranks of Heavenly Emperor Tier. If he were to have a one-on-one confrontation with Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, he would not be able to stand for thirty minutes.</p><br/><p>The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had been known for his great endurance in battle. Ordinary Heavenly Jewel Masters could not easily comprehend Heavenly Jewels with six attributes \u2013 his name of The Mightiest below Heavenly God was clearly given for a reason. Even three or four Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses would be no match for him and the reason he could be restricted was all because of the Destruction Attribute.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, stay cautious!\u201d Meng Gui shouted, his demeanor no longer as relaxed as before. At the same time, hesitation arose in his heart.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King-tier powerhouse who had been flown away could no longer be seen, falling into Heavenly Bow City and vanished.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui was contemplating if he should strike Long Shiya now, instead of being at a standstill. The reason he chose the current method of suppression was that it was the sole method that would minimize their casualties. Otherwise, upon Long Shiya\u2019s retaliation, they would be paying a deadly price \u2013 especially him \u2013 as he would definitely be Long Shiya\u2019s first target.</p><br/><p>By holding Long Shiya down with the Destruction Attribute, he would be further suppressed by their aura if he were to make the first move, as long as they did not strike. Under repeated attacks like these, Long Shiya would no longer be able to stand not long after.</p><br/><p>However, who would have expected such abrupt changes to the situation? One of the six surrounding Heavenly King-tier powerhouses had vanished all of a sudden, resulting in the decline of their pressure on Long Shiya, effectively lengthening the time that Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor could hold himself. Of course, it would bear the same outcome if they were to continue their suppression. However, nobody knew how strong their hidden enemy was.</p><br/><p>No matter how much Meng Gui thought of it, he could not wrap his head around the fact that such a powerhouse still existed in Heavenly Bow Empire. Duan Tianliang was powerful, but he was only at the Heavenly King Tier and it was impossible for him to capture a powerhouse of the same level without leaving a trace! To sneak behind a Heavenly King-tier powerhouse without giving himself away brought no guarantee that the Heavenly Emperor would be capable of such a feat.</p><br/><p>A cynical expression surfaced on Long Shiya\u2019s face; his previous nervousness and shock were actually being feigned. Indeed, the powers of the enemies before him were not weak, but he had stepped into their trap on purpose. Without the strong attraction force, it would be more taxing for him to get rid of these enemies, but now\u2026 would they dare to loosen their suppression on him?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, another heavenly King-tier powerhouse in the other direction similarly let out a grunt, and his body flew backward immediately.</p><br/><p>At this point, Meng Gui\u2019s demeanor finally changed, before commanding quickly without any hesitation, \u201cAttack!\u201d</p><br/><p>The strong Destructive Attribute instantly transformed from suppression to physical attacks. Greyish brown light mixed with intense flames exploded from the four heavenly King-tier powerhouses simultaneously. At the same time, Consolidated Radiance shone from each of their bodies, and they demonstrated their full power.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui had made his judgment at that instant. If there was a possibility that the first Heavenly King-tier powerhouse had been ambushed due to his being off-guard, it would not be as simple as mere carelessness for a second Heavenly King-tier powerhouse to be struck in the same manner. The hidden opponent must be extremely powerful. If the situation were to remain the same, although they triumphed in numbers, it would be hard to determine the outcome of the day\u2019s battle when they had their backs exposed to their enemy. The best course of action would only be by eliminating Long Shiya before searching for the concealed opponent.</p><br/><p>When the four Heavenly Kings of Blood Red Hell launched their attacks together, Meng Gui appeared before Long Shiya in a flash. Amidst the dark illumination, each of his hands was covered with a Consolidated Equipment, of two-feet-long Ghostclaw Spikes.</p><br/><p>All five of his fingers had the Ghostclaw Spikes, specializing in breaking the defense of Heavenly Energy. In addition to the insane Destruction Attribute, his rush forward had split the air in an instant, forming a long black hole. Without a doubt, he had also exerted his mightiest offense.</p><br/><p>Under the pressure of Destruction Attribute, the powers of their combined attack would be the greatest. As long as this attack could deliver a fatal blow to Long Shiya, the rest of the battle would be much easier. Meng Gui even had the confidence of annihilating Long Shiya by himself. Till then, the four Heavenly Kings would guard the perimeters against the enemy lurking in the dark. Once they had gotten rid of Long Shiya, they would deal with the enemy and emerge victoriously.</p><br/><p>However, the unfolding of events had always differed from one\u2019s predictions.</p><br/><p>The stacked powers of the simultaneous onslaught of the Heavenly Emperor and four Heavenly Kings with the energies of the same attribute may be extremely powerful, but would they really be able to harm Long Shiya? The next moment, Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor gave his answer.</p><br/><p>Upon the actions of his opponents, Long Shiya also moved, gesturing both of his arms to draw circles by his sides. The six colored light rays first shrank by two meters and then exploded in an instant. This time, as the six colors exploded, six silhouettes appeared around Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>The silhouettes all looked like him \u2013 red for the Fire Attribute, green for the Wind Attribute, blue for the Water Attribute, yellow for the Earth Attribute, gold for the Light Attribute and black for the Blackness Attribute.</p><br/><p>When the six different colored Long Shiya\u2019s appeared, they acted the same as well. Almost instantly, the Blood Red Hell powerhouses seemed to be facing six of the strongest Heavenly Emperors.</p><br/><p>Along with a deafening sound, the five shadows were flung away. Long Shiya had actually knocked away the five Blood Red Hell powerhouses all by himself. On the other hand, he still casually remained at his original position; the only ones who had vanished were the six silhouettes he had released.</p><br/><p>Pouting, Long Shiya did not continue the pursuit, \u201cWhat Destruction Attribute? It\u2019s nothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d while being hurled away, Meng Gui exclaimed in shock. Among the six shadows released by Long Shiya, two that were summoned were of the Light and Water Attribute respectively. The powerful hit he suffered did not differ much from Long Shiya himself and seemed like a full-blown attack. Even with the heightened powers of the Destructive Attribute, he had been flung away, and the blood in his body was surging. What was even more incomprehensible to Meng Gui was that Long Shiya\u2019s strike had a unique aura which had actually dispersed his Destructive Attribute, nullifying its effects.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya laughed aloud, and said, \u201cLittle Meng Gui, nothing\u2019s impossible in this world. It\u2019s just your short-sighted vision. What is Destructive Attribute in the face of the Saint Attribute? Everything is useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>For him to be able to withstand the hit, it was not entirely due to his own powers. It was true that Long Shiya\u2019s cultivation was strong. Furthermore, he had the combination of six attributes. He had no reasons to be wary of the Destructive Attribute as the four Saint Attributes would not even amount to much suppression when he fused the six Elemental Attributes. Other than that, Zhou Weiqing had injected the real Saint Energy Galaxia into his body. Supported by the Saint Energy Galaxia, one could only imagine the powers that exploded from Long Shiya\u2019s strike. Furthermore, in front of Saint Energy, how was it possible for the Destructive Attribute demonstrate its full potential?</p><br/><p>With that, Long Shiya had solved his situation of being besieged in the midst of intersecting light rays.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui\u2019s plans were not that bad but compared to the young and cunning Zhou Weiqing, there was still a difference. After all, Zhou Weiqing had played a part in many conspiracies.</p><br/><p>All of these were within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s calculations. Meng Gui would never have expected for Zhou Weiqing to be here two hours ago. He had conducted a detailed investigation regarding the location, and with the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core\u2019s effects in place, even the Heavenly Emperors could not detect Zhou Weiqing\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>After identifying the enemies, how could Zhou Weiqing leave them any chance?</p><br/><p>Just as Meng Gui was crying out in shock, yet another of the four Heavenly Kings who were being bombarded away had disappeared.</p><br/><p>The situation was just too strange and caused the expressions of the other three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings to change. They did not consider launching another round of attacks at Long Shiya but instead, gathered together in the span of a few breaths. They stood with their backs facing each other and surveyed their surroundings in vigilance.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya stood midair, clasping his hands behind him, his eyes beaming with pride. He was not proud of himself, but of his beloved disciple.</p><br/><p>To take care of three Heavenly Kings within such a short span of time without leaving a single trace. There was no doubt that Zhou Weiqing could do it!</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing only had the cultivation base of someone at the Heavenly King Tier, with the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core and his magnificent escalation abilities, he could definitely hold a candle against a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. He may have pulled some tricks in his victorious battle against his father-in-law at the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace on Heavenly Jewel Island, but much of the events were due to his efforts. While these Heavenly Kings had to withstand the insurmountable pressure by Long Shiya, his ambush had easily taken effect.</p><br/><p>Rays of dark golden light shone in the dark. Under the illumination of the dark golden rays, a shadow with wings spread on its back emerged slowly from the dark.</p><br/><p>Without chances of ambush, Zhou Weiqing no longer had any reason to continue hiding and revealed himself.</p><br/><p>At this time, his entire body was covered with solid armor, including both his legs, all shielded by the Ringless Ground Purging Set.</p><br/><p>Before coming here today, he had already completed the consolidation of all the nine pieces in front of the Ringless Ground Purging Set. Only the last piece was left for the whole set to be complete.</p><br/><p>When he released his Ringless Ground Purging Set, the light around his body seemed slightly distorted. Terrifying energy waves flowed through the air, and the only thing he did not have right then was a helmet.</p><br/><p>On top of the Dual God Strength Hammers, dark golden light rays shone as illuminating images of crying and smiling faces interchanged. The fascinating thing was that the spot on his chest was shining, and the light rays were brightening and dimming, displaying an image akin to a throbbing heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Meng Gui stared at Zhou Weiqing furiously. He could not see through Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation at all, but judging from the equipment of his legendary armor set, the cultivation of the young-looking Heavenly Jewel Master might not be any weaker than Long Shiya\u2019s! What was more important was that his silent attacks prior to that were just too horrifying. Even the world\u2019s mightiest killers were no match for his abilities to conceal himself.</p><br/><p>With a flick of the two hammers in his grasp, each drawing a dazzling triangle, they stacked on each other and released the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. At the same time, his ten Heavenly Jewels emerged as well.</p><br/><p>Although the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was slightly different from the Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation, they were similar in most aspects, and it was apparent that his relationship with Long Shiya was not to be taken lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my beloved disciple. What do you think? You\u2019ve never expected this, have you? A Heavenly King-tier powerhouse who had yet to reach the age 23. Is there anyone like him in your Blood Red Hell? Hahahaha!\u201d Long Shiya had not forgotten to show his disciple off at a time like this. The truth was, it was impossible for anyone who happened to have such a great disciple like Zhou Weiqing to not speak proudly of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Zhou Weiqing?\u201d Meng Gui looked at Zhou Weiqing skeptically. He had heard of this name countless times, and the most he had heard of was his performances in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. At that time, Zhou Weiqing had defeated the Little Demon Shen who had Six Jewels while his cultivation base was merely at the level of Three Jewels. The year before, he had once again participated in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament and won against the brothers, Tian Feng and Tian Ma. Meng Gui may have reached the Heavenly Emperor Tier, but his position was actually below the two brothers. They were the future heirs of the Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui also knew that the reason Heavenly Bow Empire could stand again was all due to that young man. However, he had never expected that Zhou Weiqing who still bore the cultivation base of Seven Jewels a year ago to now stand before him with the rank of a Heavenly King Tier. His upgrades were just too fearsome. No matter how skilled the Blood Red Hell was at nurturing powerhouses, it was impossible to develop a Heavenly King within such a short duration!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze was unsteady; he stared at the people coldly. Now, he had already entered another status. The calm and carefree demeanor he bore when he returned with Shangguan Bing\u2019er was now replaced with utter evil. From head to toe, he looked absolutely sinister.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that he turned out like this; these Blood Red Hell powerhouses in front of him intended to mess with his family! When he had first arrived and seen the palace engulfed by the dark Fate Denying Seal, his heart was in so much pain to the extent that he could not breathe.</p><br/><p>It was these bastards from the Bai Da and Kalise Empire who had invaded his homeland, forcing his father to resort to such drastic, suicidal measures to protect the last bloodline of the royalties. Facing these opponents, how could he have mercy?</p><br/><p>The previous three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings had been completely sucked dry by him. He had even devoured the Heavenly God-tier Dreadfiend Sea Naga. It was natural for him to not hold back against these Heavenly Kings. With the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core in place, his Demonic Devour had escalated to another level. Never mind the Heavenly Kings, even the Heavenly God-tier powerhouses would be affected by Demonic Devour in their battles.</p><br/><p>In fact, ever since Zhou Weiqing obtained a complete Saint Nucleus Core, he began to adopt an otherworldly appearance. The gravest mistake of Blood Red Hell had been allowing him to grow. Below those at the Heavenly King Tier, although Zhou Weiqing was absurdly powerful and was much stronger than others of the same rank, he still had certain limitations. However, now that he had broken through Heavenly King Tier and mastered the Heavenly Dao Energy, it would be challenging even for someone like a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse to kill him.</p><br/><p>After that brief shock, Meng Gui gradually calmed himself down. He may not know what attacks Zhou Weiqing had used to assault his subordinates, but after seeing that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was nothing more than that of someone at the Heavenly King Tier, he heaved a sigh in relief. If there were to be two Heavenly God-tier powerhouses here, they would be very troubled, but since Zhou Weiqing was just a Heavenly King, things would be much easier.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if both of you possess six attributes? There\u2019s four of us here, and even if they\u2019re not capable of defeating you, they can still hold you back for some time. Be smart and leave immediately. Otherwise, I can destroy the Fate Denying Seal within an instant and by then, not a single person inside will be left alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Meng Gui was speaking, he had already gathered amongst his three partners. Destruction would always be far easier than construction. He was right, he would only need a little time to launch an attack without minding the price. The Fate Denying Seal below would then be broken, and with a simple technique and he could have everyone inside killed. After all, the people trapped within the Fate Denying Seal for such a long period would be extremely vulnerable. Especially for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s father, the Great Admiral Zhou. It was almost guaranteed that upon the removal of the seal, he would lose his life in an instant as the seal had been sustaining itself by feeding on his life force.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing slowly walked forward in the air as if he could land just about anywhere. He looked calm. However, with his every step forward, the grey airflow on him would increase in volume, and the overflowing evil aura frightened even the destruction aura of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses.</p><br/><p>\u2018How is this possible? He\u2019s nothing but a mere Heavenly King, how could his aura be so terrifying?\u2019 these were the thoughts of every Blood Red Hell powerhouse including Meng Gui.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, let me handle these people,\u201d Zhou Weiqing said flatly. Nevertheless, his tone somehow implied that there was no room for argument. At this moment, his emotions had entered a unique state. With only his enemies in his eyes, he needed to vent. Yes, the flames which had burned for long in his heart required a channel to be unleashed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, don\u2019t be rash,\u201d Long Shiya ordered with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had his back facing Long Shiya, and said, \u201cTeacher, rest assured that I wasn\u2019t being impulsive. I can\u2019t give them any chances. I won\u2019t allow my family to be harmed in any way; everything lies on you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya stared at the broad back of Zhou Weiqing, and thought with a sigh, \u201cThis kid\u2026 He\u2019s no longer the young man who became my apprentice years ago!\u201d His humorous look could no longer conceal the true composure and strength within. To him, it might be a good thing that he had now truly grown. It seemed that after this, Zhou Weiqing no longer required his own protection. Today onward, he would have a position in the world of Heavenly Jewel Masters on the mainland.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, be careful then,\u201d Long Shiya said no more. This was the battlefield, and he chose to trust his beloved disciple unconditionally.</p><br/><p>Unconditional trust. Indeed, this was the best form of acknowledgment of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s capabilities.</p><br/><p>The horrifying energy wave exploded from Zhou Weiqing and in the next instant, the fearsome explosion immediately transformed the heavens and earth to a shade of grey.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui was astonished, \u201cThis kid actually intends to face the four of us with a single concentrated attack?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Long Shiya\u2019s six colored light rays radiated once more and showered the palace below in its illumination. Without a doubt, the master and his disciple had divided their roles \u2013 Long Shiya would be responsible for protecting the seal from being destroyed, while the four Blood Red Hell powerhouse became the targets of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s onslaught.</p><br/><p>The Dual God Strength Hammer in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands rose gradually, and above the two hammer were different lights that were radiating from both hammers.</p><br/><p>The left hammer was shining in black while the one on the right was a purplish red. Within an instant, two huge silhouettes appeared by his side while he was swinging the hammer. They turned out to be Hell Angel and Demonic Dragon Lady.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is\u2026 A Heavenly Skill Projection? But how can he summon two at once, they even look like the main body?\u2019</p><br/><p>With just a single action, the abilities displayed by Zhou Weiqing had far surpassed the knowledge of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses before him.</p><br/><p>The fearsome dark purple light rays and dark red light rays shone almost at the same time. Demonic Dragon Lady and Hell Angel had been summoned by Zhou Weiqing. The command he had given them was to attack.</p><br/><p>Huge dark purple light spheres struck the Blood Red Hell powerhouses one after another, and at the same time, the purplish red light rays on the Demonic Dragon Lady was radiating without stopping as beams of Dragon Silencing Seals shot out without hesitation. She looked just like the Dreadfiend Sea Naga she had encountered previously; her entire body was filled with sharp spikes.</p><br/><p>This offensive attacks from the Demonic Dragon Lady was what Zhou Weiqing had learned from his battle with the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Although he did not have the water element and was unable to copy Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s skill, he was still capable of mimicking its attack nonetheless.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that this attack would consume great amounts of Heavenly Energy, but let\u2019s not forget that he had just devoured the Heavenly Energies of three Heavenly Kings. Furthermore, was Zhou Weiqing still scared of exhausting his energy?</p><br/><p>The three Heavenly Kings of the Blood Red Hell seemed to launch their defenses at the same time as several Heavenly Skill Projections appeared from their bodies.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Silencing Seal was definitely established, but its prerequisite was that it must land on the target\u2019s body. The three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings were no amateurs as well. They possess powerful skills, along with the existence of Destruction Attribute, they blocked Zhou Weiqing\u2019s sudden explosive attack in an instant. After all, Demonic Dragon Lady and Hell Angel were merely summons, and did not truly exist.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Meng Gui had merged himself into the darkness. In fact, no one knew that Meng Gui was the true Number One Killer on the mainland, as this title of his had only applied to him fifty years ago. After becoming a Heavenly Emperor, he had retired from the world of assassination, but he was now even more dangerous compared to his earlier years.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui did not have Spatial Attribute and did not have skills like Blink, but residing in the darkness, he was not inferior to Zhou Weiqing in terms of concealing their presence.</p><br/><p>In the air, Zhou Weiqing suddenly stepped toward the left, with a flash of his shadow, dark Ghostclaws swiped across his initial position, and the air instantly split at that very spot. Even with his legendary armor set and the protection of the Immortal Deity Shield, Zhou Weiqing would be gravely injured if he remained at his previous position.</p><br/><p>While he was on the move, the \u2018crying-face\u2019 hammer in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand smashed toward Meng Gui\u2019s claws almost without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui did not avoid the incoming hit either. He stretched out his five fingers, and the Ghostclaws bent themselves and clasped onto the \u2018crying-face\u2019 hammer.</p><br/><p>After all, Meng Gui was a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse \u2013 any Heavenly Emperor would have absolute confidence. When Zhou Weiqing had voiced out that he would be facing the Blood Red Hell powerhouses with a single powerful strike, Meng Gui was so infuriated, and thought, \u2018What am I in this kid\u2019s eyes? Regardless of how gifted he is, he\u2019s nothing more than a Heavenly King-tier Heavenly Jewel Master. How absurd is it for him to intend on taking down the four of us at the same time?\u2019</p><br/><p>Indeed, the Demonic Dragon Lady and Hell Angel who had been summoned by Zhou Weiqing had shocked him, but it did not make Meng Gui feel that he was much stronger than he was. Therefore, he did not show any signs of wanting to avoid a battle and intended to counter Zhou Weiqing with his own skill.</p><br/><p>The Consolidated Equipment on Meng Gui was entirely in black, which was barely considered a legendary armor set. The whole set consisted of eight pieces \u2013 two of them being the Ghostclaws on his hands. He had always been a Heavenly Jewel Master who focused on the offense.</p><br/><p>Amidst the ear-piercing explosion, the Ghostclaws and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s \u2018crying-face\u2019 hammer had clashed. The next instant, an unbelievable expression surfaced on Meng Gui\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>His body was curled into a ball in the air and flew outward like lightning, similar to how a black cannon would. He had actually been blown away by a single hit of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hammer.</p><br/><p>What was in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands? They were the Dual God Strength Hammers! After the legendary armor set had consolidated with the ninth piece, at what level had his powers become? Never mind Meng Gui, even if Long Shiya was donned in the complete set of Ringless Ground Purging Set, he might not even be a match for Zhou Weiqing in terms of brute force. Even the Heavenly God-tier powerhouses would be inferior to Zhou Weiqing in terms of strength!</p><br/><p>Now, this was really disadvantageous for Meng Gui. Furthermore, there was still a gush of powerful Devour Energy on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s crying hammer. In just an instant of the previous clash, much of Meng Gui\u2019s Heavenly Energy had been extracted.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui had not cried out only because he had been enduring the pain. When he realized something was wrong, he switched from striking to pushing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s powers to fly backward and to minimize the effects on him. However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength was just too shocking; it was likely to weigh hundreds of thousands of pounds. No matter how strong Meng Gui\u2019s cultivation was, even if he had utilized the Darkness Energy in the air to aid him in his defense, the hammer\u2019s strike had still managed to strike a great blow on him.</p><br/><p>The Ghostclaw on his right hand was completely crushed and the entire length of this right arm had paid the price to prevent his body from being destroyed by the energy. His right arm exploded and blood spurted everywhere. Only the energies from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s crying hammer had been dispersed.</p><br/><p>How was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength as simple as a mere Heavenly King Tier?</p><br/><p>While Meng Gui was being blown away, there were no changes to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s facial expressions \u2013 much as if he had long expected this outcome. With a swing of the two hammers in his hands, a huge grey silhouette gradually emerged behind him.</p><br/><p>The three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings were indeed powerful. During his fight with Zhou Weiqing and Meng Gui, they had crushed the Hell Angel and forced the Demonic Dragon Lady to retreat. Once the Demonic Dragon Lady was destroyed, they could then join forces with Meng Gui, surround Zhou Weiqing and kill him.</p><br/><p>To their dismay, Zhou Weiqing would never leave such an opening to them. When his evil aura exploded, Demonic Dragon Lady\u2019s powers also erupted instantly. Strong purplish red light rays radiated immediately, forming a uniform attack toward the same direction.</p><br/><p>Demonic Dragon Lady had actually chosen to self-explode while her aura was the strongest. Self-explosion was a means of offense, and it allowed for her to select which abilities to be upgraded at the same time. Demonic Dragon lady\u2019s mightiest ability was no doubt Dragon Silencing Seal.</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing had upgraded his cultivation to Heavenly King Tier, a group attack became possible for Dragon Silencing Seal. At this moment, supported by the Demonic God which Zhou Weiqing had summoned, the combination of Dragon Silencing Seal with the self-explosion of Demonic Dragon Lady had no doubt achieved the strongest level. It resulted in the failure of the three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings to avoid the attack of Dragon Silencing Seal even though they possessed great defensive abilities.</p><br/><p>Within an instant, the three Heavenly Kings had been left with nothing to defend themselves. Their Consolidated Equipment no longer existed and their Stored Skills had been sealed completely. The sudden changes stunned all three of them.</p><br/><p>Just as Demonic Dragon Lady was about to self-explode, Zhou Weiqing had already vanished from the air. Blink.</p><br/><p>At the very next moment, the three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings felt the space around them collapsing abruptly, while strong beams of Control Skills fell onto them. Without the support of Consolidation and Stored Skills, it would not be easy for them to free themselves from the Control Skill released by Zhou Weiqing with the foundation of Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core, despite their cultivation base.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

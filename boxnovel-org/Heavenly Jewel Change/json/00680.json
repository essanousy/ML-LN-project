You\u2019re the most suitable candidate for this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head, \u201cBut\u2026 I still have many things I need to do. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to carry out this task for the time being.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang continued, \u201cThe Mysterious Heavenly Mainland is more than ten thousand miles away from us. Not only that, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace is very, very powerful! Wanting to snatch food from a tiger\u2019s mouth is not an easy task. You\u2019ll need quite some time to prepare for this. That\u2019s why we hope that you\u2019ll be able to move as soon as possible. As for your other matters, we\u2019ll settle them on your behalf. I, the Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, give you my word that no harm will come to Heavenly Bow City while you\u2019re away. We\u2019ll also take good care of your father. When you come back, we\u2019ll send people over to assist you in restoring the country and save your family. Before you leave, Tianyue and I will set up a wedding between you, Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er. What do you think about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tianyue\u2019s words touched the deepest part of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart. He did not expect that the Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace would agree to the matter without giving him any trouble. At the moment, the thing that worried him the most was his family and Heavenly Bow City. Now that he had the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s promise, he did not have to worry about them anymore. What surprised him more was the fact that the Palace master would agree to his nieces marrying him so easily. From what he could see, Bing\u2019er would definitely be married to him and he might stand a chance with Fei\u2019er, too. However, Shangguan Xue\u2019er? She was the heiress to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace for f*ck\u2019s sake! Now that Shangguan Tianyang had given his permission for him to marry her, it meant that he was handing over almost half of the future of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to Zhou Weiqing. The way Tianyang handled the matter showed his utmost sincerity. Zhou Weiqing was taken aback that Shangguan Tianyang would treat him, a nobody, in such a way,</p><br/><p>Fei\u2019er who was standing by the side could not help but exclaim loudly, \u201cUncle! Must it be Zhou Weiqing who goes there? We know absolutely nothing about the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland! It\u2019s going to be dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not just her. The other three girls were not happy about it as well.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang heaved a sigh, \u201cAlthough Zhou Weiqing isn\u2019t the most powerful person here, he\u2019s got a bright future ahead of him. Especially with that Saint Energy of his. This time, he managed to turn his misfortune into a blessing and made a breakthrough to the Ninth Jewel Level. His strength is no weaker than any Heavenly God master. On top of that, he\u2019s still very young. He\u2019s the most suitable for this task because he won\u2019t be too eye-catching. For this reason, I think he\u2019s the perfect candidate for the task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang was right. Although there were many powerful Heavenly Jewel Masters other than those who were from the Five Great Saint Lands, like Zhou Weiqing\u2019s teacher, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, they were rare and hard to find. Even if they managed to get in touch with one of them, a master who was at the Heavenly God tier or higher might not want to work for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Not only that, they were also no match for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s intelligence, craftiness, and the almighty Saint Energy that he possessed. Better yet, he had a great relationship with the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Chuckling, Zhou Weiqing replied, \u201cI think that I\u2019m the most suitable for this task, too. Since you\u2019ve made your points clear, I\u2019ll make my move soon to obtain the Spatial Teleportation Stone. However, I can\u2019t guarantee that I\u2019ll be able to complete the task successfully. You\u2019ll need to come up with a backup plan for the Heavenly Jewel Island and Zhongtian City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that he had agreed to it, Tianyang finally let out a smile of relief, \u201cWeiqing, we\u2019ll count on you this time. This is a life-or-death matter for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Once we lose the Heavenly Jewel Island, I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be long before the Heavenly Expanse Palace loses its title of the Number One Biggest Saint Land to other lands. Just let us know if you need anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shaking his head, Zhou Weiqing replied, \u201cOther than the Heavenly Bow Empire and my family\u2019s safety, there\u2019s nothing else I need. This time I\u2019ll carry out the task by myself. Just tell me more about that mainland later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNO!\u201d The four women shouted out in unison.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue looked at them in astonishment.</p><br/><p>Colors crept up their cheeks at once. In the end, Fei\u2019er, who was the bluntest, spoke up as she threw a dirty glance at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cThis guy is a womanizer! W-What if he suddenly brings back a few more girls from that Mysterious Heavenly Mainland? We must go with him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s face immediately darkened a few shades, \u201cNonsense! You\u2019re all from the Saint Land. Do you want us to go against our words and betray the treaty? The more people there are, the more apparent our goal will be. If Zhou Weiqing goes alone, it\u2019ll be easy for him to escape if something happens. Furthermore, he has already reached the Ninth Jewel cultivation base so this would be a great training for him to break through to the Heavenly King stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unsatisfied, Fei\u2019er pouted. Still, due to her fear of her uncle, she did not dare to press the issue any further.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Bing\u2019er walked forward after summoning up her courage, \u201cI\u2019ll go with Little Fatty. I\u2019m not from the Saint Land and I\u2019ve never agreed to join the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. I was not brought up in this palace anyway,\u201d Having said that, she lowered her head in embarrassment. Before this, she was separated from Zhou Weiqing for 3 years, she really did not want to be separated from him anymore.</p><br/><p>Xue\u2019er who was standing by the side nodded her head, \u201cI, too, feel that it\u2019ll be better if Bing\u2019er goes with him. At least, she can help watch over him and take care of his daily needs. Bing\u2019er is extremely agile so I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be able to flee in time with Weiqing if they come across any danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was speaking, she glanced over at Tian\u2019er who was standing by her side. Of course, Tian\u2019er\u2019s opinion was very important. If she wanted to go with him, none of them from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace would be able to stop her. Besides, if the two of them worked together, their strength would be much more powerful as well.</p><br/><p>To their surprise, Tian\u2019er actually nodded her head in agreement before she told Zhou Weiqing, \u201cIt\u2019s better to let Bing\u2019er follow you. However, Bing\u2019er, remember not to be too soft-hearted, okay? You must NEVER let this bastard bring another girl home. I\u2019ll go back to the Heavenly Snow Mountain to visit my father,\u201d Her last sentence was directed towards him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head, \u201cAlright. I\u2019m okay with any of you following me there, I\u2019ve no objections.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue\u2019er chimed in, \u201cAfter you leave, Fei\u2019er and I will go to the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not know that there were actually two reasons why Tian\u2019er did not insist on going to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland with him. First, because Zhou Weiqing could generate his own Saint Energy now and there was no need for him to worry about it being depleted. Second, which was also the most important reason, was because she wanted to make peace with the three Shangguan sisters.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, the four girls were no longer able to leave Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side. Since there were three of the Shangguan sisters, Tian\u2019er felt like she was fighting the battle alone. It would do all of them good if she could forge a strong relationship with them. Besides, Bing\u2019er had long known Zhou Weiqing before she did. Although there was still a tiny bit of unwillingness in her heart, she knew that it was the best solution to their situation.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang nodded his head in agreement, \u201cAlright, so it\u2019s set. Weiqing, Bing\u2019er, follow me at once. I need to tell you more about the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland in details.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next few days, Zhou Weiqing continued to stay in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to pass on the remaining matters to the others. The remaining time was spent in some secret meetings with both Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue. Nobody knew the content of their meetings, not even the three Shangguan sisters. They could only vaguely guess that it had something to do with the Destruction Energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing also asked Shangguan Tianyang for a favor. He asked for someone to escort Tian\u2019er back to the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Although with Tian\u2019er\u2019s current cultivation base, there was no need for him to do that. But since she was carrying his child, Zhou Weiqing could not help but feel worried about not being able to accompany her.</p><br/><p>As for the Heavenly Bow Empire, Zhou Weiqing had also written a few letters for Ming Yu, Hua Feng, and a few other people so the two Shangguan sisters could bring the letters back with them. With Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er attending to the matter, there was no need for Zhou Weiqing to worry about the situation anymore. He was not that proficient in being a commander on the battlefield anyway. Might as well let Ming Yu, who was much better in commanding, handle the troops.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning on the third day, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er quietly walked down the Heavenly Jewel Island. The moment they left Zhongtian City, they instantly made their way to the east.</p><br/><p>With her little hand in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand, she kept turning to look at his pale face, \u201cLittle Fatty, are you feeling unwell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed, \u201cOf course not! How can I possibly feel sick with this strong body of mine?\u201d In truth, there was one thing that he was hiding from Bing\u2019er. Because he had to leave for an indefinite amount of time, Tian\u2019er had been squeezing the juices out of him for the past few days, making sure that she dried him up completely before she left. But of course, Zhou Weiqing did not have any complaints.</p><br/><p>After they had ridden far away from Zhongtian City, Zhou Weiqing unleashed his Horned Ghost Demon Horse and let Bing\u2019er sit in front while he hugged her slender waist from behind. They continued to head East along the path as he urged the horse to go faster.</p><br/><p>In accordance with the map that Shangguan Tianyang passed to him, the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland was to the East of the Boundless Mainland. For this reason, they needed to sail to the East from the Mi Ou Empire that was situated in the East.</p><br/><p>For their task this time, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace had gone all out. Shangguang Tianyang had given Zhou Weiqing many good things that were specifically designed to deal with all sorts of potential troubles.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was actually very curious about the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. It had been thousands of years since this Mysterious Heavenly Mainland had any contact with the Boundless Mainland and it must have its own specialty. Not only that, wanting to take their greatest treasure would not be an easy task as well.</p><br/><p>When they were about 30 miles away from Zhongtian City, Zhou Weiqing slowed down his Horned Ghost Demon Horse without warning. Lowering his head, he placed his chin on Bing\u2019er\u2019s shoulder and the warm breath that came out from him sent shivers down Bing\u2019er\u2019s back. Finding it to be itchy, she whispered, \u201cL-Little Fatty, what are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Horned Ghost Demon Horse started to speed up once again and in a blink of an eye, Zhou Weiqing suddenly disappeared from the horse. With no warning at all, he abruptly appeared above the woods by the side as he pushed down his hands to hover in the air. Instantly, terrifying bluish purple color light cloud formed under his palms. Thousands of lightning pearls materialized and enveloped the entire area next to the path with a radius of at least several hundred meters.</p><br/><p>In truth, the Flying Lightning God Technique that he just used was no longer the same as the previous one. Because of the transformation of his Heavenly Energy to Saint Energy, all of the techniques that he used would be cast using the Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>In each and every lightning pearl, silverish white color could be seen at the core. Suddenly, thousands of pearls erupted at once, instantly tearing up the air in the sky. In within the few hundred meters radius, a gigantic black hole could be seen from the air. It was caused by the explosion of the Saint Energy lightning pearls.</p><br/><p>That was right, Zhou Weiqing had sensed two people tailing them since the moment they came down from the Heavenly Jewel Island. Had it not been for his Ice Cold Perception that had long merged with his Saint Energy, he would not have discovered the two vague shadows behind them. The two shadows had been following them and through the vague murderous intent in the air, Zhou Weiqing was certain that the two people did not have any good intentions. That was why he decided to lure them here so he could ambush them.</p><br/><p>The moment he launched his attack, Shangguan Bing\u2019er quickly put away the Horned Ghost Demon Horse into her Spatial Ring. A pair of gigantic wings burst out from her back without warning. With just a light flap, she immediately vanished from the spot, far away from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Flying Lightning God attack.</p><br/><p>Two heedless shadows were thrown out from the vicinity of the Flying Lightning God technique almost instantly. A powerful and tyrannical destruction aura appeared in a flash, shielding them from the terrifying explosion\u2019s aftershock.</p><br/><p>From the red light of Heavenly Energy and the Destructive attribute aura that was being emitted out of their bodies, Zhou Weiqing instantly figured out that those people were from Blood Red Hell without even having to ask them. He had been on the Heavenly Jewel Island for almost half a year, so it came to him as a surprise that there were still Blood Red Hell people waiting for him after so long. Without a doubt, they only had one aim and it was to kill him. And at that moment, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense the level of their cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Kings! The two followers were Heavenly Kings!</p><br/><p>To be fair, even the two powerful young Eighth Jewel Masters who had the Destructive Attribute from the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Dan Dun Troop were defeated in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands. Of course, they would send Heavenly King Masters in order to successfully kill him.</p><br/><p>Before this, Zhou Weiqing could only sense that the people following him were quite formidable but it did not cross his mind that it would actually be two Heavenly Kings. Although they were only at the lower level of the Heavenly King tier, they were still freaking Heavenly King Masters for f*ck\u2019s sake!</p><br/><p>Since a Heavenly King Master possessed the ability to fly, escaping from them was almost impossible. However, Zhou Weiqing was no longer the old him. Although his Consolidating Equipment was not fully assembled yet, with his current cultivation base, he was no longer the Little Fatty Zhou who shat his pants when he came face to face with a Heavenly King.</p><br/><p>The Ringless Ground Purging Set instantly suited up on his body. After the Flying Lightning God Technique exploded, without wasting any time, he was already on the move looking for one of the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Heavenly Kings.</p><br/><p>Currently, the two Heavenly Kings looked rather shabby. The clothes that they were wearing was torn and ragged from the previous explosion. They could not avoid the explosion due to the fact that Zhou Weiqing cast the spell without any warning at all. On top of that, its explosive power was far beyond their imagination. Had it not been for the danger-radar they had from being a Heavenly King that incited them to launch their Consolidating Equipment, they would have been heavily injured from that attack. Even so, they were not in a good state right now. The explosive power of the Lightning attribute was still wreaking havoc in their bodies. The numbness in their body slowed them down significantly. To their surprise, even the Destructive attribute in their body was not able to withstand the impact of the Lightning attribute! How could they possibly not be taken aback by such a situation?</p><br/><p>In just a blink of an eye, the distorted light suddenly enveloped one of the Heavenly King. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Blink was unleashed almost immediately after he had cast the Flying Lightning God Technique.</p><br/><p>At once, the Heavenly King\u2019s entire body was restrained by an invisible force, everything seemed to be slowed down at the moment. Without warning, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual God Strength Hammers crashed down fiercely on his head.</p><br/><p>Absolute Delay! With the Saint Energy, his Absolute Delay was much more powerful than he had expected. Even a Heavenly King stood no chance in front of the technique.</p><br/><p>It was all that he could do to lift his sword up to resist Zhou Weiqing\u2019s dual hammers.</p><br/><p>He could clearly see a hint of purplish-red color in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes. What was more peculiar was his dual hammers began to turn purplish red as well.</p><br/><p>Without any warning, a glimmer of purplish-red light shot out from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s \u2018cry\u2019 hammer and shone on his body. Under the effects of Absolute Delay, the Heavenly King had no chance of dodging at all. In the next second, the Consolidating Equipment on his body vanished without a trace, leaving him defenseless against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hammers. In the midst of the crisis, all he could do was use his arms to defend against the dual hammer\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>WHAM!</p><br/><p>A blood-curdling scream filled the air at once. The Heavenly King\u2019s arms were instantly crushed into a bloody pulp by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s horrifying dual hammers. The Ringless Ground Purging set on his body was still in its original 5-piece set, the power boost was 32 times higher than his usual power and because he was already at the Ninth Jewel cultivation base, that was another 32 times higher than his usual energy. What do you think it would total up to? Without his Consolidating Equipment to guard his body, even a Heavenly King would not be able to defend against this ruthless attack.</p><br/><p>Now that Zhou Weiqing had crushed his opponent\u2019s arms, he continued to smash the hammers down on the Heavenly King\u2019s chest, smacking him down directly into the ground and leaving him buried mid-waist.</p><br/><p>Blood gushed out from the Heavenly King\u2019s mouth. Although he was still breathing because of his tyrannical strength, he was already completely defeated by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King was not the only one that was surprised, Zhou Weiqing himself was taken aback by the current situation, too. Slightly stunned, it never occurred to him that a low-level Heavenly King would be so easily defeated with just a single blow. Yes, it was true that his attack was quite sudden but that was a Heavenly King for goodness sake! How could that guy be so vulnerable to his attack?</p><br/><p>At this moment, a terrifying energy ripples behind him woke him up from his stupor. Without any hesitation, his body turned half a circle and he waved his dual hammers around as a rich silverish light formed in front of him, solidifying into a light shield.</p><br/><p>\u201cWHAM!\u201d The attack was instantly blocked by the silverish light. Tyrannical flames scattered all around the shield. Yet, none of it pierced through the Spatial Rend that solidified into a silver shield. Without a doubt, that was the other Heavenly King.</p><br/><p>Seeing his partner being reduced to such a state with just a blow, this Heavenly King was aghast at the scene in front of his eyes. Yet, he could not discern how Zhou Weiqing managed to do that.</p><br/><p>Without warning, two green lights suddenly swept down from the air. It was a huge pair of wings making its way towards the Heavenly King like a green tornado.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lifted up both of his hammers, a flash of purplish-red light beamed out from his hammers. It was exactly the same technique he used to defeat the first Heavenly King earlier. B-But, what was that? It was the freaking Dragon Silencing Seal!</p><br/><p>Eye-blinding purplish red light flashed past all of a sudden. Just as the Heavenly King tried to use his long staff to resist Bing\u2019er\u2019s attack from the sky, in the next moment, he discovered the Consolidating Equipment on his body had dissolved into nothingness.</p><br/><p>However, the man seemed to have a backup plan. Before the purplish red light reached him, a gigantic tortoise phantom suddenly emerged from his back. Rich red light mixed with Destructive attribute formed a layer of light shield and blasted Bing\u2019er\u2019s attack away.</p><br/><p>However, in the next second, his shield vanished without a trace. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s dual hammers appeared in front of him in a flash.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King finally understood how his partner was defeated by Zhou Weiqing. The young man in front of him, their target, did not seem to have to store and accumulate his power before casting his techniques. On top of that, his techniques were all exceptionally powerful. It far exceeded his expectations. Ninth Jewel? How could he possibly be Ninth Jewel? Wasn\u2019t their target supposed to be only at the Sixth Jewel?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he was not given the opportunity to even finish his thoughts. Before he could do anything, he suddenly felt his body being constricted by something invisible and multiple lights were shining on his body. In that instance, the lights transformed into a force that started to constrict and strangulate his entire body at once. It left him with no chance to cast his Heavenly King level attack.</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er could clearly see the Fetters of Wind, Absolute Delay and the Touch of Darkness on the Dual God Strong Hammers. That was how Zhou Weiqing defeated the Heavenly Kings. The Heavenly King was so infuriated that he wanted to freeze Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms. He was a Heavenly King after all.</p><br/><p>Just when the Dual God Strong Hammers were about to slam down on his head, Zhou Weiqing saw the crazy colors that were filled with Destructive aura in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSH*T!\u201d He quickly activated Blink again. Forfeiting all his attacks, he leaped to Bing\u2019er\u2019s side and pulled her into his embrace. The wings of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation sprouted out from his back before wrapping around his and Bing\u2019er\u2019s bodies.</p><br/><p>In the next second, a burst of madness and Destructive aura erupted from behind him.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King from Blood Red Hell instantly turned entirely red before he detonated abruptly at the same spot. A fireball erupted out from his Dantian and smashed into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>The fireball pierced through the Dragon Silencing Seal instantly. It was so powerful because the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King actually chose to blow himself and his Heavenly Core Nucleus up. It was the most powerful attack of a Heavenly King Master. Even Zhou Weiqing was not able to grab Bing\u2019er to escape such a horrifying scene in time.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the Heavenly King who detonated his own Heavenly Core Nucleus were currently filled with madness. In truth, he was forced to unleash this ultimate technique. His partner had obviously lost his combat ability and he was unable to counter Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strange techniques. Instead of being killed, he might as well gamble with death. There was a secret method in Blood Red Hell that allowed a person to survive even after he blew his Heavenly Core Nucleus up. Of course, it would also take 10 years for him to completely heal. Although the price was high and painful, it was still much better than being killed without resisting.</p><br/><p>A battle between two Heavenly Jewel Masters often would end in a very short time. Even if your cultivation base was much higher than your opponent, as long as the gap in between was not too large, you still risk being wiped out by your opponent if you lost the upper hand. That was why he decisively chose to use this suicide attack.</p><br/><p>After the fiery red Heavenly Core Nucleus smashed into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back, the terrifying Destructive flame broke out instantly, completely enveloping Zhou Weiqing and his wings that were covering Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>That Blood Red Hell Heavenly King slumped down to the ground instantly. Blood was gushing out from the numerous wounds on his body, particularly from the huge bloody gaping wound on his Dantian that looked extremely gory. With the last remnants of his Heavenly Energy, he struggled to seal his vessels up. When you reached the Heavenly King level, as long as you were not dead, even the last drop of blood in your body could be your key to survival.</p><br/><p>However, his hand suddenly stopped in its track. Something had just entered his sight. It was a layer of gold color that had an edge to it.</p><br/><p>The horrifying flame that was filled with Destructive attribute was actually being extinguished at an alarming rate. The people who were supposed to dissolve in the hot flame were hovering in the air like nothing had happened. Rich, flavorful golden lights formed a layer of light film on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. And the horrifying energy from the Heavenly Core Nucleus did not even manage to pierce through the layer of light; not even a tiny bit.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 T-This is i-impossible!\u201d The Blood Red Hell Heavenly King croaked in a hoarse voice. His eyes were opened so wide that it seemed like it was going to pop out of his eye sockets.</p><br/><p>There were flashes of silver lights and a soft \u2018swish\u2019 sound and before anyone had any time to react, the first Heavenly King\u2019s head instantly left his body. The Silver Emperor Wing Slash!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing would never make the same mistake twice. He quickly killed the buried Heavenly King first before he had a chance to blow himself up, too. If he had done that, Zhou Weiqing would not be able to withstand that attack another time.</p><br/><p>The fiery and golden light was extinguished at almost the same time. Zhou Weiqing released the wings that were enveloping Bing\u2019er as an evil smile crept up onto the corner of his mouth. He slowly turned and looked at the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King who was no longer able to even seal his vessels up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a good-hearted person. I know what you\u2019re thinking. Let me tell you before you die, okay? The thing that blocked your Core Nucleus Detonation is actually my defensive skill that came along with my cultivation. It\u2019s the Immortal Deity Shield. Alright then, that\u2019s all. Goodbye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Within seconds, the \u2018cry\u2019 hammer in his right hand mercilessly slammed to the ground, completely crushing the head of the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King.</p><br/><p>Looking at such a gory scene, Bing\u2019er paled a little. Yet, her eyes were filled with astonishment. She looked up at Zhou Weiqing with a look of disbelief, \u201c\u2026T-They\u2019re at Heavenly King level?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t her fault that she had a hard time processing the scene in front of her. After all, in her mind, the Little Fatty Zhou was still a noobie whom she had to lead to the path of becoming a Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>Looking back, he was completely clueless and he even needed her to constantly guide him. However, in just a few years after that fateful meeting, the two Heavenly Kings were like fruits being chopped and cut under his dual hammers. Even the explosion of the Nucleus Core seemed to have no effect on his body at all! What kind of strange strength was this!</p><br/><p>Listening to Bing\u2019er\u2019s question, all Zhou Weiqing could do was gasp for air heavily. A trail of blood flowed down from the corner of his mouth. Like Bing\u2019er, he himself was completely taken aback by such a scene as well. If somebody told him that he would be able to win against two Heavenly Kings before this battle had taken place, he would definitely think that it was impossible. However, the fact was now laid out in front of him. In truth, he did not even find it that exhausting to fight with two Heavenly Kings.</p><br/><p>C-Could it be because of the Saint Energy? A wonderful feeling welled up in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart as he was struck by an epiphany.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was not bothered and decided to leave the corpses as it was. He shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Bing\u2019er. You ride the horse this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er released the Horned Ghost Demon Horse and once again, both of them leaped up on the horse. Passing the reins to Bing\u2019er, Zhou Weiqing hugged her slender waist from behind as he closed his eyes, still caught up in the epiphany that he had earlier.</p><br/><p>The battle seemed to have ended quickly and decisively with Zhou Weiqing emerging as the victor. But in truth, he had to unleash his full power and cast his technique quickly to catch his opponents off guard. Otherwise, if the two Heavenly King released their full power, it would not be so easy for him to emerge victoriously.</p><br/><p>Another thing that contributed to his victory was that Dragon Silencing Seal. No storing of power, no Heavenly Skill Projection, and one could even say that the power of the technique had increased tenfold. The two Dragon Silencing Seals managed to cause the Heavenly Kings to lose their consolidating and storing ability. That was the main key to his victory.</p><br/><p>After his Saint Energy gained the ability to regenerate itself, Zhou Weiqing realized there was a difference in using his Saint Energy to cast techniques, particularly techniques that had Heavenly Skill Projection. That was right! Even those people from the Dan Dun troop who possessed the Destructive attribute could prevent the Heavenly Skill Projection from missing its mark so how could he possibly not be able to do that now that he had Saint Energy?</p><br/><p>From his epiphany, Zhou Weiqing discovered that his own powerful skills could be unleashed in two different states. The first one was how he carried out the resurrection method last time, it was also called the Charged technique while the second one was called the Immediate technique.</p><br/><p>For techniques that were unleashed immediately, the power would not be strong. It was basically as strong as its original power but the advantage was that it would be an instant kill! Like the Dragon Silencing Seal, even if the immediate launching only had an effect of 5 seconds, it was more than enough to turn the situation around.</p><br/><p>The reasons both of the Heavenly Kings died in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand was mainly because of the Saint Energy. Techniques that were unleashed using Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Ninth Jewel Cultivation base of the Saint Energy was much stronger than the two Heavenly Kings. The Saint attributes managed to block all other attributes\u2019 attacks and it also helped increase the strength of the technique itself several times over. Although Zhou Weiqing had not solidified any Saint Nucleus Core yet, how could the Saint Energy be called the most powerful energy if he could not even fight against a Heavenly King or two?</p><br/><p>As for the Nucleus Core Detonation of the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King, it did indeed cause a lot of trouble to Zhou Weiqing. Fortunately, the main attribute of the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King\u2019s attack was fire and Zhou Weiqing himself was immune to Fire attribute.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he also had the help of the Immortal Deity Shield. To be honest, that was the first time he had seen the power of the Immortal Deity Shield. At first, when he had just unlocked the Immortal Deity Shield, it felt just like an ordinary defensive skill. There were not many changes as well when the shield was upgraded to another level.</p><br/><p>However, after the completion of the Immortal Deity Technique, Zhou Weiqing finally found out that the Immortal Deity Shield was actually quite formidable after the battle. It could even be compared to Ling Tian Ao\u2019s Consolidated Equipment Assembly Set.</p><br/><p>In truth, when a Heavenly King detonated his Nucleus Core, even a Heavenly Emperor would choose to avoid it rather than clashing with it directly. Zhou Weiqing actually received the blow heads-on and even though he was injured, his injury was relatively mild. It only took a short time before it began to heal again. Under the magic of the Saint Energy, his originally tenacious body somehow managed to heal even more quickly now.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing studied his actual strength carefully for a moment. He was certain that with his cultivation base now, he could actually be on par with a Mid-Level Heavenly King. And, he might even stand a chance facing a High-Level Heavenly King. Could this mean that if he managed to solidify the Saint Nucleus Core, he would be able to fight against a Heavenly Emperor?</p><br/><p>Six months in the Luster Spatial Realm had no doubt turned his life around. Shangguan Tianyang also saw this in him, which was why he insisted that Zhou Weiqing was the best candidate to send to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>What Zhou Weiqing did not know was that the leap in his power was actually greatly related to Hui Yao. If Hui Yao did not consume his own Soul Energy to enhance their Spiritual Energy, Zhou Weiqing would not be able to control this huge amount of energy with the sudden increase in his cultivation base. Unfortunately, he did not have much time to assemble his Consolidating Equipment to make it complete. Otherwise, with his cultivation base along with the Ringless Ground Purging Set that could help him multiply his energy manifold, he would be able to fight against a High-Level Heavenly King directly.</p><br/><p>One could say that, after he had left the Luster Spatial Realm, Zhou Weiqing was a real strong and elite Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er leaned against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s warm arms while controlling the direction of the Horned Ghost Demon Horse. Her heart was filled with a tranquil warmth and serenity. Right now, there was only one thought in her mind, \u201cMy Little Fatty has managed to become this powerful!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next 2-3 weeks, the two of them rarely dismount from the horse to rest. Only the Horned Ghost Demon Horse\u2019s endurance could stand such a long journey, running in high-speed without any rest. During this time, Zhou Weiqing was mostly in a daze. Bing\u2019er did not disturb him. Instead, she took care of his basic needs throughout the journey. However, there was one thing that she found funny and embarrassing at the same time. Although this guy seemed to be deep in thoughts and enlightenment every day, once night had fallen, he would suddenly be brimming with energy\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

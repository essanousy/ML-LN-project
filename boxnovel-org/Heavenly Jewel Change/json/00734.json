Vaguely, he had an impression that under the tremendous pressure by the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, his body seemed to have undergone an extraordinary transformation, which led to the birth of another special technique. Along with the second stage of his Dragon-Tiger Transformation, he had launched an attack but he could not remember anything from the events that happened after that attack.</p><br/><p>Summoning his own Heavenly Jewels, Zhou Weiqing immediately noticed something peculiar.</p><br/><p>Before this, the first four of his Heavenly Jewels were already fully stored with techniques. The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya did tell him that he should never simply store just any technique unless it was some of the more extraordinary ones. This was because that he possessed too many attributes and when there were too many techniques for him to the point that it was too much for the eyes to feast on, it would have an adverse effect on his cultivation base instead.</p><br/><p>After that, Zhou Weiqing only stored one technique \u2014 the Nether State of Tian\u2019er\u2019s mother, Phelia the Entropic Nether Tiger. This technique occupied the position of the fifth Jewel.</p><br/><p>However, he discovered that there were some changes to his sixth Jewel. It was no longer the Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye Jewel but instead, it had turned into a grey crystal.</p><br/><p>When he carefully infused his Saint Energy into it, he soon made an earth-shaking discovery. He was astonished to find that in this sixth jewel, all of the other five attributes had been completely repelled, leaving only the pure Evil Attribute, while a technique from the Evil Attribute was stored in it.</p><br/><p>This was not the first Evil Attribute technique that Zhou Weiqing possessed. His Ward of the Demon God was the first but instead of occupying a position in the jewels, it stood by itself as a unique technique. Of course, there were also other Evil Attribute techniques that occupied the jewels, like the powerful Demonic Devour and the Dark Demon God Lightning.</p><br/><p>This technique right now must be the fourth one then. However, Zhou Weiqing was certain that this technique was definitely the strongest one. He could faintly feel that it was triggered by some energy inside his own bloodline, probably the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline. The technique\u2019s name was called the Demon God\u2019s Possession.</p><br/><p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s speculation was not entirely correct. Though it was true that the Demon God\u2019s Possession technique was related to the Dark Demon God Tiger, it had actually already surpassed the existence of the Dark Demon God Tiger.</p><br/><p>From the Dark Demon God\u2019s Tiger Bloodline that he inherited, there was a tiny trace of the Demon God\u2019s Bloodline in it. This was also why he had a connection to the Demon God. However, the fact that the Dark Demon God Tiger did not have the Saint Energy must not be forgotten, which was also known as the strongest attribute ever.</p><br/><p>Many times, Zhou Weiqing had used his Saint Energy to activate this trace of the Demon God Bloodline. Just like the day that he was fighting against the Dreadfiend Sea Naga when he encountered a life-threatening situation, under the self-defense mechanism of the Demon God Bloodline, peculiar changes took place.</p><br/><p>In other words, the Demon God Energy that he possessed in his bloodline now had far surpassed the Dark Demon God Tiger and achieved another level. That was how the Demon God\u2019s Possession technique came to be in the first place. This technique had never been possessed before by the Dark Demon God Tiger.</p><br/><p>It was precisely due to this formidable technique that he was able to inflict injuries to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga that was at the Heavenly God-tier.</p><br/><p>This was actually possible?</p><br/><p>Lying there on the bed chuckling like an idiot, Zhou Weiqing could not stop himself from grinning from ear to ear. He had met with many peculiar things in this long period of cultivation but this was the first time he had come across such an amazing thing.</p><br/><p>Although he was not sure how powerful the Demon God\u2019s Possession was, the mere fact that he survived and was still alive now was clear evidence of this technique\u2019s atrocity, not to mention the fact that he even inflicted injuries on the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Despite how it had given him a splitting headache after the unleashing of power the last time, it was all worth it! This technique was basically like his trump card!</p><br/><p>The door opened and a young girl who looked like she was around seventeen or eighteen years old walked in from the outside. She had normal features and some freckles on her nose.</p><br/><p>As soon as she entered the room and saw Zhou Weiqing who was chuckling idiotically, she was completely taken aback, \u201cH-Huh? I-Is this man going crazy now? What should I do?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face immediately froze. A slight twitch could be seen in his mouth as he was at a loss whether to cry or to laugh, \u201cWhat do you mean by going crazy? I\u2019m perfectly fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he sat up while rubbing his temples. Although the Demon God\u2019s Possession was immensely powerful, its side effects were quite obvious as well. He was still not able to reply her properly.</p><br/><p>Patting her own chest, the girl flashed a wide smile, \u201cYou scared the hell out of me. I thought you really went crazy for a moment. If you did go crazy, I wouldn\u2019t be able to face that beautiful sister anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to the girl\u2019s honest remark, Zhou Weiqing asked curiously, \u201cWhat is this place? A beautiful woman sent me here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl nodded her head, \u201cWe are here in Jimoor Village, a small fishing village. You\u2019ve been asleep for two days and the beautiful sister was the one who gave me some money to let you put up here. She\u2019ll be back as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Subconsciously, Zhou Weiqing touched his own chest and the necklace containing the Spatial Teleportation Stone was still there. However, why would Dongfang Hanyue purposely leave him here and left all by herself? Could it be that she had something urgent to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you hungry? I\u2019ll get you something to eat,\u201d the girl said to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>He nodded, \u201cAlright. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shyly, the girl smiled and turned around to leave the room.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing proceeded to sit up for a while and realized that his headache had slowly subsided. He sighed secretly in his heart. It was good that Dongfang Hanyue had now gone. He really did not know how should he face her after all this. Now that he had taken away their most treasured item of the palace, she did not even attempt to take it back from him. Perhaps, the reason why she refused to see him was to avoid the awkwardness between the two of them. Since he had now completed his mission, it was time to return home. The earlier he could leave and settle the problems with the Luster Spatial Realm, he could assist in saving a lot of manpower and material resources at the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. They no longer have to worry about the relocation of Zhongtian City any longer.</p><br/><p>As he was pondering, he took out a peculiar-looking silverish white gemstone from the Sumeru Ring.</p><br/><p>This was the Sound Transmission Stone. Even though it could not function at a distance of tens of thousands of miles, it could still at a distance of up to thousands of miles. This was an item that was taken out by Zhou Weiqing from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace when he first departed on the trip. One was for him while the other was for Bing\u2019er, just in case they got separated in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland and fell into a situation where it was hard for them to communicate with one another.</p><br/><p>Gently infusing Saint Energy into the Sound Transmission Stone, the silverish white gemstone glistened all of a sudden. The intense Spatial Attribute energy ripples caused Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand which was holding on to the stone to become slightly transparent. Faint silverish white light shone our bright and the strange Spatial Energy suddenly shrouded his body entirely. The sound transmission had just begun.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, Bing\u2019er!\u201d Zhou Weiqing issued a soft call.</p><br/><p>He had tried using this object before and it produced excellent results. Very convenient indeed.</p><br/><p>However, even after he had tried to call out to her, there was no response from her at all after quite a while.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart sank. He attempted to call her again. Still, there was no response as well.</p><br/><p>Right now, the village girl had just come into the room with the food. Seeing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body glowing in a silverish light color, she was so taken aback that her jaw was agape.</p><br/><p>Waving his hand at her, Zhou Weiqing motioned to leave the room first. He was already in a state of panic that he could not reach Bing\u2019er at all. So, naturally, he did not have the mood to explain the situation to her, let alone eat the food.</p><br/><p>He got out from the bed and stood on the ground. Again, he made repeated calls to Bing\u2019er but every time, his call was akin to a stone sinking into the deep sea. There was still no response at all from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on? Why didn\u2019t Bing\u2019er respond? I\u2019ve already made it clear to her that once we\u2019re both separated, she\u2019d need to have the Sound Transmission Stone by her side all the time! I\u2019d need to be able to contact her at any time so that I can bring her back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething is wrong! Something had to be wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>At times, the things one held dear to one\u2019s heart often confused them. Right now, Zhou Weiqing was unable to keep a composed heart. He had become entirely restless with anxiety.</p><br/><p>There was a purpose for him and Bing\u2019er to come to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, and right this moment she was still stuck at the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s headquarters. If something went wrong, it would definitely not due to a trivial matter.</p><br/><p>At once, Zhou Weiqing was feeling so jittery that he kept pacing back and forth in the room. He could not find out what was actually happening right there. Could it be that Dongfang Hanyue was suddenly seized with remorse and became unwilling to give him the Spatial Teleportation Stone? Or perhaps, it was because of other changes?</p><br/><p>No! No, it can\u2019t be! Though the duration he was in contact with her was not that long, Zhou Weiqing was able to clearly see what kind of person Dongfang Hanyue truly was. She was smart but she was not particularly rational. On the contrary, she was quite an emotional person. She really fancied him a lot.</p><br/><p>As he thought about this, Zhou Weiqing suddenly thought of a possibility. She was probably afraid of losing him, but at the same time, she was also scared of being rejected if she had persuaded him to stay. Maybe that was why she detained Bing\u2019er instead? Perhaps, she was waiting for him to go back to her?</p><br/><p>Yes! This was most likely the case. A bitter smile crept up onto his face. With a sense of helplessness in his heart, he suddenly gave himself a good hard smack on the face in a callous manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty Zhou! It\u2019s all your fault! Why did you have to flirt around? See, even Bing\u2019er is dragged into this mess now! No, I need to go back to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace now! As the saying goes, two rivals in love will never see eye to eye. We\u2019d be in deep trouble if Hanyue suddenly decides to do something to Bing\u2019er later!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he thought that Bing\u2019er would be harmed, Zhou Weiqing became even more alarmed. Be that as it may, he was still a person who had experienced all sorts of hardships. He also knew that with his condition right now, there was nothing much that he could do even if he were to rush back there now. At the very least, he would have to recover his cultivation base to the most optimal condition first before he could do anything.</p><br/><p>He walked towards the table and picked up the food that the girl sent over, before gobbling it down in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Naturally, what a small fishing village would have the most, was fish. Though the delicious fish soup was not prepared in an outstanding method, it turned out to be quite tasty. Along with some coarse grains and vegetables, the meal could be considered as quite sumptuous. Unfortunately, right now, Zhou Weiqing had lost all of his appetites. Even the tastiest food tasted like chewing gum in his mouth.</p><br/><p>After gobbling down the food in a haste, he quickly returned to bed and started to sit down with his legs crossed, entering the cultivation state instantly.</p><br/><p>His Saint Energy had an extraordinary characteristic. There was no need for him to worry about being disrupted as he could easily pause his cultivation anytime. For this reason, he did not directly order the girl to not disrupt him. What he needed right now was to restore his body to the most optimal condition in the shortest time possible so that he could go to Bing\u2019er\u2019s rescue.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy in his body was functioning on its own. Zhou Weiqing was not clear how it would restore the Spiritual Energy in his body but there was one thing that he was certain \u2014 anything was possible with his Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Facts had proven this point as well. Along with the continuous running of his 36 Death Acupuncture Points, the Saint Energy that had leveled up to the 38th tier was even purer now and during his cultivation, it continued to reduce the throbbing pain in his head.</p><br/><p>This was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first cultivation after his Saint Energy had been raised to the 38th tier. He realized that the Saint Energy Galaxia in his body\u2019s Saint Energy had obviously increased a lot. As a whole, it had become much purer now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

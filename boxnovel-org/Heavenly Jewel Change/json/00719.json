I will not marry the guy. Have you forgotten why we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon backed off immediately as if he was truly afraid of Meng Xing, \u201cFine, fine, we\u2019ll come back to this after we deal with the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing took a deep breath and slowly nodded. A concentrated pool of energy exploded from her body. A blinding golden light suffused her body as she entered the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation state in an instant.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhou Weiqing was some distance away, he could clearly see Meng Xing who was standing on top of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>A pair of gigantic of wings sprouted from Meng Xing\u2019s back. The set of legendary equipment that Zhou Weiqing had seen before also appeared on her body.</p><br/><p>Dark gold scales materialized all over her body one by one. Very quickly, six pieces of equipment had materialized. The seventh piece was the helmet that had the appearance of a dragon\u2019s maw. It lacked feminine grace but it spoke volumes about the wearer\u2019s strength. Her gorgeous face was covered by a mask. Alas, the distance was too far for Zhou Weiqing to get a good look of her face because the mask on Meng Xing\u2019s face was similar to the one used by the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, Dongfang.</p><br/><p>Seven pieces. Seven pieces of the legendary equipment had materialized but it was obviously not the full extent of Meng Xing\u2019s capability. Soon, the eighth piece started to manifest. The eighth piece extended from around her waist. Bathed in a strong dark gold glow, the eighth piece was not a piece of wearable equipment but it joined her to the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s horn behind her. It attached her body to the top of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s head. The dark gold armor kept expanding downwards until it merged with the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s skull.</p><br/><p>A layer of eerie Demonic Energy burst from the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s body and the concentrated energy coursed through the dragon\u2019s horn into Meng Xing.</p><br/><p>The ninth dark gold glow appeared then. This time, the armor appeared directly on the Blackfiend Dragon. The dark gold armor expanded from underneath Meng Xing, fastening her legs to the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s head in the process. The armor extended downwards following the curve of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s neck to cover the exposed scales under the dragon\u2019s neck. It kept on growing until it covered the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s neck completely.</p><br/><p>Goodness! What kind of legendary equipment was this?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing studied this with his jaw hanging open. He had a hard time believing his eyes. There was a Jewel Master\u2019s legendary equipment that could combine his or her own body to a Heavenly Beast. And to top it off, that beast was a dragon. At this moment, Meng Xing and the Blackfiend Dragon looked like they were sharing the same body. He could sense only one extremely powerful presence of a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse from them and there was no other energy present.</p><br/><p>If Zhou Weiqing did not witness this for himself, he would have a hard time believing that legendary equipment could be created in such a manner. It was obvious that the ninth piece of Meng Xing\u2019s legendary equipment had been created using the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s energy. Otherwise, it would not have been able to cover such a large surface area. After the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s weakness on the bottom of his neck was covered, his defenses had increased tremendously and Zhou Weiqing bet that his attack damage must have also increased crazily as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing swallowed his saliva in incredulity. A question popped into his mind, \u2018The ninth piece. That has to be all\u2026 Right?\u2019</p><br/><p>The answer was no. This set of legendary equipment was so unusual so why would it stop at the ninth piece?</p><br/><p>The tenth dark gold glow appeared. This time, it manifested on top of Meng Xing\u2019s head. A resounding dragon\u2019s cry that rocked the sea surface into wave crests of several hundred zhang <sup>1 </sup>high escaped from the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s jaw.</p><br/><p>The dark gold glow soared into the sky as Meng Xing raised her right arm. As she did that, the eleventh dark gold glow seemed to radiate from her body.</p><br/><p>A large dark golden spear floated in front of her. The spear was 7 meters long and it was thick in the middle and tapered off to a tip on both ends. The whole spear was pitch black and was encircled by the carvings of two dragons. The dragons\u2019 heads met in the middle of the spear\u2019s body, and they were holding an eye-catching red jewel.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s right dragon claw landed on the jewel, or in other words, the center point of the spear.</p><br/><p>A palpable vibration made the sea groan. An incredible presence erupted from the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A red as vibrant as blood replaced the dark golden glow almost instantly. A blood red spear, a blood red scaled armor and even the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s horn had turned a bloody red.</p><br/><p>What did this mean? This meant that this was the completed set of legendary equipment. Eleven pieces, eleven f*cking pieces! How unbelievable\u2026 Eleven pieces!</p><br/><p>Even back on the Boundless Mainland, only the first ranked Boundless Infinitum Set was made up of eleven pieces. While on this Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, Zhou Weiqing had discovered another set with eleven pieces of equipment. The Blackfiend Dragon Set. This was the real and authentic Blackfiend Dragon Set. One had to merge with the Blackfiend Dragon itself to unleash its full potential.</p><br/><p>From a certain perspective, this Blackfiend Dragon Set was slightly weaker than the Boundless Infinitum Set. After all, it needed to borrow the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s energy to reach its maximum potential. However, if one was to compare on pure power alone, it would probably be stronger than the Boundless Infinitum Set because the wearer would be standing atop a Heavenly God, the Blackfiend Dragon!</p><br/><p>Even Old Geezer Xue would have a hard time defeating Meng Xing in this state. Even though Zhou Weiqing\u2019s impression of Meng Xing was already very high after their match earlier, watching her morph into a dragon rider made him realize he had truly underestimated her.</p><br/><p>With Meng Xing\u2019s cultivation level, even without the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s help, Zhou Weiqing believed he would not have been her match. Thus, it was not surprising why she alone did not join the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s elders to set up the ward. She was going to be the main combat force for the upcoming battle. Her power had completely merged with the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>A scary energy fluctuation erupted on the surface on the ocean and the howl echoing from the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s mouth increased in intensity. This was a provocation. An incendiary taunt directed at the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing flapped the wings on his back harder to elevate himself. He wanted a good view of this battle. This type of valuable experience would be extremely beneficial to his future cultivation\u2026 That was of course, only be the case if he could make sure he wasn\u2019t roped into the battle.</p><br/><p>After a moment of shock, he was actually disappointed. The Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing\u2019s combined power, coupled with the Ward of Darkness would give the Dreadfiend Sea Naga a hard time even if the sea naga was slightly more powerful than the Blackfiend Dragon.</p><br/><p>Under this situation, the Spatial Teleportation Stone would not be used. Then how was he going to accomplish his goal?</p><br/><p>Of course, he had expected things might go awry. Given the state of things, there was nothing he could do. He could only watch and try to look for an opportunity when there was none.</p><br/><p>With a flap of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s gigantic wings, his giant body soared even higher and his powerful presence was released in an unbridled manner. The initially clear dragon howl suddenly became spirited and the dragon\u2019s presence washed over the area in palpable waves.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing who was far away was almost knocked out of the sky by the presence of the dragon. In just a blink of an eye, the sky was filled with dark clouds. They were all Demonic Clouds that were heavy with demonic energy.</p><br/><p>Is this the power of a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse? Even though Zhou Weiqing had met Hui Yao, his wife, and Old Geezer Xue, he had never seen a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse in actual combat. The full extent of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s power gave him a new understanding of Heavenly God Tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>What he felt at the moment was the Blackfiend Dragon had become the judge of everything in sight. Even the ocean underneath them had to surrender to his power. From the sky to the ocean, all the energy seemed to have turned into a giant pool of demonic energy, and the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s enormous body was the axis on which the entire world spun on.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing contemplated his own minuscule existence. Without the protection of Saint Energy, he felt like his own body could disintegrate at any given moment. It felt like even a gaze from the Blackfiend Dragon could destroy anything within the range of this demonic energy.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing who stood on the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s head was incredibly conspicuous. The blood-red glow enveloped her entire frame and the seven-meter long spear was slanted and pointed towards the sky. The place where she was standing was the point where the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s energy pooled.</p><br/><p>They were openly provoking the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, luring it to face them!</p><br/><p>Even though this method might seem overly simple and even a bit foolish, it was the perfect method to enrage a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse.</p><br/><p>Heavenly God Tier powerhouses had the tendency of being conceited and arrogant. They valued pride more than anything else. Being provoked so blatantly in its own territory would really rub the Dreadfiend Sea Naga the wrong way. If it did not show itself, it would not have the face to show itself around the ocean and rule it anymore.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Zhou Weiqing became increasingly nervous. An earth-splitting battle was going to happen and it was really not the right time for him to get nervous. Even though the Mysterious Heavenly Palace had made all the necessary preparations, this was still the ocean, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga would not be so easily defeated in his own territory. At the same time, he had to look for an opportunity to grab the Spatial Teleportation Stone. The thing that negatively influenced his conviction was the great reception he had received from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, especially Meng Xing. After all, he had taken advantage of her. Even though she had tried to take revenge on him, Zhou Weiqing could tell she still cared about him. Even after he had done those unsavory things to her in the alternative space, she did not harbor any murderous intention towards him.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even if he managed to get his hands on the Spatial Teleportation Stone, the optimum outcome Zhou Weiqing was hoping for was that nobody from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace would be harmed.</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"2eaa2638-e264-85e0-134f-c9296e875ee2\">Zhang, Wade-Giles chang, an old Chinese measure of length equal to 10 chi, or 3.58 metres (11 feet 9 inches).

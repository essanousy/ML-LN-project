She grew up in the Heavenly Bow Empire, and she considered herself a citizen of the Heavenly Bow Empire. She might look soft on the outside, but among the three sisters, she was the most stubborn one. If her mind was made up, there was no changing it. Just like her relationship with Zhou Weiqing, she would elope with him if Shangguan Tianyue was opposed to them being together.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was mesmerized by the Gold Pearl in his hands. He was sure that the pearl came from a Millennia Oyster! The pearl exuded a unique aura and did not need any other embellishment to make it more exquisite. The pearl alone had a calming effect when it was placed in a room. However, that was not the important part. Duan Tianlang had told him that he might be able to obtain another Ringless Ground Purging Set if he had a Millennia Gold Pearl. That would mean he would be able to progress to the level of the Boundless Infinitum Set.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang did not feel too much pressure as he was confident with Zhou Weiqing, with him already having the materials for the Ringless Ground Purging Set. Ever since he met Zhou Weiqing, he had been researching ways to improve the Ringless Ground Purging Set. He had mentioned the Millennia Gold Pearl to Zhou Weiqing before. However, the pearl was too rare, and Zhou Weiqing could not find it anywhere in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. It was completely out of his expectation that a pearl would fall into his hands.</p><br/><p>After all, these were two different mainlands. Something considered rare on the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Boundless Mainland might not be considered the same on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. As the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland was not as abundant in land and resources as the Boundless Mainland, the extent of oceanic development was more advanced here. Millennia Oysters which produce Millenia Gold Pearls only existed in the depths of the ocean. Although it was considered to be precious on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, it would not be considered as exceedingly rare.</p><br/><p>Er Chun was good at reading people\u2019s expression. When he saw how Zhou Weiqing was admiring the pearl, he knew that Zhou Weiqing liked the gift that he had brought. He tried to hide the excitement he felt and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been collecting these for a couple of years. If Master likes it, I\u2019ll you bring you more in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although wealth was important to a Heavenly Jewel Master, what else could be considered to be more precious than a Master Level Consolidated Equipment Scroll? Besides, Er Chun had a plan of his own. With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s identity as a God Tier Master, he would definitely have a high position as soon as he entered the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. If Zhou Weiqing managed to rise in ranks, what would all these items even be worth? He would definitely be able to get back 10, maybe even 100 times the value.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing put the Millennia Gold Pearl back into the box carefully before he handed it over to Shangguan Bing\u2019er who was standing next to him. \u201cThese treasures are beautiful. Er Chun, you\u2019ve been very kind. I\u2019ll close an eye to what you did this morning. However, please show more restraint in the future, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Er Chun was over the moon. He was most afraid of meeting someone with a strong sense of righteousness. If that were the case, he would be finished. It was clear that Zhou Weiqing was not like that as he had no qualms in accepting the gift. As long as Zhou Weiqing accepted his gift then it would mean that everything was resolved?</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er held the box close to her. She liked the Gold Pearl a lot and was secretly happy as she looked at the box. Little Fatty was just too naughty. Here he was playing the role of a corrupted official. To be exact, he was playing the role of a greedy God Tier Master. However, she was not opposed to the way he handled the situation. After all, these were resources from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. It would be dumb if they refused the gift.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a series of knocking could be heard from the door. Zhou Weiqing raised an eyebrow. They were newcomers here. Why would there be visitors?</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Zhou Weiqing said softly while Er Chun glanced skeptically at the door.</p><br/><p>A beaming old man entered the room. \u201cBrother Zhou, you got me good!\u201d It was Master Gu Yu that he met on The Pearl.</p><br/><p>Although Gu Yu\u2019s clan was not in Ubaatar City, it was located nearby. A younger clan member of his took part in the Mysterious Heavenly Selection this morning, and because Zhou Weiqing had killed the three brats, his clan member had obtained a spot.</p><br/><p>Gu Yu regretted his decision the moment he found out that Zhou Weiqing was a God Tier Master. So he tried to remedy his mistake. He could not blame himself for the oversight either; Zhou Weiqing was really too young.</p><br/><p>If he had known earlier, he would definitely have gotten Zhou Weiqing to join his clan and never let him go. With a God Tier Master in his clan, given enough time, they might be able to form another Saint Land! What made him the most depressed was the fact that he was the one who had written Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s recommendation letters. He should have known! Why would such a beauty like Shangguan Bing\u2019er be with such a mediocre looking man if wasn\u2019t for his talent? Moreover, he was a God Tier Master!</p><br/><p>However, it was too late now as Zhou Weiqing had shown interest in joining the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. No matter how daring Gu Yu was, he did not have the guts to stop Zhou Weiqing as it would bring trouble to his clan. Knowing this, Gu Yu still insisted on paying him a visit. After all, he had saved Zhou Weiqing\u2019s life and wished to claim that debt with additional interest. Also, it was beneficial for himself to have a close relationship with a God Tier Master.</p><br/><p>Realizing that it was Gu Yu, Zhou Weiqing smiled as he greeted him. \u201cAhh, it\u2019s Master Gu Yu. You can\u2019t blame me for hiding the truth! It was our first encounter, and we were in the middle of the sea where anything could happen, so I had no choice but to be a little cautious. Don\u2019t worry, Master. I won\u2019t forget the debt I owe you for saving my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Er Chun became solemn when he saw Gu Yu. Although his cultivation was lower compared to Master Gu Yu, he was not fearful of Gu Yu as he came from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Gu Yu also noticed Er Chun\u2019s presence and smiled at him. \u201cOh, Brother Er Chun is here as well. You\u2019ve rendered a great service for the Mysterious Heavenly Palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two were sly old foxes, but Zhou Weiqing was also a crafty youngster himself. Although only a few simple words were said, the underlying meanings were all laid bare. Zhou Weiqing had placated Gu Yan\u2019s heart, while Gu Yan indicated to Er Chun that he would not be touching Zhou Weiqing</p><br/><p>Er Chun then smiled as he said to Gu Yu,\u201dOld Brother Gu Yu, you saved the God Tier Master\u2019s life? What\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled as he explained, \u201cI was out at sea with my wife to kill some sea creatures to collect Nucleus Core so that we can make Consolidated Equipment Liquid. We didn\u2019t expect to encounter the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. We almost lost our lives. Fortunately, we ran into Master Gu Yu and managed to survive. Without him, I might not be here today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, a person\u2019s strength is limited. To study how to go about making a Legendary Set, a significant amount of financial resources are needed. I suppose only the Mysterious Heavenly Palace has the financial ability to help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLegendary Set?\u201d Gu Yu and Er Chun said in unison. Shangguang Bing\u2019er watched the two old men gulping at practically the same time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled lightly. \u201cI\u2019ve just entered the God Tier Master Level recently. The materials to make the Consolidated Equipment Liquid is just too rare. My cultivation is being slowed down because of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Er Chun instantly understood what Zhou Weiqing was trying to say. \u201cRest assured, Master. The Mysterious Heavenly Palace will provide you with the best and give you the best treatment. Furthermore, You\u2019re a God Tier Master so you won\u2019t be restricted in any way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yu sighed in his heart. He knew that it was too late for him to say anything now. Fortunately, Zhou Weiqing still remembered him saving his life. He thought about it and decided to curb his desire for the Legendary Set. There was still plenty of time for him to bring up the topic in the future. Even if he asked, Zhou Weiqing might not be able to do much as he had just gotten to the God Tier Master Level. It would be wiser to talk to him after he had settled down in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.In any case, Zhou Weiqing owed him his life, which he would have to repay one day eventually.</p><br/><p>Both Er Chun and Gu Yu did not want to leave so they stayed on making small talk. They only left when Zhou Weiqing said that he was going to cultivate. Er Chun promised to pick Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er up and send them to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace headquarters to participate in the finals.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had no idea what sort of methods the Mysterious Heavenly Palace used to deliver letters, only that it seemed extremely advanced. When Er Chun picked them up the next morning, he told them that the Mysterious Heavenly Palace had already replied his letter and ordered him to protect Zhou Weiqing and his wife. He was also ordered to get Sang Tan, the Ubaatar mayor, to keep the appearance of a God Tier Master a secret.</p><br/><p>A luxurious carriage with eight horses was prepared exclusively for Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er. Besides that, eight people from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace including Er Chun were sent to escort them. It could be said that the Mysterious Heavenly Palace went all out for them as these people were elites from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace who were in Ubaatar City. After resolving things with Zhou Weiqing, Er Chun now had Zhou Weiqing\u2019s safety as his number one priority. Putting aside the question of whether he would gain anything from Zhou Weiqing, being able to send a God Tier Master to the headquarter was considered a great service.</p><br/><p>The carriage was so wide it could easily fit 10 people. The interior was covered in leather, and the carpet was made from the fur of some Heavenly Beast. Inside, there was a bed, a seat and a table filled with food. The carriage was even better than the one which he rode at the Heavenly Bow Unit. Zhou Weiqing chuckled as they got on the carriage. \u201cThis Er Chun sure knows how to enjoy life. This is such a treat.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s a miraculous success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression was filled with surprise. He approached Long Shiya and bowed respectfully towards his teacher. Long Shiya\u2019s breakthrough at this point in time would be greatly beneficial towards his future plans. Above all else, his teacher was finally able to complete his life\u2019s ambition. How could Zhou Weiqing not feel happy for him?</p><br/><p>Long Shiya looked at Zhou Weiqing. The fat meat on his face squished his small, smiling eyes so much that they could not be seen, \u201cThe wisest decision I\u2019ve ever made in this lifetime is accepting you as my disciple, kid. Hahahaha, Heavenly God. I\u2019ve finally become a Heavenly God. See if I don\u2019t fight my way up to Heavenly Snow Mountain and pull out all of the teeth of that old geezer, Xue Ao\u2019tian. Wahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya certainly was not blowing his own trumpet. He had the Six Great Attributes, and his cultivation base had broken through to the Heavenly God Tier. He was certainly in no way inferior to Xue Ao\u2019Tian who was at the Mid-Level of the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>Just then, a quiet gasp could be heard, \u201cWell, isn\u2019t old brother Long lucky! I\u2019m still not good enough. The level of the last breakthrough is simply too difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>A black and grey light cast a shadow and the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue appeared next to Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya. His cultivation base was second only to Long Shiya despite the fact that he had suffered an injury in the past. Even though his wounds were now healed, he could not utilize Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy and smoothly break through to the Heavenly God Tier like what Long Shiya had done.</p><br/><p>However, Long Shiya\u2019s breakthrough alone was enough for the Peerless Sect. Even the number one Saint Land, Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, did not have a Heavenly God-tier cultivator assuming personal command! Long Shiya\u2019s existence was enough to intimidate the other four Great Saint Lands and grant the Peerless Sect a leading position.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya pointed at the Jade Dragon that still struggling in its attempt to escape and asked Zhou Weiqing, \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Why does it have such a scary amount of energy? Is it a Heavenly God-tier Heavenly Beast that you brought back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not a Heavenly Beast. Please help me uphold the constitution, teacher, and father-in-law. I\u2019ll explain everything to you when I\u2019ve completed my tasks.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, a silver light flashed in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, and he returned to the ground in the next moment. As he cradled the dying Duan Tianlang in his arms, he poured Saint Energy into his body to help him replenish his strength.</p><br/><p>Although Duan Tianlang was substantially weakened, his mind was still excellent. He mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s done. Weiqing, I did it. This is the eleventh Consolidating Ink. I dare guarantee that this will become a dragon-shaped Consolidating Ink, and it\u2019ll surpass the last piece of the Boundless Infinitum Set. A dragon, it\u2019s a dragon! Don\u2019t worry about me, you hurry up and start consolidating. It\u2019s in the void. Lure the dragon into the scroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied with uncertainty, \u201cJunior Master, what should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang closed his eyes. After regaining a bit of mental strength, he opened his eyes again as light radiated from his pupils, \u201cDraw in Saint Energy, and consolidate it in the void. The sky is your scroll, the Jade Dragon is your Consolidating Ink, and the Saint Energy is your Consolidating Brush. Go. The eleventh legendary armor set has always used substances in different forms. As long as you succeed in consolidating it, draw it into your body at once. By doing so, you\u2019ll be able to utilize its power the moment you succeed in your cultivation. Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing carefully memorized Duan Tianlang\u2019s simple instructions. His mouth repeatedly muttered, \u201cDraw in Saint Energy, and consolidate it in the void.\u201d Suddenly, his eyes shone as his heart was filled with realization. He transfused a bit of pure Saint Energy into Duan Tianlang\u2019s body so that he would slowly recover. In the next moment, Zhou Weiqing grabbed the blueprint and appeared in the middle of the sky again.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue were not the only two people in the sky. Every cultivator at the Heavenly King Tier or above from the Peerless Sect was already in mid-air, including the six Heavenly Kings who originated from the Heavenly Demon Sect and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s female companions.</p><br/><p>Only Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue were unaware of what Zhou Weiqing and Duan Tianlang were up to. At this moment, without needing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s instructions, and under the leadership of Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Tian\u2019er, the Heavenly King-tier cultivators quickly scattered and formed a large circle surrounding the outer area in the far off distance, the Consolidated Equipment was placed neatly, in a calm and unruffled manner despite the raging chaos outside to protect Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Initially, the Shangguan triplets wanted to return to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace in the Heavenly Jewel Island to complete the next piece of their Consolidated Equipment. However, they stayed for the sake of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s consolidation. After all, Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue were previously in closed-door cultivation, and they didn\u2019t know how long it would take for Zhou Weiqing to finish consolidating and safety was of utmost importance. What if the people of Blood Red Hell took advantage of this and came here. What would they do then?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was once again in mid-air. He did not consolidate immediately when he faced the Jade Dragon. A light flickered in his eyes as the Galaxia light in his body amplified. A two meter wide, enormous light beam shot out from his body towards the sky. It was the Galaxia Feedback. However, he was using his own Saint Energy not for cultivation purposes but for binding instead.</p><br/><p>In a few short seconds, a bright gold light beam ten times bigger than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s light beam poured down from the sky. It shot ferociously at the Jade Dragon\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Terrifying fluctuations from the Saint Energy exploded in a very small area in the sky before turning into a large golden ball of light. All the force was focused on the Jade Dragon\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The initially healthy and active Jade Dragon instantly turned docile after the attack. It was firmly bound and was unable to move so it became dispirited and listless as golden starlight surrounded it.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue and Long Shiya gasped when they saw this.</p><br/><p>Among everyone present, the two of them were the most powerful, and their senses were the most vivid. Even the newly minted Heavenly God-tier Long Shiya could not help but look shocked upon sensing the might of the attack from the sky. Even though he would not be restricted by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Divine Territory and had also received his own Divine Territory after becoming a Heavenly God, he was shocked at the might of the Astral Divine Territory and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s upgrading speed.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya had thought that he could pass on his techniques and experience in breaking through the bottleneck in Heavenly Emperor Tier to the Heavenly God Tier to Zhou Weiqing. However, it seemed that currently there was no need for that. His precious disciple\u2019s cultivation base was at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier, and he also had Saint Energy. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was probably about to surpass him in overall power. As for how he would reach the Heavenly God Tier, this was not something that he needed to worry about.</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing had perfectly bound the Jade Dragon, he quieted down. He closed his eyes as his hand clutched the Consolidated Equipment Scroll blueprint that Duan Tianlang completed with his blood, sweat, and tears.</p><br/><p>The light of Saint Energy disappeared, leaving behind only little bits of starlight and the Astral Divine Discipline. Only cultivators at the Heavenly God Tier and above could clearly sense an immensely powerful Divine Thought that filled them with fear. It surrounded Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body as it fluctuated continuously. The power of this Divine Thought nearly surpassed the newly-minted Heavenly God-tier, Six Ultimate Heavenly God, Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>The blueprint gently flew out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand and spread out before Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face. Zhou Weiqing used Divine Thought to roll it up so that outsiders would not be able to read its content. All they would be able to see was a blurry piece of paper.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body began to slowly change in a bizarre manner. Little bits of starlight began to appear. It was devoid of the dazzling light from the Galaxia Saint Energy. It was just pure and simple starlight. The starlight slowly gathered behind Zhou Weiqing as it gradually became an imaginary shadow that was completely made out of starlight.</p><br/><p>At this time, the shadow was no longer the Demon God. Instead, it was Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>When the shadow first appeared, it was not that big. It was only about the same size as Zhou Weiqing. However, the shadow slowly grew larger and larger following the continuous condensation of starlight. The strangest thing was this shadow did not display any energy fluctuations. Instead, it only gave off a gold glitter.</p><br/><p>It was the first time that everyone present witnessed this bizarre transformation, especially the gradual shape-shifting process.</p><br/><p>Only Long Shiya alone was able to sense the abnormality in the shadow. Zhou Weiqing was his disciple. That year, he had told Zhou Weiqing that on the day he was able to use his own shadow to form a Heavenly Skill Projection, he would have truly learned the Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s condensed shadow was not a simple Heavenly Skill Projection. The shadow looked unreal at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, it seemed to be corporeal. Every bit of starlight used in its condensation was Saint Energy that was compressed to a high degree. The reason why no energy fluctuations were released was that all of the Saint Energy that were reserved and compressed was too pure. There was no reason for any leakage. The only way the power of this shadow could be described was that it was terrifying. It was even more terrifying than the Demon God that Zhou Weiqing had once summoned.</p><br/><p>There was a possibility that the power of the Demon God was more formidable. However, this was a projection completely condensed by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s own Saint Energy, and it had the ability to hold its own in a fight.</p><br/><p>Terrifying energy fluctuations circulated in the air. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base had an overall increase, and the dense Saint Energy fluctuations instantly died down. At a glance, the man floating in mid-air looked like a normal person.</p><br/><p>The shadow behind Zhou Weiqing kept growing until it was five meters tall before it stopped. However, it still remained behind Zhou Weiqing as starlight continued pouring in, making it grow clearer and clearer in sight. In the end, it was essentially a larger version of Zhou Weiqing. Even the clothes were exactly alike. If it was not for the difference in size, one would not be able to differentiate between the actual person and the body of energy.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s mouth twitched at the sight of this, \u201cThis bastard. Did he clone himself a twin?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, her words came to a sudden halt in the next moment. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s physical body did not move but the five-meter tall shadow behind him took one step forward and immediately swallowed Zhou Weiqing whole. The original body and the body of energy had merged into one.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

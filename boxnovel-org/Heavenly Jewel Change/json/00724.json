He knew that his opponent must have been frightened. The most he could do was to intimidate his opponent as much as possible to the extent that the Dreadfiend Sea Naga would not dare to act lightly. If there was to be a serious battle, judging from his current level of cultivation, and even with the support of Saint Energy, how could he be on the same standing with a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse?</p><br/><p>Thus, Zhou Weiqing had no hesitations and proceeded to activate his skill.</p><br/><p>A gigantic shadow of a dark angel appeared above his head. Within an instant of its appearance, horrid waves of energy exploded from the Purgatory Angel with six wings, succumbed in darkness.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing forced all his Saint Energy into his skill without holding back, the body of the Purgatory Angel solidified into physical existence, half the skies seemed to transformed into a shade of blackish purple in an instant. Now, half of the ocean which had initially been under the control of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga had turned black.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the aura released from Zhou Weiqing would not be any weaker compared to any Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. Even the people in the Ward of Darkness on the other side noticed the changes here.</p><br/><p>No matter if it was the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master Dongfang or the Elders, upon witnessing the scenes from afar, they all had their mouths wide open. <em>Oh heavens! What kind of power was that? Was it from Zhou Weiqing? How did he possess powers of such caliber? </em></p><br/><p>Everything which had been demonstrated by Zhou Weiqing had surpassed their imagination. However, at that moment, why would it matter? There was only endless joy in the hearts of these Mysterious Heavenly Palace powerhouses. Under such a drastic circumstance, for Zhou Weiqing to display such capabilities, it seemed to them like the descent of a savior!</p><br/><p>The only ones who failed to sense the situation on the other side were the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing, as they had their minds concentrated on their battle. They were going all out in attacking the Dreadfiend Sea Naga in the Ward of Darkness.</p><br/><p>The powers of the Blackfiend Dragon, with its entire being showered in red doubled at least one fold. It was not only its own strength, but it also absorbed most of the energies available from the Ward of Darkness, which meant that the twelve Mysterious Heavenly Palace powerhouses had most of their energies extracted as well.</p><br/><p>Under such conditions, the powers of the Blackfiend Dragon reached its peak, on top of Meng Xing\u2019s oppression, the opposite Dreadfiend Sea Naga received heavy blows one after the other. Even in a physical battle, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was no longer the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s match.</p><br/><p>From his outer appearance, Zhou Weiqing seemed like he had entirely overpowered the Dreadfiend Sea Naga opposite him, but only he himself knew that he was just a paper tiger who would be torn apart any moment.</p><br/><p>Well, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s luck was not that bad. He was fortunate as the Dreadfiend Sea Naga had just recently joined the ranks of Heavenly God-tier; it had yet to familiarize itself with Heavenly God-tier abilities. In addition, the father of the two Dreadfiend Sea Nagas was killed in the hands of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Therefore, the sea nagas were still quite wary of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace powerhouses.</p><br/><p>Thus, upon sensing the explosive surges of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s energy, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga did not dare to act rashly. It released its dominating aura, resulting in a stagnant confrontation with Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>The Purgatory Angel fully transformed itself into a physical being, gradually floating to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side, and froze. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy had been stronger than ever, it was no problem for him to sustain the revival of the Purgatory Angel.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lord, I\u2019m willing to fight for you,\u201d the voice of the Purgatory Angel sounded within Zhou Weiqing. Sensing the erratic energy movements of the angel, Zhou Weiqing had also lost his focus.</p><br/><p>He originally intended to only utilize the Purgatory Angel\u2019s powers to his aid but had never imagined that the Purgatory Angel he had summoned to be so powerful to such an extent.</p><br/><p>Due to their internal connection, Zhou Weiqing was able to feel in clarity that the Purgatory Angel he had summoned possessed a great deal of Heavenly Emperor-tier abilities. It was also possible that its powers could not be sustained for long and could only battle for a short duration, but to Zhou Weiqing, it meant that his powers had heightened by several folds.</p><br/><p>This was the creation of Saint Energy! With great elation, Zhou Weiqing locked his gaze on to the faraway Dreadfiend Sea Naga. He would not be rash to urge the Purgatory Angel to launch attacks. As long as he could continue withstanding the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s oppression and deter it from affecting the Ward of Darkness, he had accomplished his goal. He would absolutely not believe that he had the qualifications to engage the Heavenly God-tier powerhouse in a true battle merely with his Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga halted its movement on the torrential ocean, and observed the Purgatory Angel from afar \u2013 it was indeed hesitating. The aura flowing from the Purgatory Angel was quite powerful, and the most important thing was not the angel, but the human who had summoned it.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga could not see Zhou Weiqing clearly while he was completely engulfed by silver white rays. Due to the blockage of Saint Energy, it had no way of identifying the cultivation base of Zhou Weiqing. However, it could feel that the silverish white light rays definitely had its own destructive powers, the type of attribute that shivered even its soul.</p><br/><p>What exactly was that energy? The Dreadfiend Sea Naga had lived in the oceans for countless of years but it was its first encounter with Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Ten seconds had passed within the water dragon\u2019s moment of hesitation. It could be said that Zhou Weiqing had already secured much precious time for the Blackfiend Dragon and Meng Xing, who were in the Darkness Spelling Seal.</p><br/><p>Loud raging roars sounded from the Ward of Darkness as the gigantic body of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga clashed onto the Ward of Darkness, and a scarlet beam punctured its head. Highly concentrated energy waves exploded in the Ward of Darkness. That was only when the Dreadfiend Sea Naga adjusted its life force origin, had it not been destroyed by the incoming assault.</p><br/><p>\u201cRrraaaaa\u2014\u201d From across Zhou Weiqing, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga could no longer bear the situation. If it did not come to its brother\u2019s rescue, the latter would be killed in the Ward of Darkness. By then, what would happen to it if it were to be the only one left for the people to direct their offenses to?</p><br/><p>The waves roared, and a tidal wave of a thousand meters swirled in the air, displaying the image of a Dreadfiend Sea Naga created by the waters. It hurled its jaw and claws at Zhou Weiqing and the Purgatory Angel that he had summoned.</p><br/><p>The skill which the Dreadfiend Sea Naga had activated was one of his greatest skills; the water dragon was not comprised of simple seawater, but water elements which were completely purified. Only a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse was capable of managing a creation of such a scale.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression soured; the Dreadfiend Sea Naga had launched its attack. He had no other choice.</p><br/><p>The Purgatory Angel leaped out. With a flash of black light, the angel had flown up a thousand meters before Zhou Weiqing. With the gesture of its arms, down came the rain clouds from the skies in an instant and the concentrated Darkness Attribute energy waves exploded. Huge dark purple light spheres with the radius of ten meters descended from the skies one after another, hitting the monstrous water dragon straight on its head like a meteor shower.</p><br/><p>With a deafening roar, every descent of those humongous dark purple light spheres would splash a huge ripple on the water dragon, effectively destructing parts of its body.</p><br/><p>However, the water dragon was overtly large. No matter how many dark purple light spheres had fallen, they did nothing to harm the main part of its body.</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, it had reached the Purgatory Angel.</p><br/><p>At that moment, it was only when the Purgatory Angel summoned by Zhou Weiqing showed its true terror.</p><br/><p>The huge body appeared like a kind angel in the air, while concentrated colors of blackish purple rose like horrifying clouds without a sound. However, the Purgatory Angel\u2019s body started to expand all of a sudden, transforming itself into a dark black light sphere with the radius of hundreds of meters, and clashed violently against the water dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cTschh\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>The sharp cries made Zhou Weiqing dizzy, he could see clearly that the water dragon in the distance melted like ice, vanishing within the horrid dark purple-like energies. The Purgatory Angel sacrificed its body and life to shield the attack coming towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Judging by how it looked, it seemed like the battle ended equally. However, it was different in reality. Zhou Weiqing had given his all in summoning the Purgatory Angel. On the other hand, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was only testing the waters by launching the water dragon attack. Its greatest strength was its body itself.</p><br/><p>Upon realization that the Purgatory Angel summoned by its opponent had been eliminated as easily as that, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was stunned momentarily. After regaining its senses, it thought, \u201cIt seemed like this human wasn\u2019t as powerful as I imagined him to be!\u201d</p><br/><p>Its gigantic body started moving. To a powerhouse like the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, traveling through thousands of meters only took an instant.</p><br/><p>However, just as it was about to muster all its might to annihilate Zhou Weiqing and rush to attack the Ward of Darkness, a weird feeling crept up in his might, making the sea naga tremble.</p><br/><p>It was still Zhou Weiqing who was emitting the horrifying energy. It was a fearless aura, one that felt like it was about to destroy the entire world with his bare hands.</p><br/><p>The large body of hundreds of feet stood on the waves. Its entire being was grey in color, seemingly an illusion. However, the instant it appeared, the colors of the heavens and earth too, had changed.</p><br/><p>The whole ocean had turned grey; even the skies were similar. Grey, endless grey, and that incomparable chilling menace.</p><br/><p>The ocean which had been torrential calmed instantly upon the appearance of the huge grey shadow. It became as calm as a massive mirror \u2013 not even the slightest of waves could be seen.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga, which had initially appeared to be hovering in the air due to the waves, fell straight into the ocean. All its willpower had collapsed; affected by the chills from its soul.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

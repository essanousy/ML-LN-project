Soon after, the entire atmosphere around them seemed to warp around them, as the Silver Emperor, originally white-silver turned colour drastically.</p><br/><p>The unconscious Silver Emperor was immediately jolted awake, but it did not have any strength within to resist, instead shuddering violently as three lights intertwined around its body. Black, Grey and Blue, and it could sense its own life draining away swiftly.</p><br/><p>It was originally already heavily injured, and with this new attack, it knew it was almost at the end of its life.</p><br/><p>Without question, what Zhou Weiqing had used on it was the Dark Demon God Lightning plus Time Interrupt combo he had used before, causing the three attribute poison to enter the Silver Emperor\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>No matter what living creature, when it met with a threat to its life, it would feel a sense of panic, despite its power. The Silver Emperor was no exception. This was especially so since this unique venom was something so strange that it had not experienced before. Its remaining shreds of Heavenly Energy was low, and no matter what it tried, there was no effect on the poison.</p><br/><p>The Tri-Attribute Venom of the Dark Demon God Lightning was extremely overbearing, so much so that even powerful Heavenly Energy could not force it out. Even the Heavenly King Stage powerhouse Shangguan Longyin had failed to do so previously.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned, stepping harder on the Silver Emperor as he said: \u201cLittle thing, you can sense the threat of death right. If you want to live, then you better cooperate with Your Father, I. When I start Sealing you, you better not resist at all, otherwise, you can just wait for your death. This Tri-Attribute Venom of mine\u2026 the feeling is not too good right?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was not the first time he had tried out this Tri-Attribute Venom, and not only was it fatal, but it was relatively slow acting and extremely painful. Previously, Shen Little Demon had not been able to take it, even with the Heavenly King Stage powerhouse Shangguan Longyin helping her to alleviate the pain with his Heavenly Energy. Alas, this Silver Emperor did not have such help.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, death was not the most scary thing. This sort of incomprehensible pain, that made one want to beg for death but being unable to die\u2026 that was the most terrifying thing.</p><br/><p>As he said that with a big grin, Zhou Weiqing did not forget to place a hand on the Silver Emperor\u2019s body, continuing to Devour its Heavenly Energy. After a while, he bit on his other hand, squeezing out a drop of blood, before starting to unleash a Blood Rites \u2013 Seal of Darkness on it.</p><br/><p>Under the Demonic Change State, Zhou Weiqing could truly release the aura of the Dark Demon God Tiger to its maximum, especially from his Demonic Right Leg. Using his right leg to step on the Silver Emperor was not just to release the Dark Demon God Lightning, but also in order to let it sense that aura.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er stood at the side, watching all of that. Originally, she had thought that she was familiar with all of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s abilities, but now watching him threaten the Silver Emperor, she felt a mixed feeling. On one hand, she found it amusing, doing actions that in her eyes were futile. On the other hand, she had a strange sensation, as if Zhou Weiqing was doing something to the Silver Emperor, some unique hidden ability that she did not know about.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop dreaming already. Threatening the Silver Emperor\u2026 you can still think of such a thing. This little thing is not just savage, but it is also very stubborn. If you do not overpower it when Sealing forcefully, you won\u2019t succeed. You just wait, soon you\u2019ll be my horse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Fei\u2019er was from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, she was after all not a Heavenly Beast, and she could not sense that powerful, intense pressure that only Heavenly Beasts could. If this Silver Emperor was at the Heavenly King Stage, then it would not be too susceptible for this pressure at this moment. Alas, it had not yet successfully evolved.</p><br/><p>The bloodline of the Dark Demon God Tiger was no lesser than the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger, one of the top in the Heavenly Beast world. From the perspective of a Heavenly Beast like this little Silver Emperor, it would be submitting to a powerful Heavenly Beast of greater bloodlines, not a human.</p><br/><p>Finally, it stopped struggling. The Blood Rites \u2013 Seal of Darkness symbol on its forehead stabilizing under the blood drop of Zhou Weiqing. Its body started shuddering violently again, as if wanting to struggle, but not daring to do so. Its little eyes just happened to look right into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s bloodshot eyes.</p><br/><p>At this point, in the eyes of the Silver Emperor, Zhou Weiqing was definitely no human. The law of the jungle of the Heavenly Beast world, in addition to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s tri-Attribute Venom and the suffering it brought, finally caused it to submit. Given reason, no one would be willing to sacrifice their own life.</p><br/><p>The bloodline pressure from the Dark Demon God Tiger was such a higher level that the Silver Emperor had to look up to, even though it knew Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation level was still far beyond its own. It was the same like itself, not having broken through to the Heavenly King Stage yet.</p><br/><p>However, the bloodline pressure was of extremely high importance to Heavenly Beasts, and at least allowed it to accept Zhou Weiqing. If it were any human, without an absolute power difference, it would definitely not choose to submit, no matter torture or death.</p><br/><p>Finally, the last shreds of its Heavenly Energy was drained away, along with the torturous venom. It still continued trembling, but much lighter now, as the venom had all been drained away as well. The dark red symbol on its forehead flashed brightly once, then disappeared into its body.</p><br/><p>Its head dropped down to the side, and the Silver Emperor lapsed back into a deep unconsciousness. Zhou Weiqing did not place it into his own Spatial Ring, instead hugging it into his bosom, a smug look on his face.</p><br/><p>When the dark red symbol flashed across the Silver Emperor\u2019s forehead, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was totally stunned. She could not believe what was happening before her eyes. How could this Silver Emperor actually submit like that? This Zhou Little Fatty was only at the Four Jeweled Stage! What basis did he have to let such a powerful and stubborn Top Level Zong Stage Heavenly Beast submit to him? How could this be? How could this be?!</p><br/><p>\u201cOei, I know I am very handsome and suave, but if you keep staring at me like that, I will be shy.\u201d Zhou Weiqing flashed a teasing grin at Shangguan Fei\u2019er as he said that. At the same time, his gaze swooped down to her buttocks once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou? Shy?\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er was so angered by his words that she almost laughed. \u201cYour skin is so thick to almost an invincible point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: \u201cHaiz, although you are from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, you are after all a woman. Our bet is already set, if you really renege on it, I won\u2019t be surprised, but just feel sorry for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at him, blinking her beautiful eyes. All of a sudden, she laughed. \u201cZhou Little Fatty, you\u2019re trying to provoke me? Nope! The one who represents the face of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace is my sister, not me. You are right, reneging is the right of women, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do. What are you going to do about it? Did anyone see me betting with you? Who can prove it? No one right? Heh heh, that is to say, we never placed such a bet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh?\u201d Zhou Weiqing stared at Shangguan Fei\u2019er with his mouth agape. Originally, he thought that by provoking her like that with the name and reputation of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, she would never renege on the bet. Who could have imagined that this Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace was so tough to deal with, and she did the reverse instead. Furthermore, his own strength was no match for hers\u2026 Zhou Weiqing was immediately vexed.</p><br/><p>Looking at his depressed look, Shangguan Fei\u2019er laughed happily, skipping joyously towards the camp. \u201cAhhh, today\u2019s weather is so good. It feels so good to infuriate someone. I have decided to reward myself by eating more today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her retreating figure, Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but twitch in his heart, thinking to himself: Both are from the same mother, but why is there such a huge difference in character? This Shangguan Fei\u2019er and my own Bing\u2019er, they are just too different indeed. Thinking back to the time when he had teased Bing\u2019er ages ago, the way she had reacted so innocently and at a loss, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze suddenly wandered into the distance. How great it would be if Bing\u2019er were here with him!</p><br/><p>No matter the first time when Shangguan Bing\u2019er had became his Sacrifice in his first Demonic Change, or his \u2018adult ceremony\u2019 in the Heavenly Jewel Island\u2026 Both were memories that Zhou Weiqing would never forget, ingrained deep within his heart. This was also why no one could ever be more important than Shangguan Bing\u2019er to him.</p><br/><p>The Shangguan Sisters were just too similar, and though Zhou Weiqing did not really want Shangguan Fei\u2019er to follow him, but somewhere deep in his heart, seeing Shangguan Fei\u2019er every day by his side was like seeing Bing\u2019er as well, and it was this conflicted deep thought, along with the fear of Shangguan Fei\u2019er talking bad about him in front of Bing\u2019er, which was what made him keep her by his side.</p><br/><p>The difference in character did not detract from Shanggaun Fei\u2019er\u2019s beauty, but displaying a totally different sort of beauty. Lively, youthful, spirited, things that Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not display, while Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not have Bing\u2019er\u2019s soft, quiet beauty. These two sisters could be said to be different but equal.</p><br/><p>The sounds of the birds and insects in the forest was forming a moving melody. Life in the forest was never quiet.</p><br/><p>Due to the Silver Emperor\u2019s sudden ambush, Zhou Weiqing asked Lin TianAo to arrange a schedule of guards for the night, with the twenty one of them split into groups of guards, with the original Fei Li Battle Team members each leading a guard duty.</p><br/><p>The truth was proven that this Silver Emperor was indeed an exception. Through the rest of the night, besides a few weak little Heavenly Beasts disturbing them, they did not meet with any other troubles.</p><br/><p>Dawn. A simple meal of dry rations, and the party gathered up their belongings before leaving once more. Once again, Zang Lang\u2019s group of twelve showed their high skill and grit, taking barely fifteen minutes to take down everything swiftly.</p><br/><p>As they continued on their travels, Zhou Weiqing asked Shangguan Fei\u2019er: \u201cFei\u2019er, are you sure there are Ghost Demon Horses here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er glanced at him, saying: \u201cI am also not certain. They definitely do live here, but in the past decades they have been hunted so much, that I\u2019m not sure if we can find any more wild ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing widened his eyes. \u201cAre you joking?! If not for the fact that you told us there were these Ghost Demon Horses here, we would not have taken this route!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er nodded vigorously, saying: \u201cThey definitely live somewhere in this forest, but whether or not we meet with them depends on our luck. After all, the forest is extremely massive, and these wild Ghost Demon Horses are already much rarer now, and we might not come across them.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

It suits you,\u201d Zhou Weiqing praised.\u00a0[1. Hanyue means cold moon.]</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue said, \u201cTime for you to tell me the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Zhou Weiqing said honestly.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue stared at him in astonishment.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s your answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cIt is the most honest answer I can give.\u00a0I don\u2019t know why I chose to save you guys either.\u00a0To me, the best course of action would\u2019ve been to wait until both you and the Terror Sea Dragons were badly injured.\u00a0Faced with great danger, you would\u2019ve used the Spatial Teleportation Gem.\u00a0That would be my best opportunity.\u00a0I had a 70% confidence level that I would be able to escape after seizing the gem.\u00a0I guess you can just say that I went momentarily stupid\u2026 but I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard Zhou Weiqing say the words \u2018I don\u2019t regret it\u2019, the rage and fierceness in Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes vanished.\u00a0She stared intently at him, seemingly in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find some food.\u201d\u00a0Zhou Weiqing rose to his feet, walking towards the seashore.\u00a0He needed to calm down.\u00a0Right now, he essentially was facing a second chance at the choice he had made.\u00a0And\u2026 this would probably be the last chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt 80% certain that the gem was on \u2018Dreamwake\u2019, whose real name was Dongfang Hanyue.\u00a0She was the true controller of Xuantian Palace!\u00a0They were on a deserted island, and she was so weak that he could take the gem from her without needing to injure her.\u00a0He could then leave with Bing\u2019er, this mission complete.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 could he really be so determined as to do something like this?\u00a0If he could, he wouldn\u2019t have told Dreamwake so many things.</p><br/><p>He walked over to the side of the sea, allowing it to go past his feet.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing spread out his senses, but he wasn\u2019t able to discover any other living creatures within the vast sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddamnit! I want to eat some seafood to make myself feel better, but there\u2019s none here. This is inhumane!\u201d Zhou Weiqing roared angrily towards the sea.</p><br/><p>He took a few steps back, then helplessly squatted down on the beach. He used his hand to draw a few circles in the sand. \u201cZhou Little Fatty, you old softy. It\u2019s all because you are emotionally weak! \u00a0Weak!\u201d</p><br/><p>He drew one circle after another, but the resigned look on his face didn\u2019t abate at all.\u00a0For him to bully a heavily wounded woman, one who had treated him extremely well\u2026 he couldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0He really couldn\u2019t!\u00a0If Xuantian Palace and Dongfang Hanyue had treated him poorly, he probably would\u2019ve acted long ago.\u00a0But, he could still clearly remember how, when danger descended, she didn\u2019t forget to protect him even though she was still angry with him.\u00a0She had even risked suffering injuries to herself to do this.</p><br/><p>He suddenly rose to his feet and strode straight towards Dongfang Hanyue.</p><br/><p>When she saw the truculent look on his face, Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s own face turned even paler than before.\u00a0She unconsciously covered her chest with hands while inching backwards in the sand.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing only halted when he came to stand before her.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue was like a frightened little kitten.\u00a0\u201cW-what are you doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lowered his head angrily.\u00a0\u201cGimme the Spatial Teleportation Gem.\u201d</p><br/><p>A stubborn look appeared in Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes.\u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t.\u00a0Kill me if you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine then.\u00a0Forget it.\u201d\u00a0Zhou Weiqing let out a long sigh, a helpless smile appearing on his face.\u00a0He then flipped over and lay down next to Dongfang Hanyue.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue once more turned stiff.\u00a0Just now, when Zhou Weiqing had demanded the Spatial Teleportation gem, she had been so petrified that her heart had nearly leapt out of her throat.\u00a0But in the end, this guy had done nothing besides say that simple sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what do you want?\u201d\u00a0Dongfang Hanyue couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u00a0She had no idea what this bad man was thinking.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lay there, head leaning against his hands. \u201cThis was a perfect opportunity. I had to at least make an attempt, otherwise it would have all gone to waste. By asking, I can say that I made the attempt. You weren\u2019t willing to give it to me, so I had no choice but to just give up. \u00a0This bro is a real man. I can\u2019t bully a weak little girl like you on this desolate island. Hurry up and recover. After you recover, I\u2019m going to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want the Spatial Teleportation Gem any longer?\u201d Dongfang Hanyue asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed bitterly.\u00a0\u201cOf course I want it.\u00a0That\u2019s my mission.\u00a0But, I\u2019ll figure out another way to get it.\u00a0Keep a close watch over your treasures.\u00a0Don\u2019t let me take it too easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d\u00a0Dongfang Hanyue let out a snort, struggling to sit up.\u00a0She then closed her eyes and quietly began to train.\u00a0As she sat up, her lips curved upwards into a faint smile\u2026 but Zhou Weiqing, who was lying down, wouldn\u2019t be able to see it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could sense that Dongfang Hanyue had entered a cultivation state. Utterly bored, he stared into the skies and cursed himself mentally. <em>Zhou Little Fatty, you really are a stupid-nice person.\u00a0Would you act like this if she wasn\u2019t a beauty?\u00a0Absolutely not.\u00a0Like hell you would!\u00a0You perverted lecher!\u00a0Still\u2026 no matter what, I\u2019m a genuine scoundrel.\u00a0That\u2019s better than being a false gentleman, right?\u00a0Ugh.\u00a0My beautiful Hanyue, you really disappoint me.\u00a0Even if you don\u2019t repay me by offering me your body, you should at least give me a kiss or something.\u00a0I treated you so well.\u00a0Can\u2019t you be the slightest bit moved by it?</em></p><br/><p>Although his heart was filled with perverted musings, he rose to sit up behind Dongfang Hanyue, pressing his hands against her back. <em>I\u2019m not doing this to help her recover, I\u2019m doing this to feel her wonderful figure for myself.</em> This was what Little Fatty told himself as he sent his silvery-white light into their bodies.<em>\u00a0Well, if you are going to be a good guy, be a good guy all the way.</em></p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue hadn\u2019t exaggerated her injuries at all.\u00a0Not only were her meridians all badly damaged, some had been disordered.\u00a0Any ordinary person with these injuries would\u2019ve died long ago, but she was a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse and thus was still barely managing to hang on.</p><br/><p>Clearly, she wouldn\u2019t be able to recover from her injuries quickly.\u00a0But, Zhou Weiqing helping out changed everything.</p><br/><p>The gentle Saint Energy slowly poured into her delicate body, which shuddered.\u00a0That warm energy passed through his two hot hands into her back and then spread out through the rest of her body.\u00a0This was an extremely strange feeling.\u00a0Dongfang Hanyue felt her entire body turn a bit soft, but as that gentle energy entered her body the energies in her chaotic meridians were actually all assimilated by it.</p><br/><p>As the gentle energy advanced, her damaged meridians were gradually covered by the silvery-white light.\u00a0There was no feeling of pain at all.\u00a0She only felt as though her body was submerged in warm water.\u00a0It was indescribably comfortable.</p><br/><p>She gave up on her self-healing efforts and discarded any wariness, giving completely control over her body to Zhou Weiqing and allowing his Saint Energy to roam freely.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Dongfang Hanyue was actually lulled to sleep by that comfortable feeling.\u00a0Her sleep was incredibly peaceful.\u00a0Ever since she had taken on the crushing pressure of being responsible for Xuantian Palace, she had never again slept so soundly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell? You can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m not a \u2018good guy\u2019, you know.\u201d Zhou Weiqing, still seated behind Dongfang Hanyue, was instantly depressed. <em>Isn\u2019t this girl afraid that I\u2019m going to seize this opportunity to do something to her?\u00a0</em><em>Even if she hid the Spatial Teleportation Gem somewhere else, she can\u2019t act like this.\u00a0Doesn\u2019t she know just how lethal a weak, helpless little girl is to any man\u2019s self-control?\u00a0I can\u2019t take this!</em></p><br/><p>Night gradually enveloped the island, bringing silence with it.\u00a0A campfire was the only source of light within the island.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing was seated before the campfire, cooking some grains.</p><br/><p>The Sumeru Ring was on his finger once more.\u00a0This ring contained a prodigious amount of food and water.\u00a0Even though there was no seafood to eat, they wouldn\u2019t go hungry.</p><br/><p>Every so often, the campfire would crackle.\u00a0Although grains made for a simple meal, cooking them made them quite tasty.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did his best to prevent his gaze from turning towards the other end of the campfire.\u00a0Under the light of the campfire, Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s ruddy, fragrant face was simply far too enticing.\u00a0Although Zhou Weiqing was by nature an extremely lascivious man filled with dirty thoughts, no matter what he wouldn\u2019t allow them to overcome his morality and his conscience.\u00a0However, that didn\u2019t mean he liked it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing wanted to leave as soon as Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s meridians had been healed, but when he realized that he didn\u2019t know where the second Terror Sea Dragon was located, he simply couldn\u2019t bring himself to abandon her and leave on his own.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d wait until she woke up. It had been a long time since he had felt himself at the verge of losing control\u2026 but he had to admit, this mission had spun completely out of his control.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Despite how the Elven Empress was suffering from being tremendously depleted at this point, it was certainly not a problem for her to hold out for another thirty seconds like she had mentioned before. Moreover, even if her vitality had been exhausted, she could still make use of her connection with the Ancient Tree of Life to restore her vitality if given enough time. This was the advantage of Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution.</p><br/><p>The black hole in front of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest then expanded to a diameter of one meter before it finally stopped. Zhou Weiqing raised his hand slowly, not to push the black hole towards Fen Tian; instead, he raised it up until it reached the top of his head. This was followed closely by the black hole being suspended in mid-air as it expanded once again, this time to a diameter of three metes above his head.</p><br/><p>The pitch-black, distorted radiance then completely turned into a platinum color, followed immediately by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body warping into something unreal and distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me Fen Tian, I\u2019ll let you broaden your horizon with my ultimate critical strike.\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes were shimmering with a divine radiance; his right hand pointed to the front of Fen Tian, who was currently restricted by the Elven Empress.</p><br/><p>An intensely distorted radiance appeared in the black hole above Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head and surged towards Fen Tian like an electrical snake.</p><br/><p>That distorted radiance may seem weak and small, not even affecting the energy ripples in the least. However, when it came into contact with the Elven Empress\u2019 dark green-colored life force that was capable of trapping Fen Tian, all the dark green-colored life force vanished completely to everyone\u2019s surprise. Even the Elven Empress was swept away by the gushing distorted radiance as she disappeared into thin air along with it.</p><br/><p>Its target was not the Elven Empress, but since it came into contact with the energy she released with the support of the twelve Elf Tribe\u2019s elders, it was attracted by it. Then, it swept the Elven Empress away as well. It was indeed a terrifying energy! Following that, it was branded onto Fen Tian\u2019s black-colored ball of Destruction Energy.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian had already used his fastest speed to run when the Elven Empress was swept away. However, the surrounding space suddenly distorted, and his movements turned exceedingly slow, beyond his control. Before they knew it, that distorted radiance was then branded onto his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-this\u2026 is the Genesis Time Law!\u201d The shocked voice did not belong to Fen Tian\u2019s, but was from the Nether Lord. The distorted halo flashed past, before Fen Tian and Zhou Weiqing vanished in a split second.</p><br/><p>Time Law was similar to the Spatial Law, but the Time Law that belonged to the Divine Attribute was obviously more powerful than the latter, though Fen Tian\u2019s Time Law had the word Genesis preceding it. What did it mean? It meant that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Time Law had already merged perfectly with the Genesis Energy in his Saint Energy. Fen Tian\u2019s powerful Destruction Energy was then rendered incapable of reversing it.</p><br/><p>The agitated energy in the sky was suddenly swept away into nothingness; even the huge engulfing hole created by Fen Tian earlier had vanished as well. The crowd who witnessed the battle from afar could feel their heart rates increasing into an extremely intense, violent level. What did Zhou Weiqing actually do? Why did Zhou Weiqing, the Elven Empress, and Fen Tian disappear from the sky? Where did they go? Time Law? How did the Time Law make people disappear?</p><br/><p>No one understood what was happening there and then, but these questions did not matter to them anymore, even from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>When the Elven Empress was swept away by the distorted radiance, she could only feel the time around her turning slow all of a sudden. Following that, the energy she released earlier and the energy in her body decayed at an astonishing speed.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a radiance flashed and she appeared at a strange place.</p><br/><p>It was an amazing arena; its diameter was more than fifty meters with a twisted radiance surrounding it. Everything seemed and appeared to be unreal.</p><br/><p>Another figure appeared at this moment. The Elven Empress scrutinized it closely and found that it was a young boy who had appeared out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>The clothes on his body had already completely disappeared. Even though he looked like he was six to seven years old, his face was overflowing with a foul evil. He was also astonished when he caught sight of the Elven Empress.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the El-elven Empress?\u201d His shocked, childish voice echoed. Even though it was the voice of a child, it was filled with a murderous intent. Moreover, there was no way to tell if the voice came from a boy or a girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cNether Lord?\u201d The Elven Empress gasped in surprise. She lowered her head and looked down at herself subconsciously; she was stunned immediately.</p><br/><p>At this exact moment, the Elven Empress had the body of a child. There was only a pair of tiny wings on her back that could only set her afloat in mid-air. She was right, her own cultivation base had almost completely disappeared. In other words, she was in a state where she had transformed into her six-year-old self. Could the young boy before her be Fen Tian?</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhou Weiqing, what sort of skill did you actually use? How did we turn into this?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was at this exact moment that a figure that was much taller than they were, appeared within the horizon quietly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing, who was dressed in the Ringless Ground Purging Set slowly emerged. He could not help but be stunned when he saw the arena with his very own eyes, with Fen Tian and the Elven Empress standing within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have succeeded. I\u2019ve truly succeeded. The Time Law that restores childhood, hahaha! I\u2019ve truly succeeded!\u201d There was a layer of distorted light rings floating around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body that made him seem slightly unreal, but his proud expression remained exactly the same as it was before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, what\u2019s happening here?\u201d The Elven Empress could not help but ask, while Fen Tian, who was only six years old, had a very unpleasant expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled as he spoke, \u201cThis is one of my abilities. When I broke through to the Heavenly God Tier, I realized that the skill utilizes the Time Attribute. This skill allows me to turn life-forms in a designated area around me back to their childhood days while I remain unaffected by the transformation. It\u2019s effective on every living thing unless the life-form escapes the designated area around me when I use the ability, or if the life-form attacks me and renders me incapable of using the ability. If that\u2019s not the case, once this ability has been used, it\u2019ll definitely be successful. Initially, this ability was not powerful enough to shrink Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Energy. However, Fen Tian was still only Fen Tian. He\u2019s just borrowing the Nether Lord\u2019s abilities. In fact, he isn\u2019t even the genuine Nether Lord. My ability will be effective as long as he still has a body. Moreover, this skill is powered by the merging of the Saint God Nucleus Core. Your Majesty, I am truly grateful to you for your actions in restraining him or I would not have been able to use this ability. Oh and\u2026 little Fen Tian, what else do you have to say right now?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Under such situation, fusing them together was naturally a lot easier.</p><br/><p>A dim light shimmered and Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly. He looked at the Consolidating Ink in the crystal vat. At the very least, the first step had been completed, and everything else went the way he had expected them to.</p><br/><p>He did not immediately continue with the production for if that were the case, it would not match his Five-Jewel cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sat on the floor and crossed his legs. He then began focusing on cultivating his Immortal Deity Technique. It gave an impression to the other two that he was recovering his Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>The two God Tier Masters found it strange. Why didn\u2019t Zhou Weiqing store away the precious Consolidating Ink? After all, the more precious the Consolidating Ink was, the faster it volatilized once it was exposed to air. That was why a Consolidating Ink was usually immediately preserved in airtight bottles once it was made.</p><br/><p>However, after a short while, they began exclaiming. It was because the silvery Consolidating Ink in the vat showed no signs of becoming volatile at all. Baked in sunlight, that galaxy-like resplendent luster did not show any signs of changing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that stable?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two God Tier Masters looked at each other and exchanged nods. Zhou Weiqing had managed to progress to this stage successfully. Ignoring the fact the could truly be a God Tier Master, he had already passed the assessment from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace even if he wasn\u2019t. He was definitely a genius among geniuses in the Consolidated Equipment domain. At the very least, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace had never seen such a powerful genius before!</p><br/><p>Faint light coruscated. Zhou Weiqing continued his cultivation for slightly less than an hour before he stood up again. The moment he stood up, he had already entered the Heaven Man Unity state once more.</p><br/><p>From the beginning until the end, he had not said a single word. Meanwhile, the two God Tier Masters felt mentally drained from paying absolute attention because they did not want to miss a single one of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>Even God Tier Masters required continuous learning. A God Tier Master that could create an 8-Piece Set of Legendary Suit was completely different from one that could create a 9-Piece Set. For those that could create a 10-Piece Set, those people were indeed considered Legendary God Tier Masters. While for those that could make an Eleven Piece Set, they had not appeared for many years in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>After standing up again, Zhou Weiqing moved the crystal vat to the side. Even such a simple action was firmly memorized by the two God Tier Masters.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath, and his eyes instantly turned focused as he flipped his wrists over. A sheet of Consolidated Equipment Paper of the best quality appeared on the yellow rosewood table in front of him. The long table was flat and smooth like a mirror, allowing the Consolidated Equipment Paper to adhere to its surface completely.</p><br/><p>The Consolidated Equipment Paper that Zhou Weiqing took out was worth more than a hundred gold coins each but that there was no market for it. The reason was that it needed more than a dozen valuable materials with Spatial Attribute to make it. Even God Tier Masters would not use it casually unless they were very confident. After all, those were things that one could not buy even if one had the money.</p><br/><p>Flipping his wrists again, a shiny silver Consolidating Brush appeared in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand. The moment the Consolidating Brush appeared, the other two God Tier Masters almost could not resist the urge to stand up.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Consolidating Brush was a foot and two inches long. It had a thin tip, and its body was shiny silver in color. The tip of the pen seemed to be integrated with the shaft. However, the moment the brush appeared, a strong Spatial Attribute aura also appeared. The Spatial Attribute aura condensed around the Consolidating Brush instead of dispersing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Highest grade! This is certainly of the highest grade!\u2019</p><br/><p>As God Tier Masters, their cultivation bases were above the Heavenly King tier. They could clearly see that the lustrous silver Consolidating Brush in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand had the Strength Legacy\u2019s four ancient seal characters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Strength Legacy actually still exists?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, they did not know that the Consolidating Brush was something that Duan Tianlang gave to Zhou Weiqing. It was also one of Duan Tianlang\u2019s most precious treasures after all those years. There were the only three things left behind by the Strength Legacy. One was in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand, another was lost, and the last one was with Duan Tianlang.</p><br/><p>The Consolidating Brush was made from the skull of a God Tier Heavenly Beast with Spatial attribute. The tip of the pen was made from the nucleus core of the Heavenly Beast.</p><br/><p>That Heavenly Beast had already gone extinct from the Boundless Mainland. Now, it was not even heard of on the Mysterious Heaven Mainland. The Consolidating Brush could be considered as one of the most precious among the godly artifacts from the Consolidated Equipment Domain. The long yellow rosewood table was very much inferior in comparison.</p><br/><p>A look of greed flashed momentarily in the old Consolidated Equipment Master\u2019s eyes. The woman beside him glanced at him subconsciously. The old God Tier Master managed to struggle free of his avarice. He was astonished by his own behavior. With his position, there was nothing on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland that he could not obtain. Greed was an emotion that he had not experienced for many years.</p><br/><p>A dim light sparkled again. Wearing a faint smile on his face, Zhou Weiqing held the Consolidating Brush in his right hand and once again closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>The two God Tier Masters opened their eyes even wider. There were three important steps when creating Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. The first step was the creation of the Consolidating Ink. There were many mysterious formulas in existence. Every God Tier Master had their own inherited secret recipes that they would only pass down to their own direct descendants.</p><br/><p>The second important step was the design of the scroll. A powerful God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll had an extremely complex design. On top of that, even the slightest bit of deviation was not allowed. The final step was to sketch the entire design of the scroll. If even a single mistake were made during any of the three steps, all the efforts would be wasted.</p><br/><p>Among the three steps, the most important step was the second step: the design. As long as one obtained the design, an excellent Consolidated Equipment Master would be able to analyze the ratio of materials used for the Consolidating Ink. Instead, the most difficult step of sketching the design was the least important. After all, this only tested the strength of the Consolidated Equipment Master and his mastery in drawing the scroll.</p><br/><p>To any God Tier Master, the design of any God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll would be priceless. Zhou Weiqing was about to design the scroll, so how could they miss out on such an opportunity?</p><br/><p>This time Zhou Weiqing closed his eyes longer than the previous two times. He just stood there motionlessly. The hand holding the Consolidating Brush remained stable. He remained motionless for as long as half the time it took for the incense stick to burn.</p><br/><p>When the two men opposite him started becoming restless, Zhou Weiqing suddenly took a deep breath. The moment he took a deep breath, his entire being seemed like a giant whirlpool. Atmospheric Energy quickly condensed towards his body.</p><br/><p>The Power Jewels on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands also lit up at the same time. Although there were only five jewels, it just took an instant for his imposing stance to rapidly rise.</p><br/><p>The other two did not know why Zhou Weiqing\u2019s imposing stance rose at that moment, but they did not dare to interrupt. At best, they felt somewhat puzzled. The process of drawing the design required one to be meticulous and prudent. If it had been a design that he had completed before, then it should be the easiest out of the three stages. However, why did he look like he went all out for it? On top of that, it looked like Zhou Weiqing was using a secret technique that needed him to raise his Heavenly Energy far above his cultivation base.</p><br/><p>How could they have known that Zhou Weiqing did all of those only for them to see? In the next moment, under the shocking gaze of the other two, the Consolidating Brush in his hand had already entered the crystal vat and was submerged in the silvery lustrous liquid.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 What does he want to do?\u201d The two God Tier Masters thought to themselves as they gasped in astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is impossible to use the Consolidating Ink while designing the scroll. Is it possible that he wants to skip the design stage and move straight to creating the scroll? It\u2019s impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>While the two God Tier Masters had full confidence in making their own Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, they had never thought of making a Consolidating Equipment Scroll without designing it first. It was not that they did not have the ability to do so, but they would only do so to make normal Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. The materials for making God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls were too valuable, and the probability of failure increased greatly if they did not draw the design first. None of the excellent God Tier Masters would do such a stupid thing. However, the young man in front of them did exactly that.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing flicked his right wrist. The wielded Consolidating Brush descended on the Consolidated Equipment Paper. The silver Consolidating Ink immediately produced the outlines. His actions were slow, but his wrist was extremely firm. His emotions seemed to disappear momentarily. It was as though he, the Consolidating Brush, and the Consolidated Equipment Paper were a single entity.</p><br/><p>\u2018He is mad. He must be crazy!\u2019 The two God Tier Masters looked at each other. They were utterly shocked by Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Thick and silvery radiance continuously surged out from Zhou Weiqing. This was the Heavenly Energy that had been transformed into the Spatial Attribute. The silver radiance went down his arm to the Consolidating Brush in his hand before gathering at the tip of as he slowly drew.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the yellow rosewood table and the legendary Consolidating Brush in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand played a critical role. The Consolidated Equipment Paper lay stably on the yellow rosewood table. When the Consolidating Ink was used to draw the outline on the Consolidated Equipment Paper, the Consolidating Ink would integrate into the Consolidated Equipment Paper in the fastest possible time. The regular movements of the Consolidating Brush in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand did not waver at all during the entire process as though it had found its own trajectory.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Like the Bai Da Empire, the Kalise Battle Team also surrendered without a fight. As such, though this Group One looked to be a Group of Death, it was more for the other teams within. In truth, in such a preliminary phase, it did not draw as much attention at all.</p><br/><p>After the Heavenly Bow Battle Team admitted defeated, Zhou Weiqing did not remain for long in his own rest house, instead silently heading towards the ZhongTian Battle Team rest house. The reason was simple; before the fights had begun, he had already spotted Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er there. Only the two sisters were there at the ZhongTian Battle Team rest house, and the reason why he was certain Shangguan Bing\u2019er wasn\u2019t here was because of their eyes. Zhou Weiqing believed that if Bing\u2019er was here, she would be extremely agitated to see him, and her eyes would be different from Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Before Zhou Weiqing could enter the ZhongTian Battle Team Rest House, he was stopped. One of the ZhongTian Battle Team members lifted his hand to block him, saying: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cI am the Team Leader of the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, here to greet your Team Leader. Is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words and tone were polite, and thus the ZhongTian Battle Team member was not rude in return. Before he could speak, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s voice rang out from within. \u201cLet him in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and walked on into the ZhongTian Battle Team, not being polite in just finding a seat to sit in. His sneaky eyes hidden behind the bamboo hat were roving on both Shangguan Sisters.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s ZhongTian Battle Team was clearly very different from yesterday\u2019s. Not only were the two Shangguan Sisters Fei\u2019er and Xue\u2019er here, even Little Miss Muddle was here. It could be said that besides Shangguan Bing\u2019er, this was the ZhongTian Battle Team\u2019s strongest power gathered here.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er, from the looks of things, you all were actually planning on giving us a good fight today?\u201d Zhou Weiqing said with a speechless look on his face.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not open her mouth, and it was Fei\u2019er who spoke instead. \u201cTsk\u2026 little coward, drinking cold water1. How could you just surrender to us like that? Aren\u2019t you afraid of not being able to advance to the next stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Fei\u2019er spoke, Shangguan Xue\u2019er who was right beside her waved her hands, and a light blue shield of light enveloped the three of them. This was a Water Attribute Skill that could shield them from prying ears. Anyone below the cultivation level of Heavenly King Stage who tried to eavesdrop would not be able to hear anything.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cHeh heh, how could I possibly take action against you all, my heart would ache too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er stuck out her tongue at Zhou Weiqing. Looking at her cute look, if they weren\u2019t in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament competition grounds, Zhou Weiqing truly felt like holding her in his arms and getting intimate.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er remained her usual icy self. This time, it really wasn\u2019t against Zhou Weiqing, but rather she was afraid that the other ZhongTian Battle Team members would suspect. She could only bring up a sound proof barrier, but was unable to block their vision. If anyone saw the usually cold and icy her smile at Zhou Weiqing, it would cause too much suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you trying to act like a pig to eat some tigers? Why did you run here today, wouldn\u2019t it spark suspicion?\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er said passively.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing immediately said: \u201cI\u2019m being wronged totally! Who can I be acting like a pig to eat a tiger here? My Battle Team\u2019s overall power is really below your ZhongTian Battle Team! As such, I decided it was a wiser strategy to surrender. Furthermore, for yesterday\u2019s fight, I did send out our core power members, and did not try to hide anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er burst out in giggles, saying: \u201cCome on now, others might not know you, but wouldn\u2019t we know you well enough? If you weren\u2019t trying to act, why wear that bamboo hat and even veils to mask all your appearances? Isn\u2019t it because you are afraid many people will recognize you? By admitting defeat today, you are planning on sitting on the hill to watch tigers fight right? Aren\u2019t you afraid that we will lose to the Dan Dun Empire tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily, saying: \u201cIs the Dan Dun Battle Team that strong this year? Even you all do not have absolute confidence in beating them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er nodded and said: \u201cIndeed, we do not have absolute confidence. If Bing\u2019er was here, perhaps we would have a much stronger chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her words, Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: \u201cYou all are really torturing me! You know how much I miss Bing\u2019er, how come you do not allow her to come see me today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said: \u201cBing\u2019er also misses you a lot. However, she has only just come out of closed door cultivation not long ago. In the last few years, she has spent in closed door cultivation, and her cultivation level has risen dramatically. However, that also means her current state is very unstable, and she cannot have too much emotional upheaval. Once you enter the finals, if you can enter the Heavenly Jewel Island then, you will naturally be able to see Bing\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: \u201cI hope that the Dan Dun Battle Team can be sensible and strategic then, and just surrender tomorrow. If I were them, I would not waste time clashing against you in just the preliminary matches.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er started momentarily. However, the next instant, both of them understood his meaning. Indeed, they had neglected that possibility because they knew how strong the Heavenly Bow Battle Team was, but\u2026 the Dan Dun Battle Team would not know that! Shangguan Fei\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but exclaim: \u201cSo\u2026 your plan is to actually force out the Dan Dun Battle Team in the preliminary stages!? No wonder you would choose to admit defeat today\u2026 that is targeted at the Dan Dun Battle Team and cause them to underestimate you. With their confidence and arrogance, they would not deem you as a worthy foe at all. In that case, they would think that it is guaranteed for them to advance along with us\u2026 and because of that they might actually just surrender to us without fighting. In that case\u2026 as long as you can defeat them in the sixth round, then the Dan Dun Battle Team would not even be able to advance from the preliminary stages. That is your real plan right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cYou are truly my precious Fei\u2019er, so intelligent! I am also helping you all! To remove a strong opponent in the preliminary stages, it will be much easier in the finals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er was left speechless momentarily, before she said: \u201cHowever, did you think that if you advanced as the second rank in the First Group, then you would likely have to face the top ranker of the Third Group in the top eight fights. That would definitely be the Bao Po Battle Team. Even if you can defeat the Dan Dun Battle Team, it will not be without injuries. Do you have the confidence to beat the Bao Po Battle Team in that state then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: \u201cWhy should I not have confidence? The top eight matches are all single combat fights. The Bao Po Battle Team\u2019s greatest strength is their husband and wife team combos. In one versus one fights, their greatest strength will be diminished. Furthermore, don\u2019t you have confidence in your own husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose your wife?\u201d Both Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er retorted as one. In that instant, even Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s face blushed slightly.</p><br/><p>The other ZhongTian Battle Team members were not blind, and after Shangguan Xue\u2019er had used the sound insulation barrier, they would glance in often. At this point, seeing Shangguan Xue\u2019er blushing, their eyes almost bulged out of their sockets. What kind of situation was that? First Young Miss\u2026 was actually\u2026 actually showing such a feminine side?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, not far off from the ZhongTian Battle Team Rest House, the Dan Dun Rest House.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did that Heavenly Bow Battle Team fellow enter the ZhongTian Battle Team Rest House?\u201d The youth seated at the main seat asked with an overcast expression.</p><br/><p>One of the other Dan Dun Battle Team members said disdainfully: \u201cI guess that they are seizing the chance since they surrendered to express their goodwill towards the ZhongTian Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Little Demon was seated a few seats down, and her brow furrowed deeply as she said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure why\u2026 but that person from the Heavenly Bow Battle Team gives me a strangely familiar feeling\u2026 as if I had seen him \u2026 or her\u2026 before?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth on the main seat looked at Shen Little Demon, and his eyes grew slightly gentler. \u201cJust a mere bunch of cowardly fools who hide themselves. When it is our turn to fight them, it will be the end of their act. There is no need to worry about them. On the other hand, our fight tomorrow is with the ZhongTian Empire\u2026 what do you all think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Little Demon thought for a moment and said: \u201cThis time, the ZhongTian Battle Team is being led by the Shangguan Sisters, Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er. Their powers are both beyond mine. If we truly wish to clash headon against them and defeat them, I\u2019m afraid we will have to reveal all of our hidden aces in order to do so. Our main aim is to enter the finals, so I recommend we do not draw too much attentions to ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth at the head nodded slowly. In the depths of his eyes, a cold blood-red light flashed momentarily before vanishing.</p><br/><p>The second day of the competition continued without a hitch all the way. There were a few dark horses, but they were relatively minor, with more of the traditional stronger teams winning.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhou Weiqing had chosen not to bet at all. In fact, there was no way for him to bet at all. For their fight against the ZhongTian Battle Team, the odds were 1 to 1000, and it was pretty much pointless even if he wanted to bet on the ZhongTian Battle Team. Of course, the thought of betting on themselves and pushing through to win the fight. However, if they did so, the ZhongTian Empire would not let him go so easily. After all, even with the ZhongTian Empire\u2019s wealth, they could not afford to pay out almost a hundred billion!</p><br/><p>As such, Zhou Weiqing could only give up that dream.</p><br/><p>Two days of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament had already passed, and the bettors already had a certain judgement of all the Battle Teams\u2019 overall power, and there were already favourites regarding the teams who would advance from each groups.</p><br/><p>For the second day\u2019s fights, perhaps the most surprising result was that the Fei Li Battle Team had actually lost. Ye Paopao and his sister had strong powers indeed, but they met a powerful team from one of the southern empires who had used strategy against them to win in a final result of 3v2. However, the group which the Fei Li Battle Team was in could be said to be relatively weakest, and they would have no problems advancing into the top eight. One could say that sometimes, luck was part of strength, equally important.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Third day of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, Zhou Weiqing led his entire team out, stealthily heading to a betting station to begin his bets. Today was one of the most anticipated fights in the preliminary stages, that was the First Group\u2019s ZhongTian Battle Team against the Dan Dun Battle Team. Of course, the anticipation was mostly a view of the citizens, and Zhou Weiqing did not think any fight would happen at all.</p><br/><p>However, he still placed a lot of importance on today\u2019s competitions. Of course, his main focus was on earning money.</p><br/><p>Alas, when they reached the betting station, Zhou Weiqing could only stare in shock\u2026 as he looked on at a 1 to 100 odds.</p><br/><p>In this third day of the tournament, the Heavenly Bow Battle Team would meet the Geritimo Battle Team, also one of the stronger teams in the Group. Normally speaking, even if the odds was 10 to 1, Zhou Weiqing would not be surprised, but 1 to 100 was rather exaggerated. What Zhou Weiqing could not accept was that the odds was to his disadvantage instead! Someone had actually placed a massive bet on them!</p>\n</div>"}

As soon as she was let out, she instantly gave him an angry growl. However, her attention was quickly drawn away by the surrounding environment, and she jumped up onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shoulder, her eyes roaming around.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stroked her on the head, saying: \u201cPreviously, Senior Shangguan said that Heavenly Beasts will be affected here. Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fat Cat gave a low, disdainful wuuu wuuu, lifting her little head proudly, as if to say \u2018This place, how could it possibly affect me!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned, pulling Fat Cat from his shoulder into his arms, saying: \u201cFat Cat, we have been together for almost three years right. These three years, I have treated you so well! Good food, good drinks, everything! Now that we\u2019re finally in this Heavenly Jewel Tournament Finals\u2026 it\u2019s time you repay me right? Heh heh heh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, Fat Cat looked at Zhou Weiqing warily, giving a low wuu wuu sound as she struggled to get out of his arms.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was holding her with one hand, the other hand unceremoniously on her round little buttocks. \u201cWait, let me finish. Sighh, in truth, I really do not want to say this, as I am afraid that after doing so, it can never be the same between us again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lost in a contemplative deep thought, Zhou Weiqing brought Fat Cat in front of him, holding her to his cheek gently.</p><br/><p>Fat Cat\u2019s body stiffened, the wary look in her eyes disappearing. Her howls stopped as well, but a new look of being at a loss appeared in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, we cannot continue like this forever, right? Furthermore, I do not know if we do so\u2026 perhaps one day you will just disappear without warning. After much thought, I finally steeled my resolve to have a good talk with you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke up to that point, his words grew thicker with feeling. Bringing Fat Cat back into his embrace, he gave the \u2018King\u2019 word on her head a soft kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we first met, it was not long after I had become a Heavenly Jewel Master, when Bing\u2019er was in danger and I had subconsciously and unknowingly activated the Demonic Change. When the fight had finally ended, you had suddenly appeared under my feet, and refused to leave me. In truth, at that time, I already thought that you approached me with some motive in mind. Although up to this point, I still do not know what that motive is, I am still very confident in my own judgement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs we spent more time together, day after day, I was more and more certain that you were no ordinary Heavenly Beast. These few years, you were always by my side, but did not eat or drink\u2026 spending most of the time sleeping even\u2026 yet under such a circumstance, you were still able to evolve! Without question, you managed to gain something from me. However, no matter what, you do not owe me, and I was, and am, more than willing to let you continue gaining what you want from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, Fat Cat\u2019s eyes seemed to freeze, an invisible pressure emanating from its body, but Zhou Weiqing seemed oblivious as he continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese few years, you have saved my life more than once. If not for you, perhaps I would have died long ago when we faced the Icy Soul Heavenly Bear\u2026 not just me, but also Bing\u2019er, and my teachers. Furthermore, you have helped me so many times during Skill Storing, for the Silver Emperor\u2026 and even last night. If not for you, even though I have that unknown aura that can intimidate Heavenly Beasts, I still wouldn\u2019t be able to Store Skills from Heavenly King Beasts and higher. It can be said that we have been together for so long in a reciprocity and mutual benefit based relationship, even when you evolved, you brought me along and I actually gained an additional level of Heavenly Energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing stopped suddenly, a hesitant look on his face, but he continued: \u201cHowever, between us, there has always been that invisible gulf. I do not want to feign ignorance any longer, and I hope that we can be honest with each other, to remove that divide between us. Although I have tried to deny my guesses many times, but after all that we have been true, I am extremely certain that my guess is accurate. Right\u2026 Tian\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the instance when Zhou Weiqing called out the two words, Tian\u2019er, Fat Cat\u2019s hair bristled up as her hackles raised up, staring at him wide-eyed in shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing met her gaze impassively, saying: \u201cI believe that my guess is accurate.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a moment of silence, the Fat Cat sighed, and she actually spoke out loud suddenly: \u201cWhen did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said with a bitter smile: \u201cThe first time I saw Tian\u2019er, I had some suspicions. At that time, facing Ming Wu who could have easily killed me, and Tian\u2019er suddenly appeared to tell him that I was already chosen by the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Yet, in all my memory, I knew that I had never had any contact with the Heavenly Snow Mountain; in fact at that point I didn\u2019t even know of the Great Saint Lands. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, even though both your forms, either Fat Cat or Tian\u2019er, might look extremely different, but one thing remains unchanged, your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the start of my memory, the only purple eyes that I have seen were yours, and having been together for so long, they are naturally well inscribed in my memory. At first, I did not dare believe my ludicrous suspicions; after all, Tian\u2019er was a human, and my little Fat Cat was little white tiger, how could they be the same person? Yet, as the days passed, and more events happened, especially when you first faced Shangguan Xue\u2019er, the feelings of your aura and Attributes. Later on, once I heard about the Attributes that the Heavenly Snow Mountain was famed for\u2026 and only then did I dare to start believing in my wild speculation. My little Fat Cat was actually that mysterious young girl from the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2026 Tian\u2019er! That was the only explanation for all the strange happenings, the coincidences. After all, that time when you scared Ming Wu away, Fat Cat was not beside me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, the final confirmation to me that you are Tian\u2019er was when Little Witch passed me the Demonic Manual, she secretly told me that the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord was actually not human, but a powerful Heavenly Beast called the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger, the King of the Beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, it was here.\u201d Fat Cat said angrily. \u201cZhou Little Fatty, get your dirty hands off my buttocks!\u201d</p><br/><p>A thick purple light shone out from Fat Cat\u2019s body, and in a swift motion, she sprang out from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms. The light intensified and spread out, and this time, Fat Cat did not grow larger, slowly morphing directly into human form in the middle of the purple glow.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhou Weiqing had already guessed that Fat Cat was Tian\u2019er, but it was still a guess, no matter how confident he had been in it. Now, it was the first time for him to witness the actual transformation with his own eyes, seeing the entire process, and was caught by surprise by it.</p><br/><p>White hair, purple eyes, a contrast that accentuated the cold beauty in front of him.</p><br/><p>A tall slim figure, yet strangely curvaceous. Tian\u2019er finally appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing once again, but this time, her face was filled with killing intent.</p><br/><p>An abrupt intensified flash of the purple light, and Zhou Weiqing felt as if a needle was stabbed into his brain, causing him to feel dizzy. The next moment, a huge force travelled towards his buttocks, and his entire body flew up into air, causing him to smash into a huge tree ahead, before he finally crashed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>That white clad figure, still trailing purple light, followed closely. Soon after, a series of shrill cries of pain rang out, along with loud sounds of crashes and beating.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid Zhou Little Fatty, you vulgar, perverted, disgusting person! Hmph! Who asked you to recognize me\u2026 who asked you to recognize me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still have the face to say we are together for three years\u2026 and what have you done all this while? Toying around with me, catching me to\u2026 to\u2026 bathe with you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t revealed who I was, I might still be able to tolerate you. Hmph\u2026 very good\u2026 since you actually know who I am now, then I\u2019ll deal with you for all the grudges at once!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little rascal, you already guessed I was Tian\u2019er, and know I have a human form, and you still dared to touch my\u2026 buttocks earlier. Don\u2019t you know a tiger\u2019s bottom cannot be touched?!\u201d 1</p><br/><p>The pent up anger of the past three years poured out of Tian\u2019er in a torrential flow, as fist ad foot crashed into flesh as she dealt out an angry beating.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing was extremely cooperative, his hands covering his head as he did not dare resist, just howling in passionate cries of agony, as if he was suffering the worst torture in the world. Anyone who heard it might have cried in sorrow.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er beat him up for several minutes before she finally expended all her anger, finally stopping as she gasped for breath, her impressive chest heaving up and down. Looking down at Zhou Weiqing, her gaze will still angry, obviously she still hadn\u2019t totally had her fill yet.</p><br/><p>In truth, although it seemed like she had been beating Zhou Weiqing savagely, that was all purely physical strength, without using any hint of Heavenly Energy at all.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lay on the ground unresisting, his body curled in a ball, just like a well-cooked prawn, moaning sorrowfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up! Stop acting already. Don\u2019t think I do not know your stupid thick hide can easily take such a beating without any issues? Hmph!\u201d Tian\u2019er said angrily as she gave his buttocks another swift kick.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyahh!\u201d Zhou Weiqing quickly jumped up, vaulting swiftly as he dodged behind a large tree.</p><br/><p>Just like what Tian\u2019er had said, this fellow was totally fine at all. With his physique, and the Immortal Deity Shield to boot, it was nigh impossible for anyone to hurt him without using Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her with a depressed look, saying: \u201cTian\u2019er, you have beaten me up already. For the sake of the fact that I was so cooperative to let you hit me without resisting, your anger should be assuaged by now right. After all, in the past, you were the one who made the move to stick to me, rubbing against me. It was only years after taking you in that I knew you could become human right? When you are Fat Cat, you are so cute and cuddly, as an owner, petting my pet is very normal right? As for touching your buttocks, I have to explain it\u2026 you cannot blame me, who asked your buttocks to be so pert and round!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he eyed the above-mentioned body part.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! You little rascal, are you asking to die?!\u201d Tian\u2019er cried out angrily, about to pounce forward once again.</p>\n</div>"}

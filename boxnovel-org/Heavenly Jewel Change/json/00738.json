Even though he was a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, it was too late for him to stop whatever Zhou Weiqing was doing. As the black glow approached the silver light, it was instantly repelled by the distorted silver light. It was surprising that the Blackness attribute could not break through the extremely powerful Spatial attribute.</p><br/><p>Next, the powerful silver light transformed into an enormous vortex in a speed that could not be seen with naked eyes under the intense distortion. Looking at the vortex, even the Blackfiend Dragon was stunned as he flapped his wings to fly. The five Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouses led by Dongfang did not dare to slow down. They could tell that it was a spatial turbulence!</p><br/><p>It was not a skill of any sort but an actual spatial turbulence. Whoever that was at the center of it would be smashed into pieces. Even a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse would not dare to touch such a thing. Although someone at the Heavenly God Tier had a strong physique, who knew where the spatial turbulence would send one to?</p><br/><p>At that point, nobody could stop Zhou Weiqing anymore. Meanwhile, the silverish white light that was emitting from his body was increasing. Because he was the one that started this and since this was also caused by the Spatial Teleportation Stone, he was unaffected by the spatial turbulence at all. After that, a terrifying wave of energy exploded, and a terrifying force spread out from the spatial turbulence. The intense wave of Heavenly Energy even caused the Mysterious Heavenly Castle to tremble and a gigantic shadow appeared in the middle of the spatial turbulence.</p><br/><p>A dragon. Yes, it was a gigantic dragon. Its body was over hundreds of meters long, and its unfurled wings were like dark clouds hanging over one\u2019s head. It was a gigantic dragon that was completely red. All of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace powerhouses were stunned. They did not expect that Zhou Weiqing would be able to summon a gigantic dragon with the Spatial Teleportation Stone. Besides, the Blackfiend Dragon could not be compared to the immense power of this gigantic dragon. Moreover, the Blackfiend Dragon was currently injured! With such a Heavenly God Tier gigantic dragon, no wonder Zhou Weiqing dared to say that he was going to rain blood onto the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>At that time, Dongfang felt regretful to the very core of her stomach. She had never expected that her words would cause the scene that was currently unfolding before their eyes. Her daughter\u2019s judgment was accurate! She had no idea that Zhou Weiqing had that in him. He could even summon a gigantic dragon.</p><br/><p>That explained why he came here just for the Spatial Teleportation Stone. It was hard to believe that there was such secret skill. Even they had no idea that the Spatial Teleportation Stone could be used like that. The gigantic dragon that was summoned could compare to the combined abilities of the powerhouses that were present. It did not matter who won. As soon as they began their fight, it would be a disastrous attack to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. It was impossible not to pay a painful price when fighting a powerhouse like that.</p><br/><p>Those were the thoughts that were running through Dongfang\u2019s mind However, she was not the one that was the most shocked. It was the Blackfiend Dragon. It was because the Blackfiend Dragon could clearly sense that the gigantic dragon had the purest Dragon Emperor Bloodline in it. That meant that it was the true descendant of the Dragon Emperor! He had commented in the past that even a Dragon Emperor\u2019s descendant might not be able to defeat the Dreadfiend Sea Naga in the ocean but that was all just speculation. Among the members of the Dragon Clan, the most powerful ones were without a doubt, those who possessed the Dragon Emperor Bloodline. Moreover, the gigantic dragon that they were looking at was an adult.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon knew very well that under the suppression of the Dragon Emperor Bloodline, he would not be able to stand for long before this gigantic dragon even at his peak condition. Even worse, he was injured at the moment. My God! What kind of person did the people from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace offend to the extent that a gigantic dragon was summoned.</p><br/><p>If the appearance of the gigantic dragon had caused the people from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace to be in great fear and distress, then what they saw next would put them in complete despair. The enormously silver spatial turbulence did not even disappear after the appearance of the gigantic dragon. As soon as the gigantic dragon appeared, it flapped its wings and flew to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back right away. Without a doubt, its gigantic dragon eyes were locked on the Blackfiend Dragon directly while powerful its Dragon Power exploded.</p><br/><p>Next, another gigantic shadow slowly appeared in the middle of the spatial turbulence. As it appeared, the temperature of the mountain where the entire Mysterious Heavenly Castle was located, rose at an alarming rate. Surprisingly, the Blackness Attribute in the air disappeared right way and the Ward of Darkness was dismissed just like that.</p><br/><p>Yes, that was another gigantic dragon and its body was more than double the size of the previous dragon. As it appeared with its terrifyingly enormous body, the Blackfiend Dragon almost fell from the sky under the power that it was releasing. The petrifying Dragon Power almost killed the four Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouses that were standing across from it.</p><br/><p>That, that was\u2026</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s eyes opened wide as his wings shook uncontrollably. He recognized it. He really did. It was the Dragon Emperor\u2026</p><br/><p>Dongfang and the four Supreme Elders were in complete shock. In the human world, they were Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouses. They were truly mighty humans. Even Heavenly Jewel Masters respected them and dared not speak loudly to them. However, at the very moment, they were facing two Heavenly God Tier gigantic dragons that looked even scarier than the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Faced with the terrifying gigantic dragons were unrestricted on land, they were in complete shock and despair.</p><br/><p>Rain of blood. What he said was not merely out of rage but something he could really achieve. Yes, with the power of the entire Mysterious Heavenly Palace combined, they might be able to handle it if it was only one gigantic dragon. However, what they were facing were two adult dragons! Besides, the aura that the larger dragon was emitting was perhaps close to that of the Heavenly God Tier. It was not difficult for something like that to kill the Blackfiend Dragon, let alone kill them.</p><br/><p>As the second gigantic dragon appeared, it flapped its wings while its enormous body moved quickly and soon, it appeared below Zhou Weiqing. It held up its enormous head up to support Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body before an intense red glow lit up, bathing Zhou Weiqing in it. At that moment, the dragons\u2019 majestic eyes were filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>What was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s reason for obtaining the Spatial Teleportation Stone from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland? It was to teleport these two gigantic dragons they were looking at to prevent them from destroying the Luster Spatial Realm and affecting the entire Heavenly Jewel Island. Since he was going to teleport them, why did he choose to do it now?</p><br/><p>The truth was, before this, Zhou Weiqing did not have the confidence to do it. It was his final trump card. He planned to do this when he encountered the second Dreadfiend Sea Naga at sea earlier. However, he did not have the confidence to do it. He was not sure if he could summon the two gigantic dragons from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland that was tens of thousands of miles away. The Spatial Teleportation Stone could only be used for a few more times, he would never attempt this if he had no other choices.</p><br/><p>However, the situation was different now. Bing\u2019er was dead. Zhou Weiqing was so hurt that he was going insane. How could he retain his sanity under such a situation? His ability alone was far from enough to avenge Bing\u2019er. How could he possibly fight the Mysterious Heavenly Palace on his own? That was why he had taken such a crazy action since he had no other choice. The truth had proven that he had succeeded.</p><br/><p>At the time when Zhou Weiqing left the Luster Spatial Realm, Hui Yao the dragon had imprinted the coordinates of the Luster Spatial Realm in his mind. Hui Yao had also told Zhou Weiqing the way to summon him and Duo Si. In actual fact, Zhou Weiqing had thought too much. Hui Yao and Duo Si were not situated on the Boundless Mainland but in another realm. The concept of distance did not exist in this world when it came to teleportation from one realm to another. As a result, Zhou Weiqing had successfully summoned the two dragons.</p><br/><p>Huo Yao\u2019s eyes had a sparkle in them and it seemed to have completely healed. His majestic eyes were also locked on to the Blackfiend Dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Weiqing. You\u2019ve freed us. It seems like you\u2019re in trouble. Tell us, what do you need us to do,\u201d Hui Yao\u2019s voice was deep but his voice echoed all over the mountain ranges as he spoke. The surrounding area was turning red.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga and Blackfiend Dragon used Atmospheric Energy in a different way. When they were using it, they depended on their aura to maneuver it. However, dragon Hui Yao gave a whole new feeling to it. It seemed like the Atmospheric Energy had surrendered itself to him, allowing him to maneuver it as he wished.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon lost all hope when he heard what Hui Yao said. The Dragon Clan was a prideful clan. It was difficult for humans to command them. The reason why he stayed to protect the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was because the palace was the descendant of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s Bloodline. However, it seemed like the two gigantic dragons that possessed the Dragon Emperor Bloodline had surrendered themselves to Zhou Weiqing. It was just too unbelievable.</p><br/><p>How would they know that Zhou Weiqing had saved the lives of these two dragons? Without him and his women, Duo Si might have been dead and none of their children would have lived. If not for them, Hui Yao would not have been resurrected. Hence, no matter how arrogant the gigantic dragons were, they treated Zhou Weiqing as an equal. He was their friend, their partner.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath. Just when he was ready to release the scream of doom, a yell could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, no! Bing\u2019er isn\u2019t dead.\u201d Two shadows dashed out of the Mysterious Heavenly Castle as the yell sounded. Two people rushed next to Dongfang and the four Supreme Elders. This time, it was Zhou Weiqing who was stunned. Although everything he saw through his eyes was a bloody-red, he could clearly see the ones who dashed out from the Mysterious Heavenly Castle.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue wore a green dress. Next to her, Shangguan Bing\u2019er was in her white dress. It seemed like Shangguang Bing\u2019er was not hurt at all. She was as beautiful as she always was. Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s beautiful eyes were opened wide with shock as she dashed out with Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Technically speaking, everything was a misunderstanding. Earlier, when Zhou Weiqing had screamed when he arrived, Dongfang Hanyue who was in the Mysterious Heavenly Castle heard it. She had no idea that Zhou Weiqing knew about Shangguan Bing\u2019er being captured. Dongfang Hanyue was a little angry when she heard him screaming out there. \u2018We\u2019ve given the most precious thing to you. Can that even be compared to your wife?\u2019 That was the reason why she did not leave the castle right away.</p><br/><p>Just yesterday, after Dongfang had discussed with the four Supreme Elders, she had decided to listen to Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s opinion and release Shangguan Bing\u2019er. Dongfang Hanyue went to Shangguan Bing\u2019er in a rush. To annoy Zhou Weiqing the meanie, she even joked with Shangguan Bing\u2019er when she saw her that there was no rush for her to leave. She was afraid that Shangguan Bing\u2019er would hold grudges so she had been talking to her for the past two days. They talked a lot but she had forgotten to return Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s Spatial Ring to her. That was the reason why Zhou Weiqing had not been able to contact Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>However, Dongfang Hanyue only realized that something was wrong when she heard Zhou Weiqing said that he wanted to rain blood onto the Mysterious Heavenly Castle when she was in Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s room. So she brought Shangguan Bing\u2019er out of the castle immediately. Everything sounded like they happened slowly but in reality, it only took five minutes from the time Zhou Weiqing arrived at the Mysterious Heavenly Palace until the time he summoned the two gigantic dragons.</p><br/><p>The party was up when Dongfang Hanyue brought Shangguan Bing\u2019er out of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. In the end, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s \u201cKill them all\u201d was stuck in his throat and did not come out. In fact, Hui Yao and Duo Si were ready to attack by then. If Zhou Weiqing gave his instruction to kill everyone that was present, they were ready to do as he said. The terrifying aura lingered in the air and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes were still wide open. The indistinct, cold aura had melted away like snow together with the redness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bing\u2019er didn\u2019t die! Bing\u2019er didn\u2019t die!\u2019 At that moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s tears were flowing down his cheeks uncontrollably. His body was shaking even more intensely now.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive back my Bing\u2019er and I\u2019ll let all of you go.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said as his body shook. His voice did not sound convincing because he had two gigantic dragons by his side!</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue snapped out of her trance and felt pain in her heart as she watched Zhou Weiqing lose his manliness as he shed tears. At that moment, she behaved like a little girl, momentarily forgetting that she was the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. She thought to herself, \u2018If that were to happen to me, would he be this anxious?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not returning her to you. You can kill me.\u201d Dongfang Hanyue lifted her head and looked at Zhou Weiqing coldly. Zhou Weiqing was stunned. His felt like he was escaping rock bottom. When he saw that Shangguan Bing\u2019er was alright, he did not seem as vengeful. He was speechless when he heard Dongfang Hanyue rejecting his request. He did not know how to deal with that. He felt sorry as he watched Dongfang Hanyue being stubborn.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Shangguan Bing\u2019er stepped up to the rescue. \u201cLittle Fatty, what are you doing! Hanyue has been treating me well, I\u2019m alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>She summoned her Wings of the Wind God as she spoke then flapped her wings and flew towards Zhou Weiqing. Naturally, nobody stopped her. Dongfang and the four Supreme Elders were completely silent. They could clearly sense that if something had really happened to Shangguan Bing\u2019er, Zhou Weiqing would definitely get the two gigantic dragons to destroy the Mysterious Heavenly Castle and turn it into a flatland. At that moment, even though they were sly and cunning, they had no idea how they should handle the situation.</p><br/><p>The Wings of the Wind God was tremendously fast. Shangguan Bing\u2019er got to Zhou Weiqing in just a blink of an eye. Zhou Weiqing did not care that people were watching as he wrapped her in his arms. His hands were touching her everywhere, making sure that his Bing\u2019er was completely fine. Finally, he felt relieved. Although so many people were watching, Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not resist at all as she hugged his waist tightly and buried her face in him.</p><br/><p>Although she and Dongfang Hanygue had just come out, the both of them had been paying close attention to the Heavenly Energy outside. Hence, she could hear everything loud and clear even though she was in the Mysterious Heavenly Castle. A man who was not afraid of facing the entire Mysterious Heavenly Palace because of her. He even wanted to rain blood on this place and fight all on his own. How could she not be moved by that? That was her man, her Little Fatty!</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes turned slightly red as she looked at Zhou Weiqing who was standing majestically on top of the gigantic dragon Hui Yao\u2019s head. She knew that perhaps she would not be able to see this man anymore after today. She was jealous of Shangguan Bing\u2019er, jealous of her for being able to be with him while Dongfang Hanyue herself had too many responsibilities. She had her father\u2019s inheritance and the future of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace on her shoulders. All those were the heaviest burdens that she had to bear.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er let go of each other slowly after hugging for a while. Surprisingly, none of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace powerhouses dared to interrupt them. The two Heavenly God Tier gigantic dragons\u2019 suppressive powers were just too petrifying to them. At that moment, what they were concerned about was not the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s pride but its survival.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, you\u2019ve misunderstood Sis Hanyue. She\u2019s been very nice to me and told me many things. The Mysterious Heavenly Palace really did capture me as they were unsure of our intention here. However, they did not hurt me. Sis Hanyue came back immediately to convince the rest after she heard about it. We\u2019re supposed to depart and look for you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head and sighed secretly in his heart. The ups and downs of his life happened too quickly. He could not help but felt a little embarrassed as he looked at Dongfang Hanyue who was far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHanyue, erm, it seems like this is a misunderstanding.\u201d Zhou Weiqing mumbled.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue bit her lower lips hard, trying to keep the tears in her eyes from overflowing but she could not stop it from happening.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing flapped open his wings on the back and flew towards the Mysterious Heavenly Palace while the dragon Hui Yao and Duo Si stayed where they were. Since they were there, they believed that nobody would dare to give Zhou Weiqing trouble. Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not follow him. Instead, she stayed on Hui Yao\u2019s head with an odd expression on her beautiful face.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue did not keep what happened between her and Zhou Weiqing a secret. She told Shangguan Bing\u2019er how she felt about Zhou Weiqing loud and clear. Shangguan Bing\u2019er actually blamed Zhou Weiqing when she first found out about it. No matter how gentle she was, she was a woman after all. Moreover, she had two sisters at home. This Little Fatty scattered his love everywhere he went, he did not stop doing that even when he was in a foreign land. However, since Zhou Weiqing risked his life and did not care about the price he had to pay to rescue her today, the resentment that she had in her heart had faded away. On the contrary, she started empathizing with Dongfang Hanyue.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue was the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Naturally, it was impossible for her to return to the Boundless Mainland with Zhou Weiqing. Does it not hurt the most when one was unable be with the person that one loved? Compared to her, Shangguan Bing\u2019er was much more fortunate. Dongfang and the four Supreme Elders were now mere spectators. At that moment, they held Dongfang Hanyue in high regard. Although Dongfang Hanyue was affected by her feelings, she was not wrong in her assessment of Zhou Weiqing. Who would have thought that this young man would be able to summon two gigantic dragons?</p><br/><p>If Dongfang Hanyue did not bring out Shangguan Bing\u2019er on time, whatever happened today would really put the palace in a tough situation. The millennia of foundation of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace could have been completely destroyed!</p><br/><p>Now that Shangguan Bing\u2019er had returned to Zhou Weiqing, it seemed like they would not be fighting anymore. Dongfang let out a light sigh and waved her hand. She then brought the four Supreme Elders back to the Mysterious Heavenly Castle. She did that firstly, because their existence was unnecessary and secondly, to show that the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was no longer an enemy to Zhou Weiqing. Dongfang was not a dumb person. She knew that letting Dongfang Hanyue speak to Zhou Weiqing alone would be the best option at this time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing kept his wings and landed before Dongfang Hanyue. His heart softened when he saw Dongfang Hanyue had tears streaming down her face with a hint of stubbornness on her face as she looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHanyue, what happened today is just a misunderstanding. It\u2019s my fault. However, I\u2019ve never doubted you. I just thought that the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was hurting Bing\u2019er. No matter what, it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d One of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s good qualities was that he always had the courage to admit it when he was wrong.</p><br/><p>In the relationship between a man and a woman, most of the times many things were stuck due to stubbornness from both parties. As long as one side took the initiative to admit fault, it could be solved rather easily no matter how serious the matter was. Of course, that had to be built on the foundation of mutual love. Looking at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s sincere face, Dongfang Hanyue took a quick step towards him and cried as she fell into his arms. She was crying not because Zhou Weiqing misunderstood her but she was afraid that they would not be seeing each other anymore after this. She was reluctant to let him go!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was hit by a wave of emotions as he held Hanyue\u2019s body that was as soft as cotton. The words slipped out of his lips. \u201cYueyue, go with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue proceeded to cry without responding. She was happy that Zhou Weiqing said that. However, could she really leave? The responsibilities on her shoulders were too heavy. The entire Mysterious Heavenly Palace needed her! Hence, she cried even more after hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s sincere invitation as she continuously punched his shoulder.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the Blackfiend Dragon felt unease in his body as he was being watched by the two Dragon Emperor descendants. He then attempted to extend an invitation to Hui Yao. \u201cIf the two of you are willing, you\u2019re welcome to rest at my place. Seems like everything that happened today is just a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>HuI Yao glared lightly at him and said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going so that your cultivation isn\u2019t affected. Since it\u2019s a misunderstanding, we\u2019ll leave soon after the explanation. I guess this isn\u2019t the Boundless Mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon was secretly relieved. It was great that they were not going with him as the Fire Attribute in the Atmospheric Energy triggered by these two were just too powerful. However, the place that he was staying in was filled with Blackness Attribute. If they really went with him, perhaps it would take more than one or two days to restore the place to its previous state. He invited them just to show his sincerity.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s tens of thousands of miles away from the Boundless Mainland.\u201d The Blackfiend Dragon said respectfully. Hui Yao had a concerned look in his eyes. He and his wife were filled with excitement when Zhou Weiqing summoned them. First, because they had finally managed to come to the outside world and second was because the Luster Spatial Realm would not be destroyed anymore. After all, it was their ancestors who built it, it was best if it was not destroyed.</p><br/><p>However, after a fleeting moment of excitement, their hearts were filled with how much they were missing their children. Moreover, they were a little concerned about the unknown powerful enemy. Faced with such an opponent, would they be able to bring back their children safely even if they managed to find the enemy?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing touched the curve on Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s back as he spoke to her softly, \u201cDon\u2019t cry anymore, Hanyue. Your tears are breaking my heart. I don\u2019t want to let you go, too! But you know that I\u2019m just like you. I\u2019ve many responsibilities that I need to handle. I still have to rescue my parents, I\u2019ve many things to do. I would love to stay with you but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking.\u201d Dongfang Hanyue held her head up as she looked at Zhou Weiqing with her eyes that were red and swollen from crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only ask you this. Are you willing to come back to see me after you\u2019re done with everything that you need to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing desperation and determination in her eyes, Zhou Weiqing said instantly almost without any hesitation, \u201cI\u2019m willing. Of course I am. The soonest could be five years and the longest could be 10 years but I\u2019ll definitely come back to see you. By then, I won\u2019t only be here to see you, I\u2019ll definitely bring you back with me. I believe by then, nobody on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland can stop me anymore. Even if I need to kidnap you, I\u2019ll kidnap you with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had a domineering aura when he said that. Dongfang Hanyue finally had a trace of happiness on her face that was filled with sadness. \u201cReally? Don\u2019t lie to me, or else I\u2019ll bring the Mysterious Heavenly Palace to fight the Boundless Mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled forcefully. \u201cMy best quality is the same as my biggest weakness. I\u2019m soft-hearted, especially when it comes to my woman. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely do what I\u2019ve promised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue nodded lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you. I\u2019ll wait for you even if it\u2019s five years, ten years, even if it\u2019s twenty years or longer. I\u2019ll just consider you dead if you don\u2019t come get me in 10 years. I\u2019ll bring the Mysterious Heavenly Palace powerhouses myself to the Boundless Mainland for revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart shook a bit. Looking at the determination in Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes, his reluctance to leave became even more intense. Although the time that they spent together was short, the affection that he saw in Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes was no lesser compared to his other women. She was a good woman that was worthy of his love!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely live. For you and for the sake of all my wives, I\u2019ll definitely live well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue scoffed, \u201cI heard from Bing\u2019er that you\u2019re a lecher. Hmph, I\u2019ll be your last. Do you hear me? If not, I\u2019ll kill those additional ones when you bring me back. Perhaps I might break through to Heavenly God Tier in five to 10 years time. I\u2019m not joking with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t! I won\u2019t dare to do that.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said.</p><br/><p>He scratched his head and thought to himself, \u2018Now that I have you, I\u2019ve no idea how I should explain myself when I get back. Seems like I must behave myself. I need to stay far away from women no matter how beautiful they are. Or else, they\u2019ll definitely kill me in the future!\u2019</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue could not help but laugh out loud as she saw Zhou Weiqing\u2019s naive expression as if he was being bullied. However, tears started dripping from her beautiful eyes again after a while. \u201cYou\u2026 You go. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to help myself and leave together with you if you don\u2019t leave now.\u201d Dongfang Hanyue looked deep into his eyes and reluctantly turned around. Her back was facing him as she was unwilling to see him leave.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the feelings in his heart. He clenched his teeth and took a step forward. He then turned Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s body around and gave her a deep kiss on her red lips. That passionate kiss almost melted Dongfang Hanyue. A silver light sparked and in the next second, Zhou Weiqing appeared far away in the sky. He moved again and landed on top of Hui Yao\u2019s head. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao and Duo Si who were husband and wife looked into each other eyes. They flapped their wings at the same time and drove their gigantic body up into the sky. Then, they flew far away.</p><br/><p>Looking at them leave, Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes were all blurry from her tears. \u201cWeiqing, you must come back! I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stood on top of Hui Yao\u2019s head as he tried to get his feelings under control. Shangguang Bing\u2019er stepped aside without interrupting him. She was a nice lady who would always think about others all the time. She felt Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s pain deeply earlier. Wasn\u2019t it the same as when she had to leave Little Fatty at that time?</p><br/><p>Hui Yao and his wife flew towards the west. They might seem extremely slow but in reality, they were moving extremely fast. Zhou Weiqing took exactly two days to get back to Mysterious Heavenly Castle but this time around, they saw the ocean again after a couple of hours.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao slightly retracted his wings, allowing his body to land and float on the ocean. He then asked Zhou Weiqing, \u201cWeiqing, how did you guys come to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland? If possible, it\u2019s best that Duo Si and I don\u2019t fly over the ocean. The Water Attribute in the ocean is too dense and is unfavorable to our cultivation. Apart from that, the creatures in the ocean below would be greatly affected as well. The shock might even cause a considerable amount of deaths. I don\u2019t want to see that happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing snapped out his thoughts and thought for a while before he spoke, \u201cWe have a way to go back on our own and it won\u2019t be too slow. But what about the both of you? You guys have such large bodies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao let out a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. Have you forgotten about the Spatial Teleportation Stone? We can temporarily hibernate in there. You can summon us anytime you need us. The Spatial Teleportation Stone doesn\u2019t seem to be that big of a problem, I\u2019ll try to fix it by melting it. Otherwise, we\u2019ll have to this scrap this precious stone after a couple of uses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cThat\u2019ll be great. If that\u2019s the case, the both of you can let us down.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing shook his hand and the Neptune Shuttle flew out into the ocean with its cabin cover opened. Hui Yao then let the both of them down. Just like what Hui Yao had said, his existence had caused the ocean below to turn slightly red. The intense Fire Attribute caused many fishes in the ocean to float on the surface from their death. Apart from that, they looked like they had been cooked. No wonder Hui Yao was reluctant to fly over the ocean. Although they were from the powerful Dragon Clan, they were reluctant to kill needlessly.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er entered the Neptune Shuttle, Hui Yao looked into his wife\u2019s eyes. As the rich red glow faded away, their gigantic bodies transformed into two red glows and entered the Spatial Teleportation Stone on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest. A great and vast force was inserted, and before Zhou Weiqing could feel it carefully, Hui Yao and Duo Si vanished into thin air the very next moment.</p><br/><p>As soon as they disappeared, everything turned back to normal. There was no red anymore and after the Neptune Shuttle\u2019s cabin cover was closed, Zhou Weiqing turned around and looked at Shangguan Bing\u2019er who standing next to him. It had been almost a year since they came here. Their mission was finally complete, and it was finally time to head home.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s tiny hands and said with a pitiful expression, \u201cBing\u2019er, I know it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m at fault. I promise this is really the last one. I\u2019ll never touch any other women anymore, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er let out a light sigh and said, \u201cYou better be grateful. Little Fatty, I just want to tell you that there are too many kind women in the world. It\u2019s impossible to make all of them yours. I can forgive you but you still have Tian\u2019er, my two sisters as well as the Little Witch who sacrificed herself to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head and said, \u201cI know, it\u2019s my fault. From now onwards, if I have a relationship with any other women, I won\u2019t complain even if you guys neuter me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er burst out laughing and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who said that. Don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 Can I take it back? Even so, will you guys be able to bear doing that to me?\u201d Zhou Weiqing smirked.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er scoffed and said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we bear to do that? All you do is bully us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing then pulled her into his arms. \u201cHow is this bullying? It should be love. You see, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve loved you. I\u2019ve gotten rusty. Let me see if my Bing\u2019er was tortured for the past few days in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Did you lose weight\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

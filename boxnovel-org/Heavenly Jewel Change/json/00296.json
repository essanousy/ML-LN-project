Zhou Weiqing was so lost in the kiss that his emotions were all in a mess, so much so that he almost did not sense something was wrong.</p><br/><p>The four white-clad guards behind \u2018Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019 were totally shocked, the only thing in their minds was one single question. Who \u2026 who is this? To even dare kiss this little devil girl of their Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2026</p><br/><p>Being kissed by Zhou Weiqing, this \u2018Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019\u2019s eyes widened, her body shuddering. The next moment, a strange scene occurred.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019 started moving about in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms, and in the next instant, her arms snaked out from between them like some flexible eels. Soon after, her left leg stomped hard on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right foot, causing him to look up in pained surprise.</p><br/><p>Next, she grabbed hold of his shoulder, using her own left shoulder to strike him in the chest, and Zhou Weiqing was sent flying back in the air.</p><br/><p>That was indeed an amazing feat. After all, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength was unbelievably powerful, and even if he had no vigilance against Shangguan Bing\u2019er, that basic strength was still there, as well as a considerable body weight. Yet, this \u2018Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019 had thrown him away without even using a bit of Heavenly Energy, clearly her strength, flexibility, coordination, was at a stunning level.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing getting thrown away, Lin TianAo was startled, quickly jumping in front to catch him. At the same time, that \u2018Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019 charged forward in a leap, striking towards Zhou Weiqing in mid air, shouting: \u201cZhou Little Fatty, you\u2019re asking for death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond sis! Be lenient!\u201d Right at point, a voice rang out, and another white figure dashed down from the fourth level of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion.</p><br/><p>On hearing the voice, the \u2018Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019 in midair hesitated, and her hands which had almost reached Zhou Weiqing drew back.</p><br/><p>Only then was Zhou Weiqing safely caught by Lin TianAo, but at that point he was both shocked and angry in his heart. Shock that Shangguan Bing\u2019er would actually strike him, and that the area where he had been grabbed was exactly the Clavicle Acupuncture Point, and the instant it had been grabbed, he felt two swirling cones of Heavenly Energy invading his Acupuncture Point, and although a large portion of it was blocked off by his energy whirlpool, it still caused his entire shoulder to go numb, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have been thrown so easily.</p><br/><p>As Lin TianAo placed Zhou Weiqing back onto a ground, a figure flashed down, soaring through the air and right into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty!\u201d A cry, full of surprise, yearning, longing and love, and Shangguan Bing\u2019er appeared right in front of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>However, this time, Zhou Weiqing did not dare hug her. Subconsciously, he took a step back, his arms lifted warily in front of him. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to ask why Shangguan Bing\u2019er had treated him like that, he was cut off, staring blankly ahead as he suddenly saw that on the stairs, not far away, there was another \u2018Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019 glaring at him angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha\u2026 Heavens\u2026 Who can tell me what is going on?!\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked helplessly between the two Shangguan Bing\u2019ers, his face muscles twitching.</p><br/><p>The Shangguan Bing\u2019er right in front of him cried out tearily: \u201cSilly Little Fatty, I am your Bing\u2019er! That is my second sister, Shangguan Fei\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stared, jaw agape: \u201cYou\u2026 you really are my Bing\u2019er? How did your parents give birth to you all! You three sisters look so alike\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, both his arms which had been held up guardedly fell down, and Shangguan Bing\u2019er leaped into his embrace, hugging him by the waist tightly.</p><br/><p>That familiar scent, that slightly quivering soft body in his arms, it finally seemed so real at last as Zhou Weiqing slowly tightened his arms around Shangguan Bing\u2019er, muttering to himself: \u201cBing\u2019er\u2026 my Bing\u2019er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a cold voice rang out from beyond: \u201cWhy is it so noisy.\u201d Another white figure appeared at the entrance of the fourth level stairway. Another similar feature, with an icy cold expression \u2013 it was Shangguan Xue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, Bing\u2019er. The three sisters looked exactly alike, and when the three triplets appeared right in front of them, even Lin TianAo had no choice but to stare in shock. In his heart, he muttered to himself: Weiqing getting slapped previously and thrown this time, it was truly not his fault I guess! Perhaps if I were in his shoes, I would have done the same thing.</p><br/><p>Hearing Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s voice, Shangguan Bing\u2019er quickly looked up, a blush tinging her beautiful face, but she could not bear to let go of Zhou Weiqing, leaning into his embrace. Just like him, she had felt the torment of being parted, and having finally seen her Little Fatty once more, how could she bear to leave him so quickly again?</p><br/><p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Xue\u2019er started, her face growing even colder. Turning to Zhou Weiqing she said passively: \u201cI once promised you that if your Fei Li Battle Team managed to enter the top four of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, I would let you see Bing\u2019er. Now, you both have met\u2026 you can leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis\u2026\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er immediately cried out urgently.</p><br/><p>Looking at her, the cold on Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s face actually thawed a little, growing gentler as she said: \u201cBing\u2019er, you are at the critical moment. The Masters have been labouring hard for several days for your sake, in order to help you remould your Physical Jewels, you cannot waste everyone\u2019s effort at this point. Come back in now, the Remoulding Scroll is almost complete now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er held Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands, not wanting to leave.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er furrowed her brow slightly, saying: \u201cCome on Bing\u2019er, we have to go. How about this, let him wait here, and when you finish remoulding your Physical Jewels, you can come back out here and chat with him. Just be sure to return to the Palace at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her words, Shangguan bing\u2019er was overjoyed, smiling happily as she said: \u201cThanks Big Sis. Little Fatty, you wait here for me okay, I\u2019ll be right back here as soon as I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing held her hands stubbornly, saying: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er started, but Shangguan Xue\u2019er said coldly: \u201cIf you want the best for her, you better let go of her. The Remoulding Scroll can only be used on the instant it is created, and it will allow Bing\u2019er\u2019s Physical Jewels to be cleansed, remoulded and wiped to a clean slate, so she can Consolidate them again.</p><br/><p>Hearing Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s words, although he was still in an emotional state, Zhou Weiqing was greatly surprised. Remould Physical Jewels? Was that even possible? Weren\u2019t Physical Jewels fixed forever once they had been Consolidated?!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked pleadingly at Zhou Weiqing, saying: \u201cLittle Fatty, we have troubled so many people and spent so much in order to help me Remould my Physical Jewels, I cannot waste all the effort of these Masters. Just wait for me a while, I will be back as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how much he did not want her to leave, Zhou Weiqing could not allow Shangguan Bing\u2019er to lose such an opportunity. Without question, with the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace wealth, after Remoulding her Physical Jewels, Bing\u2019er would be able to Consolidate top quality Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, likely God Tier ones, or even a Legendary Set! Shangguan Tianyue loved his daughters so much, and especially so for Shangguan Bing\u2019er, who he felt he had let down for so many years, and he would definitely do all he could to give her the very best.</p><br/><p>Thinking about all that, he finally let go of his hands unwillingly.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er blushed as she tip toed closer to him, giving him a light kiss on his face before running lightly up the steps again.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er glared coldly at Zhou Weiqing before turning back inside again, and only Shangguan Fei\u2019er remained outside.</p><br/><p>The white-clad guards who had stopped Zhou Weiqing and Lin TianAo were now looking upon him with a different look, mostly curiosity. They were all guessing who this youth was, who had kissed both Second and Third Miss!</p><br/><p>Seeing that her Big Sis and Little Sis had left, Shangguan Fei\u2019er gritted her teeth as she glared at Zhou Weiqing. \u201cZhou Lttle Fatty, you dared to steal my first kiss, you\u2019re dead now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said with a wronged look on his face: \u201cCan I be blamed for that?! Besides my mum and dad, only Bing\u2019er ever calls me Little Fatty. Who asked you all to look exactly alike, and you also called me by that name, how could I guess it wasn\u2019t Bing\u2019er? Furthermore, you already stomped on my foot and threw me back, we should be even now right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s beautiful big eyes glared angrily at him, as she looked at him in surprise, saying: \u201cEven?! You stole this young lady\u2019s first kiss, and you think we\u2019re even so easily? Dream on! Even if you are third sis\u2019 boyfriend, I will still torture you until you are begging for death, if not I will not be called Shangguan Fei\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s not a good thing, after all you are Bing\u2019er\u2019s sister, if we are playing around in bed until I\u2019m begging to die, ahh\u2026 such an awesome feeling\u2026 but that would be letting Bin\u2019er down! Even if Bing\u2019er won\u2019t blame me, I would feel terrible in my heart! After all, I am a gentleman! Do not think that just because you look like Bing\u2019er, I will fall in love with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er was totally shocked into silence by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s teasing. From young, she had been notorious as the mischievous young miss of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and no one could do anything about her, as she became known as the Little Devil Girl. When she pranked any of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace disciples, how could they possibly dare retort or retaliate? Yet, this fellow in front of her had taken advantage of her, and still dared to retort back. All of a sudden, she felt a strange sense of freshness, a novel feeling that she had not experienced before, and she was surprised to find that some of her anger had dissipated.</p><br/><p>Her eyes swirling, a cunning plot came to her mind, and she pointed at Zhou Weiqing and said: \u201cFine, Zhou Weiqing, you just wait. Remember your words to me today, and you\u2019ll live to regret it, I await the day you beg for my forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said with a serious look on his face: \u201cThat\u2019s no problem! As long as you say \u2013 \u2018I want more\u2019, I will likely be begging for forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just having to watch his Bing\u2019er leave his side, Zhou Weiqing was already in a bad mood. Furthermore, he did not have any favourable impression of Shangguan Tianyue or Shangguan Xue\u2019er, and with Shangguan Fei\u2019er provoking him now, how could he possibly stay quiet and still be Zhou Weiqing? In terms of glibness, how could Shangguan Fei\u2019er be a match for him?</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er was so angry that she was almost shivering: \u201cToday Bing\u2019er is nearby, and I won\u2019t argue with you further. You just wait! Hmph!\u201d As she said that, she turned and left.</p>\n</div>"}

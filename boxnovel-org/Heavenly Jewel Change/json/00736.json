I\u2019ve asked him why he did what he did. He said he didn\u2019t know why but he didn\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Dongfang Yue inhaled forcefully and deeply, her eyes were already wet. \u201cEveryone, you\u2019re right. He came here with an ulterior motive. He came here for the Spatial Teleportation Stone. However, did he hurt us in any way? No. On the contrary, he saved every one of us. And what are we doing? We\u2019re suspecting him, and we even thought about dealing with him forcefully. I can\u2019t do something like this. Moreover, I\u2019ve already given him the stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her final sentence, all four Supreme Elders widened their eyes in disbelief. Dongfang screeched, \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve given him the Spatial Teleportation Stone? Hanyue, how could you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue retorted calmly, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I? I\u2019m still the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master. According to the rules of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, the Palace Master has the power to utilize all the resources in the Palace. Have you considered this, how old is Zhou Weiqing? Plus, he\u2019s not like us. We obtained our strength through legacy. He started from scratch, cultivating his strength through talent alone. Yes, he\u2019s from the Boundless Mainland, and he\u2019ll one day go home. However, is it more important to befriend someone who\u2019s fated to advance to Heavenly God tier or is the Spatial Teleportation Stone that only has a few more uses left more important? I\u2019d like to befriend him. Who knows, he may be of help to us in the future. But then you went and capture Shangguan Bing\u2019er, wasting all my efforts. Maybe I\u2019ll never be able to convince you, but it\u2019ll be the same the other way around. I rather resign as Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master than participate in your schemes against Zhou Weiqing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her gaze had already turned sharp, \u201cLastly, Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t want my Spatial Teleportation Stone for free. He had bestowed me with a portion of the miraculous Saint Energy. I have an instinct, with this incredible power, the bottleneck I was stuck at from inheriting Father\u2019s Heavenly Energy will no longer be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was speaking, Dongfang Hanyue stood and left indignantly. She needed to have a conversation with Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Seeing Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s departure, all five of the faces turned sour.</p><br/><p>Dongfang sighed, \u201cA grown girl cannot be kept at home! That silly girl, doesn\u2019t she know it\u2019s impossible for them to be together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Water said with a wry smile, \u201cIt looks like we should consider her points as well. We cannot let Zhou Weiqing come between the Palace Master and us. Furthermore, her points are not illogical! Perhaps she has seen the bigger picture.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang was contemplative, \u201cIf Hanyue can advance into Heavenly God tier, a Spatial Teleportation Stone is nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing did not know what had transpired in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. With his Dragon-Tiger Transformation, he traveled in almost a straight line towards the Mysterious Heavenly Palace at maximum speed.</p><br/><p>From afar, the mountain range which the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was built on was already in view. The whole time he was flying, his fury grew stronger and stronger. Not once did he stop trying to get in touch with Shangguan Bing\u2019er but there was no response. The worry in his heart turned into burning rage. To save his love, he would not mind taking on the whole world.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how angry he was, he could not raise his temper against Dongfang Hanyue. Could he sneak into the Mysterious Heavenly Palace? No, that was almost certainly impossible.</p><br/><p>If Mysterious Heavenly Palace held Bing\u2019er captive, they would definitely have thought about him sneaking in to rescue her. With so many powerhouses and the Blackfiend Dragon, it was almost impossible for him to succeed in rescuing her by stealth. Since that was the case, he might as well act arrogantly for once.</p><br/><p>With that thought in mind, Zhou Weiqing was no longer hesitant and he flew towards the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. In his excitement, it felt as if the Saint Energy in his body was boiling over. After all, with his current cultivation, even if he had flown for a long time using Dragon-Tiger Transformation, he still had an abundance of Saint Energy. It did not burden him too much to do so.</p><br/><p>The Mysterious Heavenly Palace appeared in his view from a distance. By the time he saw it, he heard people yelling from below. At least a hundred silhouettes leaped into the air trying to block Zhou Weiqing from approaching.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was not too familiar with the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s fighting power. However, as the only Saint Land in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, how could it not have Anti-Air skills?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stopped in the air and looked down. The ones flying towards him were not only Heavenly Jewel Masters, but their Heavenly Beasts were also with them. The Heavenly Beasts were at different stages of cultivation but they were all strong flying Heavenly Beasts. Even the weakest of them had the cultivation of Zun-stage. All of the Heavenly Jewel Masters had at least five Heavenly Jewels too. It was clear that they rushed in as soon as they noticed Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing hovered silently, allowing the \u201csky warriors\u201d of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace to surround him. He ignored them as he yelled at the Mysterious Heavenly Castle directly, \u201cDongfang Hanyue, come out right now. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being merciless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having filled his Dantian with Qi/energy, his yell, supported by his cultivation base of Nine Heavenly Jewels, fanned out. Some of the flying Heavenly Beasts in front of him were affected and became lopsided. His voice was full of wrath as it echoed throughout the valley and the abyss domineeringly.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Jewel Master who flew toward Zhou Weiqing did not attack immediately. The reason was simple. Among these people, there were those who knew Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had shone brightly at the banquet when he joined the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, surprising all the higher ranked officers. The generals of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s Air Defense had also attended the dinner, so they immediately recognized their Honorary Master.</p><br/><p>What happened to Shangguan Bing\u2019er had been kept a secret by the core members of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. That was why none of them knew about the issue Zhou Weiqing had with the Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonorary Master Zhou, why are you saying things like that? Please calm down,\u201d a Heavenly Jewel Master at the Ninth Jewel cultivation base said gently after he approached Zhou Weiqing and saluted him. At the same time, his eyes were filled with shock upon seeing Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>The wings that appeared with Dragon-Tiger Transformation were spread out behind Zhou Weiqing. There were dark-purplish dragon tattoos on his skin and it gave him an authoritative aura. More importantly, Zhou Weiqing did not hide the number of his Heavenly Jewels. Nine on each arm! This was such a huge leap from the five Heavenly Jewels at the banquet. How could it not astonish the powerhouses in front of him?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said, \u201cThis is none of your business. As long as you stay out of my way, I will not hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The general was speechless. He thought, \u2018We have over a hundred people here, and each of us is supported by our Heavenly Beasts. Even if you have Nine Jewels, there\u2019s only one of you. How are you going to hurt us?\u2019</p><br/><p>Even though that was what he thought, he did not dare to order an attack. Who knew what happened to Honorary Master Zhou? If this was only a misunderstanding, and they hurt him, what would the higher-ups say? Not to mention, Honorary Master Zhou was a God Tier Master. Was there anyone who did not want to get some benefits from him!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s yell clearly worked. From within the Mysterious Heavenly Castle, at least ten Heavenly Jewel Masters came out. With their entourage in tow, Dongfang and the four Supreme Elders walked out.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing stared at the people of the Mysterious Heavenly Castle, his face fell, and his fury grew even stronger. \u2018Dongfang Hanyue is unwilling to come and see me? Is she feeling guilty or something?\u2019 He thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonorary Master Zhou, please come down. Let us have a talk,\u201d Dongfang who was wearing a mask waved at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing landed he was followed by the whole army of sky warriors. He stood facing Dongfang, who was in front of the entrance of Mysterious Heavenly Castle, and said coldly across the abyss, \u201cAre you the real Palace Master or the impostor? I will speak with whoever has the authority.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang frowned, \u201cHonorary Master Zhou, please calm down. We\u2019re very glad that you\u2019re back after the disaster, and we\u2019re very grateful for your aid at the critical moment. What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned brightly, \u201cYou\u2019re grateful for my aid? Is that so? If so, what about my wife? Where is she? The way you repay my kindness is to lock her up, isn\u2019t it? Let me tell you something. If Bing\u2019er loses so much as a single strand of hair, I\u2019ll rain blood onto the Mysterious Heavenly Castle today, completely erasing Mysterious Heavenly Palace from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s speech angered Dongfang so much she almost lost it. She had already discussed with the four Supreme Elders. For her daughter\u2019s sake, and also because they thought Dongfang Hanyue had a point, they had decided to mend things with Zhou Weiqing. After all, the Spatial Teleportation Stone had already been given to him. If Zhou Weiqing were to abandon Shangguan Bing\u2019er, not only would they be unable to catch up to him, they would have made an enemy out of a future peerless powerhouse. It would be best if they returned Shangguan Bing\u2019er to him, patch things up, and allow him to leave. He had to return to the Boundless Mainland anyway. Even if he wreaked havoc over there, it would not affect them here in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing had been so arrogant ever since his return. Dongfang was not the real Palace Master but she was still the second-in-command in Mysterious Heavenly Palace. In the years she had held that position, when was she ever reprimanded so bluntly? Not even Dongfang Hanyue dared to do so!</p><br/><p>Even though she was shocked at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s knowledge of Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s captivity, her temper was also riled up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if you have enormous talent. It\u2019s still just talent. A kid like you who has not even achieved Heavenly King tier, how dare you say that you want to rain blood onto the Mysterious Heavenly Palace?\u2019 She thought.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

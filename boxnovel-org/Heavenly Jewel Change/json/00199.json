(2)</b></p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s hands were still in his grasp, and her eyes were currently closed. Her skin was dim, almost dark, and her life force was unbelievably weak, and continuously dropping down. Her Heavenly Energy was almost fully drained. It was clear that under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Devour Skill, Tian\u2019er was on the verge of death.</p><br/><p><i>Oh no! Not good! </i>Cold sweat streamed down Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back as fear and shock overwhelmed him. Subconsciously, he circulated his own Heavenly Energy, surrounding the fresh new drop of silvery white liquid, forcing it into his mouth. At the same time, he pulled Tian\u2019er into his embrace, lowering his head and giving her a kiss on her pale red lips.</p><br/><p>Just like that, the drop of liquid passed through their lips into Tian\u2019er\u2019s mouth, and a strange spectacle occurred next. Standing at the side, Shangguan Xue\u2019er could only stare with her jaw agape as she watched the two kiss, and from their mouths, an utterly pure form of energy seemed to diffuse all around, instantly engulfing Tian\u2019er within. She could clearly see a faint light shine forth, starting from Tian\u2019er\u2019s head, slowly moving down. Within moments, her entire body was glowing, and a large Heavenly Energy reverberation began. All the Heavenly Energy and life force that Tian\u2019er had lost seemed to return, and her eyes began to open\u2026 filled with surprise and shock.</p><br/><p>The whirlpool in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body continued spinning, continuing to draw upon his and Tian\u2019er\u2019s original Heavenly Energy\u2026 and as it spun\u2026 more drops of the white liquid continued to be generated.</p><br/><p>Slowly, Zhou Weiqing began to get the hang of it. He would leave one drop of the white liquid for himself, one drop to Tian\u2019er, and so on\u2026 In this way, an intriguing but marvelous loop began.</p><br/><p>At the side, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had a totally different sensation. All the energy aside, in her eyes, all she saw was Zhou Weiqing holding onto Tian\u2019er, their bodies pressed against each other. Every once in awhile, Zhou Weiqing would lean forward to kiss Tian\u2019er deeply.</p><br/><p>The strangest thing was that everytime they kissed, a brilliant light would appear around Tian\u2019er, as if the precious light of treasure. Originally, Tian\u2019er was already a great beauty, and each time that happened, it was as if she was evolving, her beauty shining forth even more, even her skin purifying. Looking at that, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was not only shocked, but also slightly envious.</p><br/><p>How are they doing that? Wasn\u2019t it the Devour Skill? How did it end up like this?</p><br/><p>As the process continued, the amount of the silvery white liquid in Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s bodies grew steadily, and their original Heavenly Energy also continued dropping.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er had cultivated together with the four Saint Attributes fusion so many times before, but this was the first time something like this had occurred.</p><br/><p>In the past, when the cultivated together, they would release their Heavenly Energy, allowing the four Saint Attributes to gather between or above them. In that way, the Saint Attributes would begin to spin and form the whirlpool, drawing in energy. As their Heavenly Energy slowly increased, it would be drawn back into their bodies and made their own.</p><br/><p>Such a cultivation technique, it was already far faster than if they were to cultivate individually and separately. However, this strange silvery white liquid had never appeared before!</p><br/><p>In this moment, a vague understanding slowly came to Zhou Weiqing. The profound secret should be the difference between the fusion occuring outside the body and within the body.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, the current situation happening in his body was the truest form of the cultivation with the four Saint Attributes. Furthermore, he guessed that the true key to this miraculous event was not the Devour Skill, but the life force of both of them fused together.</p><br/><p>The Devour Skill had only been the tool to bring all of their energies together into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body to form such a new whirlpool. When their life forces had joined together due to the Devour Skill, they had also fused together to join into the four Saint Attributes fusion. Under such a circumstance, the fusion of the four Saint Attributes had been ignited, causing such a miraculous chain reaction.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s guess was pretty accurate, but still incomplete. As he had imagined, when the four Saint Attributes gathered together, life force was the key to activating and igniting the change. However, at the same time, it was also due to the fact that when the four Saint Attributes fused outside of their bodies, it would draw in all forms of energy from the atmosphere. At that time, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er had thought it was naturally a good thing to draw in the atmospheric energy\u2026 after all, it could only be a boost right?</p><br/><p>However, the truth was actually the reverse.</p><br/><p>The four Saint Attributes were the highest quality Attributes in the world, and within them was a vast potential and miraculous force. When they fused together, how could they require the addition of other weaker and mixed energies? All they needed was absolute purity, not additional quantity of other unnecessary energies. When they were fully purified, the four Saint Attributes would grow in synergy, interpromoting reciprocally and having mutual generation, resulting in a all around growth and evolving.</p><br/><p>Currently, the four Saint Attribute fusion was right in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, and it was a strangely favourable condition endowed by nature\u2026 with the Dragon Tiger Transformation, his body had a natural pure XianTian or primordial force. This was something that the four Saint Attributes needed. Furthermore, within his body, as they gathered an spun, they would not come into contact or draw in the various mixed atmospheric energies that were full of other impurities. Under such a circumstance, with the mix of Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s life forces, only then had the true profound secret of the four Saint Attributes been revealed.</p><br/><p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s luck was truly good. If not for all of these unique circumstances coming into play, perhaps in their entire lives they would never discover this profound secret.</p><br/><p>By going through this process, not only was their entire Heavenly Energy going through a fresh round of purification and refining, it was also going through the evolving of the four Saint Attributes fusion. In this manner, their original Heavenly Energy without going through their Elemental Jewels, had not transformed into the purest energy in the world, with the aura of the four Saint Attribute fusion energy. This was truly the purest form of energy in the world that any Heavenly Jewel Master could have.</p><br/><p>A human\u2019s DanTian had its limits, and before reaching the Heavenly King stage, this limit would not be broken. As for the Heavenly King Stage? This was actually one of the greatest bottlenecks of this stage. Only when one was able to break past this major limiting factor, transforming their energy to a whole different level, only then would a Heavenly Jewel Master be able to reach the next stage. However, the size of the DanTian and the Ki Ocean would not change. That was to say, even for a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, besides having his meridians and internal organs stronger and more flexible, his \u2018load bearing\u2019 and capacity was actually no different from an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>Although their meridians were widened, there was definitely a limit, and it was impossible for it to continually widen forever. If that really happened, wouldn\u2019t the person just explode?</p><br/><p>Now, this silvery white liquid that Zhou Weiqing had formed from this round of cultivation was totally different. The inherent energy held within was more than ten times that of the Heavenly Energy liquid of the same level. That was to say, Zhou Weiqing could store more than ten times the energy in his body. Furthermore, that was a qualitative change, not that he had compressed the energy. This would mean both he and Tian\u2019er, when compared to a Heavenly Jewel Master of the same level, their energy purity and density was far stronger than anyone, and their sustainability would be on a whole new level. Furthermore, once they could enter the Heavenly King Stage, that would be yet another concept altogether. The true profound secret of the four Saint Attribute would only come into play fully then, and the future benefits it would bring them was not something they could even dream about now, far beyond the limits of their mortal comprehension.</p><br/><p>Time passed, seconds and minutes. Nearly an entire day and night passed before all their Heavenly Energy had been fully refined and transformed.</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Xue\u2019er was rather envious and even jealous, she still kept guard by their side. She knew that such unique opportunities were few and far between for any Heavenly Jewel Master, and once they missed it, it would be a regret that they would have to live with forever. Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s cultivation level did not seem to have much changes, but the aura and presence they gave off, it was as if they had been born anew.</p><br/><p>Finally, the last bits of their Heavenly Energy entered the whirlpool, and the last drop of silvery white liquid formed.</p><br/><p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er both had the feeling like their DanTian and meridians were so empty. The originally feeling of being filled with energy had disappeared, and all they had within each of them was a mere over twenty drops of that silvery white liquid. Even then, they could sense that their total amount of Heavenly Energy was actually more than previously. Although it was all contained within that twenty plus drops of liquid, it was without a doubt their inherent energy was terrifying. The strangest thing was that it was not a condensed or compressed form as well, and they did not need to focus on controlling it.</p><br/><p>The whirlpool slowly dissipated silently. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing also discovered something else strange. That was\u2026 despite the sheer power of his Devour Skill, it was unable to draw anything from Tian\u2019er\u2019s body any longer. That was to say, the silvery white liquid Heavenly Energy was totally immune from his Devour Skill.</p><br/><p>Towards this point, Zhou Weiqing was rather pleasantly surprised. It was without question that the silvery white Heavenly Energy was on a whole different level, not something that any existing cultivation technique could cultivate or refine. After this strange cultivation process, a whole new door had been opened to both him and Tian\u2019er, and they were slowly starting to realise the true potential of the four Saint Attributes.</p><br/><p>The Devour Skill also stopped at last, as the whirlpool within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body finally stopped. The cultivation of the two of them had also finally stopped after an entire day and night. Tian\u2019er had also been kissed so many times by Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>In truth, during the cultivation, as the time passed and it reached the later stages, the time between the production of each drop of the silvery white liquid began to take longer and longer time. In Zhou Weiqing\u2019s senses, it was due to the fact that their \u2018raw materials\u2019 were running out, thus the cultivation speed had also slowed dramatically. However, despite that, before the entire process was complete, how could Zhou Weiqing bear to stop? Who knew if there would be a future chance like this, and if he passed it up, they might regret it in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er, come here a while.\u201d After ending this round of cultivation, that was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first words.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing with brimming with energy and almost radiant in complexion, Shangguan Xue\u2019er who was extremely tired started momentarily, but she still walked towards him.</p><br/><p>Just as Shangguan Xue\u2019er reached Zhou Weiqing, in that instant, Zhou Weiqing suddenly grabbed hold of her waist without warning, lowering his head to give her a kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuuu\u2026\u201d Facing such a sudden intimate violation, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was caught off guard, embarrassed fully. If it had just been her and Zhou Weiqing, perhaps she would not have resisted, or not struggled so much. However, Tian\u2019er was right there! With her character, how could she not be embarrassed?</p><br/><p>However, before she could struggle too violently, she suddenly realised that a shameless scoundrel had actually stuck his tongue into her mouth.</p><br/><p>Filled with sudden anger, Shangguan Xue\u2019er bit down onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s tongue.</p><br/><p>In shock and pain, Zhou Weiqing quickly withdrew his tongue. \u201cAiiiiyaaa, that hurts! Xue\u2019er, what are you doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tongue was perhaps one of the weakest spots in the entire human body, and having it bitten, how could it feel good? Furthermore, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had been in a state of anger and embarrassment, and that bite had been stronger than she realised.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

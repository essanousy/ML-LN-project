Along the way, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er followed the shortest path and left Zhongtian Empire to head to Mi Ou Empire. They did not stop to rest as they rode all the way past Ocean Blue City, Coast Stout Town and East Frontier Ocean of Mi Ou Empire.</p><br/><p>For nearly 20 days, even though they were constantly on the road, Zhou Weiqing was not idle at all.</p><br/><p>Using this period of time, he gradually merged the strength that he gained in the luster Spatial Realm to his body and changed it to entirely his. Apart from that, he also discovered that even though he had not been cultivating since his stint in the luster Spatial Realm, the regeneration of his Saint Energy no longer needed to be cultivated. At the moment, it was absorbing the Atmospheric Energy in the sky through the regeneration process to supplement his own body. On top of that, the Saint Energy was further strengthening his body and through this process, the Saint Energy in his body was slowly solidifying. Zhou Weiqing could vaguely feel that all he needed to do was to accumulate the energy in his body in order to solidify a Saint Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>The two of them bought a massive amount of food and drinking water in Ocean Blue City and put them all in a Spatial Ring that had a silver gemstone on it. The ring was one of the treasures Zhou Weiqing obtained from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. When he saw the pained look on Tianyang\u2019s face, he thought to himself, \u201cIsn\u2019t this just a plain ring? The Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace is so rich and powerful. Why does he look so unwilling to part with this one tiny ring?\u201d</p><br/><p>But the moment he infused his Saint Energy into it, he finally understood why the Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace acted that way.</p><br/><p>The Spatial Ring was called Sumeru. The space inside of the ring was so enormous that it was even large enough to hold a mountain. In short, if it was used as a granary, it could support an army of 100,000 troops for six continuous months without other external supply. The ring itself was a confined space, an absolute vacuum. For this reason, the food stored inside would not go rotten.</p><br/><p>Any object could become an artifact after it had reached its capacity and functionality limit. Of course, the same went for the Sumeru Ring as well. It was impossible to find another Spatial Ring in the entire Boundless Mainland that was on par with this ring. Besides, it was obvious that once this object had fallen into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand, it would pretty much impossible to pry it away from his hands. That was why Shangguan Tianyang had looked so unwilling when he was giving the ring to him. However, the reason Zhou Weiqing was going to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland was for the sake of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and the ring was nothing compared to the survival of the Heavenly Jewel Island. After all, nobody knew how long it would take for them to sail the sea. With the ring, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er could wander the sea for years and they still would not have to worry about their food supply.</p><br/><p>After they had purchased enough food, drinking water, vegetables and fruits, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er headed to Ocean Blue City and straight to the seashore.</p><br/><p>At the moment, it was late in the evening. The moon was bright and the stars were few. The bright round moon that had its shadow reflected on the sea shone down on the roaring waves, giving off a special kind of tranquility.</p><br/><p>Looking at the endless sea, they could feel their hearts gradually relaxing.</p><br/><p>It was their first time seeing the ocean. They were in awe of the sight.</p><br/><p>Leaning on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shoulder, there was a dazed look in Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s eyes, \u201cThe moon looks so bright! What a beautiful sight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled lightly as he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be sailing for a few months, I\u2019m afraid by that time you won\u2019t find it as beautiful anymore. I wonder how many obstacles are waiting for us up ahead in this huge, vast sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er threw a dirty glance at him, \u201cUrghh, you\u2019re terrible! You don\u2019t know anything about romance at all! Let\u2019s just start our journey now. The sooner we start, the sooner we can go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head. Standing there enjoying the sea breeze that had a tang of saltiness, a gleam flashed on the Sumeru Ring on his finger before a peculiar object dropped with a \u2018thud\u2019 in front of them.</p><br/><p>Under the brilliance of the moonlight, the object emitted a hazy white light from the reflection of the moonlight.</p><br/><p>The object was about 7 meters wide, with the two ends tipped and the center round. The object was completely transparent, like a jujube pit that was carved out of a giant clear crystal. On the surface of that jujube pit, special patterns were carved on them. The carvings looked like some peculiar sea monsters that both Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er had never seen before.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could not help but be fascinated with the object. Even if he did not know the function of that thing, the appearance was more than enough to enchant a person into a trance. It was just too damn beautiful! Even a Heavenly King\u2019s full strength would not cause a dent or scratch on this thing. One could imagine how terrifyingly tough the object was.</p><br/><p>The two ends of the structure were as sharp as a needle. Circles of screw mark could be vaguely seen hidden in the structure. In fact, some of the internal structure could be vaguely seen as well from the surface. Unfortunately, due to the refraction of light, the internal structures could not be seen clearly.</p><br/><p>It was Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s first time sailing out to the sea. They had no guidance and no experience in traveling by sea. So, how did Shangguan Tianyang managed to sleep at ease letting those two inexperienced people cross tens of thousands of miles across the ocean? Well, it was all thanks to these gadgets.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing flipped his wrist. A small crystal suddenly appeared in his palm. This crystal was octagonal with thousands and thousands of transversal surface on it. Under the moonlight, it appeared to be twinkling lustrously and brilliantly with splendor.</p><br/><p>Looking at Bing\u2019er, Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cLet us see how good this Neptune Shuttle is. Your uncle has high praises for this thing. He even told me to return it to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace after we\u2019re done using it. How stingy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er was speechless, \u201cCome on! Don\u2019t be so greedy! Since Uncle has this much high praise for it, it means that the Neptune Shuttle must be quite extraordinary!\u201d</p><br/><p>A streak of Heavenly Energy flew out from his hand into the crystal. At once, a golden light illuminated Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands. In just an instant, the golden light enveloped the entire Neptune Shuttle. With a loud crisp \u2018Ding\u201d, in the center of the golden-lit Neptune, a fully transparent crystal lid slowly lifted upwards.</p><br/><p>The lid was about 2.5 meters long. The entire time when the lid was opened, there was no sound at all and no Heavenly Energy ripple could be felt. Curious, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er extended their heads to have a better look and they could see that there were only 4 seats inside the Neptune. Every seat was wide and comfortable and they were also made of the same transparent crystal. Other than that, nothing else stood out.</p><br/><p>Slightly disappointed, Zhou Weiqing sighed, \u201cT-That\u2019s all? He wants us to travel across the ocean in this little thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er chimed in, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t really have to use it. Both of us can fly. We just need a place to rest every once in a while. I think we can use this as a resting place when we\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, \u201cHow can it be so easy crossing the vast ocean? How are we supposed to differentiate the directions when we are flying? How are we supposed to know where the hell that Mysterious Heavenly Mainland is? As the saying goes, a miss is as good as a mile. Your uncle told me that the map has been uploaded into the boat. Let us just go in and have a look first.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was saying that, he leaped and quickly entered the Neptune Shuttle.</p><br/><p>The crystal seat gave off a cooling sensation when he sat on it. The seat was a little too big for him, even his big-sized body was unable to fill up the seat completely. When Bing\u2019er sat on the large seat she appeared even more petite.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing inserted the crystal in his hand into the groove in front of him according to Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s instruction. However, nothing happened even when the crystal was inserted. Even the lid was still wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould this thing be broken because it\u2019s not been used for such a long time?\u201d Zhou Weiqing mumbled miserably.</p><br/><p>A gleam flashed in Bing\u2019er\u2019s eyes, \u201cSince this is used in the ocean, should we push this into the water and see?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took back the crystal, \u201cAlright, then you sit here. I\u2019ll push it into the water.\u201d Then, he descended from the Neptune and started to push from behind.</p><br/><p>In Zhou Weiqing\u2019s opinion, with his strength, the Neptune would be directly thrust into the sea with just a push. To his surprise, the Neptune only moved a foot after his strong push. It was far heavier than he expected. In truth, his energy had at least a force of 500 kg. However, the average looking shuttle only moved a little on the soft sandy beach.</p><br/><p>S-So heavy? Zhou Weiqing was surprised. Transmitting his power to both of his arms, he shouted out loud, \u201cHAH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, the Neptune Shuttle was pushed into the sea under his might. With his push, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that the weight of the Neptune was at least 1500 kg. After all, with his cultivation base being upgraded to the Ninth Jewel Level, he was not quite sure how strong he had become.</p><br/><p>The moment the Neptune entered the sea, it did not sink even though it was heavy. Instead, only half of its body sunk in and the other half remained above water with its lid wide open. However, Zhou Weiqing could see the difference. When the Neptune came in contact with the water, the body started to emit a layer of blue light, giving it a sense of dreaminess in the darkness.</p><br/><p>Once again, Zhou Weiqing leaped into the shuttle. This time, when he placed the octagonal crystal into the groove, a peculiar scene started to unfold in front of his eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>The lid started to close and the second the lid was completely shut, the interior of the Neptune turned bright.</p><br/><p>Multiple dazzling blue lights outlined the interior of the Neptune. The crystal screen in front of them suddenly became clear, magnifying everything outside so that the view would be clearer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er could not help but exclaimed when she saw the blue glow. No girl would not like such a beautiful scene.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s interest differed from Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s interest. When the lid closed, he realized that the Neptune Shuttle immediately started to stabilize. It was as if the huge waves had no effect on it at all, the Neptune remained steadfast and unfaltering.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a round crystal ball rose up slowly between the armrest of their seats. It was at exactly where Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand was positioned, allowing him to place his palm comfortably on the ball.</p><br/><p>Smart as he was, Zhou Weiqing immediately knew what he had to do. After attempting to diffuse part of his Saint Energy into the crystal ball beneath his palm, the surrounding suddenly showed a series of changes again.</p><br/><p>The blue light in the cabin dimmed down but everything outside seemed to light up at once. Looking through the crystal cabin, the outside seemed as bright as daytime. Everything was so clear and visible. It did not seem like it was because of the lights. Instead, it seemed to be some sort of special unique ray transformation</p><br/><p>After that, something even more bizarre happened. A helmet-like thing gradually descended from above them, enveloping Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head. Immediately afterward, changes could be felt on the crystal seats. As if it was alive, it slowly converged and covered their bodies. It felt like they were completely embedded in the seats.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Zhou Weiqing was completely amazed by the Neptune. No wonder Shangguan Tianyang insisted that he return this object to him. Zhou Weiqing had no idea how the shuttle was built but if it was also equipped with speed, then, it would definitely be classified as an artifact.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a strange ripple in the cold helmet suddenly jolted Zhou Weiqing out of his amazement. After that, he was surprised to find that his own consciousness had grown. There seemed to be a peculiar kind of spiritual ripple in the helmet that could connect and merge itself with his own Spiritual Energy.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing closed his eyes, he could see everything around him more clearly. However, instead of being limited to the view in front of him, he could see the entire outside world. He had a 360-degree panoramic view of the Neptune Shuttle with not a single blind spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoosh\u201d A strange peculiar sense suddenly merged with his Spiritual Energy. He instantly felt like his consciousness became one with the shuttle. When the strange spiritual fluctuation was merging with his body, the profound secret of the Neptune Shuttle was laid bare in his consciousness. It gave him a clear grasp on the use and origins of this shuttle.</p><br/><p>As it turned out, the Neptune Shuttle utilized the hegemon of the ocean to function, the Nucleus Core of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. This Dreadfiend Sea Naga was a Heavenly God tier Heavenly beast, sitting at the top of the ocean\u2019s food chain. The dragon had a gigantic body that\u2019s nearly 1000 meter long. It was even bigger than Hui Yao the dragon and his wife, Duo Si. The Dreadfiend Sea Naga was absolutely invincible in the sea. One could easily imagine the amount of energy stored in its Nucleus Core. When they were trying to build the shuttle, the people on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland had spent an enormous amount of manpower, materials, and resources. First, they had to strip the Heavenly Energy from the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s Nucleus Core before they could begin the forging process. With the collective efforts of numerous smithies, they finally succeeded in building this artifact of the sea. The shuttle originally belonged to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. It was also considered one of the greatest treasures owned by the palace along with the Spatial Teleportation Stone.</p><br/><p>At that time, when the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Palace Master brought his people to the Boundless Mainland, he harbored the intention to conquer the land. But much to his surprise, the Boundless Mainland was far stronger than they had imagined. In the end, they were totally crushed and defeated. It was all thanks to the Spatial Teleportation Stone that they could escape with their lives. As long as there was a set destination, the stone would be able to send the user there no matter the distance. So, the armies fled but unfortunately, the Neptune shuttle fell into the hands of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and became their war trophy. It was because of this, that Zhou Weiqing was able to use it now.</p><br/><p>Since the Neptune shuttle was built with the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, the aura that was emitted from the shuttle was enough to repel most sea creatures. Its body was sturdy and under the Heavenly Energy of a Heavenly Jewel Master, it could sail at a very high speed and it would not have any problems crossing tens of thousand miles of sea.</p><br/><p>Apart from that, the Neptune Shuttle was also equipped with a navigation system. Due to the fact that the Mysterious Heavenly Palace people had recorded a complete sea map into the database when they journeyed to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, the Neptune Shuttle would bring them directly to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland with the help of the shuttle\u2019s GPS system.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! This is indeed a great artifact!\u201d Zhou Weiqing retracted his Saint Energy and the helmet on his head retracted as well. Without explaining anything, he changed places with Bing\u2019er and asked her to infuse her Heavenly Energy so she could experience what he had just experienced.</p><br/><p>Everyone would be extremely curious about new things, the same went for young people like them. Once again, they exchanged positions and activated the sea map. While Zhou Weiqing was enjoying the sensation of being enveloped by the world outside with his 360-degree view, he infused part of his Saint Energy and activated the shuttle according to the instructions that he received.</p><br/><p>He realized that the moment he infused his Saint Energy into the crystal, the energy was instantly magnified by the Neptune shuttle. THAT was the powerful effect of the Heavenly God tier Heavenly Beast\u2019s Nucleus Core. A streak of light blue flame suddenly burst out from behind the Neptune like a tail and propelled the shuttle forward like a missile, disappearing into the deep ocean.</p><br/><p>As the Neptune Shuttle drilled into the sea, the surrounding scenery was still very clear. Because of the shuttle\u2019s special feature, even if the sea was dark and gloomy, Zhou Weiqing could see as far as 1km and he could even sense things that were further away.</p><br/><p>The seawater did not seem to have any resistance towards the Neptune at all. Under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s domineering Saint Energy, the Neptune\u2019s speed was at its peak, far exceeding the speed of the Horned Ghost Demon Horse.</p><br/><p>What was even odder was the fact that Zhou Weiqing noticed that he did not need to use much of his Saint Energy at all. All he needed to do was infuse it with a small amount of Saint Energy. At the same time, the Atmospheric Energy outside was not blocked by the Neptune Shuttle\u2019s wall. Instead, it became much purer and concentrated after being filtered by the shuttle. The amount that he was absorbing was more than enough to replace the Saint Energy that he was using. The Water attributes in the sea even produced air for the two of them, leaving them with zero chance of hypoxia.</p><br/><p>Under the control of his Spiritual Energy, the Neptune glided like a gigantic fish. Riding in the shuttle gave Zhou Weiqing a feeling of freedom. He was like a kid that had just received a big toy.</p><br/><p>Since the Neptune was sailing entirely under the sea, no matter what was happening above water, it did not affect the speed of their advancement at all. And under the deep ocean, there was no such thing as terrain so they were actually heading directly in a straight line towards the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>After a few tries, Zhou Weiqing discovered that although there were also Heavenly Beasts in the sea, the moment they sensed the aura that was being emitted by the Neptune Shuttle, they would quickly swim away. Occasionally, they would encounter some sea creatures that were slightly slower but the horrifying speed and hard outer shell of the Neptune would directly smash into the creatures, without slowing down at all. Under the scouring seawater, there were no scratches or marks on the shuttle at all.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er were filled with curiosity. Due to the clear view of the Neptune, they enjoyed watching all sorts of sights in the sea. For them, it was something they had never seen or heard of, particularly those weird-looking sea creatures that were colorful and gorgeous. There were all sorts of fishes with different colors swimming and moving in an elegant manner.</p><br/><p>However, as time went by, the novelty gradually subsided and it was replaced with loneliness.</p><br/><p>That was right. The biggest enemy of sailing in the sea was not the marine life, it was the feeling of loneliness.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er would take turns to maneuver the Neptune Shuttle while the other would cultivate as they rest. In this vast ocean, time no longer had any meaning to them. They were constantly moving forward, constantly repeating the same thing over and over again. They had absolutely no idea how far they had traveled.</p><br/><p>Secretly, Zhou Weiqing was actually very relieved that he had brought Bing\u2019er along with him. Otherwise, had he been alone, he would probably become crazy due to the extreme loneliness.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there were two of them and they could at least talk and communicate with each other. Sometimes, when they absolutely could not stand it anymore, they would bring the Neptune up to the surface and get some sunshine as they enjoy the scenery.</p><br/><p>The consumption of Heavenly Energy and Saint Energy was very little but the speed of the Neptune was so fast. However, the journey seemed to have taken a toll on their minds.</p><br/><p>Five days\u2026 Ten days\u2026 Slowly, a month had gone by. Both of them were about to go stir crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, I can\u2019t stand this anymore. How far left to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland?!\u201d Controlling the Neptune, Zhou Weiqing lamented to Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Looking slightly pale, Bing\u2019er shook her head as she smiled bitterly, \u201cWe\u2019ve been at sea for a long time now. It\u2019s too late for us to turn back now. I think we\u2019ve traveled for at least 20,000 miles. Just continue forward, Little Fatty. If you really can\u2019t stand it anymore, let us take a break on the surface. Or maybe you can take a short nap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, let us continue. Sigh, I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m on the verge of breaking down even before we reach the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. It\u2019s a good thing that I have you here with me. If I was alone and had nobody to talk to, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d probably go crazy before I even reach the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Smiling gently, Bing\u2019er took hold of his arm and rubbed it softly. Feeling her gentleness, Zhou Weiqing somehow relaxed a little\u2026</p><br/><p>An endless sea that stretched as far as eyes could see, far off into the distance with no sight of an end. Right now, Zhou Weiqing suddenly understood why people said the ocean was powerful. That was right! Compared to the power of nature, human power was really much too small.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, why don\u2019t we fly in the air for a while? Since the Neptune Shuttle has a GPS system, even if we deviated from our path, it would help us find our way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes twinkled, \u201cThis is a great idea! Our flying speed is much faster than the Neptune. Besides, breathing in fresh air is much better than being confined in this small place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er\u2019s proposal was immediately approved by Zhou Weiqing. He quickly directed the Neptune to the surface and took off the crystal embedded in the Neptune.</p><br/><p>Once the crystal was taken off, the lid would automatically open and the blue light would turn itself off.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing unleashed his Dragon-Tiger Transformation while Bing\u2019er summoned her gigantic Wings of the Wind God. After putting the Neptune Shuttle away, they leaped up and flew at the same time.</p><br/><p>The feeling of the air blowing on their faces freshened and lifted their mood instantly. Bathing under the bright sun, both of them felt much at ease. Both of them exchanged glances before speeding up and flying away.</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was at Nine Jewels, when it came to the speed of flying, Bing\u2019er was not inferior to him. After all, her Wings of the Wind God was formed by the combination of four pieces of Deity Master Level Consolidating Equipment Set. When it came to flying, no other equipment was a match for her wings.</p><br/><p>Although the Neptune\u2019s speed was amazing, it still could not compare to flying. Leaving two residual images behind, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er continued flying, the sea flowing past continually under their feet.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gazed into the distance. Still, all he could see was the water that stretched endlessly to the horizon. The Mysterious Heavenly Mainland was still far in the distance. However, now that he had changed his traveling method, he was feeling a little relaxed.</p><br/><p>Right now, they were flying across the deepest part of the ocean. The sea was dark blue in color and there seemed to be no life in the endless sea, not even a bird could be seen in the air. There were no clouds in the blue skies, and below their feet were choppy and rough waves.</p><br/><p>As they were flying, a ray of light suddenly appeared in front of them without warning.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing froze for a moment before he quickly called out to Bing\u2019er. Instantly, both of them slowed down.</p><br/><p>As he watched closely, he discovered a rainbow appearing in the far distance. The beautiful colors caught his attention instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rainbow, let\u2019s go have a look,\u201d Zhou Weiqing exclaimed joyfully. After more than a month of loneliness, the two of them were easily excited. They were in need of something different to lift up their moods.</p><br/><p>A huge stream of water sprayed out from the sea before it crashed down into the sea again in a parabolic curve. That was how rainbows were formed. What made their blood boiled even more excitedly was the sight of a large ship not far away from the huge water column.</p><br/><p>Back in Mi Ou Empire, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er had come across a few ships but compared to the one in front of them, those were like tiny ants. What was more important was the fact that a ship would mean there are humans on board. Nobody could imagine how happy they were being able to lay eyes on their own species again.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, the ship seemed to have met with some kind of troubles. Rays of light were shooting out non stop from the large ship to the sea. At the same time, the water that was spouting out of the sea seemed to be aiming at the ship as well.</p><br/><p>On the large ship, a layer of shimmering light enveloped the deck, protecting it from the water that was shooting at it. Still, the ship seemed to be a little unstable as it was constantly rocking about as if it was going to capsize at any given moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve encountered a Heavenly Beast,\u201d Zhou Weiqing exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er quickly asked, \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chuckling, he answered, \u201cOf course we should rescue them. Bing\u2019er, we\u2019re going to be free soon! Since there\u2019s a ship here, then this must mean that we\u2019re not far away from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland!\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er had kind of underestimated the speed of the Neptune Shuttle. This thing was known as an artifact of the sea and its speed was far faster than ordinary ships. Although they had only been traveling for a month plus, they had already sailed at least 30,000 miles. Right now, just as Zhou Weiqing had said, they were indeed very close to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the Neptune Shuttle, they would probably need thrice the time to reach the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. After all, with the shuttle\u2019s navigation, they did not have to take any detours at all.</p><br/><p>At this moment, all of a sudden the sea\u2019s surface started churning, a deep blue light rushed up from around the massive water column and transformed gradually into a deep blue halo before charging towards the ship. At the same time, a huge head emerged from under the sea.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er were still in the air so they had first class seats to the scene that was unfolding in front of their eyes. The both of them could not help but gasp when they saw the Heavenly Beast.</p><br/><p>That Heavenly Beast was humongous. Just the head itself had a diameter of at least 50 meters. The beast was an enormous, gigantic turtle. As it lifted its head, the huge shell floated up to the surface as well. It looked like a small island in the middle of the ocean.</p><br/><p>The thick water column was actually water that it was spitting out of its mouth. The gigantic turtle seemed to have lost its patience as deep blue halos continued to bombard the ship. The shimmering protective luster seemed to be dimming and signs of damage began to show on it.</p><br/><p>The beast was at least at the Heavenly King level. Although Zhou Weiqing had never fought against a Heavenly sea creature before, with his fighting experience, he could vaguely determine its strength from its Heavenly Energy ripple.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, shall we go help?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding his head, Zhou Weiqing replied, \u201cLet\u2019s go then. But, we can\u2019t fly there. After all, as the saying goes, \u2018when we\u2019re talking to strangers, it\u2019s wise to be somewhat reserved.\u2019 It\u2019s better if we don\u2019t show our cards yet. Let\u2019s go! Let\u2019s go into the water!\u201d Having said that, he took out the Neptune Shuttle again and leaped inside it together with Bing\u2019er. When Zhou Weiqing inserted the crystal, the Neptune plunged into the water instantly.</p><br/><p>After a month of controlling the shuttle, Zhou Weiqing was now familiar with the operation. Under his maneuver, it sped up like a lightning towards the scene of the accident.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was due to the aura that was being emitted by the Neptune Shuttle, without warning, the gigantic turtle paused in its action before diving again into the water as it looked towards Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>A sneer could be seen playing on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lips. The Neptune was not just a simple sea carrier. It was also equipped with combat ability.</p><br/><p>With his Chi torrent running wildly through the 36 major Death Acupuncture Points, enormous Saint Energy gushed out of his hands and he quickly injected it into the shuttle.</p><br/><p>The Neptune Shuttle that was emitting a faint blue glow instantly turned into a silverish white color. The soft silverish light illuminated a big area under the sea. In the next second, a silverish white beam shot out straight at the head of the gigantic turtle.</p><br/><p>This gigantic turtle could also be considered as one of the hegemons in the sea. Being able to cultivate to such a huge size meant that he was already partially in the Heavenly Emperor level of a Heavenly Beast. However, in terms of cultivation base and the tiers of vessels, it was still much weaker compared to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the instance it sensed the aura of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, it was terrified to death as it quickly plunged back into the sea. However, when it laid its eyes on the Neptune shuttle, it felt a little skeptical. After all, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was extremely enormous but the thing in front of him was just a tiny little thing. Just as it was doubting itself, Zhou Weiqing had already unleashed an attack.</p><br/><p>Through the boost of the Neptune Shuttle, the Saint Energy\u2019s explosive power was easily ten times more than its usual power. It was a good thing that the shuttle could only be used in the sea. Otherwise, with the help of this artifact, Zhou Weiqing could even challenge a Heavenly Emperor-tier master with it.</p><br/><p>The enormous silverish white beam smashed into the huge body of the giant turtle without any reserve. At once, a roar could be heard from the sea. The giant turtle was abruptly lifted up over the sea surface as it tumbled and rolled multiple times on the waves. The seawater whirled along its gigantic body, creating whirlpools. Terrifying energy ripples were surging under the sea, rocking the ship roughly causing it to spin around in circles. Fortunately, thanks to its heavy weight, the ship was not destroyed by the huge vortex.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy was truly powerful. Being able to live for this long meant that the giant turtle was not a simple-minded creature. Sensing its life was being threatened, it quickly turned around and fled from the scene, diving straight into the deep blue sea.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the big ship, Zhou Weiqing might have continued pursuing the beast. Now that they had the Neptune shuttle with them, they were pretty much invincible. Perhaps, they could find an opportunity to devour the power of this giant turtle as well. However, he was not concerned about it at the moment, being able to meet another human being was apparently much more important to him and Bing\u2019er. Looking at the silhouette of the turtle in the distance, he whispered something towards Bing\u2019er before he started to activate the Neptune again.</p><br/><p>After leaping out of the shuttle and storing it away safely, the two of them began to swim towards the surface.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He instantly recognized the Flame that Gu Site had released, taking on the form of a huge lion. It was the Personal Core Fire of the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lions, the Earth Spirit Heart Flame! Let alone Zhou Weiqing with a mere six-Jeweled cultivation level, even a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse would evaporate from such an attack, an instant death indeed. It was no easy feat to summon the Earth Spirit Heart Flame, even for Gu Site. Not only was it a massive drain, it would seriously damage his life force and vitality.</p><br/><p>No matter what calculations and expectations Long Shiya had, he had never imagined that Gu Site would actually break the rules of the competition just like that, resuming his Heavenly Emperor Stage cultivation level and using his Personal Core Flame to destroy Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>When Gu Site had realised he had been tricked, the fury in his heart was burning to an unbelievable point. He had always had a hot temper, and with the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion blood burning hot within him, in his sheer rage he had lost control. Who was he? He was the King of the WanShou Empire, a noble Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse! To be forced to such a stage by a mere brat of six-Jewels, to even lose to such a person, how could he stand it?!</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, \u2018Anger rises from the heart, and evil will then rise from the gall bladder\u20191 Gu Site instantly made the decision not to let Zhou Weiqing leave this place alive, even if he had to fall out with Long Shiya. There were three powerhouses here on the side, including himself, and if the Entropic Nether Tiger was willing to help out, they might even be able to kill Long Shiya as well. As such, he had flung caution to the wind and launched his attack. He had been confident that Xue AoTian would not sit back and watch Long Shiya kill Gu Yingbing.</p><br/><p>The Lion King\u2019s estimations had all been correct, but he had missed one point. That was\u2026 he was still stuck in the Absolute effect of the Dragon Silencing Seal, and he now had to withstand the crazed fury of Long Shiya in that state.</p><br/><p>*BOOM* A single hammer blow. The Lion King\u2019s body was sent flying by Long Shiya like a cannonball shot from a cannon, smashing savagely into the mountain. The next moment, a bout of light followed suit into the freshly opened hole. Gu Site had actually been smashed by the hammer right through the Heavenly Snow Mountain and back outside! This time, even if he did not die, he would definitely be severely injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cShow mercy!\u201d At this point, the Tiger King Xue Aoying had no choice but to intervene. Although he did not like the Lion King, and did not get along well with him, he could not just sit back and watch the King of the WanShou Empire get slaughtered by the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor!</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost.\u201d By now, Long Shiya did not care about anything or anyone else. The brilliance behind his back forming his own figure, almost making it seem like own body had grown huger. The light around the octagon plum blossom Hammer brightened a hundredfold as it whistled brazenly towards the Tiger King.</p><br/><p>Xue Aoying\u2019s expression changed. Although he was able to use his own Skills and Consolidated Equipment, he dared not take such a furious blow from Long Shiya! Immediately, his body moved aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro Long, calm down. Zhou Weiqing is not dead.\u201d At last, Xue AoTian appeared, using his own body to block the fresh new hole, a snow white long spear in his hands. Behind his own back, a similar glow of his own illusory figure flashed. With a flick of his spear, he blocked Long Shiya\u2019s hammer, and the entire cavern seemed to groan slightly in the massive impact. Originally, the exit which housed the large number of Heavenly Beasts had constant sounds of heavy breathing, but it was instantly silenced. After these Heavenly Beasts sensed the sheer aura and power of the two powerhouses clashing, they did not even dare let any sense of their presence be felt.</p><br/><p>In a direct clash of physical strength, even Xue AoTian would not dare to do so against Long Shiya with his entire \u2018Hate Sky no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set. As such, he could only subtly parry the blow as best he could.</p><br/><p>As soon as Long Shiya heard Xue AoTian\u2019s words clearly, his anger diminished. Subconsciously, his head snapped to where his precious disciple had been.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Long Shiya was dumbfounded, staring dazedly as he stopped.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had not been devoured by the Earth Spirit Heart Flame like he had thought, and he was just standing right there. His entire set of Consolidated Equipment had all disappeared, but he seemed totally unharmed. The only embarrassing thing was that he was now totally naked, standing right there in his birthday suit in a rather ridiculous sight that even Zhou Weiqing himself was stunned by. Luckily, his entire skin was still covered by the purple scales, so it still wasn\u2019t too obvious. The certain \u2018object\u2019 between his legs was swinging slightly, and if one looked closer they would be able to see it.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya almost slapped himself silly. Indeed, how could he have forgotten!</p><br/><p>No matter how powerful that Earth Spirit Heart Flame was, how could it be of any effect to his disciple? After absorbing the Solidified Dragon Spirit, Zhou Weiqing was pretty much immune to fire.</p><br/><p>The Earth Spirit Heart Flame was the Personal Core Fire of the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lions, and under the restriction of not being able to use his Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills, this was the strongest attack that Gu Site could use. Alas for the poor Lion King, his attack was fully of the Fire Attribute. Although that terrifying attack has caused Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire Legendary Set to dissipate, his body remained unharmed.</p><br/><p>In a flash, Long Shiya appeared beside Zhou Weiqing, examining his precious disciple up and down, even that \u2018certain object\u2019 got a glance. Only after he was certain that Zhou Weiqing was totally alright did he heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>However, despite the fact that Zhou Weiqing was fine, that did not mean the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor\u2019s rage was assuaged. He spun around abruptly, turning his gaze to Xue AoTian. His eyes were cold, but he did not say anything. Pulling Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands, he said solemnly: \u201cLet\u2019s go, Little Fatty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro Long, wait a minute. I will give you a reckoning on this matter.\u201d Even for Xue AoTian, seeing Long Shiya like this caused him some anxiety. He knew that if he allowed Long Shiya to leave like this, there would be severe repercussions. In fact, let alone Long Shiya, currently Xue AoTian\u2019s heart was filled with rage. He had never imagined that the Lion King Gu Site would actually disregard his own pride and status to do something so shameless as to attack Zhou Weiqing with full power. If Zhou Weiqing truly died, Long Shiya aside, Xue AoTian would not let Gu Site go so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAoying, go bring the Lion King back here.\u201d Xue AoTian said gravely. His expression was already extremely ugly.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya took a deep breath, suppressing the rage in his heart. After all, this was still the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and they still had not achieved their original goal in coming here.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said softly: \u201cMaster, I am fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya glared at him and said exasperatedly: \u201cJust because you gained a slight advantage, you thought you could press it? Did you forget who your opponent was?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a helpless look. He had also been given a huge fright, not having expected that the Lion King would actually go all out on him. In that instant, there had been zero chance for him to dodge the blow. Although Long Shiya did not spell it out, Zhou Weiqing knew that his Master was reminding him that if Gu Site had not used a Fire Attribute attack, perhaps he would be dead now.</p><br/><p>However, was that really the truth of the matter? At that moment, Zhou Weiqing did not try to explain himself to Long Shiya; after all, his Master was not wrong to lecture him. In truth, when he had sensed the Lion King\u2019s attack, in the last split second Zhou Weiqing had managed to react and release a Skill. With that unique Skill, even if the Lion King was not using a Fire Attribute attack, Zhou Weiqing still had some confidence that he could at least survive it, if barely.</p><br/><p>Before long, the Tiger King had brought the Lion King back.</p><br/><p>Gu Site\u2019s current look was truly miserable and desolate. His right hand hung limp at his side, looking like the bones within had been totally shattered. Even if he could keep the arm, it was not going to be a simple matter to heal it.</p><br/><p>At the same time, his chest area had clearly sunk in, and his face was ashen. Blood seeped out of all his seven orifices, and his eyes were clearly dim. From just one look, it was clear that Gu Site was severely injured.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya had previously thought that he had killed Zhou Weiqing, and in his rage, he had struck out with all his might, supported by his entire \u2018Hate Sky no Handle\u2019 LEgendary Set. The Lion King had originally been weaker than Long Shiya, let alone without any of his Consolidated Equipment. Being able to stay alive was already a testament to how powerful his body and cultivation was.</p><br/><p>Seeing the Lion King once more, Long Shiya\u2019s eyes were filled with a violent killing intent. Raising the hammer in his hands, he said coldly: \u201cGu Site, you bastard. We are now mortal enemies, I swear I will kill you. You don\u2019t want your face anymore? You even dare bully a mere junior. Just you wait, this old man will ensure that your entire Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion Tribe is wiped out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro Long, please calm down. Allow me to handle this matter.\u201d Xue AoTian\u2019s face was stern as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Gu Site did not react to either of their words, instead staring dazedly at Zhou Weiqing. He could not believe that Zhou Weiqing was still alive, even unharmed, after taking a head-on blow of his Earth Spirit Heart Flame. Yet, there he was standing there, wearing his clothes!</p><br/><p>How could this be!? Why is this happening? Zhou Weiqing had given him just too many shocks today. Was that brat really six-Jewels? Gu Site\u2019s heart was filled with questions.</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing remained uninjured, as Xue AoTian had received the blow that Long Shiya had struck at him. He quickly rushed to his father\u2019s side, and rays of healing Divine energy shone upon his father\u2019s body. However, his head remained bowed down, and he did not dare look at Zhou Weiqing, as his face was filled with shame. He was still young, not as experienced and vicious as his father. Having such a thing happen had diminished his strong fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian looked at the Lion King coldly and gave a cold humph. \u201cYou have thrown away the face of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. There is no longer any need to continue with the competition. You can go now, and tell all the guests that the wedding is cancelled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh?\u201d Only then did Gu Site react, his face darkening as he said: \u201cMountain Lord, I admit that I have made a grave mistake. We have indeed lost this second test, but\u2026 isn\u2019t there still a third test?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian said coldly: \u201cYou still have the face to mention a third test? What is your status, your power? Have you gone stupid being the King of the WanShou Empire? How old is Zhou Weiqing? What did I tell you previously? I said. You can get lost now. Yingbing will no longer inherit my Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord position. Yingbing, you escort your father back. In a month, I want to hear that you have assumed his position as King of the WanShou Empire. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for taking care of it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Enforcing his will strictly and swiftly. That was truly the way to describe Xue AoTian. In a matter of moments, he had already made his choice and judgement. He did not even give Gu Yingbing a third chance. Not because of Long Shiya\u2019s threats, but because of his own face, and the honour and dignity of the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>\n</div>"}

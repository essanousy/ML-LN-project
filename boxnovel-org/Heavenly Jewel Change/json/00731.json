Even after knowing that nothing would happen between the two, she chose to hand herself to him without any hesitation. She even put on the necklace on on purpose.</p><br/><p>Recalling the last few months spent with him, crystal-like tears flowed uncontrollably from her flushed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, once you\u2019ve gone back, will you still remember me? Why is this so unfair? The most important present you\u2019ve left me with is not your Saint Energy, it\u2019s the longing!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Dongfang Hanyue was mumbling to herself, all of a sudden, her petite figure vibrated, and the sorrow in her eyes was instantly replaced with shock and menacing, murderous intentions.</p><br/><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t good\u2019</p><br/><p>The next instant, she leaped up without a moment of hesitation and released her Blackfiend Dragon Transformation. Under the drive of the huge dragon wings, she flew in the direction which Zhou Weiqing had left toward, with the highest speed she was capable of.</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing had left the island, his whole being had lost focus. Truth be told, he could not bear to leave. Not only did he long for Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s body, there was also a heaviness in his heart which could not be put in words.</p><br/><p>It might be due to his guilt, as neither did he immediately contact Shangguan Bing\u2019er, nor did he attempt to pinpoint her location. He had been flying in the sky just like that.</p><br/><p>While he was flying, all of a sudden, a horrifying presence exploded from below the ocean surface.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s reaction was already sufficiently fast. However, the presence seemed to have suppressed itself for a long time. A huge water pillar hit him hard and flung his body up to the sky.</p><br/><p>At that time, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strong self-defense played the key role in protecting his life.</p><br/><p>There was no need to activate the Immortal Deity Shield as it was released on its own, effectively shielding Zhou Weiqing with a layer of golden luster. Simultaneously, just like an explosion, the silverish white Saint Energy exploded from within him.</p><br/><p>The water pillar was also comprised of the water element. Although the force of its impact was horrifying and consisted of the element of condensed water, it had hit Zhou Weiqing only after it had been partially decomposed by the Saint Energy upon contact.</p><br/><p>The powers of the water pillar were terrifying; that single impact had thrown Zhou Weiqing thousands of miles up. In the air, he was already spitting blood in a crazy manner.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, the gigantic water pillar had no intentions of leaving him as it is. It transformed into a huge claw mid-air, clasped his body, and plunged him toward the water surface.</p><br/><p>At that time, the ocean surface had split into two sides abruptly, and the eighty-meter-tall Dreadfiend Sea Naga gradually emerged from the sea.</p><br/><p>The menacing claws shone with faint dark blue light, and its pair of huge eyes were filled with hatred.</p><br/><p>Its brother\u2019s death was too big of a shock to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. After being blown away by the explosion, it had cleared its mind and realized that it had been deceived by Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>It swam back and forth insanely. To its dismay, all it had found was the remnants of the other Dreadfiend Sea Naga after the explosion.</p><br/><p>The few Supreme Elders of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s mother included, had returned to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland after they had recovered their senses following the explosion. They were afraid of encountering the other Dreadfiend Sea Naga.</p><br/><p>If there was someone it hated the most, it would be Zhou Weiqing. Had it not be frightened by the Demon God\u2019s projection which Zhou Weiqing had summoned which resulted in its failure to rush to its brother\u2019s rescue in the Ward of Darkness, its brother would not be dead.</p><br/><p>Just as this Dreadfiend Sea Naga failed to have any discoveries and was planning to leave the place with hatred, he found Zhou Weiqing flying in the sky.</p><br/><p>As a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse, its sensing abilities were extremely powerful. Everything within a hundred miles fell under its coverage. Thus, after discovering Zhou Weiqing, it headed over immediately, leading to its current attack.</p><br/><p>Facing the assault of a Heavenly God-tier Heavenly Beast, no matter how strong was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy, his senses were not capable of detecting the sea naga. Just as he had expected, he was thrown into a disadvantageous position right away.</p><br/><p>Upon the rise of the water pillar, Zhou Weiqing had already comprehended his situation, and all the hairs on his body stood. \u2018This was a threat from life!\u2019 he thought. If anything, he would be left in the vast ocean forever.</p><br/><p>The more dangerous the situation was, the calmer Zhou Weiqing became. Although the impactful strike just now had injured him, the wounds were not serious.</p><br/><p>After his recent cultivation, it was the first time the Immortal Deity Shield demonstrated its defensive powers at full potential. The Heavenly God-tier powerhouse may not have used its full power in its previous attack as it was concealing itself, but for the attack to be blocked, it showed how strong the defenses of the Immortal Deity Shield were.</p><br/><p>The Immortal Deity Shield instantly decomposed the terrifying impact, and the Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing once again fully recovered. With the two occurring concurrently, although Zhou Weiqing\u2019s injuries were not light, he had yet to be weakened to the extent that he could not defend himself.</p><br/><p>Under the coercion of the horrid huge claw of seawater, a layer of a faint silverish white light appeared on the surface of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. A strange thing then happened. The terrifying water element which had been initially pressing onto his body, restraining his movements and his soul, had one circle of it melted under the silverish white rays.</p><br/><p>Although it was just a circle, to Zhou Weiqing, it brought the effect of keeping his life intact.</p><br/><p>The silver light flashed, and in the next instant, his body appeared a hundred meters away.</p><br/><p>Empowered by Saint Energy, the powers of Blink had risen sharply. This was also one of the reasons Zhou Weiqing had not panicked regardless of the situations he had been at Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>Supported by Saint Energy, he was capable of escaping by sustaining the activation of Blink for a certain duration. Although this had consumed much Saint Energy, it was the key to his life-saving in a pinch.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the huge water pillar appeared again. Zhou Weiqing did not dare to linger any longer; he activated Blink eight times continuously and was already more than a thousand meters away.</p><br/><p>However, against the Heavenly God-tier powerhouse, this much was insufficient.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing had moved a thousand meters away and thought that he had the chance to escape, out of nowhere, a surge of great pressure descended from the skies as if the sky had collapsed all of a sudden. The intimidating pressure flung Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body toward the water\u2019s surface. Furthermore, his ninth activation of Blink had failed.</p><br/><p>Saint Energy indeed could not be affected by the Heavenly God-tier water element. However, Saint Energy was necessary for him to activate Spatial Attribute to launch his skill. During that instant, in the vast area, all attributes and elements other than water element had been extracted.</p><br/><p>Facing the Heavenly God-tier powerhouse alone, Zhou Weiqing was afraid of his opponent for the first time. At that time, it was if he was being trapped in the Ward of Darkness as all his abilities were being compressed within his body. Even the circulation of his Saint Energy had slowed down substantially.</p><br/><p>Yes, he could use Saint Energy to transform into other attributes to use their skills accordingly, but the skills were limited to being supported by Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>He could no longer borrow from Atmospheric Energy. His current level of Heavenly Dao Energy was a mere joke before the Heavenly God-tier Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Skills like Blink could no longer be utilized at that moment.</p><br/><p>Rays of golden light appeared on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, it was his Ringless Ground Purging Set.</p><br/><p>It was during that time that he had calmed down. He understood very well that escape was no longer possible for him. The only option was to fight with all his might, and there might still be a slight chance of survival.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman, you\u2019ve killed my brother, I\u2019ll not let you die so easily. I\u2019ll let you experience all of the most torturing punishments in the world, and then slowly torture you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s head rose from beneath the sea and locked his gaze which was full of hatred on Zhou Weiqing. It would never be tricked again. The Zhou Weiqing before him at that moment was just like meat on the cutting board which could be devoured anytime soon.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled coldly, \u201cYou long piece of a sea worm, the victor has yet to be decided. It won\u2019t be that easy to kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inhaling a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes turned bright silver abruptly, and a mysterious presence radiated from his body.</p><br/><p>The presence came from his meridians. With the support of Saint Energy, it was released at its fullest potential.</p><br/><p>It was a strange occurrence. Due to the presence, a chain of waves appeared in the water element which had locked down the entire area.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga below also widened it eyes, while the menacing spikes on its entire body turned crystal blue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dragon Emperor Bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said proudly, \u201cYou know the Demon Emperor Bloodline too? Behold, I\u2019m the successor of the Dragon Emperor, if you dare to strike me, I just have to summon my comrades, and you\u2019ll be torn to pieces in an instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was indeed a pure Dragon Emperor Bloodline within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. In addition to the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline, supported by Saint Energy, it then radiated. Although it could not directly increase his battle forces, the Dragon Emperor Bloodline is the noblest of all bloodlines that had ever existed among the dragon clans. In terms of ranks, it surpassed the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Thus, under the dispersion of the Dragon Emperor Bloodline, the powers of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga would be slightly affected.</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit. Despicable human, don\u2019t even dream of tricking me again. As a member of the noble dragon clan, I won\u2019t commit the same mistake again. This is the ocean. So what if the descendants of the Dragon Emperor really did come? Now die.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he said that, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s entire being radiated in blue, and the water element in the air became concentrated. With Zhou Weiqing as the center, the water element compressed toward him in an insane manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you, I\u2019m not afraid of you,\u201d seeing that his chances of escape were almost impossible, the inner strength within Zhou Weiqing was invoked.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy in his body circulated at top speed. In this instant, the Ringless Ground Purging Set on him had temporarily tuned silver white.</p><br/><p>The surrounding water element was too concentrated, resulting in the failure of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s activated technique to take shape.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The kid had to be a young virgin! Bing\u2019er\u2019s beauty was most effective at enticing young male virgins.</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Bing\u2019er had first followed Zhou Weiqing all those years ago, she was already quite dazzling. \u00a0The only difference was that back then she had seemed a bit fresh and immature. As three years had gone by, she had fully blossomed into a truly peerless beauty. \u00a0Although the three Shangguan sisters were identical, their auras were completely different. Shangguan Bing\u2019er had a soft, gentle quality to her beauty that was the most enticing of the three. \u00a0Right now, she was dressed in water-green robes and wearing no makeup. She looked like a young orchid, filled with grace and spirituality. Anyone who saw her would feel that her only \u2018fault\u2019 was that the only man in her eyes was Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0She didn\u2019t seem to even notice the way the youth had stared at her just now.</p><br/><p>The youth guided Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er into the interior of the ship. \u00a0This ship was truly enormous, over three hundred meters long and eighty meters wide. \u00a0Ships of such enormous size were extremely uncommon in the Boundless Mainland, and they wouldn\u2019t even rock when beset by great waves in a storm. \u00a0They were extremely stable vessels for venturing deep into the ocean. Although this ship couldn\u2019t match the Sea Emperor Shuttle in speed, it could hold far more than just one or two people!</p><br/><p>The youth continued to guide them deeper into the ship until they finally reached an enormous cabin. \u00a0This cabin actually had a banquet prepared within it, and the dishes prepared were all rather foreign and exotic to Shangguan Bing\u2019er and Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0Clearly, they weren\u2019t from the Boundless Mainland.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster Guyu sat in the main seat, while a serious-faced man who looked to be in his forties sat next to him. \u00a0Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t see this man earlier during the day, but judging from his clothes he was probably an important member of the crew. \u00a0It was very possible that he was the captain of the ship.</p><br/><p>Three tables had been prepared in total. \u00a0Aside from the Heavenly Jewel Masters he had seen earlier, the others were probably all important members of the ship\u2019s crew.</p><br/><p>Guyu beckoned towards Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er, indicating that they were to join him at his table. \u00a0Zhou Weiqing understood that it was time to put on a play. These people definitely wanted to figure out what their background was.</p><br/><p>As soon as he entered, he had put a grateful look upon his face. \u00a0When it came to acting, Zhou Weiqing was without a doubt one of the top figures in all the Boundless Mainland.</p><br/><p>He pulled Bing\u2019er over to Guyu\u2019s table, then bowed respectfully. \u00a0\u201cGrandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guyu nodded towards them, indicating that they should sit. \u00a0The two youths seated below Guyu had appeared earlier in the day, and they couldn\u2019t help but stare at Shangguan Bing\u2019er. \u00a0Although they didn\u2019t exactly look \u2018lascivious\u2019, they were pretty close. After having changed her clothes, Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked like an orchid hidden within a gorge. \u00a0She put all the other women on this entire vessel to shame.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er didn\u2019t even seem to notice their gazes. \u00a0She simply lowered her head, moving slightly closer to Zhou Weiqing to indicate that every part of her belonged to him.</p><br/><p>Guyu\u2019s gaze flickered across the two of them. \u00a0He then smiled and said, \u201cWe were in a bit of a rush when we saved you earlier. \u00a0Can I ask where you are from? Can you tell me a bit more about the disaster which befell you? \u00a0I\u2019m responsible for this entire ship\u2019s safety in this dangerous ocean, after all.\u201d His words were quite restrained, but he had made it unmistakably clear that he wanted to know more about Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s backgrounds.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, a flicker of grief flashing through his eyes. \u00a0Even Shangguan Bing\u2019er, who knew that he was just putting on a show, couldn\u2019t help but feel moved by his incredibly realistic grief. \u00a0How could the others not do so as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, you and your friends rescued our lives. \u00a0Of course we have to tell you about ourselves! My humble wife and I came from a small clan located near W\u2019Batu Harbor. \u00a0We were riding a great vessel when we went out to sea. Our clan fell long ago, leaving behind just myself and my humble wife. \u00a0We had been hoping to hunt some sea monsters on this trip and claim their Heavenly Cores to make some money and improve our luck.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe never would\u2019ve imagined that we\u2019d run into a Terror Sea Dragon, one of the rulers of the seas. \u00a0I\u2019m not even sure what happened. All I heard was someone scream the words \u2018Terror Sea Dragon\u2019, and in the next instant our ship was completely destroyed. \u00a0We were fairly lucky, as we were swept away by the waves and sent drifting across the seas. If a few more days went by, we probably would\u2019ve both died. Oh, right! \u00a0My name is Zhou Weiqing, while my humble wife is Shangguan Bing\u2019er. We are tremendously grateful for having been rescued by everyone, and we\u2019ll find a way to repay you for saving our lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing spoke with what could only be described as \u2018absolute sincerity\u2019. \u00a0It was perfectly in keeping with his status as a disaster victim, and it also gave a clear explanation as to who he and his wife were. \u00a0As for W\u2019Batu Harbor, it was one of the other destinations that had been marked within the Sea Emperor Shuttle\u2019s maps. The only other name Zhou Weiqing knew was the \u2018Xuantian Continent\u2019 itself, and these people here obviously wouldn\u2019t suspect that he was from the Boundless Mainland. \u00a0For him to simply report W\u2019Batu to skip over this question was more than enough.</p><br/><p>When they saw the bitter look on his face and heard him narrate his tale, most of the people present revealed looks of pity. \u00a0The only one to be unmoved was Grandmaster Guyu. He said calmly, \u201cIn other words, you are independent cultivators? Judging by appearances, you are less than twenty years of age. \u00a0For an independent cultivator of your age to become a five-Jeweled expert couldn\u2019t have been easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing let out a sigh. \u00a0Not seeming to have heard the suspicions underlying Guyu\u2019s words, he explained, \u201cAlthough my clan has fallen upon hard times, we\u2019ve never lost our legacies and our cultivation techniques. \u00a0Grandmaster, how about this? Since you saved our lives, if you wish I can hand over my clan\u2019s cultivation techniques to you. This is just a small token of gratitude from the two of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>If there was anyone else who still felt suspicious of him, their suspicions were now completely allayed by his words. \u00a0Everyone could sense his absolute sincerity.</p><br/><p>In both the Boundless Mainland and the Xuantian Continent, ancestral cultivation techniques were incredibly valuable to any and all Heavenly Jewel Masters. \u00a0Zhou Weiqing expressing willingness to hand his over was more than enough to demonstrate his sincerity. Every single person\u2019s cultivation technique was unique in its own way, and it could be used to judge many things. \u00a0For him to not even hold back on something as priceless as an ancestral technique meant that he was essentially laying himself completely bare.</p><br/><p>Indeed, when Guyu heard these words his expression instantly became much friendlier. \u00a0He waved his hand and said, \u201cWhen we have some spare time, let\u2019s spar a little. For you to have reached the five-Jeweled level at such a young age means that you are a promising talent. \u00a0This old man is willing to give you a pointer or two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words were beautifully spoken, but Grandmaster Guyu wouldn\u2019t be so easily convinced. \u00a0<em>If you wish to offer up your techniques, then I\u2019ll first see for myself just how your techniques are</em>. \u00a0Besides, any technique which could allow a twenty-year-old to reach the five-Jeweled stage had to be a decent one.</p><br/><p>The hidden verbal exchange between the two was \u2018invisible\u2019, but it was the most dangerous of all confrontations. \u00a0If something went wrong, the two sides could instantly find themselves enemies. The reason why Zhou Weiqing was able to remain composed was because he truly didn\u2019t have any intentions of harming the people aboard this vessel. \u00a0In addition, even if something did go wrong he didn\u2019t have to be afraid. So long as he had the Sea Emperor Shuttle, they would still be able to reach the Xuantian Continent. However, if they reached the continent via this vessel they would have a new, proper identity. \u00a0They would also be able to learn many things regarding the continent, which would be of great use to them.</p><br/><p>The meals on the ship were naturally centered around seafood. \u00a0Large ships like this would only bring fruits, vegetables, and a small amount of dried meat and grains. \u00a0The vast majority of their provisions, they had to catch for themselves from the sea. This was the only way for them to continue to sail for extended periods of time.</p><br/><p>However, this rather plain banquet was more than enough to awaken the appetites of Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er. \u00a0Any sort of hot food would be unspeakably appealing after the month they had spent subsisting on grains! Their very voracity served as another testament to the terrible experience they had suffered at sea.</p><br/><p>After the meal, Grandmaster Guyu didn\u2019t release Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0Instead, he invited Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er to his private quarters.</p><br/><p>Compared to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s residence, Guyu\u2019s cabin was much larger and better furnished. \u00a0This single cabin took up all the space in the ship\u2019s highest level, and it even came with its own exercise area. \u00a0From here, they had a superb vantage point to see the ocean around them.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er waited outside, while Zhou Weiqing was ushered inside the cabin. \u00a0The two peculiar-looking youths were Guyu\u2019s disciples, and they waited outside as well. \u00a0They tried to strike up a conversation with Shangguan Bing\u2019er and get closer to her. If it had been Shangguan Fei\u2019er who was here, all their secrets would\u2019ve been revealed in a snap. \u00a0Bing\u2019er, however, was different. No matter what they said, she simply listened with a smile while saying very little. This simply spurred them on, but they remained quite courteous and didn\u2019t act improperly at all.</p><br/><p>\u00a0Roughly an hour later, Grandmaster Guyu let out a startled cry from within his cabin. \u00a0\u201cThis cultivation technique of yours is absolutely suicidal! For you to have reached such a level is just incredibly lucky. \u00a0\u2018Immortal Deity Technique\u2019? More like \u2018Doomed Deity Technique\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>The door to the cabin swung open. \u00a0Zhou Weiqing walked out with a rather helpless look on his face, Grandmaster Guyu by his side. \u00a0Guyu had an absolutely stunned look on his face, and he couldn\u2019t help but stare at Zhou Weiqing strangely.</p><br/><p>As soon as Shangguan Bing\u2019er heard this, she knew what had happened. \u00a0She lowered her head and forced back her laughter as she walked over to stand next to Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0The cute and reliant way she acted towards him filled the two youths with jealousy.</p><br/><p>Guyu let out a long sigh. \u00a0\u201cWeiqing, this old man has honestly never even heard of a technique like this, nor can I give you any pointers. \u00a0Go back to your cabin and have a rest. We\u2019re already on our way back. If we run into any enemies enroute to the continent, I\u2019ll need to ask the two of you to lend a hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said respectfully, \u201cOf course.\u201d \u00a0His earlier performance had clearly won him Guyu\u2019s acknowledgment, and he was now a member of this vessel\u2019s crew.</p><br/><p>Next came the long trip back. \u00a0To the people on the boat, this was an extremely boring trip. \u00a0All they did was occasionally hunt a few weaker sea beasts to add to their harvests. \u00a0To Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er, however, this was a far better life than the one they had experienced on the Sea Emperor Shuttle. \u00a0They didn\u2019t need to do anything at all, but they were still headed where they needed to go. Most importantly, they were learning many new things about the Xuantian Continent.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was highly adaptable to any new environment, and he made friends very easily. \u00a0He quickly began to learn a great deal of information through his conversations with the people aboard this ship.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

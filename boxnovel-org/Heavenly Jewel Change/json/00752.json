Even in the dark, the Peerless Archers had a certain level of accuracy. Under such circumstances, every round of shots they took together would be able to kill thousands of their enemies, along with the terrifying damage of the flames. The outcome of this battle would be concluded in just two hours.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu\u2019s commands on the battlefield were absolutely wonderful. The main forces of the army closing in from the rear, eliminating the chances of the enemies escaping. This was a confirmed victory and a complete victory at that.</p><br/><p>The real battle had only been going on for slightly more than two hours until it came to an end, and all that was left was to clean up the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The flames burnt on until dawn. As the fire had extinguished, the war had also drawn to a close.</p><br/><p>When Ming Yu led the group of the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s officers into Heavenly Bow City, it also signified the success of Heavenly Bow City\u2019s reclamation. Until this point, the Heavenly Bow armies had almost reclaimed every single territory.</p><br/><p>Ming Yu had only used three days to accomplish all of these. During this period, Zhou Weiqing had remained in the palace and told all of his recent encounters with his father and the Emperor of Heavenly Bow Empire, Di Feng Ling.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Difuya is here,\u201d the guard\u2019s announcement made everyone who was in the midst of their discussion in the main hall, direct their gazes toward the entrance of the palace.</p><br/><p>At this time, there was only Zhou Weiqing and his father, Di Feng Ling, Xiao Yunchen and several other men in the main hall.</p><br/><p>Difuya had been assigned to the rear section of the city and did not participate in the war. In fact, Zhou Weiqing had never paid much attention to the princess. After they had emerged victorious in the war, he had ordered his people to send Difuya back.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the return of his daughter, Di Feng Ling looked agitated, but soon after, this agitation of his was replaced by anger, and he sat still on his seat with an unpleasant demeanor.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather,\u201d accompanied by a sorrowful cry, Difuya rushed in from the outside and ran toward her father. Just like how Zhou Weiqing had hugged Admiral Zhou previously, she clung to her father\u2019s legs and sobbed loudly.</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling sat perfectly still and gave no response despite her antics.</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou who had been sitting at the side frowned, and spared a glance at his son.</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing had reported everything to his father, Zhou Shui Niu\u2019s attitude toward his beloved son had changed minutely. His previous sternness had vanished and was now replaced by affection. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like what Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had said. Whoever has a son like this will definitely be proud!\u201d he thought as he recalled Long Shiya\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>As for Difuya giving up on the marriage, Admiral Zhou was extremely displeased within his heart. He thought, \u201cI used to think that my son didn\u2019t deserve the princess, but how about now? My son is the youngest Heavenly King-tier powerhouse. In what way is he undeserving of her?</p><br/><p>Regarding Difuya, Admiral Zhou now did not think of her as a good match for his son. Difuya was the royal descendant of the Heavenly Bow Empire! However, since unpleasant things had happened to the Heavenly Bow Empire, it was his son who had invested all his efforts and had gone through so much for the empire to be successfully reclaimed today. What has she done as the princess? He thought that not only had she not aided much, she had caused trouble for his son instead. He did not bother to have such a daughter-in-law and did not mind calling off the marriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away, I don\u2019t have a daughter like you,\u201d Di Feng Ling abruptly lifted his leg, and kicked Difuya away.</p><br/><p>Difuya was stunned by her father\u2019s kick, as she did not get up after falling to the ground. \u2018Since I was little, father had loved me the most. How can he treat me like this?\u2019 she thought.</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling stood up and said to Admiral Zhou, \u201cBrother, I\u2019m ashamed to allow this brat to step foot into your family. I shall beat her to death at this instant to prevent our relationship from being tainted any further.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Di Feng Ling unsheathed his long sword and stepped forward. He raised it and was about to swing it toward Difuya\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t, your Majesty,\u201d the people exclaimed.</p><br/><p>In a flash, Zhou Weiqing held Di Feng Ling tightly, \u201cGodfather, what are you doing? Difuya hadn\u2019t done anything wrong either. Even if nothing had happened to the country in the first place, she had no feelings for me. Everyone has their own preferences, so it didn\u2019t mean anything even if she doesn\u2019t like me. There\u2019ll be no happiness in a forced relationship. Furthermore, she had found her own happiness now, and our Heavenly Bow Empire had been successfully reclaimed. Throughout the last few years, she had been suffering as well. So, please don\u2019t blame her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling\u2019s had a terrible expression, but once Zhou Weiqing held down, there would be no way for him to free himself. Under such circumstances, he could only stop his actions, and glare coldly at Difuya, \u201cGet out! I don\u2019t want to see you. From now onward, you\u2019re no longer a princess of the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Difuya was stunned. She stared at her cruel father, began to cry, and fled the scene.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed. Although he had never been fond of Difuya, despite despising her, he did not wish to see such a tragic end to her. But alas, Di Feng Ling was really infuriated at the moment, so all words to coax him will be in futility.</p><br/><p>After Difuya had left, Di Feng Ling gradually calmed down and he sighed heavily. He said, \u201cWeiqing, I\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s all my fault, I\u2019ve not taught her properly.\u201d His emotions now could only be described as mixed feelings. If Difuya really did get married to Zhou Weiqing, he would be able to tolerate all of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s actions. After all, the future child of Zhou Weiqing and Difuya would inherit the throne of the Heavenly Bow Empire \u2013 but what now?</p><br/><p>In the recent days, Di Feng Ling had already educated himself with the current situation of the Heavenly Bow Empire. It could be said that this was the strongest era of the Heavenly Bow Empire in history. However, how much powers did he still have as the Emperor? This did not only refer to him; it was the same for Admiral Zhou as well. Although Zhou Weiqing had handed over all his powers immediately, they were perfectly aware that without Zhou Weiqing, nobody would be able to command the armies.</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling sat down and after recovering from his daze, he raised his head all of a sudden and looked at Zhou Weiqing, as if he had just made up his mind, \u201cWeiqing, I\u2019ve decided. Among all my children, there\u2019s not a decent one. I\u2019ve never appointed anyone as the prince as well. From today onward, you\u2019re now the Prince of the Heavenly Bow Empire. In a few days\u2019 time, I\u2019ll officially crown you as the Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhou Weiqing was shocked and stared at Di Feng Ling in astonishment, Admiral Zhou who had been at the side had already kneeled on the ground, \u201cYour Majesty, please reconsider.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing quickly moved to kneel in front of Di Feng Ling too, \u201cGodfather, all the things that I\u2019ve done were well within my responsibilities. This is inappropriate. Furthermore, this isn\u2019t what I desire. If you were to hand such a big country over to me, what freedom will I have left? Rest assured, I will handle the military affairs. As long as you don\u2019t change the Marshal, and continue to place your utmost trust on Marshal Ming Yu like what I\u2019ve done, then, I can guarantee that we Heavenly Bow will only grow stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Di Feng Ling shook his head and pulled Zhou Weiqing and Admiral Zhou up. He looked at Zhou Weiqing with affection and said, \u201cMy child, I know your heart. However, you\u2019ve contributed so much to the empire. If I don\u2019t do something, how can I face the people? Say no more, I\u2019ve made up my mind. I also believe that under your ruling, the Heavenly Bow Empire will be able to become one of the strongest countries of the mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Other than possessing the highest popularity in the Heavenly Bow Empire, Zhou Weiqing had even established friendly relationships with several other big countries, including a few Great Saint Lands. If he were to rule the Heavenly Bow Empire, it would definitely bring great benefits to the country in the future. After some internal struggles, Di Feng Ling believed that he had made the most fitting decision. After uttering these words, he somehow felt relieved.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly and said, \u201cNo, Godfather, please listen to what I have to say. Although I\u2019m not willing to rule our Heavenly Bow Empire, I will never stop contributing to the country. These are my thoughts \u2013 why is the Zhongtian Empire and Wan Shou Empire so strong? It\u2019s because they are supported by the Saint Lands. If that\u2019s the case, why can\u2019t we, the Heavenly Bow Empire, possess our own Saint Land?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSaint Land?\u201d upon hearing these two words, Admiral Zhou and Di Feng Ling\u2019s eyes shone.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded lightly, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, a Saint Land. Despite the current situation, our powers are still insufficient. However, the numbers of our Heavenly Jewel Masters are not any fewer than those big countries. Even if we\u2019re no match for the Zhongtian Empire, we\u2019ve surpassed the Fei Li Empire. Under a continuous nurturance, we\u2019ll be able to grow stronger and stronger. With me and my teacher in the Saint land, we can still stand against the other Saint Lands in terms of higher-tier powers. As time goes by, I believe that we\u2019ll grow more powerful. Furthermore, since I\u2019m not a God Tier Master, I\u2019m able to help the elderly Heavenly Jewel Masters to lengthen their lives. Once the news is released, I believe that not for long, we will have the scale of a Saint Land, and as for its organization, it\u2019ll be my matters to handle. As for the country, it\u2019ll be better for you to rule it, otherwise won\u2019t I be considered a sinner plotting for the throne? As a citizen of Heavenly Bow Empire, it is required of me to contribute to my country. Please don\u2019t give me a bad name!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing his words, Di Feng Ling\u2019s will seemed to waver a little, and thought, \u201cYes, if heavenly the Bow Empire is able to have its own Saint land, it can be on the same ranks as the bigger countries!\u201d</p><br/><p>After some pondering, just as Di Feng Ling was about to nod in agreement, all of a sudden, a person rushed in. Without permission, the person barged straight into the main hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, this is bad, something has happened. Your Majesty, Admiral Zhou, I\u2019m out of line, but I have urgent matters to speak to Weiqing about.\u201d</p><br/><p>The individual who had barged into the hall was none other than Ming Yu. It was only he who would not be blocked by the soldiers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

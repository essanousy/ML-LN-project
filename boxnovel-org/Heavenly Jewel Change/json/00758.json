However, one had to bear in mind that even if the four Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses had the Destruction Attribute, Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue were also formidable existences of Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>\u2018One-on-two wouldn\u2019t be possible, but if it\u2019s one-on-one, hehe,\u2019 he thought.</p><br/><p>Second Elder had been paralyzed by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hammer hit, though the more important thing was that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy Galaxia had destroyed his defensive Heavenly Energy and Absolute Delay was beaten into his body.</p><br/><p>The victory of the battle between Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses could be determined even with the slightest difference. At this moment, Second Elder had his back to the Demonic Emperor\u2019s direction. He never would\u2019ve thought that Wu Yunyue would ambush from behind without minding his own identity.</p><br/><p>The fact was that Wu Yunyue had no room to be concerned about his identity right now, as the Heavenly Demon Sect had been destroyed in the hands of these Blood Red Hell powerhouses! If that was not the case, how would the negotiation between him and Zhou Weiqing be so passive while everything revolved around Zhou Weiqing? He had long despised these people of the Blood Red Hell, so as long as he could avenge his people, his reputation would not matter!</p><br/><p>As he swung the Heavenly Demon Blade, a cloud of mist-like colors exploded behind Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue. The mist seemed like it was comprised of countless tiny strands, giving off the color of faint grey.</p><br/><p>It was a Life Attribute Heavenly Plant. Wu Yunyue\u2019s Heavenly Plant was named the Despair Hibiscus, a type of plant that existed in nature. It had no poison, but upon contact, a strong demonic poison would explode. The Evil Attribute poison was just like the three types of energy venom of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dark Demon God Lightning, which was extremely venomous.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had told Wu Yunyue earlier that he would create an opening for him to perform a full-blown strike, thus Wu Yunyue was well prepared since the beginning. Demonic Change, legendary armor set, and Despair Hibiscus, almost all of his powers were being focused on this single strike.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell Second Elder had sensed the immense threat coming from beneath; however, upon being affected by the Absolute Delay, his reflexes became much slower. With great struggles, he turned his body with the spear in his hand pointing downwards while activating all of the Heavenly Energy that he had in his body.</p><br/><p>Baam\u2013, the Heavenly Demon Blade and Second Elder\u2019s Blood Spear collided against each other vigorously. Judging from both of their Cultivation Bases, Wu Yunyue had the upper hand, and that\u2019s not even considering the fact that the Second Elder could not even utilize eighty percent of his power.</p><br/><p>Heaven and earth shook as an ear-piercing explosion was heard. The Second Elder spewed a mouthful of blood. His defensive Heavenly Energy had been crushed by Zhou Weiqing earlier. At that moment, the Despair Hibiscus was released and had enveloped Second Elder\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A miserable scream was heard, and the Second Elder\u2019s hysterical shrieks were filled with dissatisfaction and rage. \u201cHow dare you ambush me! You shall die with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing Wu Yunyue\u2019s ambush, he was very clear that he did not have the opportunity to escape anymore. He would definitely die before First Elder and Third Elder arrived.</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, Second Elder ignited his Heavenly Emperor-tier Heavenly Nucleus Core without any hesitation. In an instant, the area surrounding his body formed into an area that was like a black hole. As soon as a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse succeeded in self-explosion, even the Heavenly Bow City that was far away would be affected by the impact. By then, the casualties would not be limited to the people before them.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue then left the battlefield in a flash almost without hesitation. A Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse\u2019s self-explosion power was almost equivalent equal to three folds of his most powerful attack. Wu Yunyue did not want to die. Furthermore, there would be no turning back, because as soon as the Heavenly Nucleus Core was ignited, the self-explosion was unavoidable. Since this Second Elder would be dying, how could he allow him to use him as a scapegoat?</p><br/><p>However, right at this moment, a massive hammer suddenly appeared behind the Second Elder and a distorted glow instantly covered his body, which was about to explode.</p><br/><p>\u2018This kid is insane,\u2019 Wu Yunyue thought. Wu Yunyue clearly saw that it was Zhou Weiqing who had appeared behind the Second Elder. No matter how remarkable he was, it was a self-explosion of a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse! \u2018Is he planning to die?\u2019 he thought again.</p><br/><p>However, Wu Yunyue was slightly stunned in the next second as the Second Elder\u2019s self-explosion halted just like that. After an intense distortion occurred around the area surrounding Zhou Weiqing and the Second Elder\u2019s bodies, everything returned to normal. Zhou Weiqing had his own ways of utilizing Time Reversal, the skill that was perceived as useless. He had just started to really master this skill ever since he possessed the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>Time Reversal no longer required the absorption of a huge amount of energy to reverse time for a mere two hours. With the support of Saint Energy Galaxia, Zhou Weiqing could completely control the time and range of Time Reversal. Naturally, the pre-requisite was to eliminate the target of Time Reversal; it would only worked if that part was fulfilled. Since the Second Elder was self-exploding, how would he have any defence on his body? No doubt, Zhou Weiqing successfully performed it with a single strike.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had figured out what could possibly happen after he blasted the Second Elder. Therefore, he performed the consolidation of Time Reversal as fast as he could and made it back with Blink. When he arrived behind the Second Elder, Zhou Weiqing had cold sweat all over him as Blink had almost deviated in direction due to the black hole-like impact from the self-explosion. Fortunately, he made it eventually.</p><br/><p>The function of the Dual God Strength Hammers was not as simple as a mere Secondary Skill! The heavy hit of the hammer had almost instantly crushed the majority of Second Elder\u2019s backbones, so he could not perform self-explosion now even if he wanted to. The light cloud of Starcrux Heavenly Nucleus Core then appeared on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest. How could the Second Elder fight fair with Zhou Weiqing when he was severely injured? After retracting his dual hammers, Zhou Weiqing grasped onto Second Elder\u2019s back brutally with the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palm Claws of his Ringless Ground Purging Set and fully activated the Demonic Devour. At the same time, the sky had also turned dark due to the Starcrux Heavenly Nucleus Core energies he had released.</p><br/><p>It seemed easy for Zhou Weiqing to have defeated a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, but the truth was that it was equivalent to him defeating the Second Elder together with Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue. Furthermore, it was a victory with intense surprise elements and pitfalls. No matter whether the pitfalls were intentional or not, it was a sad case for the Second Elder. The series of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s confusing actions earlier were the reason why the Second Elder ended up like this.</p><br/><p>\u2018That works too?\u2019 Wu Yunyue thought to himself as he opened his eyes wide in shock. However, there was no time for him to consider Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ability at the moment, as the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor on the other side could barely take it anymore. If one was to use a sentence to describe the battle on the other side, \u2018collapsing heaven and sinking grounds\u2019 would be the most suitable one.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon Lady released Dragon Silencing Seal in a self-explosive manner, naturally, it would not be able to work fully. Although the reflexes of First Elder and Third Elder of the Blood Red Hell were delayed, they still managed to lift up a big piece of energy space and defended most of the Dragon Silencing Seal\u2019s power. There were only seven or eight Blood Red Hell Heavenly Zong-tier powerhouses with cultivation bases of eight or nine jewels who had been hit by Dragon Silencing Seal.</p><br/><p>When the Fourth Elder was crushed by Long Shiya\u2019s attack, the First Elder and the Third Elder were in shock. Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses were human as well, and a change that came out of nowhere had similarly impacted them significantly. The Blood Red Hell Four Elders had been living together since they were young, so they were close to each other. Due to the agreement of competition, as well as wanting to get Long Shiya and the rest to surrender, they decided not to interfere when Long Shiya bet with his attack. To them, even if the Fourth Elder was not as powerful as Long Shiya, they were all at Heavenly Emperor Tier. It was impossible for Long Shiya to to kill the Fourth Elder with merely one hit.</p><br/><p>The appearance of Dragon Demonic Lady was just too sudden. Until the death of Demon Dragon Lady, they had yet to figure out whether it was a Heavenly Beast or of an entity of energy.</p><br/><p>Upon the Fourth Elder\u2019s death, the First Elder and Third Elder became furious. They did not care about the bet agreement anymore at that moment as they dashed towards Long Shiya together and attacked. However, the Dragon Demonic Lady self-exploded at that very moment.</p><br/><p>With the First Elder\u2019s and the Third Elder\u2019s Cultivation Bases, there would not be any effect on them even if the Dragon Silencing Seal glow had shone on them. However, they could abandon their subordinates. The Demonic Dragon Lady was a Heavenly Emperor-tier Maximum Level Heavenly Beast, the Dragon Silencing seal that she had released by self-explosion were difficult to be defended against even for Heavenly King-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>If they allowed the glow to shine on, it was safe to say that the subordinates that they brought along with them would lose a majority of their combat strength. Besides, the initial absolute advantage of the ability had been pulled down significantly due to the Fourth Elder\u2019s death. Although they were enraged, they could not abandon their subordinates. The only thing they could do was release the Consolidated Equipment which gave the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor the opportunity to attack.</p><br/><p>The sky had completely turned into six colors of the six attributes of Water, Fire, Earth, Wind, Light, and Darkness. All of the attributes energy elements exploded from Long Shiya\u2019s command. Ever since Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor took Zhou Weiqing as his disciple, it was his first time showcasing all of his combat strength. Although the six color glows were just consolidated simulation, one could notice that they were little shadows behind every light arrow if they looked closely. Those were shadows that looked exactly like Long Shiya. One could tell how terrifying the power of the light arrows was.</p><br/><p>10,000 Devastating Godslayer Arrows. It was one of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya\u2019s ultimate moves. The attack did not only gather his personal strength, but also massive amounts of Atmospheric Energy. Long Shiya\u2019s advantage was that he was the one who attacked first. The Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse had the ability to control the Atmospheric Energy as their attack weapon as they wished. However, there was a sequence of who got to attack first, which was why Long Shiya had not had the opportunity to use the Atmospheric Energy earlier. Therefore, the Atmospheric Energy of the Blood Red Hell First Elder and Third Elder was much thinner when Long Shiya attacked.</p><br/><p>At the moment, there was a magical scene happening if one could watch from far. The sky was filled with the six colors while the ground was bloody red like a blood sea. There was a layer of black, destructive air currents within the bloody ground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

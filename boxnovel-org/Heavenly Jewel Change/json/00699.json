Zhou Weiqing suddenly came to a realization. When his Heavenly Energy broke through to the 36th-tier, he had remained at the Heavenly Xu Energy level. However, this breakthrough brought him to the realm of Heavenly Dao Energy, or to be exact, Saint Dao Energy.</p><br/><p>A Saint Core Nucleus could be condensed only when four types of Saint Dao Energy were accumulated, similar to how Heavenly Dao Energy was condensed into a Heavenly Core Nucleus. Even though he had yet to achieve the Heavenly King Tier, by crossing over into the Saint Dao Energy stage, he had already exceeded most of the Higher Level Heavenly Zong masters. It was unknown how many of the Higher Level Heavenly Zong masters were suppressed by the 36 levels of Zong Heavenly Energy. Entering the Heavenly Dao Energy stage meant that there was a significantly higher possibility of him forming a nucleus.</p><br/><p>This was a critical step. To any Heavenly Jewel Master, it was a very thrilling move filled with opportunity.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing had always been cultivating the Immortal Deity Technique, he achieved breakthroughs rapidly. As a result, the bottleneck only plagued him for several months. However, if this was known by the Higher Level Heavenly Zong masters, they would spit blood on his face. This was because they might not necessarily be able to cross that threshold even after decades of arduous cultivation!</p><br/><p>Heavenly Dao Energy meant controlling the energies of the Heavenly Dao. It was endless as it fused with the Heavenly Dao. This single evolution took him to a completely different level. Only at this point had the Saint Energy in him truly completed a circulation. With the Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing was absolutely confident that he would have a fighting chance if he faced any powerhouses below the Heavenly Emperor Tier. Even a Heavenly Emperor Tier expert would have difficulty killing him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, are you alright?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er asked with concern. Although she had constantly sensed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy increasing, he did become unconscious because he had used too much Spiritual Energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing slowly stretched out his right hand, clenched his fist, and felt the Atmospheric Energy compressing. \u201cThe Heavenly Dao Energy. Bing\u2019er, I\u2019ve made a breakthrough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er was slightly dazed. She could not help it as her eyes gave off a twinkle. She had already known many years ago that her little fatty was abnormally talented. Although she knew that he would become a powerhouse in the future, she never expected it to happen so fast.</p><br/><p>Since the beginning of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation, only six to seven years had passed, but his cultivation was already steadily approaching the Heavenly King Tier. On top of that, it was the Heavenly King Tier with Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing turned to sit up and took a deep breath. Even as he took a breath, he could feel the Atmospheric Energy gushing wildly towards him. It was similar to what happened when he used Demonic Devour. If only he was not on the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s territory\u2026 He really wished to experiment by using his Saint Energy to cast Demonic Devour. He wanted to see if he could swallow the Atmospheric Energy for cultivation with Demonic Devour\u2019s aid. A powerful scene would surely unfold.</p><br/><p>This breakthrough gave Zhou Weiqing an all-round improvement, be it his Saint Energy, Spiritual Energy, or in terms of physical prowess. All of them experienced significant improvements. In short, he was one foot into a brand new world.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they say anything?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er shook her head.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and replied, \u201cIt should be time for them to know that I\u2019ve woken up, but first, let me consolidate the scroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Five Ringless Ground Purging Sets could increase his power by thirty-two times his base. Six pieces would make the improvement sixty-four fold. As long as he consolidated the sixth Ringless Ground Purging Set that he had tried so very hard to make, the pure power alone was enough for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength to soar.</p><br/><p>The news of Zhou Weiqing waking up soon reached the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. However, nobody came to disturb him and Shangguan Bing\u2019er that day. They came early the next morning, and Zhou Weiqing, who was cultivating in the wooden cabin, slowly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cComing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He put on his coat and got out of bed. He then left the wooden cabin with the neatly dressed Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing then stood calmly outside the wooden cabin. He did not move ahead to greet the visitors. There were not many people coming from outside the valley; there were only three people, and they were coming straight for the wooden cabin.</p><br/><p>Among the trio, Zhou Weiqing only recognized one of them. This was the elder that had brought them to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, Fei Lun. There was an old man beside him with a sun imprint on his chest. This showed that the man and Fei Lun\u2019s had similar status. Leading them was a man with three suns on his chest.</p><br/><p>The man was tall and slender, and he was covered in a blue robe. Long black hair flowed behind his back, and a large, dark blue mask covered his face. The man was covered completely. Not even the skin from around his neck could be seen.</p><br/><p>\u2018Three sun imprints?\u2019 Zhou Weiqing was slightly surprised.</p><br/><p>The three soon arrived in front of the wooden cabin. The man in the lead stopped in his steps. His voice was very neutral and melodious. \u201cMaster Zhou. Greetings. It\u2019s an honor that you\u2019ve come to our Mysterious Heavenly Palace. I\u2019m Dongfang, the lord of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing thought to himself, \u2018As expected!\u2019</p><br/><p>He laughed, stepped forward, nodded his head and replied, \u201cGreetings, Palace Master Dongfang.\u201d Elder Fei Lun did not raise any objections to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lack of decorum. Back when Zhou Weiqing proved that he was a God Tier Master, he gained the right to be arrogant.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing carefully perceived the Palace Master. However, he realized that his perception was vanishing as though it was sinking into the ocean. It did not give him any useful information. However, he felt that the Palace Master was giving off an extremely heavy and profound aura. Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel the connection between himself and the Atmospheric Energy weakening greatly by him simply standing there.</p><br/><p>Dongfang said indifferently, \u201cMaster Zhou, I\u2019m truly astounded that you are already capable of making God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls at such a young age. Nie Han and Meng Xing have already told me about your situation. We of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace fully welcome a talented Master like you. Please do state your requests if there are any. I\u2019ll strive to fulfill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a request. I joined the Mysterious Heavenly Palace for the purpose of being able to study Consolidating Equipment Scrolls better. Therefore, I must request that the Palace Master provide me with various materials. Also, I do not have the time to make Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for others. Those of insufficient rank should not come and bother me. On top of that, I hope to join the Mysterious Heavenly Palace as a guest as I do not wish for others to order me around. Of course, I won\u2019t decline if the Palace Master needs my help.\u201d</p><br/><p>If anyone else had made such a request, the elder behind him would have already attacked without the need for the Palace Master to act. However, when these words were spoken by someone at the God Tier, it became a different matter.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master nodded and said, \u201cNaturally. Master Zhou, your request is approved. As long as my Mysterious Heavenly Palace can find the materials, you\u2019re free to use them. However, I sincerely hope that a portion of Master Zhou\u2019s finished products would be given to me for handling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not hesitate to lower his head. \u201cAs long as my wife and I do not need it, I will give it to you. However, I cannot guarantee the success rate. I hope you will not blame me for wasting materials when the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Palace Master laughed. \u201cThe Mysterious Heavenly Palace still has a level of confidence. Does Master Zhou have any other requests?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cI\u2019m probably not like the other God Tier Masters. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m still too young but I prefer the bustle. Therefore, this quiet place is not too suitable for me. Palace Master, I hope you can find me a place to live in Mysterious Heavenly Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to Zhou Weiqing, the faces of the two elders behind the Palace Master twitched. \u2018What do you mean by too young? What a fleece! You\u2019ve already become a God Tier Master around in your early twenties! How can we, the elders, endure this blow?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Palace Master nodded and said, \u201cThat is certainly possible.\u201d He then looked at the two elders behind him and said in a heavy voice, \u201cPass my command down. From this moment forth, Master Zhou will be honored by our palace. His rank will be equivalent to that of a Supreme Elder. Master Zhou\u2019s wife will also be given a position of an elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The two elders replied in a respectful voice. Fei Lun took out a tray from his spatial storage ring and handed it to Zhou Weiqing. There were two sets of clothes on the tray.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master once again nodded to Zhou Weiqing and said, \u201cIn order to welcome Master Zhou to the palace, I will host a grand welcoming ceremony this evening. When the time comes, important members of the palace will come and participate. It\u2019s also the welcoming dinner for you. Master Zhou has been in seclusion for many years and may not be familiar with the situation in this Palace. Elder Fei Lun, you\u2019re to stay behind and explain the palace\u2019s situation to Master Zhou. I still have matters to tend to and will bid my farewell here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A glimmer of happiness flashed on Fei Lun\u2019s face. He had the opportunity to be closer to someone at the God-Tier. This was a good thing.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master turned and left with the other elder. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s performance was perfect as he bowed slightly. Even though he did not follow decorum as expected for the Palace Master\u2019s departure, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s actions had already shown that he had been recognized as a member of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zhou Weiqing found it secretly amusing. He never expected that the Saint Lands he joined was on another continent.</p><br/><p>Fei Lun no longer had the arrogance of when he first met Zhou Weiqing. He stood to the side and said with a smile, \u201cPlease do not be offended. This valley is the most secretive area of the palace. Without any orders from the Master, only two God Tier Masters are allowed to come and go freely. That\u2019s why the Master only brought us both this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and replied, \u201cI understand. The fact that the Palace Master came personally has already proven his sincerity. Elder, please come inside to have a seat. I have no inkling of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, so I will have to trouble you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Lun chuckled and said, \u201cI thought that this might\u2019ve been the case.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

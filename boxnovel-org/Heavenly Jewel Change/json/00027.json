Although he had guessed that his future mother-in-law would be extremely angry after finding out what had happened to Shangguan Bing\u2019er, he had not expected her to be so intrepid, and come knocking.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mother Ling Zihan saw Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s mother, it was as if she was struck by a bolt of lightning, and she stood there shocked and silent, with an obviously strange expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er quickly rushed in front of her mother with a harried expression on her face. \u201cMum, listen to me! It was all a misunderstanding, it wasn\u2019t Little Fatty\u2019s fault!\u201d Although she knew Zhou Weiqing\u2019s real identity, but she was still used to calling him Little Fatty.</p><br/><p>Today, when she returned home, when her mother had taken a look at her, she had already discovered that she had transformed from a young girl to a young woman. The normally gentle and kind mother had been extremely furious, forcing her to say what had happened. After which, she had been dragged all the way to the Admiral\u2019s Manor.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s mother said coldly: \u201cAccidentally killing someone, isn\u2019t it still killing someone? Who are you that you can use my daughter\u2019s virtue as your Sacrifice to Awaken your Heavenly Jewels? Zhou Weiqing, if you are a man, you better commit suicide in front of me, and take responsibility for your actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to her words, Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but get angry as well. \u201cAunty, you do not have to worry, I will definitely take responsibility for Bing\u2019er, and I will definitely not shirk it. No matter what the reason was, I have indeed taken her virtue, but I mostly definitely will not commit suicide in front of you; that would be irresponsible and cause more harm to Bing\u2019er. I will spend my life to repay her, love her, and take care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s mother said scornfully: \u201cYou? You think you deserve my daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMum!\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er was rather anxious in her heart; one side was her mother, and the other side was the man she had accepted; being stuck in the middle was extremely painful for her.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her, not backing down a whit. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I know that with my looks, I probably do not deserve Bing\u2019er. But what can those good looking men do for her, does that really mean they will treat her well? I can be like a bear; on ordinary days, I\u2019ll be lying down, acting foolish yet cute, and she can hug me for warmth or use me as a pillow. In a harsh winter when there is nothing to eat, I am willing to sacrifice myself as food reserves; and in times of danger, I will stand tall and become the most ferocious Heavenly Beast.\u201d When Shangguan Bing\u2019er heard Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, she was dazed with sentiment, her eyes turning red as her eyes grew resolute.</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s mother heard his words, her body trembled a little, and her expression changed, the fierce gaze seeming to waver a little, as if she was remembering something unpleasant. Subsequently, an unbelievably terrifying aura spread out from her, the likes of which Zhou Weiqing had never felt before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a glib tongue you have boy, let me see, what can you rely on to give my daughter happiness.\u201d As she said that, her eyes flared up, and with a wave of her left hand, Shangguan Bing\u2019er stumbled to the side and found herself unable to move. She was extremely shocked as she did not even know that her mother had such a terrifying power.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the beautiful middle aged lady appeared right in front of Zhou Weiqing, her hand hurtling towards his shoulder. Although she was very fierce in her words, she knew her daughter was now having a relationship with this young man, and despite her needing to vent her anger on him, she did not overdo things.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had been training hard these last few weeks, and being attacked suddenly, the Immortal Deity Shield hidden beneath his skin immediately came into effect, and his five energy whirlpools started spinning at top speed, his Heavenly Jewels already appearing around his wrists. With a silver flash of light, he subconsciously used Blink, barely dodging the Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s mother\u2019s blow.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt the hairs on his entire body standing as a chill ran down his spine. He had the feeling that if the he had been hit by that blow, he would have taken a huge injury. That beautiful middle aged lady looked rather frail, but the stress that she gave to him was unprecedented, even compared to when his father was seriously trying to beat him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh? Blink?\u201d The middle aged lady looked at Zhou Weiqing with some surprise, after all it was definitely not easy to dodge that blow of hers, which could easily change directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d At the same time, another voice sounded out, as Ling Zihan finally awoke from her shocked trance. With a step forward, she stood before her son, saying with an excited expression on her face: \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re Tang Xian Elder Sis?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ling Zihan said those words, everyone started, especially Zhou Weiqing; as from appearance, his mother looked at least 7-8 years older than the middle aged lady. More surprising was the fact that they knew each other! Tang Xian looked puzzlingly at Ling Zihan, saying: \u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Zihan said enthusiastically as she rushed forward: \u201cTang Xian Elder Sis! Look carefully, it\u2019s me, Zihan! Those years ago, you and Shangguan Elder Brother saved me at the Dragonpit Riverside. You also stayed at my house for over a month, and at that time you said you liked the environment of my house. I was still a little girl at that time, and Shui Niu was studying at the Jewel Master Academy.\u201d Tang Xian\u2019s eyes showed surprise and happiness as she said: \u201cYou\u2019re little Zihan? It seems just like yesterday, yet already twenty years have passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Zihan held onto Tang Xian\u2019s hand and said: \u201cYes, it\u2019s me! It\u2019s been twenty years, and I\u2019ve grown so old, but Tang Xian Elder Sis, you\u2019re still just as beautiful as you were.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mouth twitched; he had never expected that his mother and his future mother-in-law would know each other. It was lucky that they knew each other too, this future mother-in-law seemed unbelievably powerful, and if his mother did not intervene, he would have been in serious trouble.</p><br/><p>As he thought about that, he silently sidled to the side and helped up Shangguan Bing\u2019er from the ground. At this point, she had also recovered her ability to move, and both of them exchange strange looks. Tang Xian\u2019s eyes suddenly changed and she whipped her head around to stare at Zhou Weiqing: \u201cZihan, this little brat, who is he to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Zihan knew Tang Xian\u2019s power very well, and quickly gripped her hands tightly, saying: \u201cTang Xian Elder Sis, this is my son; mine and Shui Niu\u2019s son. He is our only son, if he has done any wrong, please punish me instead Elder Sis.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xian drew a deep breath, and slowly released it, as she continued glaring at Zhou Weiqing: \u201cZihan, if it were any other thing, I would have easily forgiven him. However, this son of yours took my daughter\u2019s virtue. How could I possibly let him go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? He just returned home, I\u2019m also not sure what is going on. Weiqing, get over here now and kneel down to your Aunt Tang Xian.\u201d Ling Zihan said furiously at Zhou Weiqing, although Shangguan Bing\u2019er, who was standing beside him, could clearly see her giving him a signal with her eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing braced himself as he walked forward, thinking to himself: <em>Kneeling to my mother-in-law, that isn\u2019t so bad. At least it\u2019s not some outsider.</em> Lowering his head, he walked to the front and kneeled down.</p><br/><p>Ling Zihan said: \u201cTang Xian Elder Sis, we haven\u2019t met for so many years, where are you staying now? Where\u2019s Shangguan Elder Brother? Is he good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention him.\u201d Tang Xian revealed a angry and suffering face. \u201cI brought Bing\u2019er to the Heavenly Bow City, but I never expected that you to be here, nor did I expect that the Shui Niu you mentioned years ago would actually turn out to be the Admiral Zhou of Heavenly Bow Empire.</p><br/><p>Ling Zihan gave her son a kick and said: \u201cLittle brat, speak now and tell us what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing once again told his tale, and Tang Xian\u2019s face remained icy, while Ling Zihan was totally dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Shangguan Bing\u2019er also stepped forward to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side and knelt down in front of her mother. \u201cMum, I also like Little Fatty. What happened in the past was a mistake, and wasn\u2019t his fault. After that, on the battlefield, Little Fatty saved my life twice, and was even willing to sacrifice his life for me when we were surrounded by the Forest Direwolves, attempting to let me escape. Mum, I will not like another man in my life again. If you kill him, then you must kill me as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s words caused both Zhou Weiqing and Ling Zihan to be visibly moved, and the shock and excitement in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart almost caused him to lose his composure. This was the first time Shangguan Bing\u2019er had actually admitted verbally that she liked him, and especially that line that she would never like another man again, it struck the softest spot in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart. At the same time Ling Zihan was very touched, thinking to herself: That little girl doesn\u2019t seem to have inherited her mother\u2019s fiery temper, that\u2019s lucky, that\u2019s lucky.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Tang Xian\u2019s brow furrowed, before she sighed and said: \u201cGrown girls are hard to keep at home\u2026 grown girls are hard to keep at home [1. That\u2019s the literal translation of , usually used as a lament by parents as their daughters grow up and need to be married off into another family. In chinese culture, the female is married into the male\u2019s family, so they \u2018lose\u2019 their daughter in that sense.] Sigh, never mind, this little brat Zhou Weiqing shall have the advantage\u2026 show me your Heavenly Jewels.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xian originally brought her daughter here because she was angry, but also as a bluff, a show of strength. As a mother, how could she not see that her daughter really liked that Zhou Weiqing, but as a mother, she also wanted to vent her anger and also test that little rascal as well. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s performance had satisfied her, and with Ling Zihan mediating, he was saved the beating as well. After all, he was a Heavenly Jewel Master, one with the Spatial Attribute, and could be considered a decent match for her daughter. She just wanted to verify what attribute his Elemental Jewel was.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing showed his wrists dutifully, and when Tang Xian saw the blue-green Cat\u2019s Eye Jewel around his wrist, her face changed instantly and she grabbed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s left hand, saying in shock: \u201cAlexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt Tang Xian\u2019s hand like a vice around his wrist, causing it to hurt, and he gave a bitter smile as he nodded: \u201cYes! Aunty, that is an Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xian seemed stunned as she said rather absentmindedly: \u201cWhat attributes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cWind, Lightning, Spatial, Darkness, Evil\u2026\u201d As he said up to there, he paused a moment, then continued resolutely: \u201cAnd one more attribute that I haven\u2019t been able to identify.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, even Shangguan Bing\u2019er was surprised; she had not known that Zhou Weiqing still had a sixth attribute.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her apologetically, nodding his head. He did not want to hide anything further from Shangguan Bing\u2019er, her words just now had touched him deeply.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

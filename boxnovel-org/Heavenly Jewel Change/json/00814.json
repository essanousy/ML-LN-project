Instead, it was more like an implosion that gradually developed into an explosion as it spread further. The terrifying explosion made the sky seem like a palace of light and darkness. At this moment, the sky was like it was being lit with splendid fireworks while a large amount of Destruction Attribute energy spread all around. Regardless if it was the gigantic body of Long Shiya or Shen Mo\u2019s huge engulfing mouth, neither of them could be seen right now.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain began shaking vigorously. Not only did it tremble here, but even the entire Wan Shou Heaven was shaking. It seemed like the end of the world was coming and everything was about to be destroyed. To Zhou Weiqing, the terrifying energy explosion in the air made him immensely nervous. He knew Long Shiya\u2019s abilities very well but it was his master\u2019s first time in combat ever since he became a Heavenly God. At the same time, they had no idea how long the opponent had been a Heavenly God cultivator for.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing would rather lose the battle and even the entire Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands rather than see Long Shiya get injured. He already thought of surrendering when Long Shiya\u2019s Six Ultimate Divine Territory was covered by the opponent\u2019s Destructive Divine Territory. However, Zhou Weiqing was shocked at the attack that Long Shiya launched afterward and secretly praised him in his heart \u2014 this was true control. Although Zhou Weiqing had Saint Energy and the six attributes, he was far less familiar than Long Shiya when it came to controlling the attributes.</p><br/><p>Safe to say, Long Shiya had reached a godlike level of control over his six attributes. The sequence, combination, and control of each attribute were done in perfect harmony. Though it did not seem like the attack was laced with the six attributes, they were actually witnessing something far more powerful than the impact of an attack merged with six attributes.</p><br/><p>This was true strength! However, his opponent was a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse after all. After exhibiting such precise control, it had taken a toll on Long Shiya\u2019s Divine Thought. If he did not win from this attack, Long Shiya might be at risk. The opponent had defeated two Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell and Zhou Weiqing knew that as long as Shen Mo had the opportunity, he would definitely not let go of Long Shiya. Losing to a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse would definitely have a huge impact, be it to Zhou Weiqing or the Peerless Sect. Zhou Weiqing was even ready to join the battle, even if it means going against the rules. He would definitely not let his master die on the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Fen Tian was anxious as well, as Long Shiya becoming a Heavenly God was beyond his expectation. Shen Mo\u2019s victory in this battle would bring more opportunities to the Blood Red Hell from the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands, and in order for the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands to carry on according to his plans, the victory of this battle was crucial.</p><br/><p>Besides, it was the same thing to the Blood Red Hell as it was extremely important for them to have a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse who possessed the Destructive Divine Territory. Fen Tian might not feel sad even if ten Heavenly Emperors were dead, but he might actually go insane if Shen Mo was killed in the battle.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian looked at Zhou Weiqing by instinct and the both of them glared at each other, seemingly wanting to see the strong will to kill in the eyes of the opposing party. Not only did they plan a rescue, they also wanted to fight each other. A confrontational atmosphere broke out all of a sudden. A golden layer filled with the divine aura of a powerhouse appeared at that moment and covered the top of the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>It was the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, Xue Ao\u2019tian. Nobody knew what he was thinking about when he looked at Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian casually. However, a strong tremor descended when the golden glow appeared, creating layers of glowing mist within the golden glow. It was Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s territory. He did not hope that the Heavenly Snow Mountain would get destroyed by the impact of Long Shiya and Shen Mo\u2019s battle. Because of this, he made the first move. If Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian wanted to fight each other, they would not only have to deal with each other, but would also have to break through these chains.</p><br/><p>A terrifying energy wave exploded in the air all of the sudden. Zhou Weiqing looked shocked as he watched the scenes unfold in mid-air. Fen Tian had the same shocked expression as well as they looked at the changes happening in the sky. The initial darkness had disappeared completely, and the Destructive Divine Territory vanished just like that. Finally, it was broken by Six Ultimate Heavenly God\u2019s full-force attack.</p><br/><p>However, Long Shiya\u2019s gigantic body had disappeared as well. The explosion of the Destructive Divine Territory had a major impact on Shen Mo and Long Shiya. He could not hold on to his Six Ultimate Divine Territory anymore as he had over-consumed his Divine Thought. Besides, that was the last attack of the Destructive Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Shen Mo and Long Shiya were still in the air but they were pulled a distance of thousands of meters apart. They looked at each other and were both a little pale, especially Shen Mo. His body was slightly shaking while Long Shiya had his eyes closed and his body trembled lightly for a second.</p><br/><p>Everyone else was silent. The audience was indulging themselves in the clash of the two Heavenly God-tier powerhouses. Long Shiya who was at a disadvantage against Shen Mo on his cultivation base and Divine Territory managed to turn the tables with his knowledge and amazing control of the six attributes. At that moment, it was hard to tell who was winning but at least the Six Ultimate Heavenly God was not on the losing end.</p><br/><p>Safe to say, this was by far the most exciting battle that the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands had ever seen. The battle of two Heavenly Gods had silenced all the attribute energies within hundreds of miles. Shen Mo looked at Long Shiya who was before him with a puzzled look in his eyes. Never did he expect that he would not be able to defeat Long Shiya with his Destructive Divine Territory, especially since he had already arrived at the Heavenly God Tier. He knew very well about his condition \u2013 he was wounded. When he got to the Heavenly God Tier, his physique became terrifyingly powerful, making it difficult for him to sustain injuries. However, it was not that easy for him to heal the moment he got wounded.</p><br/><p>The current situation was simple. Shen Mo was wounded; he had even wounded his Qi while Long Shiya had exhausted his Divine Thought. Overall, they were in equal positions but Shen Mo was at a slight disadvantage. However, no matter who attempted to kill who, they would still have to brave the risk of the both of them perishing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that Brother Long would be able to destroy my Destructive Divine Thought. Brother Long, why don\u2019t we announce this battle as a tie? What do you think of not participating in the tournament any longer? Give the opportunity to other people instead. Let\u2019s not change the ranking as well.\u201d Shen Mo said quietly.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya neither opened his eyes nor argued with him, \u201cAlright.\u201d The both of them descended from the sky after that simple response and returned to their places accordingly. They crossed their legs to recover as soon as they could, at almost the same time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian went behind them respectively and helped them heal. Xue Ao\u2019tian and Shangguan Tianyang looked at each other and had an odd expression in their eyes. They were in luck today. They knew very well that as long as they did not join the tournament, Long Shiya or Shen Mo could easily defeat any contender from both sides. The tie allowed the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to stay in the tournament.</p><br/><p>It was a lady who entered the ring from the Peerless Sect\u2019s corner. Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue looked uncomfortable when they saw the lady appearing, as it was Shangguan Xue\u2019er who represented the Peerless Sect this time. The situation was the same as it was in the last battle. Two Heavenly King-tier powerhouses represented the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. However, the Heavenly Snow Mountain had the upper hand this time. If they won, they would have to quit the tournament and pass the next battle to Love Valley and Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>This time, Huang Xingyun seemed to have learned his lesson and sent out a Heavenly King-tier powerhouse right away. Fen Tian sent a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse after some thought, but the results were expected \u2013 the Blood Red Hell won. Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue then became anxious all of a sudden. Although they knew that Shangguan Xue\u2019er had almost reached the Heavenly King Tier and that she had consolidated a few pieces of the Boundless Infinitum Set, she was facing a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse from the Blood Red Hell! It was not easy to fight a Heavenly Emperor cultivator from the Blood Red Hell who possessed the Destruction Attribute. Even with the slightest mistake, she might lose her life. The Peerless Sect had killed the people from the Blood Red Hell before. They would definitely not show mercy to Shangguan Xue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>The two brothers then looked at Long Shiya who stopped his battle due to his wounds and shifted their gaze toward Zhou Weiqing. They had a strong resentment and questions in their eyes. The Heavenly Emperor that was sent by the Blood Red Hell was called Tian Yu. In Blood Red Hell, the family name \u2018Tian\u2019 and \u2018Shen\u2019 were the two biggest family names that had been managing the Blood Red Hell. Fen Tian had the family name of Tian but it got switched around. The powerhouse who was named Tian Yu was Fen Tian\u2019s cousin.</p><br/><p>Tian Yu could not help but frown when he looked at the young Shangguan Xue\u2019er and said in disdain, \u201cIt seems like the Peerless Sect is left with Wu Yunyue and Long Shiya, those two old men. Even a little girl like you would have to sacrifice your life here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er looked coldly and Zhou Weiqing spoke just as she was about to say something, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing strode to Shangguan Xue\u2019er as he spoke. He then said to Fen Tian who was on the Blood Red Hell\u2019s side, \u201cIf I recall correctly, according to the rules of the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands, the lords of the Five Great Saints Lands can change the participants on their own corner as and when they please. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked by what Zhou Weiqing had just said. The Peerless Sect\u2019s ability had been proven by Wu Yunyue and Long Shiya \u2013 nobody dared to underestimate them. However, what Zhou Weiqing just did had confused everyone there.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

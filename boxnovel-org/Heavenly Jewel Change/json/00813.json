Regarding their cultivation base, Long Shiya who possessed six attributes had the upper hand. However, regarding their Divine Territories, Shen Mo\u2019s was far superior. Moreover, Shen Mo had a ten-piece legendary set on him, which surpassed the nine-piece Hiltless Heavenly Purging Set. Therefore, Long Shiya was at a slight disadvantage, as the both of them were equally matched.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Long Shiya transformed himself into a shadow, Shen Mo did not just watch and do nothing. He moved his body in a flash and indulged in his own Destructive Thought. The huge engulfing mouth expanded at an instant, and the rich purplish-black color seemed like it had materialized as it attempted to bite Long Shiya ferociously. The combination of the Divine Territory and the physical body was a battle technique exclusive to a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. At that moment, they were both like gods. If their attacks were used in human wars, it was sufficient to destroy hundreds of thousands of soldiers within a short period of time.</p><br/><p>Besides, the biggest characteristic of the Heavenly God-tier powerhouse was that their personal cultivation base was almost unlimited. Without having to absorb too much Atmospheric Energy for their individual circulation, they could create massive amounts of energy on their own. That was the biggest difference between the Heavenly God Tier and the Heavenly Emperor Tier. Therefore, even though Shen Mo\u2019s overall ability was slightly more powerful than Long Shiya\u2019s, it was not easy to take advantage of the latter.</p><br/><p>It had been years since the last battle between the Heavenly God-tier powerhouses on the Boundless Mainland. At that moment, the Five Great Saints Lands\u2019 powerhouses had even forgotten that the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands was ongoing. All of them were focused as they looked into the sky, as none of them wanted to miss such an exciting battle.</p><br/><p>The huge engulfing mouth that Shen Mo merged with became extremely ferocious and attempted to bite Long Shiya\u2019s gigantic body in a frenzied manner. He managed to tear a couple of pieces of his flesh forcefully, very quickly. Moreover, a layer of a rich, black destructive Qi current dashed up wildly with every tear, as it attempted to cover Long Shiya\u2019s gigantic body so it could erode his body with Destructive Thought.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that Long Shiya was on the losing end now. However, it was not as easy to handle the Six Ultimate Heavenly God. After a loud bang was heard, Long Shiya\u2019s gigantic body \u2013 which was in the air \u2013 became transparent out of nowhere, while the six-colored lights separated themselves into individual lights. Then, a series of peculiar sights appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>The first that erupted was the Wind Attribute. A rich green light now erupted from the Six Ultimate Heavenly God\u2019s gigantic body. Countless Wind Blades formed into a tornado and sliced the Destruction Energy from all directions. A screeching sound was made when the Destruction Energy was sliced by the Wind Attribute. Regular people aside, even Heavenly King-tier powerhouses activated their Heavenly Energy to protect their ears or they may lose their ability to hear forever.</p><br/><p>This was just the beginning. The reason why the Wind Blades did not destroy the Destruction Attribute right away was mainly caused by the limited amount of Saint Energy in them. Under such conditions, although the Wing Blade\u2019s slicing ability was limited, it prevented the terrifying Destruction Attribute energy from further eroding Long Shiya\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Countless green Wind Blades were clearly seen embedded in the black energy. Then, the Fire Attribute was the next one to erupt. The Fire Attribute attack was the most primitive one \u2014 a fireball. The fireballs did not directly hit the Destruction Energy. Instead, it collided with the Wind Blades that erupted earlier. There is a saying that goes \u2014 the wind helps the spread of fire. During the collision of the Wind Blades and the fireballs, the latter exploded first and a series of roars could be heard. On top of that, the series of explosions combined with the Wind Attribute resulted in the strengthening of the terrifying Fire Attribute energy even further. The explosion created a space around the gigantic body that Long Shiya had transformed into. Massive amounts of Destruction Energy had been driven out. Although it could not be destroyed, at least it managed to put a distance between them.</p><br/><p>Shen Mo was shocked. He had never encountered something like this for as long as he possessed the Destruction Attribute. To him, the Wind Attribute, Fire Attribute or any element attributes could be absorbed by the Destruction Attribute easily. However, what he was experiencing was not like that at all. Furthermore, he was far behind the control ability that Long Shiya had for the energy. Although the Destruction Attribute had the upper hand \u2013 like what the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain Xue Ao\u2019tian had mentioned before \u2013 Long Shiya had outstanding talent as the Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation was one-of-a-kind. In terms of control, almost nobody could compare to Long Shiya. Even Xue Ao\u2019tian admitted that he was no match for Long Shiya before he arrived the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Long Shiya showcased his powerful control ability. Each of the fireballs positioned with every single one of the Wind Blades. That alone was shocking enough. It was not just one or two fireballs, but at least tens of thousands of fireballs that were so dense, it could not even be seen with the naked eye in the collision!</p><br/><p>Fire came after wind, but earth came after fire. Sharp, earthy thorns exploded from the air. At an instant, Long Shiya\u2019s body looked like it had transformed into a huge porcupine. Countless earthy thorns passed across the flames and pierced the Destruction Attribute. Each earthy thorn instantly became harder under the high temperature as they passed through the flames. Most of the earthy thorns were even refined to the point that they looked crystal clear, akin to a stone sculpture. Their destructive ability had increased tremendously.</p><br/><p>After earth, came water. Countless pillars of water erupted. They were not there to destroy but to boost the earthy thorns. Each of them had become the driving force for the earthy thorns to move forward. Under such conditions, the impact of the earthy thorns became even more terrifying. One could see clearly that the Destruction Energy that made it hard for them to move forward earlier was now pierced by countless earthy thorns. As a series of bangs filled the air, narrow and long channels were opened.</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, even a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse who could produce tremendous energy could not withstand such large amounts of energy consumption! The Destructive Divine Territory that initially had a clear lead and the upper hand, had suddenly dimmed a little. However, this was not the end of Long Shiya\u2019s onslaught. He was the Six Ultimate Heavenly God, not the Four Ultimate Heavenly God.</p><br/><p>The last to appear was naturally Light and Darkness. These two do not appear as individuals but as one. One after the other, sparkling, crystal clear light balls appeared out of thin air. The balls of light were rather peculiar as they had two colors to them \u2013 black on one side and gold on the other. The two colors took their turns shining in the sky as they released a peculiar wave of energy. If observed closely, one would notice that the dual-colored light balls had circles of distorted energy waves around them. It was easy to imagine how terrifying the energy was in there.</p><br/><p>The light balls used the simplest route as they headed toward the channels created from the piercing earthy thorns. A terrifying wave of energy was flowing in the air. The light balls did not pierce through these channels. Instead, they paused when they reached the center of the Destructive Energy. As the light balls paused midair, the powerhouses on the Heavenly Snow Mountain below held their breaths. Many of them predicted what Long Shiya was going to do \u2013 even Shen Mo knew it all too well. However, he did not have the ability to stop Long Shiya at that moment at all.</p><br/><p>Shen Mo had been handling the explosion of the four attributes in a state of panic earlier. His Divine Territory might not be able to hold out from the full-force impact by the four attributes if he did not have the Destructive Divine Territory. As soon as his Destructive Divine Territory was destroyed, his advantage would become a disadvantage. He definitely did not wish to see that happening. He knew very well that although the attack that Long Shiya performed was powerful, it drained his body. As long as he managed to withstand this onslaught, he would be the one who would emerge victoriously.</p><br/><p>In reality, Shen Mo was being careless. He was relaxed as he had the upper hand earlier. To him, Long Shiya would definitely lose as long as he absorbed his energy with the help of the Destructive Divine Territory. Never would he have thought that Long Shiya would have such an ability. Most importantly, he had underestimated Long Shiya\u2019s control of his abilities. If it was performed by someone else, like Zhou Weiqing for example, it would be impossible for him to control it as accurately as Long Shiya. Besides, without accurate control, it was naturally impossible for the four attributes to come together so smoothly, and the impact of the attack would naturally be far less effective than this.</p><br/><p>On after the other, the crystal clear, dual-colored light balls that seemed shine with various colors paused in mid-air just like that. The locations that they paused at was almost at the center of the channel. At that moment, the only thing that Shen Mo could do was to give his all to boost his Destructive Divine Territory to make it denser. However, Long Shiya\u2019s attacks were connected to one another without delay.</p><br/><p>Then, an explosion occurred. Though the effects of light and darkness colliding should have resulted in the two opposite energies disappearing, they exploded instead. The explosions were ten times to a hundred times more powerful than the explosion of the Fire Attribute. Long Shiya spent his entire life mastering the six attributes to the point where he could control each attribute with utter ease. Naturally, he knew how to control the Light and Darkness Attributes very well. Each of the dual-colored light balls\u2019 was separated at a distance with a layer of energy made up from gently merging the six attributes, ensuring they did not come into contact with one another. At that very moment, Long Shiya removed the layer of energy made from the six attributes, causing the terrifying explosion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

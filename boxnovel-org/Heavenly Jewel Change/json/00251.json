He was located right in the chest of that enormous gray figure, which seemed to be like his background. Heaven and Earth had turned gray, while the light of the sun and moon both vanished. The only thing which filled the vast sea was a boundless Demonic energy.</p><br/><p>Yes.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing had once more summoned the Demon God to descend upon the world.</p><br/><p>The Demon God.\u00a0The Ward of the Demon God had summoned the Demon God.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy had been virtually exhausted, but he could clearly sense that this Demon God was completely different from the ones of the past.</p><br/><p>Last time he had summoned the Demon God, a mere image of it had appeared for an instant.\u00a0This time, he had suffered the true projection of the Demon God.\u00a0It no longer was limited to just a single second.</p><br/><p>The enormous image of the Demon God stood silently behind Zhou Weiqing, but this was already enough.\u00a0What surprised Zhou Weiqing was that when the Demon God had appeared, all of the Saint Energy in his body had completely evaporated and then poured into the Demon God.\u00a0But of course, once the Demon God had actually appeared, all Attributes of atmospheric energies in the sea and in the heavens began to flood towards the Demon God\u2019s body with terrifying, inconceivable speed.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing was impacted by this as well.\u00a0The Saint Energy in his body had already been squeezed try, and now it greedily absorbed all these disparate types of atmospheric energies and furiously converted them to replenish his own stores.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy in his body actually seemed to be turning even purer as a result. The astral silver light now glowed even more dazzlingly, while the thirty-six Death Acupuncture Points no longer rotated so madly. Instead, they transformed into thirty-six holes of pure devouring power which swallowed all types of atmospheric bodies into his body.</p><br/><p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing himself didn\u2019t realize that the reason he was able to accomplish this wasn\u2019t because of the Saint Energy\u2019s revival abilities.\u00a0Instead, it was because of his own bloodline.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s own body contained the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline.\u00a0This was a bloodline which was on par with the Dragon Emperor Bloodline\u2026 and the most powerful aspect of the Dark Demon God Tiger\u2019s Bloodline was the strand of the Demon God Lineage.\u00a0It could be said that under this tremendous pressure, all of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s latent power had been fully activated.\u00a0He had been able to merge together that strand of the Dark Demon God Lineage into his own Saint Energy, and as a result was able to summon a true projection of the Demon God.</p><br/><p>This was the true Demon God, something which eclipsed all Heavenly Gods.\u00a0Even though it was a mere projection which couldn\u2019t actually fight on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s behalf, its appearance caused all atmospheric energies to obey its bidding unless an aura which was on par with it appeared.</p><br/><p>Right.\u00a0This Demon God projection couldn\u2019t even help Zhou Weiqing with a single attack, which the projections he had summoned when he was young and weak were capable of.\u00a0However... its aura and majesty was that of the true Demon God\u2019s.\u00a0It didn\u2019t NEED to launch any attacks.\u00a0As soon as it appeared the Terror Sea Dragon dove into the seas, completely overwhelmed by fear.\u00a0It didn\u2019t dare to launch any further attacks against Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing himself was immersed in a marvelous state.\u00a0Just ten seconds later, all of the Saint Energy he had exhausted was completely replenished, and it was actually increased by a certain degree.\u00a0More importantly, his Saint Energy had become even purer.\u00a0He could vaguely sense that he could \u2018touch\u2019 the edges of the thirty-eighth level.</p><br/><p><em>Demon God.\u00a0Have I truly revived the Demon God?</em> However, he quickly realized that he was wrong. He was completely incapable of maintaining any sort of connection with the Demon God which had appeared behind him. In fact, there wasn\u2019t even a voice in his mind like there had been the previous time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt a bit depressed, but the entire battlefield had changed due to the Demon God he had summoned.</p><br/><p>First of all, the Terror Sea Dragon that was responsible for reinforcing the first one had been terrified into diving deep into the oceans.\u00a0It didn\u2019t even dare to try and flee.\u00a0Instead, it curled up into a ball within the sea, releasing all of its energies to try and resist the terrible, corrosive power of the Demon God.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the Tenebrous Sealing Formation was partially formed from the Demonic Attribute. Now that the world outside suddenly became suffused with the Demonic Attribute, the sealing formation\u2019s power almost instantly skyrocketed. The Terror Sea Dragon within it had already been at a disadvantage; now, the sudden increase in pressure put it in an incredibly dangerous position.</p><br/><p>However, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake had finally realized what was going on at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side.\u00a0When they saw the all-encompassing gray figure which had appeared outside the Tenebrous Sealing Formation and Zhou Weiqing standing within it, they couldn\u2019t help but slow down their attacks.</p><br/><p><em>H-he actually managed to stop the Terror Sea Dragon.\u00a0What power is this?\u00a0How can it be this terrifying?</em> None of the Xuantian Palace powerhouses knew how Zhou Weiqing had done this. They were no longer capable of evaluating exactly how powerful he was\u2026 and right at this moment, the Terror Sea Dragon in the Tenebrous Sealing Formation finally exploded with power.</p><br/><p>Any creature, when faced with certain death, wouldn\u2019t just lie down for its killers.\u00a0This was doubly true for Heavenly Gods.</p><br/><p>As the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake paused for a moment in shock, an incredibly dense streak of deep blue light suddenly shot out of the centermost part of the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>This blue light looked completely different from anything else.\u00a0No one had ever seen this blue color, and it gave off a feeling of coziness and clarity.\u00a0A terrifying ripple of energy instantly spread outwards, and with each transformation of the energy the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s giant body would shudder.\u00a0Layers of this azure light blasted out unabated from within its body, while the terrifying aura emanating from it seemed about ready to tear through the recently-strengthened formation.</p><br/><p>What was this?!</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon cried out in shock, \u201cNot good.\u00a0It is going to self-detonate its Heavenly Core Nucleus.\u00a0Quick, stop it!\u201d</p><br/><p>At a time like this, Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon didn\u2019t dare to hold anything back at all.\u00a0If the Terror Sea Dragon succeeded in this self-detonation, most likely no one within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation would survive.</p><br/><p>Dense bloody light shot into the air, while the Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s body almost instantly lost its luster.\u00a0However, the blood-red light instantly poured into Dreamwake\u2019s body, then flooded into the Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d Dreamwake cried in her lovely voice, letting the Dragon Spear explode with incomparably dazzling light.\u00a0The devilish blood-colored light grew brighter, while the Dragon Spear shot out of Dreamwake\u2019s hands and instantly transformed into an enormous spear which was fifty meters long and glowed with blood-red light.\u00a0It instantly traversed the distance between her and the Terror Sea Dragon.</p><br/><p>The Terror Sea Dragon had chosen to self-detonate its Heavenly Core Nucleus at the very last moment, while the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake had activated this attack called \u2018Extermination\u2019.</p><br/><p>Previously, they had held back and not used it.\u00a0Even when the other Terror Sea Dragon had appeared and posed an enormous risk to them, they still hadn\u2019t used it.\u00a0This was because once they used this attack, Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s power would instantly drop by 90%.\u00a0To them, this was essentially an attack that came from their core essence.</p><br/><p>Once \u2018Extermination\u2019 shot out, victory or defeat would be determined.\u00a0It had set alight all of the Heavenly Energy within Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake, which had been poured into this single attack.\u00a0You can imagine how incredible it was!</p><br/><p>An ear-piercing screech rang out as the Terror Sea Dragon made its response.\u00a0Although it had yet to truly activate all the energies within its Heavenly Core Nucleus, it still chose to self-detonate.\u00a0Otherwise, once it was hit by this \u2018Extermination\u2019 attack, it wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to self-detonate.</p><br/><p>Anyone watching from afar would be able to see with clarity how the entire surface of the sea suddenly shuddered violently.\u00a0All of the black light within the enormous Tenebrous Sealing Formation suddenly contracted as an incomparably terrifying explosion blasted out of it.</p><br/><p>Even though it had suffered from the \u2018Extermination\u2019 attack and had been locked away by the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, this remained a Heavenly God powerhouse\u2019s self-detonation!</p><br/><p>The terrifying explosive force caused all living beings to shudder.\u00a0In an instant, an utterly vast azure mushroom cloud that was completely formed from water and a thousand meters tall suddenly appeared within the sea.</p><br/><p>The terrifying azure light contained a mixture of black, gray, and blood-colored light, and it instantly expanded outwards.\u00a0All living beings within a hundred meters were almost instantly crushed into dust and killed by this terrifying power, leaving nothing behind.</p><br/><p>Utter misery.\u00a0This was true, utter misery for all living beings.\u00a0As for the giant gray figure that had towered over all things, it too was annihilated by that terrifying blast.</p><br/><p>The Demon God projection only had the Demon God\u2019s aura; it wasn\u2019t capable of enduring any attacks at all.\u00a0Given Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base, how could he possibly summon the actual power of the Demon God, even if he did use Saint Energy?\u00a0The point of this Demon God projection was to make it so that your enemies wouldn\u2019t even dare to think about attacking you.</p><br/><p>However, once the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s self-detonation appeared the Demon God projection was destroyed. Thankfully, its brief appearance had been summoned by Zhou Weiqing via the Ward of the Demon God. As soon as that terrifying blast had appeared, all of the Demonic energy quickly wrapped around Zhou Weiqing and did its best to protect him.</p><br/><p>It was at times like this that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s natural toughness revealed itself.\u00a0Dragon-Tiger Transformation.\u00a0Immortal Deity Shield.\u00a0Ward of the Demon God.\u00a0All of these powerful defensive techniques overlaid on each other.\u00a0Although he was sent flying by that terrifying explosion of energy, he didn\u2019t suffer any actual injuries.\u00a0Of course, this was also because the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s self-detonation hadn\u2019t been fully successful in drawing out all the energy within its Heavenly Core Nucleus, and it had also been weakened by the \u2018Extermination\u2019 attack and the Tenebrous Sealing Formation.\u00a0Otherwise, the field of death wouldn\u2019t have been a mere hundred kilometers in size.</p><br/><p>Heavenly God powerhouses were, by nature, figures with unearthly levels of power!\u00a0The death of such a figure could unleash an absolutely indescribable amount of destructive energies.</p><br/><p>Simply put\u2026 if this had happened on land, the self-detonation of something as powerful as a Terror Sea Dragon would\u2019ve been able to wipe out at least half the Fei Li Empire. You can imagine how powerful it was!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

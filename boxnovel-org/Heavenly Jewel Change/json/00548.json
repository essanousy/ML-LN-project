In terms of interpersonal interaction, she was far worse than Shangguan Fei\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you say then?\u201d She subconsciously thought that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words did make some sense, and she actually asked out loud.</p><br/><p>How could Zhou Weiqing not seize such a perfect opportunity? All this while, he had been talking nonsense to Shangguan Xue\u2019er for a simple reason \u2013 to delay time. No one else knew how terrifying Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Heavenly Energy recovery speed was. With just his Dragon-Tiger Transformation wings and his Immortal Deity Technique circulating at max speed, his recovery rate would truly shock the entire world. In just a matter of their short conversation so far, he had already recovered another ten percent of his energy. Naturally, he did not mind continuing speaking more. At the same time, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was still dressed in her Boundless Infinitum Set Consolidated Equipment, and instead of recovering Heavenly Energy, it was still draining from her\u2026 or at the very least an equilibrium that did not allow her to recover. With such a contrast, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current severe disadvantage could possibly be reversed!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026. This\u2026 Well\u2026.\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked to be deep in thought, and after some musing, he finally said: \u201cHow about this? You three sisters are triplets, and your relationship is so strong between each other. In the future, if Bing\u2019er and Fei\u2019er both marry me, you will be left alone. I will feel really bad about that. If I defeat you, why don\u2019t you just marry me as well? How about that? Betting your future against my life\u2026 that is a fair trade right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er truly wanted to give him a piece of her mind! Fair trade my foot! However, at this point, her mind was not even in a fully clear state. All she wanted to do was to get Zhou Weiqing down as quickly as possible and give him a savage beating before talking about anything else. Furthermore, he did not even have his own Legendary Set any longer, how could he possibly defeat her?!</p><br/><p>Of course, this was also because Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not know Zhou Weiqing well enough. If it were Shangguan Bing\u2019er or Shangguan Fei\u2019er here right now, they would never bet with him. That rascal, when had he ever lost out in a bet? Would he ever come up with a bet that he had no confidence in winning? The answer was clear \u2013 a huge no! Alas, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had slowly fallen in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s trap.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. I agree. Come down here and accept your death then!\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er cried out angrily.</p><br/><p>It was actually Zhou Weiqing\u2019s turn to be surprised. Originally, he had planned to give such an absurd terms of betting that Shangguan Xue\u2019er would be enraged and argue with him further, letting him have more time to recover. He had not expected that it would actually backfire, and Shangguan Xue\u2019er would just agree like that\u2026 not leaving him with any more time!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really said it yourself? Will you really live up to your words?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked tentatively.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er was no fool, as she saw the cunning light in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes, she instantly knew that this rascal was up to no good. At the same time, she quickly saw that Zhou Weiqing was doing his best to recover his Heavenly Energy, which was why she agreed so quickly. She planned to end this fight quickly, not giving him anymore time to recover.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Shangguan Xue\u2019er, swear to the heavens. If today, Zhou Weiqing can defeat the Boundless Infinitum Sword in my hands, I will marry him. If I break my vow, may lightning descend from the heavens and destroy me body and soul, so that I will be cast out from the reincarnation cycle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s vow was vicious indeed, but short and sweet. In barely a moment, she had finished it, and she turned a disdainful and provoking gaze to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was after all a man. With Shangguan Xue\u2019er already agreeing so quickly to his absurd terms, how could he possibly continue running away and stay in the sky? He knew that if he really continued to fly in the air to finish recovering his Heavenly Energy, Shangguan Xue\u2019er would forever hold him in contempt, and who knows if she might even start using any secret arts to recover her own Heavenly Energy\u2026 and what the final result would be from that again.</p><br/><p>Gritting his teeth, Zhou Weiqing descended from the skies, landing not far from Shangguan Xue\u2019er. His expression was grave, but he crooked his finger at her and said solemnly: \u201cCome then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was really back on the ground, Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not hesitate any longer. In a flash, the Boundless Infinitum Sword in her hands had pierced out towards him. At this point, Zhou Weiqing no longer had his \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set, and it was without question that his fighting capabilities had dropped drastically, no longer with that terrifying physical strength. With her own powerful sword intent, though she had now swapped to her left hand, Shangguan Xue\u2019er still had absolute confidence in defeating ZHou Weiqing quickly.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the Boundless Infinitum Sword had reached Zhou Weiqing, striking out at his right chest.</p><br/><p>Seeing the Boundless Infinitum Sword strike out at him, a faint smile appeared on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face. It was not a mocking one indeed, but one with a hint of appreciation and gratitude. No matter what her words were, even in such an angry state, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s actions showed that she was not truly trying to kill him. Otherwise, that sword would be aimed at his left chest, not the right.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire expression was grave and serious. However, to Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s surprise, as her sword pierced right in front of Zhou Weiqing, he did not make any move to dodge at all.</p><br/><p>With a sickening thud, the Boundless Infinitum Sword pierced right into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, shoving right through his chest. Yet, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s only action was to suddenly raise both hands, grabbing onto the blade with his bare hands!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er was totally caught by surprise. When her sword had pierced right through Zhou Weiqing, she had already been shocked and dazed. No matter what, she had not expected that he would not even make an attempt to dodge.</p><br/><p>It was not that she felt any heartache for Zhou Weiqing, after all she was still hating that fellow. However, just like what Zhou Weiqing said, no matter what he was still her future brother in law! It was concerning both her sisters\u2019 future happiness. Both Shangguan Bing\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er loved Zhou Weiqing so much, and if she killed him with that single sword pierce, how could she account it to her sisters?!</p><br/><p>As such, when the sword in her hands pierced through Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right chest, she was totally dumbfounded. She did not realise that as the sword pierced through, there was no blood at all. At this point, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands suddenly grabbed onto her Boundless Infinitum Sword. Instantly, a terrifying suction force drew upon Shangguan Xue\u2019er through the Boundless Infinitum Sword.</p><br/><p>Demonic Attribute \u2013 Devour Skill!</p><br/><p>Indeed, it was the Devour Skill that Zhou Weiqing had not had a chance to use all this while.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing reached the six-Jeweled cultivation level, his Devour Skill was already able to begin Devouring his opponent\u2019s Heavenly Energy even with a small distance, instead of the previous requirement of having to touch his opponent. In fact, against a much weaker opponent, his suction force was strong enough to just drag it to his hands to Devour. Of course, it was without a question that a direct touch was still the most effective for Devouring. Furthermore, unless the opponent\u2019s cultivation level was far above Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, otherwise once he touched the opponent, then the Devour Skill was so strong that it could turn the tides of battle.</p><br/><p>As soon as Shangguan Xue\u2019er felt the strong Devour Skill burst out abruptly at her, she instantly realised what Zhou Weiqing\u2019s plan had been. However, she had not expected that he would be so savage to himself, actually using his own body to take a sword right through his chest just to gain an opportunity to activate such a Skill.</p><br/><p>What do I do? What do I do? In Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s eyes, as long as vibrated the Boundless Infinitum Sword with her power, she could easily cut through Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands and kill him off. However, if she really did that, that would also be killing off her sisters\u2019 happiness!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was gripping onto the Boundless Infinitum Sword so tightly that without cutting through his hands, or even slicing them off, she could not possibly free the sword. In terms of raw physical strength, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was no match for Zhou Weiqing, and the only way she could end the fight on her own terms was to totally destroy Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands and possibly kill him. However, Shangguan Xue\u2019er could not bring herself to do so!</p><br/><p>Without question, the rascal Zhou Weiqing was fully making use of Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s kindness. As Mu En\u2019s disciple, being so shameless was of extremely ease to our dear Zhou Little Fatty. With such a good method to use, why not use it? So what if it was shameless? Ordinarily speaking, beauties always fell for the bad boys after all, and the good guys would stay single! Shangguan Xue\u2019er had already sworn such an oath, as long as he could gain this eldest sister as well, heh heh, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace would not be able to stop him in the future! More importantly, this was the only way he could see to get out of this current mess, and if he did not do so properly, how could he face up to Tian\u2019er as well?</p><br/><p>Seeing that strange smile on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lips, Shangguan Xue\u2019er snarled angrily: \u201cLet go, otherwise I will cut off your hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she gave a gentle vibration in the Boundless Infinitum Sword. However, Zhou Weiqing continued holding on tight, as if the Boundless Infinitum Sword was not cutting into his flesh.</p><br/><p>At that moment, only then did Shangguan Xue\u2019er see blood starting to flow from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands and chest. However, there was no hint of him slowing down or stopping the Devour Skill. In the series of fights, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had already used quite a lot of Heavenly Energy, and currently as she was being Devoured by Zhou Weiqing, she felt a sense of weakness wash over her. She was clear that if this continued any longer, she would truly be losing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 despicable!\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er said hatefully.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cMy Lady Xue\u2019er, what is being shameless or despicable? In this world, the victor is the king, he is the one who writes the history books. Come on then, kill me! You only have two choices now\u2026 to kill me off or to marry me. Take your pick. Sigh\u2026 Bing\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, let us see how your big sister chooses. There is not much time left\u2026 I estimate about ten seconds more before I Devour enough Heavenly Energy to overcome you. Let me help you countdown. Ten\u2026 Nine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er almost fainted from sheer anger. This shameless\u2026 despicable\u2026 rascal!!! She glared angrily at Zhou Weiqing, and in that moment, she actually let go of the Boundless Infinitum Sword, breaking free from his Devour Skill.</p>\n</div>"}

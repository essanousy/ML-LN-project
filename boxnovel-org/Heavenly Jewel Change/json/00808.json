Half of the sky turned golden in color and a huge blaze of golden light burst out as he lifted his hands. It was aimed towards the enemy.</p><br/><p>Then, the other half of the sky turned black. An overbearing Destruction Thought seemed to obstruct the expansion of the Divine Aura on the Tiger King\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell\u2019s Heavenly Emperor took a step out of the void and attacked with his right fist. A loud blast could be heard and before long, the gold and black colors in the sky could be seen fluctuating violently.</p><br/><p>The Divine light from the Tiger King was smashed into pieces in response. It turned into pieces of golden light before it disappeared. What was even more horrifying was when the black Destruction Energy curled back and countered the golden light. It completely disregarded all the specialties of the Divine Attribute as it began devouring it in an insane manner. It was as if it only needed a split second to counter the merits and drawbacks from both sides.</p><br/><p>The tyranny of the Destruction Energy had already surpassed many expectations. At least, in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s experience, he had never seen such a powerful Destruction Attribute before.</p><br/><p>If his earliest sighting of the Destruction Attribute from Little Demon Shen was only a small addition to his personal attributes, then the Destruction Attribute displayed by the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Heavenly Emperor was a pure Destruction Attribute, similar to his Saint Energy. Zhou Weiqing had guessed that even if the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Heavenly Emperor did not consolidate the Extermination Nucleus Core, which was an opposing force of the Saint Nucleus Core, at the very least the Destruction Energy in his body would have taken over half of his Heavenly Energy. Besides, the overall density was a far cry from the previous Blood Red Hell powerhouses. The density of the Destruction Energy was on par with the Blood Red Hell assassins who had shown up in Heavenly Bow City to mount a sneak attack on him. However, those assassins were only at the Heavenly King Tier. He was at the Heavenly Emperor Tier. Naturally, his power could not be spoken of on equal terms.</p><br/><p>The tyranny in the Destruction Attribute caused varying degrees of changes on the faces of the crowd that had gathered to watch the fight in Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s peak. Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s face followed suit and grew stern.</p><br/><p>Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the appearance of Destruction Attribute had overturned the rules of all attributes from the original Four Great Saint Attributes of the leading Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p><br/><p>The disadvantages of Tiger King Xue Ao\u2019ying\u2019s attributes were immediately exposed in battle. In truth, there was still a slight gap between his power and Yun Ruoyun\u2019s previous level. The reason he unleashed an assault the moment he arrived was because he wanted to get help from Yun Ruoyun to consume the enemy\u2019s Heavenly Energy. It would give the enemy no chance to retaliate.</p><br/><p>However, the enemy did not even show the slightest signs of being depleted of energy from his previous battles. Additionally, it seemed like he became more powerful than Yun Ruoyun back then. When the Destruction Attribute was completely released, the terrifying force caused the color to drain from the Tiger King\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>He could clearly feel that the attributes and elements in the air being ruined, violated and destroyed under the powers of the Destruction Attribute. The destruction made the Destruction Attribute even stronger in contrast. It was as if a black hole was swallowing everything in its path to strengthen its powers.</p><br/><p>Another fierce explosion rang loudly. The Tiger King\u2019s body was sent flying out of the way. It was also at this very moment the gold color seemed to vanish completely from the sky before everything turned dark. If it was not for the fact that the Destruction Attribute had yet to envelop the entire sky, Heavenly Snow Mountain would have become pitch black if not for the sliver of light from afar.</p><br/><p>The Tiger King let out a muffled moan in the sky. His entire body flew backward, and the dazzling legendary armor set on his body was surrounded by a black light. It seemed like it was continuously corroding him. It was fortunate that he was protected by this legendary armor set. Otherwise, his body would have been severely injured by this attack.</p><br/><p>Once one achieved the Heavenly King Tier and beyond, a significant amount of abilities would have been infinitely weakened. Although the competition was based on sheer strength as well as the advantages one property had over the other, it did not mean that skills were unnecessary, only that they were not the most important thing.</p><br/><p>Clearly, both sides were equally matched in power. However, in terms of attributes, the Tiger King was vastly inferior. Judging by the looks of it, he would not be able to hold on for very much longer.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s feet seemed to move a little bit. Fen Tian smiled at him and said, \u201cBrother Xue, do not despair. My subordinate will not kill you. We aren\u2019t enemies anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>With profound meaning in his eyes, Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s glanced at him as he said, \u201cThis Destruction Attribute is indeed powerful! Fen Tian, where did you find such a powerful attribute and how is it that every person in Blood Red Hell is equipped with the power of this attribute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you once the Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands is over, Brother Xue. As long as we solve the problem before us, you can even have a share of this Destruction Attribute. I know your cultivation base is at the Heavenly God Tier. Once you possess the power of Destruction Attribute, you\u2019ll be a powerhouse that surpasses all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s eyes flashed as if something had stirred.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian secretly smirked in his heart. Naturally, he would not willingly face Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain on his own at the same time. That was why he was trying to entice Xue Ao\u2019tian. He was the only one who knew if he was actually going to share the Destruction Attribute with Xue Ao\u2019tian or not. At the very least, he had no intentions of sparing the Tiger King in the battle before him. The other Great Saint Lands were merely stumbling blocks to him. The more he could get rid of, the better it would be. He had even thought of his excuse. If the Tiger King died in battle, he would shirk the responsibility and pass it on to his subordinate. After all, in this battle, it was not easy to show mercy.</p><br/><p>The battle in the sky was going according to Fen Tian\u2019s plan. Another deafening roar was heard as Xue Ao\u2019ying spat out a mouthful of blood. His originally white legendary armor set had turned completely black in color. One could only imagine how much damage he had endured.</p><br/><p>It was also at this point in time that the Blood Red Hell powerhouse suddenly paused in mid-air as he raised both his arms to the sky. Then, the Destruction Thought that covered the sky suddenly gathered towards him like a whirling scattering puff of clouds.</p><br/><p>The terrifying black shade suddenly heightened him into a ten-meter-tall giant.</p><br/><p>All of this happened very quickly. The Tiger King, Xue Ao\u2019ying steadied himself in the sky with great difficulty. In the next moment, the enemy had already finished gathering the Destruction Thought, and the ten-meter tall giant was already charging towards Xue Ao\u2019ying.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Mercy!\u201d Fen Tian yelled from below. Even though he was faking it, he had to really show it. He was still unwilling to fall out with Xue Ao\u2019tian. He knew very clearly that after this attack, even if Xue Ao\u2019ying survived, he would be severely injured. The ideal outcome would be to cripple the Tiger King without killing him.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s expression significantly changed as well. However, this was the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands. Even with his status as the number one in the world, he could not disrupt the competition. Otherwise, the other Great Saint Lands would unite against the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>However, the gigantic black shadow was charging too quickly. When Fen Tian\u2019s voice rang out loud, the giant black shadow had already slammed itself fiercely against the Tiger King.</p><br/><p>The powerhouses of Heavenly Snow Mountain could not bear to watch this. Most of them had their eyes shut. Even the Lion King, Gu Site, who had been in conflict with the Tiger King his whole life could not hold back the sullen look in his eyes. Anyone could see that the Tiger King was already wounded. The difference in attributes between the two was far too great. How could he possibly catch a lucky break and escape from the enemy\u2019s Divine Thought, that was filled with the force that it had absorbed. Even a legendary armor set could not block such a forceful attack!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>An ear-piercing explosion echoed throughout the sky.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian who was at the peak of Heavenly Snow Mountain saw the ashen look on Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s face. He said with an apologetic look on his face, \u201cBrother Xue, this is a mistake, I\u2026\u201d Just as he was about to console Xue Ao\u2019tian with his excuse to temporarily protect the alliance between the two, he noticed the ashen look on Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s face turned into shock. Voices of surprise could be heard from all around.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian instinctively raised his head towards the sky, and he saw two figures falling from the sky.</p><br/><p>The first to fall was the Tiger King, Xue Ao\u2019ying. Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s body flashed and caught his younger brother. At this moment, Xue Ao\u2019ying\u2019s face was like a hell\u2019s banknote. He was completely unconscious but his hands and legs were intact, and he was still breathing. At first glance, it looked like his entire body was heavily injured.</p><br/><p>The other figure was also falling from the sky. There was no need for Fen Tian to act as a member of Blood Red Hell automatically caught him in a flash. It was the Heavenly Emperor powerhouse from Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>The difference was his situation was far more dire compared to Xue Ao\u2019ying. A large hole with a diameter of a ruler could be seen on his chest. He looked lifeless.</p><br/><p>Even Fen Tian, who had carefully laid out what he thought was a perfect plan, was stunned. This was because when he turned to speak to Xue Ao\u2019tian previously, he did not notice any changes to the sky. He simply could not fully comprehend the situation before him. Clearly, his subordinate had the upper hand. How could the situation change so suddenly? Even though the Tiger King seemed like he was badly injured, his own subordinate who was more competent was completely killed off.</p><br/><p>After all, the number of powerhouses in Blood Red Hell was rather alarming as well. Zhou Weiqing had gotten rid of quite a number of them in the past so the number of Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses he had was limited. Blood Red Hell\u2019s wild schemes were not only limited to this Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands. They had already made plans to selfishly take over the other Great Saint Lands. Now that they had lost one of their best Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses without any rhyme or reason, even Fen Tian could not help but feel glum?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d He asked his subordinate through slightly gritted teeth.</p><br/><p>The last clash in the sky was equivalent to a dramatic scene. Everyone else knew that when the giant shadow created by the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse slammed into Xue Ao\u2019ying, the initially pale-faced Tiger King who looked like death was knocking on his door, suddenly released an explosion of blinding gold light from his body.</p><br/><p>This golden light forcibly tore through the invincible Destruction Energy. The successful attack carved a hole through the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse\u2019s body. The Tiger King also suffered the repercussions from the clash with the Destruction Energy. That was why both parties ended up falling from the sky.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian could not believe his ears when he heard his subordinate\u2019s report. If Destruction Energy was that easy to break through, what was he going to use to lead Dandun Empire into an easy victory against the Geritimo Empire? To think he arrived in such a grandiose manner, ready to use the Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands to thoroughly change the mainland\u2019s landscape.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019ying was clearly on the losing end just a while ago, and he had also sustained heavy injuries. Even if he was not wounded and went all out, it was not possible that he could break through the Destruction Energy. Both parties had almost the same cultivation base, and he was definitely at a disadvantage in terms of attributes so no skills could possibly have any effect at that point in time!</p><br/><p>\u201cFen Tian, I think this must be Ao\u2019ying\u2019s mistake. You saw it as well. In matters of life and death, Ao\u2019ying couldn\u2019t give his all. As for your subordinate\u2019s death, I\u2019d like to express my deepest regret.\u201d Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s voice rang in Fen Tian\u2019s ears. There was an apologetic note in his voice but when Fen Tian turned to face Xue Ao\u2019tian, he could not detect a single trace of regret on his face.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian clenched his fists instinctively. He almost lost his temper but in the end, he managed to hold it in. Regardless of the situation, he could not detach himself from the recent events. After all, it was his subordinate who had received a fatal blow. Even though he still could not make sense of what happened after, this was not the time to fall out with the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>He forced a smile on his face, \u201cThe Tiger King can\u2019t be blamed for this. In the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands, life and death is something that can happen in the blink of an eye. However, it seems that the Tiger King will not be able to continue fighting. In this fight, it can be said that neither of us has won. However, it can be considered that I lost a little more since my man is dead. My men will enter the cycle first. Send another person out, Brother Xue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian nodded. He and Fen Tian both sent out another person each. Fen Tian chose a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse again. However, the shocking thing was Xue Ao\u2019tian actually sent out a mere Heavenly King.</p><br/><p>The other Masters of the Great Saint Lands were not at all surprised by this arrangement. After all, the greatest power of Heavenly Snow Mountain lay with Xue Ao\u2019tian. Their power as a whole was not considered too strong. That was why using a Heavenly King to undertake the mission was an inevitable situation.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Snow Mountain and Blood Red Hell\u2019s mutual suffering had resulted in the Heavenly Expanse Palace getting off easy. At least the cannon fodder Heavenly King-tier powerhouse that they sent out in the first round allowed them to receive a position in the next cycle and maintain their position as number four. Unfortunately, he was up against the Demonic Emperor, Wu Yunyue.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse versus a Heavenly King-tier powerhouse. Unless this was an abnormality like Zhou Weiqing, what kind of suspense would this bring?</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue did not bother wasting much of his effort and easily won his first round.</p><br/><p>Presently, the first round of the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands had ended. The winner of the first round was the Peerless Sect. Of course, from Fen Tian\u2019s point of view, the Peerless Sect had only achieved this by luck. If the Heavenly Emperor he sent out did not die, Wu Yunyue might not have such a good result.</p><br/><p>There was no break in the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands. Wu Yunyue\u2019s next opponent would be a challenger from Love Valley who lost in the first round.</p><br/><p>The representative from Love Valley was also a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse who was clearly a little anxious because he had to face Wu Yunyue. When both parties ascended to the sky, his figure lagged behind Wu Yunyue by an obvious measure.</p><br/><p>This was understandable. Wu Yunyue was the previous Sect Leader of the Heavenly Demon Sect. Even though the Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s overall power was inferior to the other four Great Saint Lands, one would have to measure each individual\u2019s power in a battle. No one in the other Great Saint Lands dared to take Wu Yunyue\u2019s cultivation base lightly. Evil Attribute had a rather tyrannical power, and that included the two great attributes, The Darkness and Life Attributes. Even when faced with Shanggong Tianyang in his Boundless Infinitum Set, Wu Yunyue\u2019s power was enough to grant him the possibility of victory in a single combat. So, what could an average Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse have to stand against him? Moreover, Wu Yunyue did not waste a lot of effort in the previous match against the cannon-fodder Heavenly King-tier powerhouse from Heavenly Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>The entire sky turned grey following Wu Yunyue\u2019s ascent. The air was already icy-cold but now it turned gloomy as well. At first glance, Wu Yunyue looked very calm but his eyes were filled with ferocity.</p><br/><p>He had never had a good impression of the other four Great Saint Lands. If it was not for their coercion, how could the Heavenly Demon Sect have fallen to the point of needing a crutch? He had volunteered himself to represent the Peerless Sect in the first round. He did not think about how long he would have to continue. All he thought about was that he needed a way to relieve himself of the burden he felt. Under these circumstances, the Demonic Emperor was undoubtedly very terrifying.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy might not have been able to help Wu Yunyue in breaking through to the Heavenly God Tier but it had placed him one step closer to the tier. All he needed was just a little more to reach the Heavenly God Tier. This was also due to the severity of Wu Yunyue\u2019s old injury that the Saint Energy managed to heal.</p><br/><p>The Love Valley\u2019s Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse faced Wu Yunyue from a far distance in the sky. A warped light resulted in him occupying a leading position in the sky. However, he was much weaker in contrast to Wu Yunyue\u2019s Evil attribute that covered the sky. This Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse from Love Valley was only at the middle level of his cultivation base.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic Emperor, if you please.\u201d Shrouded in the brilliance of his light, the Heavenly Emperor from Love Valley gestured in an invitation as eight pieces of the legendary armor set wrapped around him at the same time.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue did not reply him at all. He moved in the next second. A thick, grey light seemed to burst out from his body. When the grey light erupted, Wu Yunyue\u2019s body began to swell, and his eyes turned into a blood-red shade. His long hair that trailed over his shoulders turned into a horrifying grey color.</p><br/><p>Demonic Change. That was right. Wu Yunyue had actually used Demonic Change at the beginning of the battle. He did not even bother feinting.</p><br/><p>Bang! A horrifying blast exploded in the sky. Wu Yunyue was like a cannon shot as he instantly charged towards the Love Valley\u2019s Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse. A nine-piece legendary armor set, colored like grey crystals covered his entire body. He held a sword condensed from grey crystals in his right hand, bringing a ray of light with him before the light went off in an instant.</p><br/><p>Demonic Emperor Set. Even though there were only nine of this legendary armor set, it was worn by Demonic Emperors of days past. It held the highest position among the nine legendary armor sets.</p><br/><p>Any Heavenly Jewel Masters with the Evil Attribute were believed to be Demonic Emperors. Zhou Weiqing had the clearest perception in sensing the ability used by the Demonic Emperor at this moment. Wasn\u2019t the grey sword in his hand an imitation of the Demon God Sword?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing who stood in his original position seemed to absent-mindedly turn towards Huang Xingyun, the Lord of Love Valley. Huang Xingyun was clearly shocked when he saw Wu Yunyue utilizing Demonic Change. Afterward, his expression turned very ugly.</p><br/><p>Rumble\u2026</p><br/><p>Just then, a loud clap of thunder rang throughout the sky. Upon reaching the Heavenly Emperor Tier, hand-to-hand combat became more straightforward. One must at least possess the Heavenly Skill Projection ability to actually have any effect. However, to utilize an ability of that level would not be easy. Hence, generally speaking, hand-to-hand combat in the Heavenly Emperor Tier was a mostly rigid affair that relied on pure strength, attributes, experience in battles and a few special techniques.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Emperor from Love Valley seemed like he was giving his all in his fight with Wu Yunyue. He also raised his swords in shock.</p><br/><p>The distortion from the Time Attribute had caused a messy trace in the light rays around his body. One, it was to confuse the Demonic Emperor. Two, it was to use the Time Disorder to wreck havoc on the Demonic Emperor\u2019s sense of direction.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the difference in cultivation base between him and Wu Yunyue wasn\u2019t all that great. Moreover, Wu Yunyue\u2019s transformation had exceeded all physical limits upon using Demonic Change. The ice-cold perception had also been magnified.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Emperor\u2019s sword cut through the Time Disorder Skill from a small opening before it clashed with the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>A loud bang was heard from the clash.</p><br/><p>At a crucial point, the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse unleashed his power. The Love Valley Heavenly Emperor looked like he had been electrocuted as he trembled all over. He could not possibly withstand Wu Yunyue\u2019s blow. How terrifying was the corrosion of Evil attribute?</p><br/><p>However, in the next moment, his body actually separated. His Heavenly Skill Image shattered under the Demonic Emperor\u2019s sword but his original body had already retreated ten meters away. It neutralized a large amount of Wu Yunyue\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Time Mirror Image? This was the most powerful technique of Time Attribute. It allowed a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse to unleash a mirror image that was not a complete Heavenly Skill Image. The cultivator would be able to maintain a certain degree of defensive strength in the mirror image and give the original user enough space for to evade attacks. Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue\u2019s crucial blow was neutralized under these circumstances.</p><br/><p>A sharp gleam flashed across the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor\u2019s eye. Naturally, he could see that Wu Yunyue\u2019s attack was meant to take his life. If he did not have the Time Mirror Image defending him, he would have ended up gravely injured if not dead.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue brandished his sword, and the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor dodged it in the next moment as he stepped back. His body had already charged upwards once again, and the space in his surroundings began to warp. It enveloped him and Wu Yunyue within it. At this moment, only he and Wu Yunyue alone knew of what going on around them. The powerhouses in Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s peak had no way of seeing the changes at all.</p><br/><p>The Love Valley Heavenly Emperor appeared right in front of Wu Yunyue in a flash. His body and sword became one as he charged towards Wu Yunyue\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue might be slightly passive due to his outdated sword techniques but he had a wide array of experiences in battle. His body followed the sword and a puff of dense, dark blue light exploded in all directions. It enveloped his entire body within it. It was Life Protection, a specialty of the Life Attribute.</p><br/><p>The Blue Rain Hibiscus bloomed with a million rays of lights. It was not only for defense. It also whirled towards the Love Valley Heavenly Emperor. At the same time, the Demonic Emperor raised his sword following its movements.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

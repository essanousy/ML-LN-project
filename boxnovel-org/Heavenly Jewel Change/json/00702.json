The addition of the Honorable God Tier Master Zhou will surely increase the overall strength of the palace to the next level. As you can see, Honorable Zhou is very young. He is also the youngest God Tier Master in the history of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace and the Mainland. In fact, I believe even in that distant Boundless Mainland, it\u2019s impossible that they would have such a young powerhouse.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, I urge everyone to respect Honorable Zhou like the way they respect me. I also hope that Honorable Zhou will produce more God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. This is also relevant to all of you present here. Come, let us toast to this historic moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to the seats, several tables with all kinds of food and drinks had been placed there. When the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace summoned them, everyone stood up in unison and toasted Zhou Weiqing respectfully. \u201cCongratulations to the Honorable Zhou for joining our Palace.\u201d The two Honorable and four Supreme Elders also simultaneously got up and congratulated Zhou Weiqing for the first time.</p><br/><p>After the toast, the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace looked in the direction of Zhou Weiqing, however, because there was a crystal barrier where his eyes were on his mask, Zhou Weiqing could not see the expression in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonorable Zhou, please say a few words,\u201d the Palace Master of Mysterious Heavenly Palace said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded as he gave an indifferent smile. With a glass in his hand, he turned toward the crowd of Mysterious Heavenly Palace powerhouses. \u201cThank you for your well wishes. I\u2019m Zhou Weiqing. Although I\u2019m fortunate enough to be a God Tier Master, I\u2019m really very young. With regards to Cultivation Base, I\u2019m far inferior in comparison to all of you here. When it comes to the creation of God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls, I\u2019m also inferior compared to the Honourable Meng Xing and Honourable Nie Han.\u201d Having said all that, he paused for a moment, leaving the people below confused.</p><br/><p>Nobody could understand why Zhou Weiqing would say those useless words that belittled himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, perhaps there is one thing that I have an advantage in. That is the speed of producing Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. As long as there are enough materials, no one in this world can be faster than me in making Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Certainly, there was no one previously and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s probably impossible to have anyone who can beat me in the future as well.\u201d Although his tone was calm, the words were very on the mark.</p><br/><p>The moment that remark was out, even though the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was still around, the people below were in an uproar.</p><br/><p>Arrogance, that was absolute arrogance! As the saying goes, one should always stay be respectful before flaunting their strengths. With his previous self-deprecating statement and the absolute confidence in his arrogant declaration, it caused an uproar among the high-ranked officials of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Even the four Supreme Elders could not help but frown slightly. Zhou Weiqing had said too much without any reservations at all.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing turned around to face the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. He bowed slightly and said, \u201cPlease Lord, forgive my blunder. Since today is a welcoming reception for me, I only wanted the seniors of Mysterious Heavenly Palace to understand me better. Will you allow me to show my skills? I prefer to let my actions speak for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Palace Master of Mysterious Heavenly Palace hesitated for a moment, but he soon nodded to Zhou Weiqing and gestured for him to go ahead.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the two God Tier Masters, Nie Han, and Meng Xing, who were sitting at the side, were radiant. Although Zhou Weiqing was extremely arrogant ever since his arrival at Mysterious Heavenly Palace, the strength he displayed had also deeply shocked them. Therefore, when Zhou Weiqing said that he wanted to demonstrate his strength again, the two God Tier Masters were, of course, more than willing to take a look.</p><br/><p>Different from the other high-ranked officials in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, there was almost no competition between the ranks of the God Tier Masters. The reason being that the status of a God Tier Master would never change. Instead, these gentlemen needed to have a good relationship between themselves in order for them to be able to improve their abilities in making Consolidated Equipment Scrolls by communicating with one another. Therefore, they looked forward to Zhou Weiqing demonstrating his strength again because it would surely be beneficial to them.</p><br/><p>After they saw that the Palace Master had nodded, everyone\u2019s eyes were focused on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Especially those higher-ups that were sitting around the periphery of the Elders of Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Their eyes were zealously watching Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>It was a known fact that the Consolidated Equipment Scrolls produced by the God Tier Masters were reserved only for those in the upper echelons. Aside from the Palace Master, next on the list to be given access to the scrolls were the Supreme Elders; the core disciples of Mysterious Heavenly Palace members, the Elders and a total of 2 God Tier Masters. Moreover, the production of high-level Consolidated Equipment Scrolls required a lot of resources and time. Therefore, those below the level of the Elders would not have an opportunity to obtain Consolidated Equipment Scrolls produced by the two God Tier Masters. However, with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s participation, it would be different this time around. With an additional person, the speed of making Consolidated Equipment Scrolls would be much faster.</p><br/><p>Naturally, they did not expect to obtain the God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls from Zhou Weiqing. That was unrealistic. However, even a Consolidated Equipment Scroll made from the hands of a God Tier Master would be much better than the ones made by an ordinary Consolidating Equipment Master. Therefore, when Zhou Weiqing said that he was the fastest God Tier Master in history regarding the speed in making Consolidated Equipment Scrolls, how could these high officials of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace not view him in a new light?</p><br/><p>Naturally, all their thoughts had been seen through by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes. The reason why he acted with such eminence was to quickly obtain the approval of those high-level members of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Supreme Elders were certainly respected, but in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s opinion, they were not as good as those high-ranking members amongst the Elders. Those people could be easily won over. If he could, in the shortest possible time, demonstrate sufficient strength and obtain their approval, the mission to Mysterious Heavenly Palace could be completed in the fastest time.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, come over.\u201d Zhou Weiqing waved at Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er got up from her seat and went over to him. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lips were moving as he said a few words to her. Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded slightly. She turned around with her back facing Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Under the indescribable gaze of everyone, Shangguan Bing\u2019er bent over with both her hands on her knees.</p><br/><p>Her action looked a little weird. Her perfectly round buttocks, covered by the blue robes of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, was tilted in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Despite knowing that Zhou Weiqing would be sensible enough not to do anything inappropriate, this was still quite a shameful position to be in. As such, her delicate face blushed.</p><br/><p>Although in terms of visual impact, Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not possess the looks to stun people in the same way Meng Xing might, her appearance was not inferior in any way. At the same time, her temperament was entirely different from Meng Xing. Meng Xing\u2019s temperament was similar to the noble temperament of Princess Cai Cai while Shangguan Bing\u2019er belonged to the gentle and elegant type, similar to the gentle girl-next-door. The main difference between these two traits made Shangguan Bing\u2019er seemed more approachable and more attractive, making people feel like caring for her, while in men\u2019s minds, Meng Xing could only be described as a Goddess.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when the crowd of senior people saw Shangguan Bing\u2019er posing in such a position with a touch of blush on her charming face, they could not help developing a favorable impression of her. Those high-level members were generally not young. At this age group, there was little impulse to engage in the carnal behaviors of men and women. Instead, there was only a benevolent form of love that came from the bottom of their hearts.</p><br/><p>However, in the very next moment, the affection on their faces disappeared and was replaced by shock, absolute shock.</p><br/><p>A strong, dark golden light radiated out from Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s body like great waves in streams of succession. A pair of incomparably huge dark golden wings suddenly unfurled on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>When they felt the strong surge of Heavenly Energy fluctuations, the two God Tier Masters, and four Supreme Elders, who were the closest, all stood up. An extremely powerful pressure almost directly smashed on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d A clear and cold shout sounded. That managed to stop the four Supreme Elders from dropping their powerful pressure directly on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s body. The person who spoke out was Meng Xing. Although the four Supreme Elders stopped and did not strike, their attention was still fully trained on the pair of wings which had unfurled on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s back. It was shocking to the audience.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, the four dark golden lights had shown everyone that this was a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll! The enormous pair of wings on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s back was a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll outfit!</p><br/><p>People with lower cultivation could only perceive it visually. However, for those elders above the Heavenly King Tier, their impact was far greater. That was because they could already see that the enormous pair of wings on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s back was not just a simple God Tier Consolidated Equipment, it was a Set! A Consolidated Equipment Assembly Set! That was definitely the best God Tier Consolidated Equipment in existence. Her God Tier Consolidated Equipments were already comparable with the Legendary Sets, not to mention her four-part assembled wings that might be a part of a Legendary Set. That alone was enough to call it the world\u2019s best God Tier Consolidated Equipment!</p><br/><p>Meng Xing and Nie Han were naturally the most knowledgeable. After shouting at the Supreme Elders, Meng Xing subconsciously looked toward Nie Han. She also saw the same astonishment in her eyes reflected in the eyes of God Tier Master Nie Han.</p><br/><p>They both knew very well that if they wanted to produce these types of Consolidated Equipment, it was not possible to collect the materials in a short period of time. Moreover, it could not be completed by a single God Tier Master. Even if the two of them worked together with sufficient materials, without a few years of preparation, they would not be able to produce such a high-grade God Tier Consolidated Equipment.</p><br/><p>When the enormous wings spread out, the wingspan was almost 10 meters long. As Shangguan Bing\u2019er bent forward, it was as if two long, narrow tables unfolded in front of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er had arrived together with Zhou Weiqing. Therefore, what he wanted to reveal was naturally this set of God Tier Consolidated Equipment Assembly Wings.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s following actions were a clear indication that this was only just the beginning.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Of course, this time she used her original voice, the clear crisp beautiful voice clearly with a note of anger within. Lifting her hands and with a slight tilt of her claws, a well crafted mask flew off her face.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing, who was charging at her with all his might, propelled by his Tornado Strike Skill, was shocked by the sudden sight in front of him. He was totally stunned to see that the common look of that female ZhongTian Battle Team member was now\u2026 exactly the same as Shangguan Bing\u2019er!</p><br/><p>Although logic told him that this could not be Shangguan Bing\u2019er in front of him, as the power levels was just too different, he could not bring himself to continue his attack. Even if it were any of her two sisters, how could he possibly really injure them?</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing instantly dismissed the two Legendary Hammers in his hands. Still in midair, his right leg struck the ground savagely, changing the direction just before he rammed into her.</p><br/><p>As for Little Witch, when she saw the female ZhongTian Battle Team member reveal her true appearance, she was also surprised. She quickly removed her Shadow Chase skill, skipping lightly to the side.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing pass by her, the female ZhongTian Battle Team member felt the anger rise within her, and couldn\u2019t help but give his buttock a swift kick.</p><br/><p>This young lady opponent of theirs was no other than Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s second sister, Shangguan Fei\u2019er. Having had her first kiss stolen by Zhou Weiqing, she had been so vexed that she had instigated Zhan LingTian\u2019s anger, getting him to secretly sneak her into the ZhongTian Battle Team by using a mask to disguise herself. In such a manner, she had entered this Finals of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament to seek revenge.</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s cultivation level was not as high as Shangguan Fei\u2019er, she was also extremely talented, one of the top genius of the young generation, with the Mutated Duo Physical Jewels, which was one of the rarest and more powerful mutations. If not for the fact that she had such an important status in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, how could she possibly get so many God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters to help her design and create a specialised Legendary Set? After all, these God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters had an extremely exalted status within the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and they had no other obligation besides helping only the Palace Master and the direct heir to create the Boundless Infinitum Set. Besides that, they could not be forced to help the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Shangguan Fei\u2019er had coaxed and pestered them unceasingly with all her wiles before successfully getting her current four God Tier Consolidated Equipment. The Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace was indeed notorious in the entire Heavenly Jewel Island, perhaps her name was even more known than her elder sister Shangguan Xue\u2019er, the heir and future Palace Master!</p><br/><p>As such, she had never expected that with all her power, she could actually lose to the combination of Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch! Even though the two of them were working together, she had four God Tier Consolidated Equipment, all part of a Legendary Set!</p><br/><p>Still in midair, Zhou Weiqing received the kick from her and instantly lost his balance. *Peng* He crashed right into a large tree before tumbling down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>However, even this kick gave Shangguan Fei\u2019er a large surprise. When her foot connected with Zhou Weiqing, a powerful elastic force burst forth from his muscles involuntarily, the shockwaves actually causing her right foot to be numbed momentarily. At the same time, it was clear that a strange white light formed a whirlpool around the spot she had kicked, dissipating the Heavenly Energy around her kick.</p><br/><p>Even though she had not used much Heavenly Energy in that kick, it was without question that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s defense was far beyond any Three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, even taking into account his Demonic Change State.</p><br/><p>In the distance, Little Witch stared at the two of them, saying in surprise: \u201cWeiqing, what is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing vaulted back up from the ground, releasing his Demonic Change State as he looked gloomily at Shangguan Fei\u2019er before saying: \u201cHow would I know what is going on? She is definitely not Bing\u2019er\u2026 and I don\u2019t think it is Shangguan Xue\u2019er either\u2026 You\u2026 you are Shangguan Fei\u2019er right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er gave a cold smile, saying: \u201cHmph! So you can still remember who I am! Zhou Weiqing, if you dare touch me again today, I will make sure that you will never ever end up with Bing\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare threaten me?\u201d Zhou Weiqing said angrily. \u201cI have already gone easy on you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er gave a disdainful humph, saying: \u201cYou two are fighting me two against one, and you dare say you have gone easy on me? I sneaked into this Heavenly Jewel Tournament because of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but say curiously: \u201cHuh? You sneaked into the Tournament because of me? Why? Have you fallen for me too?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit! You took advantage of me, and now you are trying to deny it? If you do not give me a good accounting, I will not let you off.\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er snarled angrily, her face a mask of anger. She had been doted upon lovingly since she was young, and no one would ever dare to take advantage of her. Yet, her first kiss had just been stolen like that. Her fury was far beyond even Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s.</p><br/><p>After all, no matter what, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was the heir and future Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. She had been trained from young as such, and her character was definitely more suited as well, being a lot more logical and trained to see reason. Alas, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was definitely not the same, and she was the vengeful type indeed, how could she possibly let Zhou Weiqing go so easily.</p><br/><p>Little Witch looked at Zhou Weiqing strangely, saying: \u201cWeiqing, you are just too beastly, you won\u2019t even let Bing\u2019er\u2019s sister go? Alright, this is a personal matter then, you two settle it on your own, I\u2019ll be by the side.\u201d As she said that, she turned around and walked away.</p><br/><p>It was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s turn to get angry. \u201cBeastly your head! Didn\u2019t you see she looks exactly the same as Bing\u2019er? They are triplets, who could possibly recognize them from each other? I didn\u2019t take advantage of her on purpose, furthermore it was just a little kiss\u2026 That time, Shangguan Xue\u2019er gave a such a huge slap that my face was swollen for days, but this girl gave me such a beating already!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er defended herself, saying: \u201cIf I do not blame you, then who?! Who asked you not to look clearly before running over to take advantage of me? In any case, I don\u2019t care, since you already kissed me, then you better give a good accounting of yourself, otherwise I won\u2019t let it go so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a cold humph before saying: \u201cDo as you wish. If you can, just kill me then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the atmosphere was freezing as the impasse continued, all of a sudden, the sky lit up once more a another Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace signal flare burst out.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s face changed. Although she was capricious and headstrong, she still could put the big picture ahead of her own needs. Seeing the second signal flare light up, it could only mean one thing: The ZhongTian Battle Team was in huge trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with you later.\u201d Saying that, she spun around and flew off swiftly in the direction of the signal flare.</p><br/><p>Looking at her retreating figure, Zhou Weiqing had a gloomy expression on his face. What am I do to?! A future fight and opponent, Shangguan Xue\u2019er, is already giving me a huge headache, and now an unreasonable sister Shangguan Fei\u2019er is added to the mix. Furthermore, her power is almost just as strong, and definitely not someone I can handle by myself. Add in this Little Witch, mischievous and unpredictable as she is, and the wonderful but trouble-bringing Tian\u2019er in his arms\u2026 That is not even mentioning his own dear Bing\u2019er\u2026</p><br/><p>The saying goes \u2018Three women can form an opera\u20191, but he had five beside him! Each with a terrifying background, each with a murky connection to him. How was he going to continue living from now on!</p><br/><p>Seeing that Shangguan Fei\u2019er had left, Little Witch sidled up to Zhou Weiqing, saying apologetically: \u201cWeiqing, I did not know it was all a misunderstanding, and I thought you had really taken advantage of her. You won\u2019t blame me right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her exasperatedly, saying: \u201cWhat blame? Come on let\u2019s go as well, we should have a look at what happened to the ZhongTian Battle Team, that they actually need to use their signal flare twice.\u201d No matter what, they had to try to finish this Heavenly Jewel Tournament the best they could. By that them, after he left the Heavenly Jewel Island, the immense sea will allow the fish to leap at liberty, and the vast sky will allow birds to fly freely. 2 At the most, he will run away from them all, and when he was powerful enough, he would return to bring Bing\u2019er away. Too many women is also a cause of headache! Although Zhou Weiqing loved beautiful women, he was also afraid of trouble. Furthermore, besides Tian\u2019er, who he had deeper feelings for, both Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er were half enemies or sorts, and even Little Witch was together with him more for a mutually beneficial agreement. Running away from them, Zhou Weiqing would not feel any burden in his heart.</p><br/><p>Little Witch flew closer to Zhou Weiqing. She could clearly sense a slight coldness from him, and couldn\u2019t help but furrow her brow slightly. This young man looked to be honest and naive on the surface, but he was extremely cunning inside. He might act the part of a pervert at times, but in truth, no one could really tell what he was thinking inside. Such a strange, unpredictable nature, it was truly mystifying.</p><br/><p>From Little Witch\u2019s perspective, her first impression of Zhou Weiqing at first was that she did not like this young man. The only reason she followed by his side, even sacrificing her own values to flirt and seduce him, it was all for the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p><br/><p>However, as they spent more time together, she realised that Zhou Weiqing was always constantly surprising her. He was clearly only at the three-Jeweled cultivation level, yet he could always accomplish deeds that no one else could.</p><br/><p>Women always liked the strong, especially women with a background like hers, from a Great Saint Lands, used to seeing so many genius and talents. In order to conquer their hearts, one had to be able to have the power to conquer them first.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing naturally did not have the power to do so currently, but the display of his unbelievable talent was truly obvious throughout the entire Heavenly Jewel Tournament. He might not be extremely handsome, but he had a certain bad boy charm about him that slowly grew more pleasing to the eye to Little Witch, bit by bit. In that moment when Zhou Weiqing turned to leave, she suddenly felt a small sense of loss. She knew that in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart, she could never be equal to Tian\u2019er, let alone Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Just as she was lost in wild thoughts, she suddenly looked up to see that Tian\u2019er, in her Fat Cat form, had leaped up onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shoulder, looking at her with a provocative look on her face.</p><br/><p>Little Witch glared at her, before quickly leaping into the air and chasing after Zhou Weiqing. At the same time, a Life Attribute recovery Skill fell upon Zhou Weiqing, to alleviate the pain he felt from Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s kick.</p><br/><p>Chance\u2026 she had to wait for and seize an opportunity! This was the sole thought in Little Witch\u2019s mind. As for when such an opportunity would appear, she did not know, but she believed in her heart that it would eventually appear for her.</p><br/><p>In just the few moments they had milled around, Shangguan Fei\u2019er had already disappeared into the distance. However, with the signal flare clear in the distance, they would not have any trouble following her.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not proceed ahead at a quick pace, as he still needed to circulate his Immortal Deity Technique in order to recover his Heavenly Energy. Furthermore, Little Witch had also expended a large amount of Heavenly Energy earlier, and she did not have the recovery speed of Zhou Weiqing. As such, the two of them moved on at a leisurely pace towards the direction of the signal flare.</p>\n</div>"}

Even a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse can\u2019t easily break in. After all, the Luster Spatial Realm is created by just a couple of gigantic dragons while the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land is made from the Elf Tribe\u2019s Life Tree\u2019s core and the entire tribe was also involved in its creation. As long as the Life Tree isn\u2019t destroyed, the Sealed Land will remain until the end of time. Besides, there\u2019s an advantage to creating this Sealed Land. Because it\u2019s in another realm, the territory is naturally limited. The Natural Element aura that the Life Tree releases is naturally also restricted to the territory. The realm absorbs the Boundless Mainland\u2019s Atmospheric Energy while it continuously makes pure Natural Energy internally. Therefore, cultivating in there would be significantly beneficial to the Elf Tribe. It also stimulates the tribe\u2019s reproduction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing finally had a rough understanding of this Sealed Land after hearing Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo how do we get into this Sealed Land?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get in. It\u2019s impossible to enter by force. The only way to enter is with the guidance of the Natural Element. We have the Natural Heart that the Elf Tribe gave as a gift in the Heavenly Expanse Palace\u2019s collection. One can enter the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land anytime they want but we can\u2019t do that. Therefore, everything depends on our luck when we get there. Weiqing, you must remember not to enter the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land by force with your cultivation base. If you do that, the Elf Tribe will treat you as their enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing then said in dismay, \u201cIt\u2019s already a problem whether we can enter or not, let alone obtaining the Elven Queen\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said helplessly, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that our mission this time has any meaning because it\u2019s almost impossible for you to obtain the Elven Queen\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cXue\u2019er, why don\u2019t we have a bet? If I managed to, you\u2019ll have too\u2026 You know what I mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er rolled her eyes at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m not making a bet with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was stunned, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er calmly said, \u201cFirst of all, I know you very well. Although I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll succeed, with your character, you\u2019ll never simply bet on things that you\u2019re not confident in. So many people have fallen into your trap. Didn\u2019t Ling Tian\u2019ao lose to you? I\u2019ll lose my life to you if I accept the bet. Secondly, there\u2019s nothing good for me even if I win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said helplessly, \u201cWhy not? You\u2019ll win me as a prize! If you win, I\u2019ll marry you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er said calmly, \u201cDear sisters, let\u2019s kick this shameless fellow down. Who agrees with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Five small hands were raised up almost at the same time, and five long legs kicked at Zhou Weiqing, including Wu Yuehan whom he held while they were flying.</p><br/><p>With Zhou Weiqing acting as the mood-maker, their journey to the Blancpain Empire was not dull. Moreover, even though the five of them were flying, in reality, the women were depending on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength. They had no idea how fast their flying speed was. Due to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Galaxia Saint Energy, they could not feel any external impact while they were flying.</p><br/><p>Traveling from the Heavenly Bow Empire to the intersection of the Blancpain Empire and Mi Ou Empire was almost equivalent to traveling from the west to the east of the mainland. It was safe to say that it was like traveling across the entire mainland so one could imagine how far it was. Zhou Weiqing had to take care of the women apart from helping them with flying. Therefore, even with his Cultivation Base, they flew for exactly seven days just to get to their destination.</p><br/><p>A lush forest could be seen from far away, and it was endless. Floating on top of the green ocean, they could feel the rich Life aura. Little Witch felt it the most intensely because she had the Life Attribute in her body. She revealed an indulgent expression on her pretty face.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cThe elves sure know how to pick the location. They chose to build the Sealed Land on this prehistoric forest. Naturally, they\u2019ll be able to absorb a large amount of life force. Xue\u2019er, where\u2019s the entrance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said helplessly, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere in this forest, it could be anywhere. This is the reason why I said it\u2019ll be difficult to enter this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was surprised and said, \u201cDo you mean the entrance to the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land is mobile?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right. We can easily find the entrance if we have the guidance of the Natural Heart. We\u2019ll need the Natural Heart to cover us with Natural Energy for us to enter the Sealed Land.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing frowned. However, he suddenly smiled, \u201cI understand now. Xue\u2019er, perhaps you meant this piece of prehistoric forest would be completely destroyed if we enter by force. If that\u2019s the case, then the entrance will naturally appear if we use force. With my cultivation base, it\u2019s not difficult to enter by force.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said immediately, \u201cWeiqing, we can\u2019t do that. If we do that, we\u2019ll be dead to the Elf Tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely keep my promise to you. Let me try looking for the location of the entrance,\u201d Zhou Weiqin said as he slowly closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>He released his Divine Thought and spread it across the forest. The five women who were hovering around him could clearly see that his body was emitting a splendid reddish gold light almost immediately. His clothes could not cover the glow that was radiating from his body.</p><br/><p>Circles of reddish gold halos spread out from his head and headed towards to the forest like fans. That was the greatness of Saint Energy. Regardless of the attributes of the Heavenly Energy, the most it could do was to forcefully train one\u2019s Soul Energy to produce Divine Thought. Divine Thought could only be increased from cultivation base.</p><br/><p>However, it was different for Saint Energy because it was completely integrated into the Divine Thought. It was a part of the Divine Thought, and it could increase the Divine Thought directly. With the help of Nebula Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing managed to expand his Divine Thought extremely quickly. What was peculiar was that the Divine Thought that was supported by the Nebula Saint Energy could absorb the Atmospheric Energy in the air to strengthen itself so it could cover a broader area.</p><br/><p>An ordinary Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse could use Divine Thought to sense slight energy waves that were within the radius of tens of miles. Meanwhile, Zhou Weiqing expanded the perception coverage to at least 10 times more with only the Nebula Saint Energy. The forest was huge but it still had its limit after all. With Zhou Weiqing constantly scanning, as long as he kept changing his location, he would definitely find it sooner or later.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er looked at Zhou Weiqing in shock. Without a doubt, Zhou Weiqing definitely did not know much about the Elf Tribe\u2019 Sealed Land. The only information he had was what she had described to him. What he was doing right now right now was simple and even stupid. It would not work at all for other Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses because the Sealed Land\u2019s entrance would randomly move. It would be too difficult to look for it using Divine Thought.</p><br/><p>However, the coverage of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Divine Thought could be described as terrifying. Under such circumstances, the dumbest way became the most effective one. As he scanned using Divine Thought, Zhou Weiqing brought the five women with him and flew around the sky. In less than 15 minutes, a smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound it.\u201d Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes suddenly and waved his right hand. A tendril of light made from Nebula Saint Energy covered the six of them. Soon after, their bodies were like meteors headed towards a direction at the speed of light.</p><br/><p>During the journey, Zhou Weiqing had always guided the five women to fly at a stable speed. They were chatting and laughing along the way. The women did not feel the speed at all. However, the recent acceleration of their speed by Zhou Weiqing made them realize the difference between him and them. The air around them became distorted suddenly. In just a couple of breaths, they arrived at another place.</p><br/><p>What kind of speed was that? It could definitely be compared to traveling through space. It was so fast that even the air around them was distorted.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing had landed on the ground with the five women. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes were trained on a tree that would require a couple of people to circle it with a hug not far away from them. All the women, with the exception of Little Witch, had leveled up to Heavenly King Tier and their perception was pretty powerful. Moreover, all of them had Saint Energy in them. As they followed the direction of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze, they discovered something odd with the big tree.</p><br/><p>Looking at it with their eyes, it was just an ordinary old tree in the forest. However, under the probing of Divine Thought, one could see that the air around the old tree was slightly distorted. To their surprise, it was made from Life Energy. The old tree seemed to sense that it was being probed by the people\u2019s Divine Thought. As if it was sentient, it disappeared in a streak of silver light.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to run away?\u201d Zhou Weiqing smirked as the corner of his lips curled upwards. Next, the silver light shot towards Zhou Weiqing and the women, enveloping them in the glow. As the glow flickered, they were teleported elsewhere. It was a group Blink. The point was that even after the Blink was complete, the old tree that was made from Life Energy still remained in sight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

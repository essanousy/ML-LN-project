She created a big scene on the Heavenly Jewel Island as well as scolded Shangguan Tianyue to burn in hell. That was also the reason why she had always ignored Shangguan Tianyue.</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Tianyue held an honorable position, Tang Xian was the lady that he had loved the most in his life. As such, Little Fatty Zhou\u2019s father-in-law was actually afraid of his wife. Hence, no matter how big a commotion Tang Xian was creating, there was nothing he could do.</p><br/><p>They heard about the news when Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er landed on the island. Tang Xian immediately left along with Shangguan Tianyue. One reason was because she missed her daughter while another reason was because she was pissed with the bastard Zhou Weiqing. She could not get over it whenever she thought of how her three dear daughters would leave with him. That was why the \u201cmother-in-law beating up her son-in-law\u201d show was playing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was startled when he encountered Tang Xian\u2019s attack that came out of nowhere. However, he was a smart person after all, immediately understanding the reasons behind it. Hearing Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s scream of fear, Zhou Weiqing neither avoided nor defended against the attack and allowed Tang Xian to press her palm on his chest.</p><br/><p>A deep \u2018bang\u2019 resounded and a rich Fire Attribute flame blasted forth. However, that was not the end of it. Tang Xian had an impulsive character. Noticing that Zhou Weiqing had not bothered to defend at all, she started overthinking. She thought to herself, \u201cIs this bastard looking down on me? I have the cultivation base of Upper Level Ninth Jewel Heavenly Zong master after all.\u201d With blazing emotions, she held nothing back the second time as she flipped both of her palms and slapped them on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest 18 consecutive times.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue had just found out about Zhou Weiqing breaking through to the Heavenly King Tier so he did not bother about Tang Xian\u2019s attack. It was nothing for a mother-in-law to give her son-in-law two slaps. It would be better if it could let Tang Xian cool down. Hence, he stood aside without interfering.</p><br/><p>However, Shangguang Tianyue\u2019s eyes opened wide when Tang Xian displayed her prowess. Tang Xian did not hold back at all! From the flaming aura that was released from her palms as well as the color that had turned completely golden-red, her recognized that it was Tang Xian\u2019s ultimate technique, the Crimson Sunfire Palm. It could be identified as an inner skill possessing rich and compressed Fire Attribute to create a powerful offense. Even Shangguang Tianyue did not dare to let her slap him that much.</p><br/><p>\u201cXian\u2019er, please show mercy.\u201d When Shangguang Tianyue snapped out of his thoughts and said that, Tang Xian had already completed dishing out her 18 slaps. Zhou Weiqing secretly glared at his father-in-law. She was already done with her attack, wasn\u2019t it too late by now? By then, Shangguan Bing\u2019er had already dashed towards them and held her mother back. As Tang Xian was blocking her earlier, she did not see how Tang Xian had attacked Zhou Weiqing. All she heard was a series of deep roars.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian slightly regretted when she done with her attack. She heard that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base had already levelled up to the Ninth Jewel so thus could not care less when she was attacking. She was one of the people who found out about Zhou Weiqing possessing six types of attributes and therefore she understood that Zhou Weiqing was not any weaker than her currently. However, nobody expected this guy to not defend himself at all as well as allow her to slap him for 18 times. Although she did not give the slappings her all, the Crimson Sunfire Palm that could melt steel was not that easy to endure!</p><br/><p>However, the entire family was shocked by what Zhou Weiqing did next. After taking the 18 slaps, Zhou Weiqing remained with a smile on his face as he kneeled onto the ground immediately and gave Tang Xian three kowtows in respect. \u201cA pleasure to meet you, mother-in-law.\u201d Initially, Shangguang Tianyue wanted to help heal Zhou Weiqing but his raised arm could only pause in the air.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian\u2019s eyes bulged out as well. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re alright?\u201d No matter what, this guy looked as though nothing had happened to him. His aura was stable and he had a smile plastered across his face. The thing that Tang Xian found most shocking was that her blazing Crimson Sunfire Palm did not leave any marks Zhou Weiqing\u2019s clothes. She clearly felt all her strength being slapped into the kid\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stood up after the kowtow and said in all honesty, \u201cYour son-in-law won\u2019t have the guts to be injured. How else would I answer to the love of Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Tang Xian who had already calmed down by then had her anger driven to boiling point again. Fortunately, Bing\u2019er was restraining her so she did not attack again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little bastard, you\u2019re agitating me on purpose. Am I right?\u201d Zhou Weiqing forced out a smile and said, \u201cMother, how would I have the guts to agitate you?! If you\u2019re still mad, you can beat me up again. I would not dare to hide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguang Tianyue approached her and looked at Zhou Weiqing in a malicious manner while speaking to Tang Xian. \u201cDo you want me to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away. I\u2019m teaching this bastard a lesson, what does this have to do with you. You\u2019re nothing good yourself, birds of a feather flock together.\u201d Shangguang Tianyue\u2019s jaw dropped after being scolded as he thought to himself. \u201cAren\u2019t I innocent? You\u2019re teaching your son-in-law a lesson, that\u2019s none of my business!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xian then said to Zhou Weiqing furiously. \u201cYou little bastard. You\u2019re not learning anything good but you\u2019re fast in learning to be a womanizer. Isn\u2019t our Bing\u2019er good enough for you? Why are you flirting everywhere you go? Do you think it\u2019s easy for me to give birth to my three baby girls? And you\u2019ve gotten all of them hooked. I\u2019ll fight with you to the end if you don\u2019t explain it to me today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt a twitch in his heart as he scratched his head and knelt again while saying with a face of sincerity, \u201cDear mother-in-law, please allow Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er to marry me. I\u2019ll treat them well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the explanation that you\u2019re giving me?\u201d Tang Xian almost exploded from her anger. There was a saying that goes \u2018Never beat a person who is smiling\u2019. Since the beginning, this guy had been accepting anything that went his way. He seemed to be stating that you can just come at me and I would definitely not fight nor talk back. As long as you give me your daughters, you can do anything to me.</p><br/><p>Compared to before, Zhou Weiqing had a major improvement in his shamelessness. Most importantly, he was sincere even when he was being shameless. Zhou Weiqing nodded in all seriousness and said, \u201cDear mother-in-law, besides this explanation, I don\u2019t know how else I should explain this to you. As long as you allow Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er to marry me, I\u2019ll agree to any conditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xian looked at Zhou Weiqing with her eyes lit up, she seemed to have cooled down a little. \u201cYou\u2019d agree to any conditions? That was what you said!\u201d Zhou Weiqing nodded immediately like a chick pecking rice grains when he noticed her being less stubborn.</p><br/><p>Tang Xian raised her hand and pointed at Shangguan Tianyue who was next to her and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, my condition is simple. Help me beat him up, then I\u2019ll let my three daughters marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh?\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked at Tang Xian, stunned. Tian Xian then scoffed. \u201cWhat? Do you not dare to or are you not keen on doing what I instructed? It\u2019s not the first day I felt like beating him up yet I\u2019m no match for him. I\u2019ll surrender if you beat him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked embarrassed at Shangguan Tianyue and thought to himself, \u201cOh father-in-law, please say something!\u201d Shangguan Tianyue was pissed as he proceeded to speak, \u201cWhat you looking at? Come at me if you dare! I\u2019ve wanted to beat you up for a long time. How can I not be mad that you\u2019re dating three of my daughters?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a majestic voice resounded, \u201cEnough, do all of you not feel embarrassed enough? Come back to the palace.\u201d Hearing the voice, even Tang Xian who was in rage toned down. It was Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s voice, Tang Xian only felt respect towards this Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace Master. She scoffed as she pulled Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s hand and headed towards the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace direction.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er shot an apologetic look at Zhou Weiqing while he shrugged his shoulders helplessly and trailed behind them honestly as they made their way to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Shangguan Tianyue walked next to Zhou Weiqing, his lips moved for a while after giving him a glare. Zhou Weiqing was stunned and peeped at his father-in-law. The both of them held their heads low just like cocks who had just lost their fight as they followed behind Tang Xian and her daughter into the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>At the meeting hall of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, Shangguan Tianyang was seated at a towering position. Because Tang Xian and her daughter were present, Shangguan Tianyue decided to stand next to Zhou Weiqing. Shangguan Tianyang looked at Zhou Weiqing with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, I didn\u2019t expect all of you to complete the mission so quickly. The Luster Spatial Realm finally achieved peace not long ago. It seems like our preparation to move to Zhongtian City can stop now. Tell me about what you\u2019ve seen in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. I\u2019m very interested to know the situation there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhou Weiqing realize that they had felt the changes in the Luster Spatial Realm. He also realized that he had already settled the matter with the two gigantic dragons earlier. He then roughly told them about his journey of traveling on the ocean with Shangguan Bing\u2019er as well as what happened on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. Of course, he had to hide what happened between himself and Dongfang Hanyue.</p><br/><p>Listening to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s story, the Shangguan brothers showed surprised expressions occasionally. According to what Zhou Weiqing told them, the overall ability of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was perhaps above that of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Everything aside, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace could not compare to the six Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouses and the Dreadfiend Sea Naga they had over there. The Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace did not have anything at the Heavenly God Tier over here.</p><br/><p>Of course, if the two saint lands were to really fight, it would not be that easy for the Mysterious Heavenly Palace to defeat the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. In the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, the amount of powerhouses at the Heavenly King Tier and above were aplenty. That was also the main reason why their abilities surprised the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang continued nodding after hearing what Zhou Weiqing had said. \u201cWeiqing, I thank you on behalf of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. This matter has an extraordinary meaning to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and even the entire Zhongtian Empire. Even though I\u2019ve always treated you like family, I won\u2019t let the great sacrifice that you\u2019ve done for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to go to waste. Voice out whatever request that you have and I\u2019ll definitely fulfill it you as long as it is within the abilities of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, what Shangguan Tianyang said would have shocked the entire Boundless Mainland if it were to spread out. Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said. \u201cCan I have two requests?\u201d Shangguan Tianyang then replied with a smile, \u201cDo tell. We can discuss the matter as long as it\u2019s not about money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing called him a sly fox in his heart. When Shangguan Tianyang said that he could voice out his request, he meant that it would have to be discussed first. He was really thorough! \u201cFirst, I hope that the Zhongtian Empire could continue to support the Heavenly Bow Empire. Don\u2019t be stingy when we need help.\u201d Shangguan Tianyang nodded almost without hesitation. \u201cSure, I give you my word.\u201d Supporting the Heavenly Bow Empire would allow this little ally to get more powerful, which would benefit the Zhongtian Empire immensely. There was no reason for him to not say yes.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing proceeded to say. \u201cThe second request would be me officially proposing our marriage to you. I\u2019d like you to host my wedding with Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er.\u201d Tian Xian\u2019s eyes were wide open as she glared at him after hearing what Zhou Weiqing had just said.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue frowned as he stood aside but he held his tongue. No matter what sacrifice Zhou Weiqing had given for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, the relationship he had with his three daughters and his talent as well as his unpredictable potential that might become even more powerful in the future, there was no reason for them to disagree to the marriage. However, among the three Shangguan sisters, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er were slightly better but Shangguan Xue\u2019er was the heir-to-be of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. It was not a good thing to let the heir of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to marry an outsider.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang spoke again after a moment of silence. \u201cWeiqing, theoretically speaking, I don\u2019t have any reason to reject you. I should probably give you my promise for everything that you\u2019ve done for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace as well as the relationships that you have with them. However, you know well that Xue\u2019er is still the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace candidate as the heir to the throne. She means a lot to us as she is the one who will inherit the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s. If she marries you, then who should inherit the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled. \u201cActually, that\u2019s not difficult to solve. You and father-in-law are both in your prime. Let\u2019s not talk about how long you can live. Living another 100 to 200 years shouldn\u2019t be a problem for the both of you. Although is the heir, she won\u2019t be inheriting the palace anytime soon. As long as you promise to let me marry them, I\u2019ll promise you that the first born of any of the three of them would be sitting on the seat of the Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shangguan brothers had odd expressions on their faces when they heard what he said. This bastard amazingly good at taking advantage! It sounded like what he said made sense, but if that happened, the future master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace would be Zhou Weiqing\u2019s child. It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that he would be taking over the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace indirectly?</p><br/><p>Scoffing madly before he smiled, Shangguan Tianyang replied. \u201cThis suggestion isn\u2019t impossible to realize but I can\u2019t decide on my own as Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er are my second brother and sister\u2019s children. How about this? There won\u2019t be any problem with me as long as you manage to convince your soon-to-be father and mother-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing eyes opened wide when he heard what Shangguan Tianyang had said. What the hell, is this the legendary skill of passing the ball around?</p><br/><p>However, there was nothing else that he could do. He then looked at Tang Xian with his pitiful face but Tang Xian gave him a cold glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. Unless you do as I say and beat that old thing up. Hmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was a rejection in disguise. Shangguan Tianyue had earned his fame over many years and he was popular among the Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouses. He had just leveled-up to the Middle Heavenly Emperor Tier not long ago. Putting aside the fact that it was impossible to beat his own father-in-law up no matter what, even if he wanted to, did he had such powerful abilities?</p><br/><p>Tang Xian despised this kid more and more and that was why she came up with such an unreasonable request. Seeing Zhou Weiqing look more and more worked up, all Shangguan Bing\u2019er could do was to watch silently. She kept pulling her mother\u2019s clothes but Tang Xian could not bring herself to become softer. Eventually, it was Shangguan Tianyang who came to the rescue.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, stop being difficult to second brother. How about we settle this matter this way. Weiqing is our junior after all, it\u2019ll definitely impossible to get him to beat up second brother. Why don\u2019t we let them compete against each other. If he manages to stand 30 minutes of combat with second brother, he\u2019ll win the match. Let\u2019s not make his life difficult and let the three children marry him. If we can\u2019t even stand 30 minutes of combat, breaking them apart isn\u2019t something so good. I\u2019ll be in charge of Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er\u2019s marriage. They\u2019ll still marry Weiqing but Xue\u2019er will stay to inherit the position of Palace Master in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. What say you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s with a just smile, Zhou Weiqing truly wanted to show that man his middle finger. It sounded like his suggestion made sense as it covered every aspect. However, he was actually trying to keep Zhou Weiqing close while keeping Xue\u2019er the heir of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. After all, he did not want to offend Zhou Weiqing and be hated by him as the talent that was he showed was getting increasingly stunning. If he became their enemy, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace might not be at peace in the future.</p><br/><p>Moreover, marriage was not something that you could stop even if you wanted to. Would they not lose everything if the three Shangguan sisters were to run away together? Shangguan Tianyang had decided to let Zhou Weiqing marry them since the beginning. On the other hand, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was a considerate person so she had discussed it with Shangguan Tianyang not too long ago. She had indicated that she was willing to stay and inherit the Palace Master position within the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Because of that, it was like Zhou Weiqing had fallen into Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s trap as soon as he got back. If his plan was not revealed, it would be working according to his wishes. Tang Xian did not make a sound, she was a smart person and naturally, she understood what Sangguan Tianyang meant. It was great that she could keep one of her dear daughters with her! Shangguan Tianyue locked eyes with his brother, naturally already knowing what Shangguan Tianyang meant since the beginning so he nodded lightly.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone had their attention on Zhou Weiqing as they waited patiently for his answer. In reality, even Shangguan Tianyang was anxious right now. As soon as Zhou Weiqing decided to decline or even leave right away, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace would be in a bad situation. No matter what, Zhou Weiqing was the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s saviour. If Zhou Weiqing was agitated, he would not marry the three Shangguan sisters any longer and the relationship between the Heavenly Bow Empire and the Zhongtian Empire might not be too good in the future. Besides, within the one year that Zhou Weiqing left, the mainland had gone through a tremendous change. The Zhongtian Empire even sensed that an intense crisis was coming so they needed the Heavenly Bow Empire as their ally badly.</p><br/><p>Sensing that everyone was looking at him, Zhou Weiqing squinted as he clenched his fists. A light golden yellow flashed by his calm and moist eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I agree.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She kept shaking her head. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing then said sternly, \u201cYou\u2019re lying. A liar must be punished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like the world was spinning as Little Witch was pressed on the bed by someone who was heavy. When she looked at the mischievous face that was inching closer to her own face, Little Witch\u2019s heart started beating three times faster than usual. She clenched her hands and dared not look at him as she closed her eyes. However, she was not averse to what was happening to her at the moment, and there were some anticipatory feelings even though she was nervous.</p><br/><p>In another room, Shangguan Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, Bing\u2019er, and Tian\u2019er were sitting together.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at Bing\u2019er and Tian\u2019er and asked with a curious expression on her face, \u201cIs it possible to elevate our cultivation base by having sex with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er rolled her eyes at Fei\u2019er and said, \u201cThis is the 21st time you\u2019ve asked that. Why don\u2019t you try it to see if it works?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s beautiful face turned red. \u201cI\u2019m shy. It\u2019s that idiot Little Fatty\u2019s fault. Why would he want to go to the Elf Tribe for no reason? Otherwise, we won\u2019t be taken advantage of. The Elf Tribe is very dangerous. How can we help him if we don\u2019t raise our cultivation base? Do you think this is a wicked plan that the idiot came up with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er burst out laughing and said, \u201cOh, please. I think you\u2019ve been wanting to do that since the beginning. We\u2019ve known each other for so long. Do you want me to teach you a technique or two to make him surrender to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She then got closer to Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s ear and said something to her softly. Suddenly, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s face turned red like she had too much to drink. \u201cYou! You\u2019re so bad. I don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore. Sister, Tian\u2019er bullied me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blush on Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s face was not any lesser than Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s. Although Tian\u2019er had lowered her voice, with their cultivation base, how could she not hear what was said?</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er giggled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re all shy now, but you\u2019ll have to do it with that idiot sooner or later. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask Bing\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t ask me. I know nothing.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er lowered her head. However, judging from the way she reacted, it seemed like Tian\u2019er had spoken the truth.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s eyes met and their beautiful faces turned red.</p><br/><p>They had the thought of having sex with Little Fatty Zhou. How could it be possible that they did not have other intention apart from elevating their cultivation base so that they could help him get to the Elf Tribe? In their hearts, Zhou Weiqing was their man since the beginning. Did they not want to secure his heart by giving their most precious things to him? Moreover, Tian\u2019er, Bing\u2019er, and even Little Witch had already had sex with him. At this point, they were worried. Would his feelings towards them fade if they did not have sex with him? Although it sounded unfair, there was nothing that they could do, since they had fallen in love with that meanie. If Zhou Weiqing knew what they were thinking, perhaps he would be so happy that even his anus might expand\u2026</p><br/><p>In the morning, a soft little lamb was woken up from her sweet dreams by the touch of a pair of warm and big hands. From the blush on her face, one could tell that they had intense sex last night. Even until now, the heat between them had not dissipated. In reality, that was the truth. Little Witch\u2019s wisdom was not inferior to the other women\u2019s. Although she looked weak, she was still a Heavenly Jewel Master with Seven Jewels cultivation base after all. Her body could not be compared to ordinary females\u2019. Zhou Weiqing was over the moon because of the good time they had last night and was still energetic after being up the entire night.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t mess around. I\u2019ve just fallen asleep and here you go again.\u201d Little Witch buried her head in his arms and dared not look at him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cYou seductive little devil. You\u2019re the one that seduced me. How can you blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho seduced you? Hmm? \u2018Smooch'\u201d Little Witch lifted her head up in disdain, but her lips were kissed by Zhou Weiqing once again. However, her eyes were wide open.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing noticed something was wrong and freed her lips immediately. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hanyue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Hanyue looked at the brightly lit room and exclaimed in surprise, \u201cIt\u2019s already morning. Oh, no. They\u2019re still waiting for me to go back. What should I do? It\u2019s all your fault.\u201d She punched Zhou Weiqing\u2019s broad chest a few times before she turned around. She then quickly flipped herself over and tried to run out after putting on her clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis silly girl. It\u2019s already morning. Do you think they waited for you until morning!?\u201d Zhou Weiqing pulled her over. Because he had a strong physique, he would not be exhausted even if he had sex for a month without stopping. Even then, he still could not get enough of it.</p><br/><p>Little Witch begged, \u201cPlease let me go. My dear husband, they\u2019ll blame me if I don\u2019t go back to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was aroused by her calling him \u2018dear husband\u2019. Eventually, he let her go. At that moment, he began thinking to himself that he had to get a bigger bed in the future. What would it feel like to be able to sleep with all of them under a blanket? Hehe.</p><br/><p>Little Witch ran back to her room and bumped into Tian\u2019er before she could get inside.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er looked at her teasingly and laughed with her voice lowered, \u201cYou must be on cloud nine. We were waiting for you until late at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch was embarrassed as she replied, \u201cI, I fell asleep. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She did not have the urge to compete with Tian\u2019er anymore. Tian\u2019er was already carrying Zhou Weiqing\u2019s child. Since Tian\u2019er and Zhou Weiqing were both cultivating Saint Energy, she had the highest position among the five of them.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er giggled and pushed her into the room. \u201cYou wait here. I\u2019ll get them to come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>A while later, Tian\u2019er brought the Shangguan triplets over. Shangguan Xue\u2019er was shy, but Shangguan Fei\u2019er could not wait to ask, \u201cHow was it, Little Witch? Did it work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch was stunned for a moment before she snapped out of her shock. \u201cI, I forgot to feel it. Give me a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Last night was a crazy night. She had indeed forgotten to feel what she and Zhou Weiqing were doing last night. She felt like she was a small boat in the midst of an ocean storm, as if she was being thrown up and down like she was wandering between peaks and valleys. Now that Shangguan Fei\u2019er asked, she finally remembered that it was an experimental mission.</p><br/><p>As Little Witch thought about it, her body lit up while a layer of light reddish gold halo emanated from her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh? What\u2019s this?\u201d Little Witch was shocked when she found that her original Heavenly Energy had completely changed. It was now thicker, stickier, and became a massive force that she was unsure of.</p><br/><p>As the Heavenly Energy was released, her seven Heavenly Jewels were naturally released as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still seven!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er said in a sorry manner. She was slightly disappointed.</p><br/><p>However, in the next moment, some changes happened to Little Witch\u2019s body. Her seven Heavenly Jewels became reddish gold in color as the reddish gold Heavenly Energy was released. Little Witch suddenly had a change in her facial expression as she sat on the ground with her legs crossed. The reddish gold energy that surrounded her body began to fluctuate. All of her Heavenly Jewels were shining brightly, releasing life, darkness, and demonic aura interchangeably.</p><br/><p>The other four women\u2019s cultivation base was higher than the Little Witch, so they could clearly sense that Little Witch\u2019s cultivation base was increasing tremendously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really works?\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at each other with shock written on their faces.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er was the one who understood Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ability the most, so she burst into laughter and said, \u201cOf course it works. That meanie\u2019s Galaxia Saint Energy has already evolved into the Nebula Saint Energy. He definitely won\u2019t be stingy when it comes to us. Actually, he doesn\u2019t even need to do anything. All he has to do is convert the Heavenly Energy in Yuehan\u2019s body into the evolved Nebula Saint Energy. With the level of pureness and richness of the Saint Energy, it\u2019ll naturally cause a change in Little Witch\u2019s body. I guess the level-up this time will be big.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you all yesterday? He\u2019s right. If you all come with him, there\u2019ll be a lot of benefits under the merging of Yin and Yang. It\u2019s possible to break through to the Heavenly King Tier. To put it simply, our Little Fatty is the best tonic in the world right now. I\u2019ve thought it through. To prevent him from seducing other women, we\u2019ll have to work together to drain him. Which of you will be going with him tonight?\u201d Tian\u2019er had a mischievous expression on her face when she said that.</p><br/><p>She went over to Shangguan Fei\u2019er and embraced her as she said, \u201cOr why don\u2019t the both of you go together? Little Fatty is good in this. Since the both of you will be doing it for the first time, you might not be able to handle him on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, you\u2019re so naughty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing had no idea what the five of them were talking about. In reality, he did not really do much last night. However, anyone who had sex with him would naturally be affected by the rotation of his Nebula Saint Energy. The tiniest trace of Saint Energy on the heavens and earth had been tempering Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. It was the same even when he was breathing, so when he was having sex with Little Witch, the Nebula Saint Energy would naturally enter her body and synchronize with her original Heavenly Energy. Moreover, Little Witch was absorbing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s essence all night, so it made sense that her body was filled with Nebula Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, one should never forget that she was different from the Shangguan triplets because she possessed Saint Attribute as well. Although her Demonic Attribute was incomplete, she had the Saint Energy foundation. This made it easier for her to accept Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Nebula Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>After washing up, Zhou Weiqing went to look for the five women to have breakfast. To his surprise and disappointment, none of the five women were there. He had no idea what they were doing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

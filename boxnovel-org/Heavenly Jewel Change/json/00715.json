As he dashed to stop before Meng Xing, he unleashed one of his learned abilities, the legendary Dragon Claw that aimed at a certain female body part\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, Meng Xing\u2019s transformation had not really come to a complete end yet. Even though her legs were already at the final stage of turning into a dragon\u2019s tail, her upper body was still transforming. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s claw made her burn with shame. At the same time, a great suction force erupted from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palms.</p><br/><p>The Concentrated Heavenly Energy was hastily drained from Meng Xing\u2019s body into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s. The Blackfiend Dragon Transformation she was going through was then halted.</p><br/><p>Taking a close look at Meng Xing, Zhou Weiqing chuckled insolently and said, \u201cAny person worth his or her salt will have a number of life-saving skills. I know I will not be your match after you finish the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation, but there is a fatal weakness to this transformation \u2013 it takes too bloody long. While I am unable to harm you during this process, it doesn\u2019t prevent me from physically touching you, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was rendered speechless as her wide eyes stared at Zhou Weiqing. A continuous sensation of numbness came from her chest and more importantly, the amount of Heavenly Energy leaking from her body was slowly increasing. She was unable to maintain the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation due to the heavy leakage of her Heavenly Energy. Most crucially, the energy drained from her body was not at the Sixth Jewel Tier Heavenly Energy but her own Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was shocked by the discovery as well. The store of Meng Xing\u2019s Heavenly Energy was much more intense than he expected. As the wealth of Heavenly Energy channeled into his body, he felt like he was swallowed by the warm embrace of the vast ocean. The energy immediately changed in his constitution into Saint Energy and through the conversion of Saint Energy, it became the glittering Saint Energy Galaxia.</p><br/><p>In just ten breath circulations, Zhou Weiqing realized the increase in his Saint Energy had already superseded the increase he managed from the whole month of cultivation.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly Emperor! She had the cultivation of a Heavenly Emperor and not a Heavenly King\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was astonished by this discovery.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was mentally out of it as well. Her Blackfiend Dragon Transformation was being undone, even her consolidated demonic equipment was disappearing. The powerful engulfing force of the Demonic Drain was exhausting her Heavenly Energy at a tremendous rate. However, the one thing that she simply could not stand was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s two hands were grabbing her ample bosom.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a burst of terrifying energy detonated from within Meng Xing. Zhou Weiqing felt his whole body shiver and a force threw him backward; ending the Demonic Drain. He landed with a heavy thud after being sent flying for about several hundred meters.</p><br/><p>Even if with his full force and the borrowed Saint Energy, he might not have been able to consistently drain the Heavenly Energy of a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, much less at the time, as he only had the cultivation base of six jewels.</p><br/><p>After losing the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation, Meng Xing was in her birthday suit. Therefore, she quickly covered her body with a long robe. After she was dressed, a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse like herself crumbled to the floor in the next second, panting for air. Her body still convulsed incessantly.</p><br/><p>Be it male or female, the chest was an extremely sensitive part of the body. Having her Heavenly Energy drained through that particular area of her body combined with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s unsavory hands, it had numbed Meng Xing. The palpitation from her chest caused a series of reactions to occur throughout her body. Even though she had managed to push Zhou Weiqing off her, her mind still drew a blank.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing who laid quite a distance away was also having a hard time formulating his thoughts. Even though Meng Qing had sent him flying with a shockwave but she did not put enough force behind him to truly kill him. The fall might not have been pretty but with his physical constitution, it was definitely not enough to kill him.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly God Tier powerhouse at 29 years old? How is that possible? Meng Xing had finally been able to give him a shock after the many shocks he had given her.</p><br/><p>No wonder the four elders of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace and God Tier Master Nie Han were so courteous towards her. Her cultivation had reached such an incredible level. The sprawling room was quiet except the sound of their breaths.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s both hands were covered over her chest and her body was trembling. An indescribable sensation was coursing through every inch of her body, originating from her chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kill him, I really should kill him.\u2019 However, she could not summon any energy or lethal intent. She just felt dazed and exhausted.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing crouched down to the floor trying to catch his breath. At that moment, he was clever enough to know it was unwise to attract the wrath of a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse. He reminded himself to not anger Meng Xing by bringing up the fact that she had reneged on her promise.</p><br/><p>The unsteady peace lasted for one steep of tea before Meng Xing was slowly herself again. She stood up slowly and before she managed to straighten herself; she even faltered for a bit.</p><br/><p>Staring at Zhou Weiqing who was still on the floor far away from her, she threw a black crystal to the floor with a curiously excessive force and the next moment, her body disappeared into thin air.</p><br/><p>The moment Meng Xing disappeared, Zhou Weiqing clambered up from his floored position and hastily shrugged into his set of clothes. He tidied his attire up to ensure Bing\u2019er would not be able to find a single fault.</p><br/><p>After he was satisfied, he walked to where Meng Xing was and picked up the black crystal. Then he looked at his two hands and laughed salaciously, \u201cThey do feel nice without the armor and scales. But that was close, she could transform into a Heavenly Emperor\u2026 Almost died back there.\u201d</p><br/><p>His hands arced into two claws and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s smile turned perverted. His left hand smacked his right hand and his right hand smacked his left hand. In a faux lecture, he scolded, \u201cNaughty and lewd!\u201d</p><br/><p>He channeled Heavenly Energy into the black crystal and in a flash, he found himself back at the empty field outside of the sixth floor of Mysterious Heavenly Castle.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing had long since disappeared. After the initial wave of clandestine satisfaction, he was suddenly washed over by hopelessness; he had completely crossed her this time. It would be extremely difficult to mend the bridge between them. Alas, not all was lost. At the very least, he had managed to confirm Meng Xing\u2019s true capability.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly Emperor, one that could use the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation. Zhou Weiqing understood if Meng Xing utilized the full range of her power, the sky would change and the earth would shake!</p><br/><p>Zhou Fatty who had always been self-satisfied with his talent was definitely devastated that day. A 29-year-old Heavenly Emperor. He dared say, if he did not run into any miraculous encounter in the near future, that would then be a level he would not be able to achieve.</p><br/><p>Back in the room, Shangguan Bing\u2019er forwent her cultivation training to wait for his return. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s match with Meng Xing did not last long this time and he soon returned. Even though he had taken extra care to smooth out his appearance, he still looked rather disorderly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did she call for you?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er asked him with a curious glow in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed bitterly, \u201cTo beat me up, probably to test the true extent of my strength, or perhaps the six elements I commanded in the Blackfiend Dragon form had aroused her jealousy, or that she has suspicions that she needed to clarify.\u201d He did not have the guts to tell the truth.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er bought his lies and asked with concern, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and explained, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Since she was only testing my abilities, she limited her power to a cultivation base of six jewels. However, her cultivation is even greater than what I predicted. She is a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, can you imagine that? At only 29 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er was duly shocked. \u201cIn other words, this place has at least six Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouses, Blackfiend Dragons, and Heavenly God Tier powerhouses. This is completely way above the power level of our Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded. \u201cIt does seem that way. After all, their family is the largest in this Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. This situation is nothing out of the ordinary. But don\u2019t worry, after all, we came from Boundless Mainland. There is no weakness they can take to their advantage. As long as we do not make the first move, we can live here in peace. However, this also means that we have to be extra careful on our mission of hunting the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded and understood. \u201cFatty, father, and uncle have said, we should always put safety as our priority. Zhongtian city should have started their preparations. Your safety is of utmost importance. If it is too dangerous, it would not matter if we return empty-handed. We should not take unnecessary risks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cIt is still too early to worry about things like that. We still have ample time left to prepare and observe. There is no downside to our staying here. At least this place has sufficient atmospheric energy that is beneficial to our training. Let us continue this conversation later. I need to first absorb the Heavenly Energy that I have drained from Meng Xing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing returned to bed and sat with his legs folded. He entered a state of cultivation almost instantly. This was one of the many benefits of having Saint Energy \u2013 there was no need to worry about. The Saint Energy would regulate itself within the body. Zhou Weiqing noticed the increasing amount of Saint Energy that glittered like the galaxy collected in his Dantian. The galactic halo around the core Death Acupuncture Point had also burned brighter.</p><br/><p>Draining was definitely more efficient than cultivating! Even though the period Zhou Weiqing spent draining the energy from Meng Xing was not long, Meng Xing was an authentic Heavenly God Tier powerhouse. The truncated draining period still brought an abundance of benefits to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Draining the Heavenly Energy of Heavenly Jewel Masters and Heavenly Beasts were two completely different concepts. Even though the Heavenly Energy residing within powerful Heavenly Beasts was immense and pure, it would still be incompatible with human cultivation due to its beastly nature. After absorption, one would have to commit to endless filtering as the energy could be assimilated into the human body. Furthermore, the cultivation method of Heavenly Beasts was wildly different from human cultivation. Therefore, even after a proper filter, there would only be only a small handful of talented individuals like Zhou Weiqing that could fully make use of their power.</p><br/><p>However, Meng Xing was different. She was an authentic Heavenly Jewel Master, a Heavenly Emperor one at that. The purity of the Heavenly Energy in her body impressed Zhou Weiqing greatly. Even though its property could not rival Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy, it could be assimilated into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body to be converted into a great supplement to his Saint Energy without much need for filtration.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

With the addition of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master Zhou, the overall strength of our Palace will definitely rise to the next step. As all of you can see, Consecrated Zhou is still extremely young, the youngest God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in all the history of our XuanTian Palace, perhaps even the entire Continent. I believe that even in the Boundless Mainland far away, there will not be a God Tier Consolidating Equipment as young as Master Zhou.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cFrom now on, I ask that all of you treat Consecrated Zhou with the same respect as you treat me. Of course, I also hope that Consecrated Zhou can create more God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, and that is closely interrelated with everyone here. Come, let us raise our cups to celebrate this historic moment.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">On the table near their seats, there were all sorts of food and drinks, refreshments, wine. Under the leadership of the XuanTian Palace Master, all those present stood up, raising their cups as they said respectfully to Zhou Weiqing: \u201cCongratulations Consecrated Zhou for joining the Palace.\u201d This time, even the other two Consecrated and the four Grand Elders also stood up together to join in the toast to Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As they drank together, the XuanTian Palace Master Dong Fang looked at Zhou Weiqing. However, his mask covered even the eyes with a crystalline object, and thus Zhou Weiqing could not see his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cConsecrated Zhou, how about giving us a few words?\u201d The Palace Master smiled.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing smiled in return, nodding. Holding his wine glass, he turned to the other XuanTian Palace powerhouses and said: \u201cThank you everyone for your wishes. My name is Zhou Weiqing. Although I am lucky to have reached the realm of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, I am still after all very young. In terms of cultivation stage, I am far from being able to compare with all of you present. Even in terms of creating God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, I am definitely inferior when compared to Consecrated Dreamwake and Nie Han.\u201d At this point, he paused for a while, leaving the people below rather confused.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">No one could understand why Zhou Weiqing would suddenly speak such words, to actually disparage himself to such a degree.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHowever, perhaps there is one point I have an absolute advantage in. That is, the speed that I can create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. As long as I have enough materials, then I am confident in saying that in this entire world, there is no one faster than I in creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Not in the entire history, and even in the future, will that be surpassed.\u201d His words were calm, spoken in a tranquil tone, but clear and full of resolution.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As soon as his words rang out, even though the XuanTian Palace Master was present, the entire hall burst into an uproar.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Arrogance. This was absolute arrogance. As the saying goes, step back a little then soar ahead; with the self-abasement at the front, and that absolute confidence and arrogant proclamation\u2026 such a mix caused the entire XuanTian Palace upper echelons to burst into a commotion. Even the four Grand Elders couldn\u2019t help but furrow their brows. Zhou Weiqing had bragged too greatly, without even leaving any leeway for himself.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Turning towards the XuanTian Palace Master, Zhou Weiqing bowed slightly and said: \u201cForgive me Palace Master, but since today\u2019s dinner is a reception for myself, then I would like all the XuanTian Palace seniors here to have a greater understanding of myself. I would like to demonstrate my skills; after all, empty words are useless, and I prefer to use actions to speak for me.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The XuanTian Palace Master hesitated for a moment, but very quickly he nodded towards Zhou Weiqing, giving him an inviting gesture.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seated to the side, both God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters had their eyes glowing in interest. Ever since Zhou Weiqing had entered the XuanTian Palace, although he appeared arrogant, the power he had shown had also deeply shocked these two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters. As such, now that Zhou Weiqing personally requested to show his strength once more, the two of them were naturally happy to watch.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Compared to the other upper echelons of the XuanTian Palace, there was totally no competitive spirit between these God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters. That was because no matter what, any and every single God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master would enjoy an unshakable position and status. In contrary, it was important that they had a good relationship, only by constant communication and research together would they be able to improve their individual and overall Consolidating Equipment Scroll creation skills and techniques. As such, they were more than happy to see Zhou Weiqing display greater strength and skills, as it would only benefit them too.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Seeing the Palace Master nod, all of their gazes turned to focus on Zhou Weiqing, especially those powerhouses seated on the outer regions who had not reached the Elder status yet; their gazes on him were especially heated and enthusiastic.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had to be known that usually the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls that these Masters would create would naturally be prioritised for those upper echelons. Besides the Palace Master, it would be the Grand Elders, the most talented core disciples, Elders, so on so forth\u2026 There were only two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters, and the higher level a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll, the more effort, vigor, resources and time it took. As such, these powerhouses who were just below the Elder status were in the awkward position of pretty much being impossible for them to gain any of the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters\u2019 works. However, with the addition of Zhou Weiqing, perhaps this would change. After all, the addition of one more person would greatly increase the speed and total numbers of creation.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, that was not to say that they were hoping to gain God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls from Zhou Weiqing; that was not a realistic dream at all. However, even if it were Grandmaster or Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, those created by a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master would be far superior to those created by ordinary Grandmaster Consolidating Equipment Masters. As such, when Zhou Weiqing said his creation of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls was the fastest in history, how could these XuanTian Palace powerhouses not look at him in a new favourable light?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Of course, all of this was easily seen through by Zhou Weiqing. Of course, the reason why he was speaking so arrogantly was so that he could gain the recognition and approval of the XuanTian Palace upper echelon. Although the Grand Elders had higher status and recognition, to Zhou Weiqing perhaps these Elders and lower had a greater meaning to him. After all, these powerhouses would be easier to win over. As long as he could display sufficient power, he could gain their approval in a short period of time, allowing him to better complete his quest in the XuanTian Continent.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cBing\u2019er, come.\u201d Zhou Weiqing beckoned towards Shangguan Bing\u2019er.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shangguan Bing\u2019er got out of her seat and walked towards him. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mouth moved silently, as he spoke to her quickly in voice transference. Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded subtly, walking towards him before turning around, leaving her back to him.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the onlookers watched in puzzlement, Shangguan Bing\u2019er bent over slightly, her hands propping herself up on her knees.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This was truly a strange position indeed, as her round pert buttocks, covered only with the blue robes of the XuanTian Palace, were now lifted and pointed perkily at Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Although Shangguan Bing\u2019er knew that in such a setting and occasion, Zhou Weiqing would know how far to go, and would definitely not do anything excessive, such a position was just too embarrassing, causing her to blush.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Perhaps in terms of visual impact, Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not give the same kind of stunning and breathtaking reaction as\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Dreamwake, it was more because of her disposition than her beauty. Dreamwake had the sort of noble aura like Princess Cai Cai, while Shangguan Bing\u2019er had a more gentle, sweet aura, like that of a girl next door. The difference between the two also meant that Shangguan Bing\u2019er gave others a more approachable feeling, perhaps even easier to move others, causing them to want to protect her, whereas Dreamwake would easily become a dream goddess of men.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As such, as the upper echelon powerhouses all saw Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s actions and the blush on her cheeks, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a favourable impression towards her. These powerhouses were mostly rather advanced in age, and far past the youthful age of being rash and impulsive towards the opposite sex. Perhaps it was more a deep, inner liking.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, in the next instant, that \u2018liking\u2019 expression disappeared from their faces, replaced with shock. Absolute shock.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Four thick rays of dark gold light sprang forth from Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s body, like surging waves billowing out. At the same time, a massive pair of dark gold wings sprouted out from behind her back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When they sensed the powerful Heavenly Energy reverberations rolling forth, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters and four Grand Elders who were closest to her stood up abruptly, a fierce aura instantly pressing down on Shangguan Bing\u2019er.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cStop.\u201d A cold, clear shout rang out. Only then did the four Grand Elders\u2019 auras stop pressing down on Shangguan Bing\u2019er. The one who had spoke was Dreamwake, but although the Grand Elders did not take action, their full attentions were still focused on the pair of wings that spread out behind Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s back.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">God Tier Consolidated Equipment. Without question, the four rays of dark gold light had told everyone that these massive wings behind Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s back were actually all God Tier Consolidated Equipment.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Those with slightly lower cultivation levels could only perceive it with their five senses, but for those Elders at the Heavenly King stage and above, the shock was even greater. That was because they could clearly see that the pair of giant wings extending behind Shangguan Bing\u2019er was not just as simple as being God Tier Consolidated Equipment, but it was actually a Set. More so, it was an Assembly Set! Amongst the God Tier Consolidated Equipment, this was considered extremely highly ranked, nearly on the same level as Legendary Sets. Furthermore, it was possible her four-piece Assembly Set Wings might even be part of a Legendary Set. If that were true, then just that single fact alone would place it amongst the absolute top of all God Tier Consolidated Equipment.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Naturally, Dreamwake and Nie Han were the ones able to tell the quality of the goods. As soon as she shouted to stop the Grand Elders from attacking, Dreamwake subconsciously looked at Nie Han, and she was able to see the same shock in his eyes that she was feeling.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Both of them clearly knew that in order to create such Consolidated Equipment, just in terms of material, it was definitely not easy to collect and gather. Furthermore, this was definitely not an accomplishment that a single God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master could perform on his own. Even if it were the two of them working together in fully unity, with all materials abundant, without several years of preparation, they would not be able to create such a level of God Tier Consolidated Equipment.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The large wings spread open, added together they were nearly ten metres long. Since Shangguan Bing\u2019er was bent over slightly, it was as if the two massive wings were spread open right in front of Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shangguan Bing\u2019er had after all accompanied Zhou Weiqing here, and to all the other onlookers, it was natural that Zhou Weiqing was about to display this unique God Tier Consolidated Set of Wings.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">However, Zhou Weiqing used his following actions to tell them that this was all just a beginning.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

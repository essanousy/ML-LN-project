Had they only went to devour some heavenly beasts to increase their Saint Energy, only God would know how long it would take them to absorb 3,000 drops of Saint Energy. After all, the number of heavenly beasts that were at least at the Heavenly King tier and above were very, very limited, even if it was in the Heavenly Snow Mountain. It was absolutely impossible for them to simply devour them and transform as they wished.</p><br/><p>However, the amount of energy contained in the Destruction Energy was so incredibly vast. Both Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er could clearly feel the increasing speed of the huge Saint Energy Whirlpool that was at their joined hands.</p><br/><p>The phrase \u2018as one fell, another rose up\u2019 was the perfect one to describe them. As the Saint Energy slowly increased in amount, the amount of Destruction Energy that they could devour each time gradually grew as well. Not only that, the speed at which they devoured the energy was accelerating as well.</p><br/><p>Right now, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er was so absorbed in the process that they had completely entered a state of oblivion. The Heavenly Energy in their bodies were being replaced by the pure Saint Energy. Along with the nourishment from this energy, their bodies were slowly being enhanced.</p><br/><p>The three Shangguan sister obtained various benefits as they cultivated at the same time. They too were advancing at a tremendous pace.</p><br/><p>In the Lustre Spatial Realm, time was no longer a problem. Nobody knew how long had passed by when suddenly, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er was startled at the same time, hastily opening their eyes.</p><br/><p>Such a sudden awakening appalled the both of them. Glancing at each other, they were pleasantly surprised to find that Heavenly Energy no longer existed in their body, they were all completely replaced by the Saint Energy in every corner of their bodies. Not only that, the energy seemed to continue pouring into them</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Yet, the Destruction Energy in the body of Hui Yao the dragon was only halfway devoured by them. Both of them were taken completely surprised yet struck dumb with amazement by this realization.</p><br/><p>After all, both of them now was possessed at least 3,000 drops of Saint Energy in their bodies. Yet, in such a circumstance, the Destruction Energy was still not completely devoured. One could easily imagine how horrifying this energy was.</p><br/><p>However, a new problem had arisen in Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er. They realized almost simultaneously that each of their bodies could no longer contain the Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>That was right, their bodies could no longer contain it. After the Saint Energy had exceeded 3,000 drops, all they could feel was their body beginning to swell. Thought the Saint Energy was being continuously built up in their body, they began to feel a pain because of the swelling. It was apparent that this was not a good sign at all. Not only that, the Saint Energy did not even begin to show the slightest signs of it solidifying into a Saint Pill though it had reached the threshold of 3,000 drops.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What happened?\u201d Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er glanced at each other, obviously confused by this matter. The Demonic Devour was still going on and the Saint Energy was still building up in their bodies. If this continued, both of their bodies would probably be blown up by the Saint Energy. No matter how strong and tough their bodies were, it would still be feeble in the face of Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, come here,\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s clever mind started to work at this instance as he quickly gave an instruction.</p><br/><p>The three Shangguan sisters who were cultivating behind them opened their eyes in shock. The faith that Shangguan Bing\u2019er had in Zhou Weiqing was absolute and incomparable. Immediately, she stepped forward and stood in front of him with a surprised and concerned look, \u201cFatty, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d Zhou Weiqing demanded without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Looking at the anxiousness on his face, Shangguan Bing\u2019er decided to put aside her shyness as she knew that this time, Zhou Weiqing must have his reasons for making that demand.</p><br/><p>She offered her lips and the two pair of lips met halfway as they kissed. In an instant, Bing\u2019er\u2019s petite body started to tremble sharply. At that moment, her body was rendered into a silverish, white color. The rich, flavorful Saint Energy flew into her body like a stream, slowly spreading across her entire body.</p><br/><p>As the saying went \u2014 When a man builds up semen in his body, the body would automatically release it through a wet dream [1]. Since his own body could no longer hold it in any longer, Zhou Weiqing could not possibly let the Saint Energy go to waste, right?</p><br/><p>He then thought of a method to offload this energy. After all, passing on the Saint Energy to the three Shangguan Sisters would definitely be a commendable act as well.</p><br/><p>With the addition of Shangguan Bing\u2019er now, along with the outflow of the Saint Energy, the pressure that was pressing on Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er\u2019s bodies immediately dissipated without warning. Due to the sufficient Saint Energy in their bodies, the transformation speed of the Destruction Energy was increased to the next level higher.</p><br/><p>Afraid that Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s body would be affected by such a huge sudden transfusion of Saint Energy, the moment he had transfused 500 drops of Saint Energy into her, Zhou Weiqing stopped the kiss and summoned Shangguan Fei\u2019er to step forward instead.</p><br/><p>Shyly, Bing\u2019er retreated to a side and Fei\u2019er was bolder compared to her. She even put her arms around his neck as she kissed him, with it being her turn to accept the Saint Energy this time around.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing had also transfused 500 drops of Saint Energy into her, he called out Xue\u2019er\u2019s name this time. Even Duo Si the dragon looked at him in a peculiar manner as it wondered to wondering to itself, \u201cYes, this human is nice but why does he have so many women around him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to her two sisters, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was much more shy and self-conscious. But, when Zhou Weiqing called for her name urgently again, along with the encouragement from both Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er, she finally stepped forward and stood before him.</p><br/><p>The moment the two pairs of eyes connected, Xue\u2019er lowered her head by nature when she saw his gentle gaze. With a sharp breath, she closed her eyes and just like Fei\u2019er earlier, she awkwardly put her arms around his neck and offered her trembling lips to his.</p><br/><p>The rich, flavorful Saint Energy began to flow again. At this moment, Shangguan Xue\u2019er appeared to be exceptionally beautiful as a reddish blush spread across her delicate face. Though she had kissed Zhou Weiqing before but at that time, it was when they were both alone. Now, she had to kiss him in front of Tian\u2019er and her two sisters, only God knew how much courage that she had to summon to do just that.</p><br/><p>Her cold lips instantaneously warmed up from the Saint Energy. Without warning, Xue\u2019er\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as a certain shameless guy had taken this turn of event to his own advantage and inserted a tongue into her mouth during the Saint Energy\u2019s transfusion. He even started to suck on her savory, delicate tongue without reserve.</p><br/><p>Ah bastard! Bastard! BASTARD! Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er are still watching us! Xue\u2019er wanted to break it off but she was afraid she would disrupt the absorption and transformation process of the Destruction Energy that Zhou Weiqing was going through. At this time, her brain had already plunged into total darkness, completely losing the ability to think. However, a touch of happiness gradually filled her heart quietly.</p><br/><p>After knowing him for such a long time, here and now, the realization that she was finally his woman dawned on her for the very first time, ever. Since she could not avoid this feeling, she might as well enjoy it, right?</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, the mouth-to-mouth Saint\u2019s Energy transfusion method was clearly a delightful thing that Zhou Weiqing would never get tired of. After giving 500 drops to each of the three sisters, the whole process started again.</p><br/><p>After receiving such a big amount of Saint Energy, the three Shangguan\u2019s sister now felt like brand-new people. The warm Saint Energy in their bodies did not contradict their Heavenly Energy at all. Also, having this energy made them feel like their bodies were constantly changing in a subtle manner that they could not even begin to explain.</p><br/><p>Finally, when Zhou Weiqing finished his fourth transfusion, the Destruction Energy in Hui Yao the dragon was now completely depleted. The instance he and Tian\u2019er transformed the last drop of Destruction Energy into Saint Energy, the gigantic body of the dragon suddenly quivered ever so faintly without warning.</p><br/><p>This, of course, was not a sign of his resurrection. Still, there were at least some signs of vitality in his body that was the result of the natural metamorphoses of the dragon clan\u2019s powerful life.</p><br/><p>The main reason why Tian\u2019er believed that they could revive Hui Yao was because the dragon clan possessed a body that was the most powerful among all of the Heavenly beasts. Even after they were supposedly dead, their dragon soul would never dissipate but would gather in the form of a nucleus instead. The vitality and bloodline power in the body would not deteriorate even after a long period of time.</p><br/><p>The silverish, white ray once again appeared on the five people standing there. After ending the devouring process, it could be said that the five of them have received an enormous gift from the entire process. Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s body was completely filled up by Saint Energy and the three Shangguan sisters had at least 2,000 drops each.</p><br/><p>Aside from being surprised and excited, Zhou Weiqing was secretly gasping with admiration. What a tremendous amount of Destruction Energy that was! It had never crossed his mind that it would be able to be transformed into a total of 12,000 drops of Saint Energy. No wonder Duo Si said that this Destruction Energy was at a higher level than their Heavenly God Energy.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for such a petrifying energy, how could Duo Si and her husband who was both on the Heavenly God-tier be hurt by those sneak attack?</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally our job is done,\u201d Zhou Weiqing let out a long sigh of relief. Duo Si gradually opened up her wings and unlike the energetic Zhou Weiqing and the girls, she looked exceptionally tired. The colors of her orbs had obviously dimmed down in that gigantic dragon\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing were absorbing the Saint Energy, Duo Si was giving it all her might to control the Destruction Energy. Had it not been the speeding up of Zou Weiqing\u2019s Demonic Devour at the final moment, she was not even sure she would be able to survive the whole ordeal. However, in order to resurrect his husband as soon as possible, she was willing to use up all her energy. For that reason, even if it was tiring for her, she still kept going on while she grit her teeth.</p><br/><p>Noticing Duo Si\u2019s exhaustion, Zhou Weiqing suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s take a break. At least for now, our chances appear to be more hopeful now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duo Si nodded her head, the sadness that was in her eyes originally was now slightly lifted away. From the very beginning, her gaze had never left her husband. Slowly crawled to go near him, she silently watched the wounds on his body that were slowly healing.</p><br/><p>That was right! Even when a dragon had already lost its life, after Zhou Weiqing and the girls had devoured the Destruction Energy in his body, his wounds had actually started to heal and it was at an unbelievably alarming speed as well. This was the horrifying recovery capability of the dragon clan. If the ground was not fully dyed with the red color of its blood, Zhou Weiqing would even suspect that the dragon would come alive any moment now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen can we begin to resurrect him?\u201d Duo Si asked him and Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too tired at the moment. We need your help too for the resurrection process. Resurrecting a dragon would require an exceptionally massive amount of Heavenly Energy. When Tian\u2019er\u2019s and my Heavenly Energy is no longer sufficient to proceed, we\u2019ll need to consume your Heavenly Energy through Demonic Devour to support her Resurrection Skill. For this reason, you need to get back to your best form as soon as possible. We\u2019ll start whenever you\u2019re ready,\u201d Zhou Weiqing replied.</p><br/><p>Translator Notes:</p><br/><p>[1] ,, I swear! I didn\u2019t make this up myself!

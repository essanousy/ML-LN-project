After all, he was one of the people at Heavenly Emperor Tier. He applied pressure to his wounds, blocked the flow of blood. Just when he looked toward Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side of the battle again and was about to put his hopes on his three partners, he saw hundreds of sparkling Tricolor Lightning Pearls enveloping the three naked men.</p><br/><p>A dark golden shadow appeared before Meng Gui once again. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze had turned extremely cold. At the same time, a deafening sound came from the other side.</p><br/><p>Without a scream, the three Heavenly King-tier powerhouses had vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>Upon witnessing the scene, bone-deep chills arose from within Meng Gui\u2019s body. If he had been previously infuriated by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arrogance, all that was left in him now was fear.</p><br/><p>The powers displayed by Zhou Weiqing was seriously too formidable, which had far surpassed his imagination. \u201cIs this really a level reachable a young man in his twenties?\u201d he thought. Right then, Meng Gui only felt that he would rather face the familiar Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya than the evil young man before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d Zhou Weiqing spread the wings on his back. The huge grey silhouette blended into his body almost instantly. Then, a gush of evil exploded along the transformation of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire being and turned to grey.</p><br/><p>Now, Zhou Weiqing looked just like a massive grey whirlpool, sucking away all the Atmospheric Energy from the air so quickly, turning Meng Gui into a hollow being, and sealed every space which presented the possibilities of escape.</p><br/><p>Without the support of Atmospheric Energy, even if he was a Heavenly Emperor, it would be impossible for Meng Gui to escape from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pursuit with mere speed. The only thing he could do right now was to battle Zhou Weiqing to death.</p><br/><p>Staring at Zhou Weiqing, Meng Gui\u2019s face had paled entirely. Ever since he had become a Heavenly Emperor, it was his first time being forced into such a drastic situation. Never had he expected for his life to end in the hands of such a young opponent.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing may just be a Heavenly King, but the aura he was radiating had completely suppressed Meng Gui\u2019s attribute, resulting in his inability to activate his cultivation. Furthermore, when one had reached the ranks of a Heavenly Emperor, one\u2019s physical body and soul would have long fused into a single entity, making the body a formidable weapon. After Zhou Weiqing had cut off one of Meng Gui\u2019s arm, it was equivalent to destroying his vitality. Meng Gui could not even release seventy percent of his cultivation during his peak. Given the circumstance, it was no longer possible for him to win against Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>However, Meng Gui had also demonstrated a mindset of which the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings were incapable of. Before Zhou Weiqing released the strong pressure, he had actually calmed down gradually.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, don\u2019t you go overboard. Indeed, you\u2019ve won today, but if you intend to leave me here, you too must pay a huge price.\u201d Meng Gui said darkly. The stark contrast between his calm demeanor and the insanity arising in his eyes was apparent.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Zhou Weiqing seemed amused, \u201cWell then, I want to know what exactly the price is that I\u2019ll be paying for, to leave you here.\u201d At that point, he did not look like he was in a rush to make his move against Meng Gui.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui said coldly, \u201cI\u2019m a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse. Upon reaching the Heavenly Emperor Tier, there will be changes to the characteristics of the Heavenly Nucleus Core. You can ask Big Fatty Long about this. If I were to self-explode my Heavenly Emperor-tier Heavenly Nucleus Core, you and Big Fatty Long might be able to escape alive, but nothing will be left of the city below. Your family and the royalties of the Heavenly Bow Empire, will also vanish into thin air.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression changed. He retreated backward slightly and looked at his master, who was floating mid-air.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya nodded at Zhou Weiqing. Right then, the astonishment in Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor\u2019s eyes had yet to disappear completely. He had witnessed the entire process of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s battle with the Blood Red Hell powerhouses, and he could not be any more shocked. \u201cThose were all Heavenly King-tier powerhouses who possessed Destruction Attribute!\u201d he thought. Long Shiya thought to himself that even if he were to deal with the combined forces of the three, it would take some time. Furthermore, Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui would be on the sidelines. However, Zhou Weiqing brought three deaths and one casualty with his own powers. While Meng Gui\u2019s injuries could somehow be associated with his own mistakes and carelessness, it was only possible with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s powers.</p><br/><p>With the same nine-piece legendary armor set upgrading his powers, Long Shiya asked himself and thought that his abilities now could no longer match those of Zhou Weiqing. Although the powers of his origin were superior to those of Zhou Weiqing by a cultivation base of one Jewel, he was far inferior to Zhou Weiqing in terms of strength. Zhou Weiqing had boosts from Dragon-Tiger Transformation of the Dragon-Tiger Bloodline \u2013 this was something that Long Shiya could never match. Furthermore, he possessed Saint Energy as well.</p><br/><p>Now that his beloved disciple had become so powerful, Long Shiya could not guarantee if he would be able to emerge victorious against Zhou Weiqing one-on-one. \u2018It hasn\u2019t even been a year since we last met! Little Fatty had already grown to such a level. If more time had been given, won\u2019t Xue Ao\u2019tian have to give away his position as The Strongest in the World?\u2019 he thought.</p><br/><p>However, it did not seem to be the right time think of such things, as Long Shiya had also heard Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui\u2019s words. Meng Gui was right \u2013 when one had reached the level of Heavenly Emperor Tier, there would be changes to the Heavenly Nucleus Core\u2019s characteristics. Once it exploded, he did not dare to face it head on either, especially for the fate of the city below which was greatly valued by Heavenly Bow Empire.</p><br/><p>After receiving the Master\u2019s response, the evil aura radiating from his had slightly subsided, and Meng Gui heaved a breath of relief. He could choose to self-detonate. If that was the case, the destruction of the city below would bring about a heavy blow to Heavenly Bow Empire, and similarly, the goal of preventing Heavenly Bow Empire from advancing toward the south could be achieved. However, Meng Gui was also human, a powerhouse who would be willing to risk his life just to accomplish a mission! Having achieved the level of Heavenly Emperor after cultivating for eighty years, the more experienced they were, the greater they valued their lives. The impact of a Heavenly Emperor-tier Heavenly Nucleus Core\u2019s explosion may be powerful, but if the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse were to choose to self-explode, unlike the Heavenly King-tier powerhouses, he would have no chance of survival but instead, he would be annihilated along with his own Heavenly Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>Thus, if it was not the final moments, if there was still a choice, he would never choose to do so.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s demeanor did not look too good. He sighed softly, \u201cIt seems that I have no choice but to let you go today. However, if you\u2019ve been freed, my true powers will then be exposed to Blood Red Hell. It wouldn\u2019t seem ideal for our Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon seeing his change in demeanor and having heard his words, Meng Gui was elated and said immediately, \u201cRest assured, I can swear by my Heavenly Nucleus Core that I\u2019ll absolutely not speak a word about the powers you\u2019ve demonstrated today. I\u2019ll even be willing to dissociate myself from Blood Red Hell, live a secluded life in an uncivilized place, and never interfere with the matters of this mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing pursed his lips and furrowed his eyebrows together. After thinking for a while, he nodded seriously and said, \u201cAlright, go ahead and swear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Gui finally let out his breath in relief. He knew that his threats had succeeded, and thought to himself, \u2018This kid\u2019s cultivation may be strong, but he\u2019s still na\u00efve in the end!\u2019 He quickly said, \u201cI, Meng Gui, swear by my Heavenly Nucleus Core that I\u2019ll leave this place, cut myself off from Blood Red Hell, return to being an independent cultivator, and never mention a word of what had happened today. Should I act otherwise\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Meng Gui was about to complete his sentence, all of a sudden, he saw Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest shining without any source of light. Although there was no energy wave, his gleaming chest was just too strange.</p><br/><p>It was a ball of light as big as a fist. Surrounding it were circles of mysterious light ribbons orbiting it like tentacles. Simultaneously, the evil had vanished from Zhou Weiqing \u2013 who had been previously showered with evil aura \u2013 but now there was another mystical aura on Zhou Weiqing which Meng Gui had never seen before.</p><br/><p>His skin was as white as jade, his entire body seemed to have turned transparent, and just like a bright star, he was radiating with brighter and brighter colors.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled softly and pointed at the sky, \u201cLook above you.\u201d While speaking, he first lifted his head.</p><br/><p>Although he had seen the changes of light on Zhou Weiqing, the pressure which had been suppressing and locking him down had all vanished, resulting in Meng Gui subconsciously following Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze and looked toward the sky. It was not a big deal, but at that instant, he was stunned as if his soul had left his body.</p><br/><p>In the pitch-black sky, he did not know when it started, but there were tens of thousands of stars shining. He thought, \u2018Aren\u2019t these stars gathering into a massive dazzling nebula?\u2019 The shape of the nebula was exactly the same as the light from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d just as he had uttered his first word, Meng Gui called upon all his might almost without hesitation, wishing to conceal himself in the darkness.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was too late.</p><br/><p>With a gesture of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand, illumination appeared as if the galaxy had descended. Meng Gui had no way of avoiding it, as his whole body stiffened, rendering him unable to move.</p><br/><p>In his extreme fear, he had an instinct to self-detonate the Heavenly Nucleus Core. He saw the ball of light on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest brightening up, and a beam of starlight fell on his own chest, connecting both of their bodies through the beam of light.</p><br/><p>His Heavenly Nucleus Core\u2019s movements stopped; even the rhythm of Meng Gui\u2019s heartbeat matched that of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was still gazing at the sudden beautiful night sky, and said flatly, \u201cEvery single Heavenly Nucleus Core is a star, and what I have is the star\u2019s nucleus. In front of the star\u2019s nucleus, how will your star, which has yet to reach its full development, self-explode? I\u2019ll return it to the sky of stars. Farewell, Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surreal nebula in the sky lit up abruptly, the dazzling lights seemed to instantly fuse with Zhou Weiqing into a single body. The next moment, before the Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui had the chance to scream, he had already reduced to ashes in the sky.</p><br/><p>The blinding starlight made the nearby Long Shiya shut his eyes, not daring dare to look at it directly. The pressure by the starlight was not strong, but all Atmospheric Energy had disappeared upon the appearance of the mysterious stars.</p><br/><p>Meng Gui\u2019s body had vanished, but his golden shining Heavenly Nucleus Core was still floating mid-air. With a wave of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand, it fell into his palm.</p><br/><p>Mystical lights shone in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes. He stared at the night sky, remaining perfectly silent for long, and seemed to have entered a special state of enlightenment.</p><br/><p>Raising his right arm, he waved in the air, and the Heavenly Nucleus Cores of the six Heavenly Kings he had killed flew from different directions each. While Dark Demon God Lightning had murdered the three Heavenly Kings in its explosion, their Heavenly Nucleus Cores had been preserved. The six Heavenly Nucleus Cores suddenly transformed into six beams of light rays, shooting out into the sky. From the appearances of the stars, it seemed just like six stars were rising from six different directions.</p><br/><p>Along with the rise of the six beams of starlight, six beams of faint golden starlight had also descended from the sky and fell onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, enveloping his dark golden Ringless Ground Purging Set with dazzling golden starlight.</p><br/><p>Showered in the starlight, the nearby Long Shiya could sense that the energies in Zhou Weiqing were rising. One could also tell from the observation that the colors of the ball of light on his chest had become purer.</p><br/><p>Next, another beam of golden light was released form Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand \u2013 it was Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui\u2019s Nucleus Core. It was obvious that the rising speed of this golden light was far quicker than that of the six previous beams. With a blink of the golden light, the nebula responded by illuminating a beam of starlight on Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>The golden pillar of light this time had a diameter of half a meter and showered in the starlight. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body shivered suddenly. The aura exploding from his body had also changed.</p><br/><p>Upgraded. Had he been upgraded just like this?</p><br/><p>Long Shiya had been staring in a jaw-drop silence, and thought, \u201cSince when did Heavenly Jewel Masters upgrade like this? Let\u2019s not mind the speed, but isn\u2019t the process just too fascinating?\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not know that this was the secret of the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core. Of course, it also had something to do with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Demonic Devour ability.</p><br/><p>What Saint Energy possessed was creativity; it was not just the mere creativity of humans, but the greatest sense of creativity from the heavens and earth. This world had been created from the most primal part of this ability, and all the stars in the sky had been created in this manner.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was right \u2013 every single Heavenly Nucleus Core can become a star of the sky, it just required an endless process of transformation and upgrades. Of course, the Heavenly Nucleus Cores of these Heavenly King-tier and Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses were not true stars, but they had the aura of the same attribute of those stars nonetheless.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even the Heavenly Nucleus Core of a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse would not be on the same standing as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>Of course, with his current cultivation, he would not be capable of releasing the true powers of the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core. His own cultivation was insufficient, and the levels of the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core\u2019s upgrading was limited.</p><br/><p>However, this did not affect him from being able to borrow the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core\u2019s powers. What he had done earlier was igniting the powers of the stars in the night sky using his Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core, and interacting with the faraway stars, effectively reflecting Star Energy back to his body. On the other hand, when he had released the energies from the Heavenly Nucleus Cores of the six Heavenly Kings and one Heavenly Emperor, it was the same as returning these pure energies of stars back to the stars in the sky, effectively receiving Star Energy fed back by these stars.</p><br/><p>These Star Energies might not be as strong as the seven Heavenly Nucleus Cores, but the purest Star Energy could be utilized by stacking onto the existing Star Energy of his Starcrux. On top of the fact that Zhou Weiqing had just devoured much Heavenly Energy, under the combined escalation, his cultivation had been instantly upgraded from the Middle Level to Upper Level of the Heavenly King Tier. If Demonic Devour was said to be the most amazing method of upgrading one\u2019s cultivation in the human world, then, the method of Star\u2019s Reflection would also be considered insanely ideal in the world of Gods!</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing had been condensing the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core, he already had the enlightenment \u2013 albeit not as profound. However, after the previous process, he had slowly begun to master the essence of Star\u2019s Reflection.</p><br/><p>It could be said that Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui\u2019s fate had occurred within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s predictions. With Demon God\u2019s Possession, Zhou Weiqing had sealed all of Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui\u2019s senses of the external world. At that time, Long Shiya could feel that the Atmospheric Energy in the air had a unique fluctuation.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had been talking with Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui. In fact, he had been delaying time as a long accumulation process was required for him to use Star Energy. It would be very challenging to use it in battle. Back then, when he had been condensing the tenth pair of Heavenly Jewels, his tenth Elemental Jewel had been fully occupied by his Star Energy. Similar to the seventh Elemental Jewel, its skills could not be stored. Star energy was the source that brought about this mystery in the world.</p><br/><p>Reality had proven that Zhou Weiqing had succeeded, after the Star Energy had been activated by him, never mind the already injured Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui. Under such situation, even the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses would not be able to withstand the Star Energy\u2019s strike, and even the Heavenly God-tier powerhouses would have to keep their distance.</p><br/><p>The biggest weakness of this Star Energy was that its accumulation time was too long. Of course, this was also associated with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current cultivation base. At the very least, it would not be too practical for the time being.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master, please retreat a few steps,\u201d Zhou Weiqing said to Long Shiya courteously.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya still felt surreal. Nevertheless, he subconsciously moved away further, clearing out the space above the palace.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing put away his Ringless Ground Purging Set and brought his hands together in front of his chest. His whole being turned clear and bright once again, and a gentle Star Energy descended from the sky and gradually landed on the Fate Denying Seal.</p><br/><p>A mysterious scene occurred. Under the Star Energy, the Fate Denying Seal was actually melting away slowly. Indeed, it was melting, just like ice coming into contact with water. It may not be melting very fast, but it was continuously decreasing in size.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a bright silver light flashed across the diamond-shaped pendant on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest. The silver light shot out and landed on the land below, forming a massive magic circle.</p><br/><p>Countless silhouettes gradually emerged from the magic circle one after another, amounting to thousands of people.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing swung his arm downward, and a beam of Star Energy flashed across the group of silhouettes. A beautiful girl in a white dress rose into the sky and appeared by his side \u2013 she was none other than Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>At that point, nervousness appeared on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face, who was maneuvering Star Energy. He looked at Tian\u2019er and nodded at her sternly.</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Bing\u2019er had left home, he had joined the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s Imperial Army. Then he joined the Heavenly Bow Battalion and later joined the Royal Military Academy. Later, when he had led the Fei Li Battle Team to victory in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament on Heavenly Jewel Island, he had achieved the first brilliant accomplishment of his life. However, it was short-lived when he learned about the destruction of his hometown. For Zhou Weiqing, it was too heavy a blow.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, he was not depressed due to that. Instead, he put in immense effort to make his country prosperous. With his own abilities, he had made the Heavenly Bow Empire rise again, to be even stronger than before.</p><br/><p>Today, he had finally returned to his home country which he had left for long; back again to the sky above the royal palace of the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p><br/><p>When it was time to remove the seal, as long as the Heavenly Bow City was retrieved, it meant that the reclamation of Heavenly Bow Empire was a success.</p><br/><p>Every single one of the three thousand warriors below was all from Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s most brilliant Peerless Regiment. One thousand Peerless Heavy Cavalry and two thousand Peerless Archers. After they had been sent here, they immediately searched for their ideal position.</p><br/><p>No army of Kalise Empire had been stationed inside the Royal Palace of Heavenly Bow Empire as it had been guarded by several Blood Red Hell powerhouses. The aura of the Fate Denying Seal had its effect on the human body.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Kalise Empire\u2019s armies outside had heard the commotion. They had not launched their attack solely because of the existence of the few powerhouses. Zhou Weiqing assigned three thousand people to this location to ensure that the Royal Palace would be safe and sound after he had removed the seal himself. It was also to ensure that he could give his all in recusing the lives of his family.</p><br/><p>Under the illumination of Star Energy, the darkness brought by Fate Denying Seal was being eroded continuously, but during this process, unstable emotions kept flashing across Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The more he had removed the Fate Denying Seal, the clearer he could sense the aura within the seal. Those were terrifying energies of countless negative emotions such as despair, unwillingness, fury, killing intent, and blood. Even a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse with Darkness Attribute like Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui would not dare to remove the seal casually. Upon the destruction of the seal, the individual would be struck by the backlash of the people\u2019s negative emotions within the seal. Even if one\u2019s body could withstand it, there would be a negative imprint on one\u2019s soul \u2013 imposing a massive harm toward one\u2019s cultivation in the future. This was the true terror of the Fate Denying Seal.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing would not be affected by these negative emotions. Other than the combination of his Star Energy and Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core giving him immunity of the Fate Denying Seal\u2019s backlash, his own mood would never be affected by negative emotions! Activated by his father as his final strike, it encompassed all his efforts and his own life. Amidst the negative emotions, all he could feel was endless sorrow.</p><br/><p>The darkness surrounding the palace had begun to fade while the stars in the sky had shone even brighter. Tears flowed uncontrollably from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face. At this moment, he had seen a huge silhouette clearing hovering five meters above the ground right in front of the palace,</p><br/><p>Broad shoulders, a proud and straightened back, pitch-black armor, and that unwavering spirit. That was his father, who was once the strongest of the Heavenly Bow Empire. One who had been willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of his country \u2013 Admiral Zhou, Zhou Shui Niu.</p><br/><p>Within the coverage of the faint black light, there were still many people, Zhou Weiqing next saw his mother Ling Zihan, who was not far from his father. He then saw his godfather, Emperor of Heavenly Bow Empire, Di Feng Ling. The Emperor, Di Feng Ling was acting in an unbelievable manner. In Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes, he was kneeling in front of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s father. Others who had kneeled down in unison were the officials of Heavenly Bow Empire headed by Xiao Ru Se\u2019s father, Xiao Yunchen, and also the Marquis and Finance Minister of the Empire. They had even fallen to their feet to worship his father.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the Star Energy\u2019s melting of the seal had paused. In a flash, Zhou Weiqing had appeared in front of his father who had been frozen within the seal.</p><br/><p>Although he had been extremely calm during his earlier battle with the three Heavenly Kings and one Heavenly Emperor, he was now shivering uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>The darkness of the Fate Denying Seal would automatically melt away upon contact with his Saint Energy Galaxia. Looking closely at his father whose eyes was filled with an unwavering will, Zhou Weiqing outstretched his arms wide and hugged his father tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019\u2014er\u2013,\u201d a sobbing voice sounded in the air. The next instant, all of the heavens and earth were filled with dazzling golden light.</p><br/><p>The very instant Zhou Weiqing embraced his father, the Star Energy spun violently, and all the blackness brought upon by the Fate Denying Seal had vanished. The stars in the sky could then no longer be seen and were replaced by a massive golden virtual image of an angel.</p><br/><p>Six wings flapped, and concentrated golden light mixed with silvery white Saint Energy descended from the sky. The palace which had long been engulfed in darkness and overwhelmed with dark aura was now showered with a layer of divine golden light.</p><br/><p>The sacred energy waves circulated in the air, transforming into dots of golden starlight which shone onto each person, enveloping them with a layer of golden mist.</p><br/><p>The sacred energy blended into their bodies little by little, eliminating the concentrated dark aura brought by the Fate Denying Seal. The Saint Energy which was full of creativity continued to nurture their bodies, awakening the life within them.</p><br/><p>There was only one exception, and that person was Admiral Zhou. The latter was in the tight embrace of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou\u2019s Heavenly Jewel Attribute had always been Darkness, resulting in a certain level of repulsion against Divine Attribute. Furthermore, as the caster of the Fate Denying Seal, his death would be certain upon the safety of others under normal circumstances. With Tian\u2019er\u2019s cultivation, it was insufficient to rescue the life of her to-be father-in-law whom she had just met for the first time.</p><br/><p>As for Long Shiya, his cultivation was sufficient. However, his attribute would worsen the situation. To heal a person of Darkness Attribute using Light Attribute would only speed up the person\u2019s death. As for Water Attribute, it might be able to save the life of Admiral Zhou for now, but no one could guarantee how long his life could be sustained. At the very least, Admiral Zhou might also become crippled.</p><br/><p>Thus, Zhou Weiqing had to make his move. Under his command of Star Energy, chances would be best only if he did it himself.</p><br/><p>The instant he hugged his father, Zhou Weiqing had cleared all his other attributes, leaving only the purest Saint Energy Galaxia. It enveloped the fragile body of his father who might just collapse any time, simultaneously eliminating all negative energies of the Fate Denying Seal.</p><br/><p>Admiral Zhou, at this point, was akin to a building constructed by wood blocks, albeit a slanted one, about to collapse anytime now. On the other hand, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy Galaxia was like a cover, gathering these wooden blocks together to stop its shape from changing, effectively preventing its collapse.</p><br/><p>Apart from that, these Saint Energy Galaxia were continuously entering Admiral Zhou\u2019s body, reshaping it with the purest and gentlest Creation Energy.</p><br/><p>Indeed, he was being reshaped, not healed.</p><br/><p>After casting the Fate Denying Seal, it could be said that Admiral Zhou\u2019s body had long collapsed. The reason he was still able to sustain his current state was solely due to the effects of the previous seal. Once the seal had vanished, he would also turn into ashes. The reason why Zhou Weiqing had the chance of reshaping him was because the soul of Admiral Zhou was still present.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er who was releasing divine energy could clearly sense that huge amounts of Atmospheric Energy were flowing toward Zhou Weiqing, including the energies she was releasing. Unfortunately, his Saint Energy Galaxia was decreasing at a shocking speed.</p><br/><p>This was not as simple as solidifying the energies of Purgatory Angel upon the activation of the skill. It could be said that Zhou Weiqing was really creating a physical body for a soul now!</p><br/><p>Although the original body of Admiral Zhou was being used as the foundation, the entire creation process had depended on his Saint Energy Galaxia for the body to take shape. Only by doing so, there would not be any future negative implications. For the sake of his father, why would Zhou Weiqing mind his efforts?</p><br/><p>The three thousand warriors of Peerless Regiment had fallen into their respective positions, defending against the external forces while fixing the palace as the center. The palace of the Heavenly Bow Empire was not huge, thus three thousand of them were perfectly sufficient. However, they were fixating their gazes in the air. To them, the sacred light radiating from Tian\u2019er\u2019s body was simply too astonishing.</p><br/><p>Other than that, due to Tian\u2019er\u2019s high position, whatever the faraway armies of the Heavenly Bow Empire could see, was also seen by the armies of the Kalise Empire and the Bai Da Empire.</p><br/><p>Holy Faith which was capable of being on the same standing as Demonic Devour had begun to take effect. While staying mid-air, Tian\u2019er continuously transformed these powers of religion into the purest divine energy and showered them below. Not only were the fellow people of the Heavenly Bow Empire healed, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s energy consumption was being supported at the same time.</p><br/><p>Right then, the Shangguan Triplets were all amongst the warriors. It had been such a large commotion here, but the army union of the Kalise and Bai Da Empire had yet to show any signs of attack. Thus, they had not received any pressure as of now.</p><br/><p>It was Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui who had ordered normal soldiers were not allowed to interfere regardless of the situation. In fact, the only ones capable of causing any commotion were the Heavenly King-tier powerhouses, for the ordinary armies would only bring them death. Therefore, his command was not wrong either. It was only that the warriors brought by Zhou Weiqing were relaxed.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er nodded at Shangguan Fei\u2019er, and said, \u201cLaunch the signal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shanguan Fei\u2019er agreed and raised her right hand. A beam of light shot to the sky and exploded into dazzling fireworks upon reaching the highest pinnacle. This firework signified that the palace\u2019s rescue was a success. As for the details regarding the methods of attack outside and the assembly of troops, those were the matters of the Heavenly Bow Military God, Admiral Ming Yu.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er stared at the faraway Zhou Weiqing up in the sky who was giving his all to bring his father back to life; her eye somehow looked a little lost.</p><br/><p>Back then, his cultivation had been far weaker than hers were! However, he had now reached a level where she would need to look up to him. Heavenly King Tier who was many years younger than she was, had become a Heavenly King first, and even possessed the Saint Nucleus Core!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er had informed Shangguan Xue\u2019er of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s bet with the brothers, Shangguan Tian Yang and Tian Yue. When Shangguan Xue\u2019er discovered that Zhou Weiqing had faced immense pressure for her sake and had finally emerged victorious, shedding the heaviest burden on his shoulders, she was lost and dazed for a few hours.</p><br/><p>These few days, she had been avoiding Zhou Weiqing and did not dare to meet him. The emotions in her heart were indescribable. She was not clear on how she should face Zhou Weiqing and felt rather guilty. For the sake of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, she had considered giving up this relationship! Amongst the Shangguan Triplets, the time she had spent with Zhou Weiqing was the shortest, but it did not mean that her feelings for Zhou Weiqing would be any less than how she felt for the two younger sisters.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, she had been engaging in intense training in Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace since she was young. For someone like her, whose heart had been as pure as a blank sheet of paper, there were only traces left by a single person, and he was Zhou Weiqing. Furthermore, there was no one else on the white piece of paper.</p><br/><p>With all his efforts, Zhou Weiqing had finally gotten a chance to be with her, but what had she done previously? She had been constantly avoiding him, giving in to her father and uncle. Due to such a responsibility, she had thought of giving up on him, albeit not just once. However, he too had not once given up on her.</p><br/><p>Even her two younger sisters were unaware of her complicated and contradictory feelings. It would only be possible for her to overcome her guilt after she had organized her thoughts.</p><br/><p>However, there was one thing which Shangguan Xue\u2019er was no longer concerned about. It was the fact that she was no longer the heir of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. She intended to have all her thoughts focused on her man \u2013 she would be wherever he was.</p><br/><p>Outside Heavenly Bow City, Ming Yu stared at the divine light which was radiating continuously from the faraway Heavenly Bow City and had been waiting in silence.</p><br/><p>Finally, a smile crept up his face when the huge fireworks rose into the sky.</p><br/><p>All the military leaders and soldiers had let out deafening cheers at the same time, including him. They did not mind alerting the Kalise armies who were on guard.</p><br/><p>An hour ago, Ming Yu had released an order and had spread the news of the rescue. Furthermore, he had also informed the officers of the Heavenly Bow Empire regarding the type of fireworks appearing upon the successful rescue and had asked for them to deliver the news.</p><br/><p>This was a little trick of Ming Yu, which aimed to raise the morale of the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s soldiers to the highest point by using the opportunities presented by the successful rescue of the Heavenly Bow Empire royalties.</p><br/><p>The loud cheer had made it clear to him that his trick had succeeded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAction,\u201d with a swing of his arm, Ming Yu relayed his command to attack.</p><br/><p>The armies of Heavenly Bow Empire had begun to move. They did not directly launch their offense, but instead, they operated in a scattered formation, and passed through the forests, slowly closing in on the Heavenly Bow City.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

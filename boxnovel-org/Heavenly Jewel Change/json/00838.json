However, this Nether Lord was extremely cunning. It turned out that he actually drilled a hole in the ground of his realm and hid there so that our ancestors could not find him for a very long time. By the time he was found again, he had become much stronger than he was, as strong as Fen Tian whom you faced previously. At that time, we did not have the Saint Attribute so the previous Elven Empress burned herself into ashes to weaken him. Even then, they were unable to kill him. The Dragon Emperor, on the other hand, combined forces with the rest of the Dragon Tribe powerhouses to lay down a seal and sealed him with extreme difficulty so that he could no longer absorb anymore enmity from the outside world.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to it, Zhou Weiqing let out a sigh of relief. However, a sad and mournful expression suddenly appeared on the Elven Empress\u2019 face, \u201cIt\u2019s precisely due to that battle that our Elf and Dragon Tribes were all badly wounded because our most powerful forces had all been sacrificed in that battle. In turn, it kind of sped up the process of you human beings taking control of this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chimed in, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then the Nether Lord that was sealed should be very weak, shouldn\u2019t he? Since he could no longer absorb enmity from the outer world, there was no way for him to become even stronger. So what\u2019s actually going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress let out a bitter smile, \u201cWell, it was indeed like this in the beginning. He could no longer enhance his strength by himself, and we also thought that we could keep him sealed forever. However, as time goes by, things began to change. We\u2019ve no idea how the Nether Lord did it but somehow, he managed to drill a tiny hole in the seal and absorbed enmity carefully from the outside world. By the time the Dragon Emperor noticed it, he had already become much stronger than before. Left with no other choices, the Dragon Emperor could only repeatedly strengthen the seal. However, if the Nether Lord could break the seal the first time, there would undoubtedly be a second time. If I guessed correctly, when he broke open the seal for the second time, he was even more careful than the first time and even managed to contact the Blood Red Hell to increase the grievances in the outer world. Not only that, it was the Blood Red Hell who helped direct the grievance into the Nether Realm. He finally made his first move when he became strong enough, and this time, it was already too late when we noticed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Destruction Energy that was formed by negative emotions had been strengthened to become as powerful as the Heavenly Change Tier through the constant purification from the Nether Lord. It\u2019s a level that even your Saint Energy will never be able to break through. Now, I just hope that with the help of your Saint Energy, we can completely seal the Nether Realm. With this way, you\u2019ll only need to infuse some intensified Saint Energy into it once in a while so that we can stop him from getting stronger. Although this is only a temporary solution, it\u2019s the only way that we have right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head in silence. Even the Dragon and Elf Tribe that were so powerful had their hands tied when faced with the Nether Lord. One could easily imagine just how powerful he was. However, this did not mean that there was no other way to deal with him. At the very least, the temporary solution would allow this world to continue existing in peace.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao and Duo Si continued to push forward into the deep abyss. Every now and then, Hui Yao would spew out balls of fire to illuminate the pathway ahead. This abyss seemed to have no end at all. They had already flown for more than 15 minutes with their current flying speed and was at least fifty kilometers in. Still, there was no sign of them reaching their destination yet.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a gentle pop suddenly sounded from an eruption below, and an intense Destruction Energy surged out from the cave below.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s perception was the most alert. Within seconds, he immediately acted. His body remained still as platinum Nebula Saint Energy blasted out from a piece of lit star that was embedded in the chest piece of his Ringless Ground Purging Set. Although the Destruction Energy was powerful, it was not that pure. With just a flash of platinum light, the entire Destruction Energy was consumed by the Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to speed up!\u201d The Elven Empress announced anxiously.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head. Several dozens of Nebula Saint Energy forces spewed out from his Ringless Ground Purging Set and formed a gigantic platinum light shield that enveloped the two gigantic dragons.</p><br/><p>Both Hui Yao and Duo Si strained every nerve to increase their speed and charged straight towards the deep abyss without the need of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>The two gigantic dragons had cultivation bases at the Heavenly God Tier. Now that they were charging forward with all their might, their speed was impossibly fast and as swift as the wind. The Destruction Energy in the air that accompanied them became even more intense as they made their way in deeper. All of them had a solemn look on their faces. They were all praying that the seal would hold, at least until they arrived at their destination.</p><br/><p>WHAM \u2014</p><br/><p>A surge of Destruction Energy that was several times stronger than before crashed forcefully on the Saint Energy Shield that was being held up by Zhou Weiqing as it forced the two gigantic dragons to slow down suddenly. However, thanks to the Saint Energy, and the fact that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was purer than ever after he had reached the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier, the powerful Saint Energy suppressed the Destruction Energy in the air by force. Due to this, the two dragons merely halted for a moment before they continued to pick up their speed again as they moved deeper into the deep abyss.</p><br/><p>At this point, a voice erupted in the air, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d What followed next was a wave of intense tyrannical energy ripple that burst out from the bottom of the abyss. A gigantic figure suddenly appeared and blocked their way.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had traveled far and wide, and he had seen a great deal. However, even he could not help but be taken aback when he saw this huge figure.</p><br/><p>Although the abyss continued to stretch downwards and the diameter gradually narrowed, it was still at least 500 meters wide in diameter. Nevertheless, this giant that had appeared out of nowhere from below literally obstructed the entire 500-meter wide pathway. With just this alone, it was easy to imagine just how humongous its body was. Hui Yao and his wife immediately felt dwarfed in comparison in front of this figure. Waves of Destruction Energy continued to emanate out of its body unceasingly. It turned out that the Destruction Energy that had attacked Zhou Weiqing and the rest earlier was only the residual energy ripples.</p><br/><p>This humongous being turned out to be a turtle-shaped Heavenly Beast. However, there was one thing that made it stand out when compared to other ordinary turtles, and that was its head. It possessed a head that was almost identical to Hui Yao, or worse, even bigger than Hui Yao. A dragon head on a turtle\u2019s body. At this moment, glowing fire that looked like flowers were lighting up the patterns on its back. A pair of dragon orbs were staring fiercely at Zhou Weiqing and the rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Dragon Turtle!\u201d The Elven Empress exclaimed in surprise. With a flash, she leaped off Duo Si\u2019s body. As a gentle green light shone downwards, the green light that was filled with the Life Saint Energy landed gently on the Dragon Turtle.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Turtle was dumbfounded, \u201cT-The Elf Tribe? Life Saint Energy? A-Are you the Elven Empress?\u201d The hostility in his eyes immediately faded when he saw the six wings behind the Elven Empress.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress quickly replied, \u201cI\u2019m the current Elven Empress. Dear respected Dragon Turtle Elder, what\u2019s the current situation with the seal? We just killed the Nether Lord\u2019s advocate in the human world and are here to help out because we noticed that the seal seems to be in an unstable state. This is a human powerhouse, Zhou Weiqing, and this is his wife, Tian\u2019er. They have managed to cultivate the Saint Energy with the help of the four Saint Attributes. I believe that it\u2019ll be a great help in reinforcing the seal. These two dragons here are the descendants of His Majesty Dragon Emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, the Dragon Turtle already had a clear view of Zhou Weiqing and the others. Zhou Weiqing had also withdrawn his own Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that the Elven Empress\u2019 Life Saint Energy had won the trust of the Dragon Turtle. Due to the fact that they were from the ancient tribes, the moment it saw the six wings behind the Elven Empress and sensed the Life Saint Energy that was extremely serene and relaxing, it immediately understood the goodwill of these newcomers.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao\u2019s voice reverberated in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ears, \u201cActually, the Dragon Turtle is also part of our Dragon Tribe. It\u2019s sort of like a mutated dragon, but it\u2019s extremely powerful. This Dragon Turtle elder\u2019s cultivation base is most likely at the Upper Level of the Heavenly God Tier. Not only that, the Dragon Turtle is known as the Heavenly Beast that has the best defense in the entire world. Even in ancient times, their population was extremely scarce. I did not expect the ancestors to place a Dragon Turtle Elder here to attend to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was saying that, Hui Yao led Duo Si forward to pay their homage to the Dragon Turtle who had lived for only-God-knows-how-long.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Turtle stretched his head forward in Hui Yao\u2019s direction. A stream of intense red light beamed out from his eyes and landed on Hui Yao. Instead of dodging, Hui Yao merely stood still and allowed the red light to shine on him.</p><br/><p>After a short moment, the Dragon Turtle and Hui Yao both simultaneously emitted the same golden brilliance from their eyes.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Turtle nodded his head towards Hui Yao, \u201cYou must be the descendant that His Majesty had left behind in the Luster Spatial Realm. In this case, please follow me, hurry! I\u2019m afraid the seal won\u2019t hold much longer. Let us talk about this while we move. All of you, get on my back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao and Duo Si landed gently. Although their gigantic bodies also landed on the Dragon Turtle\u2019s back, it did not appear crowded at all.</p><br/><p>A loud rumble resonated in the air. Zhou Weiqing finally noticed that all four limbs of the Dragon Turtle were inserted in the surrounding caverns previously. All four of his limbs were shaped in the form of dragon claws as well, and they were humongous. At this moment, the four limbs were retracted, and everyone instantly plunged straight downwards into the deep abyss.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour timing\u2019s just perfect! There have been multiple combat engagements at the seal, and His Majesty\u2019s heavily wounded now. We can no longer hold on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What? Our ancestor is heavily injured?\u201d Hui Yao was completely taken aback.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Turtle replied in a deep voice, \u201cWe\u2019ve no idea why, but the Nether Lord\u2019s strength has been continuously increasing in the last decade or so. We couldn\u2019t even find out where he managed to get his power. Recently, he had launched several attacks on the seal, and because of this, there were already many cracks on the seal. On top of that, not too long ago, he managed to break a small piece of the seal by force. His Majesty only managed to patch and reinforce the seal at the cost of a serious injury. However, all the cracks are becoming bigger and bigger, and it\u2019ll break anytime now. I\u2019m sure all of you must have felt the force from the Destruction Energy. That\u2019s exactly the doing of the Nether Lord. Apart from that, I\u2019m afraid the seal will break any time now judging by the Destruction Energy that\u2019s getting stronger and stronger as we speak. If it\u2019s not for the fact that I noticed your presence and went out to see earlier, I would\u2019ve gone there to help the others to strengthen the seal.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to the Dragon Turtle\u2019s words, all of them could not help but take in a cold breath in shock. The situation seemed to be even worse than they had thought. They could still accept the fact that cracks had appeared on the seal, but to the point that the Dragon Emperor \u2014 the one who played the most important role in the sealing process \u2014 actually got injured? What did that mean?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Do you have any more tricks up your sleeves? Just bring them out if you have them! Let us have a look at who\u2019s stronger, you or us?!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Zhou Weiqing was talking, the Peerless Sect\u2019s powerhouses behind him put on their own Consolidated Equipment Sets.</p><br/><p>The ones attracting the most attention were the three Shangguan sisters and Tian\u2019er. All four of them actually had a cultivation base at the Heavenly Emperor Tier. Even though they were only at the Lower Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier, how old were they?</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er was wearing the exact same God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set like her father. However, the golden luster that was radiating from her body was much more radiant and brilliant. It was a gold color that shone brightly like the stars \u2014 a rich, intense Saint Energy fluctuation that shared the same root as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s.</p><br/><p>The person who was the most shocking was none other than Shangguan Xue\u2019er. With a cultivation base at the Heavenly Emperor Tier, the Boundless Infinitum Set could be seen on her body. Although she might not be as good as Shangguan Tianyang if everything was taken into account, do not forget that Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s cultivation method was totally different from Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s. Her offensive prowess with her sharp and swift swordsmanship was superior to Shangguan Tianyang.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er was also wearing a ten-piece Consolidated Equipment Set. It was slender and dazzling with a foot long blade at every joint. Among the three sisters, her legendary armor set that was attached to her Dual Physical Jewels appeared to be the thickest and heaviest.</p><br/><p>Similarly, Shangguan Bing\u2019er was wearing a ten-piece Consolidated Equipment Set as well. A greenish golden luster shone brilliantly, especially the pair of gigantic Wings of the Wind God that was so dazzling, it ravished the eyes.</p><br/><p>The strength of the Peerless Sect was now entirely on display. Even if the Elf Tribe was not taken into consideration, the Peerless Sect had at least one Heavenly God and six Heavenly Emperors as of now. Such strength was already more than enough for them to possess the glory of a Saint Land. Not mentioning the fact that their Saint Energy had not been taken into consideration yet.</p><br/><p>Did Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun still have any other tricks up their sleeves? Maybe they do, but it would not be a trump card that they could easily show to the public.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Fen Tian yelled as he raised his hands high. At once, the Destructive Divine Territory that was in mid-air clashed with the Natural Divine Territory like a whirlwind, scattering wisps of clouds.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress remained unfazed. A turquoise-colored staff materialized in her right hand out of thin air. As she pointed the staff forward, the Natural Divine Territory suddenly spread over the sky and covered up the Earth as it transformed into an endless supply of Natural Energy and charged forward as well.</p><br/><p>The two huge Divine Territories collided violently in mid-air. To Fen Tian\u2019s surprise, his impenetrable Divine Territory could not work its Destruction Devour ability in the face of the Elven Empress\u2019 Natural Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>That was by no means merely Natural Attribute energy. There was no doubt that it had the Saint Energy in it as well. This was\u2026the Life Saint Energy? A branch of the Genesis Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the Life Saint Energy could not be compared to Huang Xingyun\u2019s Destruction Energy in terms of purity. However, in terms of overall strength, the Elven Empress plus the twelve Elven Elders were much more superior than it. For this reason, when the two Divine Territories collided, none of them could gain the upper hand.</p><br/><p>As the two Divine Territories collided head-on, the powerhouses from both sides began to make their moves as well.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian let out a faint sigh. He knew that the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s foundation over thousands of years might not be able to survive today.</p><br/><p>A huge number of powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley descended from Hui Yao and Duo Si\u2019s bodies. They coordinated together with the powerhouses on the ground as they charged towards the Peerless Sect, Heavenly Snow Mountain and Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace in a frenzy.</p><br/><p>With the addition of these latecomers, their numbers had already far exceeded the Peerless Sect, Heavenly Snow Mountain, and the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Due to the fact they all had the same Destruction Attribute, the entire world was suddenly overwhelmed with Destruction Energy with just one attack.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya continued to take on Shen Mo. Before this, there was no victory in their previous match. This time, none of them would hold themselves back. The two of them did not want their own attacks to harm their own people. As if their minds were in sync, both of them rose up to the sky at the same time as they looked for their battlefield in the air.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyu, on the other hand, led the Love Valley\u2019s powerhouses and charged towards the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. In contrast, the two gigantic dragons in the sky soared downwards and rushed at the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Expanse Infinitum, Star-Lunar Rotation!\u201d Shangguan Tianyang roared loudly with his eyes wide open. 108 Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s powerhouses began to move at the same time. White smoke suddenly spread out and vast energy ripples clashed fiercely with Huang Xingyun and his wife.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Spirit Earthly Fiend Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation was a lot stronger than the ordinary version of the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation that was used to fight against Xue Ao\u2019tian last time. In just one blow, they effectively blocked Huang Xingyun and his wife with brute force.</p><br/><p>The total number of powerhouses from both Love Valley and Blood Red Hell totaled up to nearly 400 people now. On the contrary, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, Peerless Sect, and Heavenly Snow Mountain only totaled up to just about slightly over 200 people. Not to mention that this also included the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s Heavenly Beast Guardians.</p><br/><p>A turquoise light swept across in the air. The Natural Divine Territory mightily enveloped Hui Yao and Duo Si from above the sky.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao was already at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier. After he had possessed the Destruction Energy, he naturally became even more tyrannical than before. Duo Si, on the other hand, had also made a breakthrough to the Upper Level of the Heavenly God Tier, with one foot already stepping on the threshold of the Maximum Level. In terms of strength, the two of them were not inferior to both Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun added up together.</p><br/><p>Roar!</p><br/><p>In a frenzied uproar, the two gigantic dragons instantly ran amok and smashed left and right in the Life Divine Territory. Within a second, the unnerving energy ripple turned the Snow Deity\u2019s Castle on the summit of Heavenly Snow Mountain into powder.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us go up to the sky,\u201d the Elven Empress ordered in a deep voice. She lured the two gigantic dragons to leave the battlefield temporarily with the help of the Natural Divine Territory as she led the twelve Elven Elders and rose up to the sky at the same time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s judgment of the situation was extremely excellent. When Hui Yao and Duo Si first made their appearance, he could see that if the two dragons were present on the battlefield, even in a best-case scenario, the Heavenly Beast Guardians would still have their strength immensely weakened. It was unlikely that the beasts would be able to utilize their full strength in the face of the Dragon Emperor Bloodline.</p><br/><p>For this reason, he decided to let the Elven Empress and the Elf Tribe deal with the two dragons. First, they would not be at a disadvantage in terms of bloodlines because they would not be affected by the dragon\u2019s tremendous pressure. All the same, Zhou Weiqing did not want to harm both Hui Yao and Duo Si. Only the Elves had the strength to be able to suppress them completely yet making sure that they remained unharmed.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing also put himself in the Elf Tribe\u2019s shoes. The Elf Tribe was made up of a kind and peaceful people. They did not like killing nor did they possess actual combat experience. Therefore, even though they had a total of five Heavenly God-tier powerhouses, their actual combat ability was not that good. The Elven Empress was the only person powerful enough to join in the battle. They would most likely suffer a great loss if they had joined the battlefield up front. If that was the case, how would Zhou Weiqing be able to lift his head up in front of the Elven Empress?</p><br/><p>Of course, now that the Elf Tribe had to go deal with the two dragons, the pressure on the battlefield had become way stronger too. The number of the powerhouses from Blood Red Hell and Love Valley had far exceeded Zhou Weiqing\u2019s initial judgment.</p><br/><p>The Elf Tribe and the two gigantic dragons soared up to the sky. Fen Tian did not bother following them. He understood very well that the battle here on the summit of Heavenly Snow Mountain was the most important, particularly that Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Fen Tian finally understood. Among the three Great Saint Lands rival, the soul of the team was not Shangguan Tianyang or Xue Ao\u2019tian. Instead, it was Zhou Weiqing, the young Sect Leader of the Peerless Sect. He was the real leader of the other side. It was apparent that everything was under his control. Not only that, just the fact that Zhou Weiqing could make so many Elf Tribe\u2019s powerhouses obey his command undoubtedly proved his position as a leader. He would never have guessed that in truth, both Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain only found out about Zhou Weiqing\u2019s trump card just a moment ago as well.</p><br/><p>Two acutely violent and chilly beams blasted out from Fen Tian\u2019s eyes towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing provocatively threw a dirty look at him fearlessly. Although his cultivation base was still at the Maximum Level of Heavenly Emperor Tier and he has yet to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Tier, there was not an ounce of fear in him at all when facing a Maximum Level Heavenly God like Fen Tian.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took his stance with the hammers in both his hands. He then tipped his right hammer towards Fen Tian and lustrous stars instantly burst out of his body. A spiraling nebula halo appeared and hovered above his head.</p><br/><p>This time, the nebula spanned an area with a diameter of about five meters, and it only enveloped Zhou Weiqing alone. However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest began to lit up as well when he was bathed in the mass of nebula rays. The Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core and the Astral Divine Territory echoed and responded to each other from afar. The golden Nebula Saint Energy from before gradually changed its color to a whitish-gold.</p><br/><p>Without warning, a pure and intense Saint Energy ripple erupted out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. That Saint Energy was so strong that it caused several of the Blood Red Hell\u2019s powerhouses who were charging towards him to stop abruptly in their tracks. With fear on their faces, none of them dared to take a step closer.</p><br/><p>On the other side, horror dawned on Fen Tian\u2019s face as well. Despite the fact that there were at least several hundred meters in between the two of them, he could still clearly feel the horrifying and threatening aura that Zhou Weiqing had on him. The whitish-gold Saint Energy aura that was mixed with a little golden color emitting out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body brought a sense of coercion to the Destruction Energy in his body. There was no doubt \u2014 if his destruction was compared to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s creation, it was still far inferior in terms of their attributes.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian clasped his hands together above his head. Under the shadow of his full legendary armor set, a massive scarlet sword materialized in his hands. Without any fancy moves, he slashed down towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Dark purplish ray transformed into a gigantic light blade.With the innumerable gigantic Devouring Mouths in the sky as a backdrop, it sliced downwards at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing merely scoffed. The Dual God Strength Hammers in his hands that were completely dyed in a whitish-gold color by the Nebula Saint Energy was hoisted upwards towards the sky.</p><br/><p>With a loud bang that smashed opened a huge space in the surroundings, the dark purplish light blade shattered. Even Zhou Weiqing needed to take two steps back to stabilize himself.</p><br/><p>The corner of his mouth lifted in slight disdain. Zhou Weiqing understood that Fen Tian was trying to use brute force to exert pressure on him. However, how could he possibly be afraid of him with the help of the pure Nebula Saint Energy?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zhou Weiqing was completely struck dumb by astonishment. After all, his breakthrough of the 28th Death Acupuncture Point that enabled him to enter the seventh jewel level just took place a short, short while ago. I\u2019ve already broken through the 29th Death Acupuncture Point? Other than finding it to be beyond logic and above reason, there were absolutely no other words that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s could use to describe this phenomenon.</p><br/><p>It looked like he did not even have to store his energy if he used the Saint Energy to cultivate his Immortal Deity Technique. Even though he had not attempted it yet, he knew that he would need more Saint Energy to break through the next Death Acupuncture Point. Calming the excitement that he felt in wanting to try for the next breakthrough, he gradually ended his cultivation.</p><br/><p>At the moment, it was apparent that he could not cultivate continuously to the next breakthrough. Although the Saint Energy in his body was more than enough, he still needed to revive Hui Yao the dragon with Tian\u2019er later. Only God knew how much energy he would need to do that. Even if it was the majestic Saint Energy, the horrifying possibility of it being depleted in the process still exists. In order to ensure there wouldn\u2019t be any failure in the resurrection plan, he needed to conserve the Saint Energy in his body as much as possible so that he could help support Tian\u2019er during the resurrection. As for his own breakthrough, well, what was there to be worried of now that he had made such an astounding discovery? Since he still wanted to go to the Heavenly Snow Mountain, it would be better for him to solve this immediate problem first.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing noticed another marvelous discovery. After he used up 300 drops of Saint Energy, it was immediately replenished with Heavenly Energy. Although this Heavenly Energy was not the real Saint Energy, the essence of Saint Energy that was mixed in it was pretty rich. It was obvious that the Heavenly Energy that he had was different from the original Heavenly Energy. Because of the presence of the Saint Energy, he could vaguely feel that if he was to engage in a combat, as long as he did not directly unleash his Saint Energy to cast his techniques, the Heavenly Energy in his body would be almost inexhaustible.</p><br/><p>Although his cultivation base was only at the Seventh Jewel, the vast amount of Saint Energy that he possessed had made him much, much stronger than his level. As for his actual combat effectiveness? Well, he himself was unable to answer the question as well.</p><br/><p>The dragon was still resting as it would need more time to recover. Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes and called out to Tian\u2019er softly.</p><br/><p>Opening her eyes, she saw the hand that he stretched out towards her. Immediately, she understood his thoughts. The two of them held onto each other\u2019s hands and once again, the huge Saint Energy Whirlpool started to swirl again.</p><br/><p>At once, strong intense Saint Energy\u2019s ripples spread out from their bodies. Whether it was the dragon or the three Shangguan\u2019s sisters, their bodies trembled subtly as they bathed in the rays of the Saint Energy. Apparently, it was quite a boost to all of them.</p><br/><p>When they were not devouring outside matter, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er used their four great saint attributes to cultivate their Saint Energy. Last time, even if they cultivated one whole day, they could only obtain 10 drops of Saint Energy and that was if there was enough Atmospheric Energy in the air for them to use.</p><br/><p>However, this time, after they had activated the huge Saint Energy Whirlpool, joy filled their hearts at once. It was because they had both noticed that even though the overall volume of the huge Saint Energy Whirlpool was not altered at all, it had been solidified many more times than it was previously. The Atmospheric Energy in the Lustre Spatial Realm was madly rushing in into their huge Saint Energy Whirlpool in an extremely exaggerated manner.</p><br/><p>Although the energy influx was extremely huge, the pressure was still able to be borne by the huge Saint Energy Whirlpool. At the centre of the whirlpool, droplets of Saint Energy was slowly flowing in. Although the speed was not too fast, it was in some ways much stronger than before. At the very least, it only took 5 breaths for the second drop to regenerate after the first one was done. With such a cultivation speed, they could easily generate 100 drops of Saint Energy in a day, or perhaps more. If they could maintain this cultivation speed in the future, it would be more than enough even if they did not devour any Heavenly beast.</p><br/><p>In order not to disturb the other\u2019s cultivation, Zhou Weiqing whispered at Tian\u2019er and told her about the situation of the Immortal Deity Technique cultivation.</p><br/><p>The moment she heard his story, Tian\u2019er was completely startled. She glanced up at Zhou Weiqing and after a moment of pondering, she whispered back, \u201cWeiqing, I think you need to continue to cultivate. Duo Si has used up a lot of her power earlier so I think she needs at least 10 days before she could fully recover. Now that we\u2019re able to generate the Saint Energy in such a fast speed, I\u2019m sure it would be more than enough to support your consumption in these 10 days. You can\u2019t simply pass up such a good opportunity! God knows how much Saint Energy we would be left with after we revive that gigantic dragon. You might as well seize this opportunity to push your cultivation base up a notch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied, \u201cDo you sense anything different at all? Like did your cultivation speed improved or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er shook her head, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s apparent that my cultivation speed has improved and I could also feel that I would be able to breakthrough very soon but still, mine is not in the same class as your Immortal Deity Technique. If your technique is able to break through the rest of the Death Acupuncture Points, I\u2019m pretty sure that you\u2019d be able to enter the ninth jewel level in no time. At that time, you can also solidify your Saint Energy into the Saint Core Nucleus first. Now, both of our Saint Energy added up together is around 6000 drops and even if that\u2019s not enough, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be far from achieving that. We could each solidify part of our Saint Energy and help you make your breakthrough. We\u2019re going to face more dangers in the future and in order to reach the Heavenly King level from the upper ninth jewel, your Heavenly Energy would need to go from the 36th level to the 40th level. But at that time, your Immortal Deity Technique would already have reached its maximum ninth jewel so you\u2019d need more time to explore your other options.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under Tian\u2019er\u2019s encouragement, Zhou Weiqing finally agreed to the suggestion after thinking about it deeply. However, he would not use all of his Saint Energy up at ago. After discussing with Tian\u2019er, he decided to cultivate and regenerate his Saint Energy at the same time in order to ensure that both of their Saint Energy would never be lower than 2000 droplets.</p><br/><p>Without wasting any time, the second attack on his Death Acupuncture Point quickly took place again. Similar to the previous one, when Zhou Weiqing mobilized his Saint Energy to revolve according to the Immortal Deity Technique\u2019s pathway, there was no obstacle at all, not even in his head region. Soon after, he successfully made another breakthrough at the 30th Death Acupuncture Point. This time, he had consumed 350 drops of Saint Energy. Had he not known beforehand that the droplets of Saint Energy were merged back into his body after he had used it up in his breakthrough, he would probably feel very reluctant to see the Saint Energy being used up so fast.</p><br/><p>In just one go, the 31st Death Acupuncture Point was pried open in no time at all. At first, Zhou Weiqing wanted to stop and wait for his Saint Energy to regenerate before he started again, but he was stopped by Tian\u2019er. Immediately, she passed 1,000 drops of Saint Energy to him and support him to continue his breakthrough on the 32nd Death Acupuncture Point, increasing his cultivation base up to the eighth jewel.</p><br/><p>The instance the 32nd Death Acupuncture Point was broken through, all Zhou Weiqing felt was that all of the pores in his body were entirely blasted open, all of the 32 Death Acupuncture\u2019s Chi current was speeding up its revolving speed. The huge Saint Energy Whirlpool that was created by him and Tian\u2019er had also started to speed up, shortening the time they needed to absorb the Atmospheric Energy. They only needed 3 to 4 breaths now to generate 1 drop of Saint Energy. With such a speed, they could gather at least 100 Saint Energy in just 2 hours.</p><br/><p>Unlike human beings, a Heavenly Jewel Master had a longer gaseous pulse, therefore their breath was much longer than a normal human being.</p><br/><p>After he had made it into the eighth jewel level, Zhou Weiqing had already consumed up to a total of 1500 drops of Saint Energy, leaving him slightly distressed over the wastage. Fortunately, the number was equally shared by both of them so he could still accept it.</p><br/><p>He did not continue to try and make another breakthrough. Instead, he stopped and activated the huge Saint Energy Whirlpool together with Tian\u2019er to regenerate the Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>They did not realize that it had been a full three months since they last entered the Lustre Spatial Realm. Before this, they had spent nearly two months just to devour the Destruction Energy alone but because of some mysterious, abstruse circumstances, both of them did realize it at all.</p><br/><p>Day after day, time slowly passed away. In just a blink of an eye, another 10 days had gone by.</p><br/><p>A deep dragonish grunt suddenly sounded, waking up the three Shangguan sisters who were in the midst of cultivation. When they opened their eyes, they could see that Duo Si the dragon was slowly rising up from the ground, sparkles were restored in her orbs.</p><br/><p>It was also at this time that a whistle rang out from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mouth. The silverish white light that was emitted by him and Tian\u2019er\u2019s bodies turned brighter all of a sudden, shooting up to the sky like a silverish white light beam.</p><br/><p>Letting go of Tian\u2019er\u2019s hand, under the surprised gaze of everybody else, his body suddenly floated up without warning. The silverish white light on his body gradually turned to into a brilliant gold color.</p><br/><p>Unlike the gold color of Tian\u2019er\u2019s Divine Attribute, the gold that was emitted out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was filled with a sense of tyrannical and domineering power. Not only could the domineering power be sensed in his imposing manner, it had a special kind of existence like it was a whole other attribute of its own. The strong golden light did not have the slightest sense of energy but it felt like it was a matter that could occupy space instead.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, the golden light emitted from his body suddenly vanished without warning. What followed next was the lighting up of the 36 Death Acupuncture Points on his body, it made him look like he was decorated with stars. The golden light that vanished earlier suddenly reappeared again. All of a sudden, like a gigantic whirlwind that swept away clouds, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body began to devour the Atmospheric Energy in the air like a sea that could hold water from thousands of rivers.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What\u2019s happening?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er quickly asked Tian\u2019er in an anxious tone.</p><br/><p>A smile crept up on Tian\u2019er\u2019s face, \u201cHis Immortal Deity Technique is going to be completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was right. Ten days of efforts, ten days of cultivation and Saint Energy regeneration. During the final spurt on the last Death Acupuncture Point, the Hundred Convergences Point, he actually used up more than 1,000 Saint Energy. After that, he and Tian\u2019er worked hard to restore the Saint Energy in their bodies to the maximum as he held back the feelings of having all of his points interconnected during the last spurt. It was only until Duo Si had awakened that he let go of the suppression.</p><br/><p>At this very moment, all the 36th Death Acupuncture Points that he had opened in his body started connecting to one another, just like a star map. That powerful and domineering golden light was a sign that Zhou Weiqing had managed to cultivate his Immortal Deity Technique to the maximum state. Unlike before, the Immortal Deity technique was no longer just a defensive and resistive mechanism for him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

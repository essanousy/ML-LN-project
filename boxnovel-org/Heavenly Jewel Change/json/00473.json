Normally, area of effect attack Skills were no match in terms of offense compared to single target Skills of the same level. However, it was clear that this Skill was not just good in its area effect, even its sheer power was unbelievable. Just a single Hell\u2019s Angel had not only broken the Wolf Cavalry troop\u2019s sabre formation, it also wiped out a large number of them. Seeing the dark purple light slowly dissipate, another bright illusory figure started to appear above Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head, replacing the previous one. This time, it was a purple red colour, as the figure of the Demonic Dragon Lady appeared out of nowhere, with an even more powerful presence.</p><br/><p>No order was required. The wolf cavalry troops scattered like crazy in all directions. Who knew what crazy Skills would come next.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Lin TianAo quickly caught back up to Zhou Weiqing, who watched the enemy retreating with the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic Dragon Lady above his head. After they regrouped, they headed towards the Gold Crow and Berserker Tribes.</p><br/><p>Alas for the Wolfman Cavalry troops, how could they have known that the second Heavenly Skill Image was just a trick, its purpose just to scare them\u2026 and it had succeeded amazingly. The Dragon Silencing Seal was indeed a powerful Skill, but it was totally useless against ordinary soldiers like them, let alone so many of them. Only powerful Heavenly Jewel Masters would be afraid of such a Skill. Of course, with the prior Hell\u2019s Angel, this bluff was not easily called, and the effect was effective indeed. Soon enough, they reached the defensive lines of the two tribes.</p><br/><p>When the Peerless Battalion had came earlier, the Gold Crow and Berserker Tribes had instantly noticed it. Especially when the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment had moved out to attack the Peerless Battalion, the pressure on them had lessened considerably. Naturally, they had also clearly seen the dark purple light of the Hell\u2019s Angel and its effect on the Wolfman Cavalry Regiment. Now that the enemy was retreating, the two powerful tribes also heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>They had been surrounded and attacked for more than two hours, and though they had definitely given much trouble to the Wolfman Cavalry and Unicorn Cavalry Regiments, the two tribes had not remained unwounded. After all, they were severely lacking in armour and weapons, and no matter how tough they were, they could not possibly last forever against the continuous charges of the powerful cavalry units, and several of them were already critically injured. If not for the timely appearance of the Peerless Battalion, perhaps their injuries would have increased to the point that their lines would collapse. By that time, they might even be in danger of being wiped out eventually, no matter the toll that would take on the two Regiments.</p><br/><p>As they got closer, Zhou Weiqing immediately saw how the tribesmen of the two Tribes were all injured. The two tribes were rather easy to differentiate, with the Gold Crow Tribe consisting of more females, with fewer males. As for the Berserker Tribe, they had a good mix of both sexes, with the males mostly all with their upper bodies naked, grasping all different sorts of weapons. Various wounds and injuries could be clearly seen on their bodies, and right in front of their defensive line there were large numbers of the WanShou Empire soldier corpses.</p><br/><p>Too strong\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing knew that he was as stout and muscular as they were, yet when he compared himself to the two Tribes, he found that he was nothing compared to them. From just a single look, he could not even find one less than two metres tall. All of them were so muscular that they did not even seem human, with some of the larger ones almost built like mountains, reaching at least 2.5 metres tall, their shoulders broad and thick as city walls.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss!\u201d Ma Qun\u2019s excited voice rang out and the next moment he charged out with his large Consolidated Assembly Set Shield, pouncing onto Zhou Weiqing and giving him a bear hug. He was currently covered in blood, and it was as if he had seen his closest kin when he spotted Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Ever since they reached this place and were surrounded, both Crow and Ma Qun\u2019s eyes had reddened. They were under so much pressure in convincing their tribes to migrate and move, and when this had happened, they could clearly feel their entire tribe\u2019s eyes on them, no matter whether it was true or not. After all, they were responsible for bringing their tribesmen here, yet upon reaching they had been greeted with such powerful enemies. Let alone speaking of the danger of having their entire tribes wiped out, even if a single of their tribe members were killed, they would be the greatest sinners of their tribe.</p><br/><p>Being hugged by Ma Qun, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that this brother of his was trembling. Such a stout and muscular fellow, yet he was currently giving off such a weak feeling, obviously totally drained of strength from the long fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood bro, don\u2019t worry, our reinforcements will be coming soon. I will definitely bring your tribes safely to our new camp.\u201d It was no time for lengthy explanations, and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strong and resolute voice brought Ma Qun a fresh bout of confidence.</p><br/><p>At this moment, due to the Wolf Cavalry Soldiers being frightened by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s terrifying Skills, Barthez gave the order to retreat temporarily and regroup slightly ahead, reforming into a different formation. At the same time, this gave the Gold Crow and Berserker Tribes a rare and highly treasured chance to rest.</p><br/><p>Two massive figures disengaged from the crowd and walked towards them, both covered in blood. Along with them came Crow, carrying her massive Gold Crow Legendary Axes.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Ma Qun stopped hugging and went ahead to receive them.</p><br/><p>The two figures together with Crow were a male and a female. The man was so huge and tall that even with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s size, he had to totally raise his head to be able to see his features\u2026He is at least a metre taller than I am! That was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first thought upon looking at him. As he looked closer, he could see that the huge man resembled Ma Qun, and in his large grip, there was an enormous Great Hammer in each hand, much larger than even Zhou Weiqing\u2019s considerable Dual Legendary Hammers. His broad muscular chest were filled with many small wounds, and his entire body was covered with blood. Still, it was evident that most of the blood were from his enemies.</p><br/><p>As for the lady, her figure was even taller than Crow, with a head of short hair, carry a pair of massive war axes. As the two of them strode towards them, it was definitely an intimidating and valiant looking group.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, let me introduce you. This is my father, our Berserker Tribe Tribe Leader.\u201d Ma Qun quickly said.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a few steps forward and extended his hand to the huge man.</p><br/><p>Ma Qun\u2019s father gripped the two Great Hammers in a single hand before extending the empty hand to grasp Zhou Weiqing\u2019s. \u201cMy name is Ma Long.\u201d His voice was loud, deep and rich, with an almost slight metallic tone to it. Just a few words, yet Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ears were almost ringing with that.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ma, good to meet you. I\u2019m sorry that we have come so late, we never expected that your arrival would coincide with the WanShou Empire\u2019s attacks.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said with an apologetic look on his face.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands were not small, but in the middle of Ma Long\u2019s massive hand, it was as if it was totally enveloped, like a baby\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt a firm grasp and a large strength applied. However, his face did not change, and he too applied more pressure, not going on the offensive but just maintaining his grip without allowing Ma Long\u2019s strength to overwhelm him.</p><br/><p>Ma Long continued slowly increasing the pressure, his gaze fixed upon Zhou Weiqing though he did not speak.</p><br/><p>After a moment, surprise slowly showed on Ma Long\u2019s face. He felt as if Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand was a tough bedrock; no matter how much force he applied, Zhou Weiqing would respond with an equal strength. At this point, he was already using seventy percent of his strength, but looking at Zhou Weiqing, he was smiling with an honest look, not flinching or showing any sign of weakness at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, no wonder that little brat Ma Qun was praising you so much. That strength, it is indeed impressive.\u201d Ma Long finally let go of his grip, looking at Zhou Weiqing approvingly as he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me try.\u201d The middle aged lady warrior who had came together with Crow passed the axes to Crow, taking a large stride forward to Zhou Weiqing. She was even more direct, not hiding the fact that she was about to test Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Crow quickly piped out: \u201cWeiqing, this is my mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle aged lady warrior was even more straightforward and forthright, saying: \u201cMy name is Hong Yu, you can call me Aunty Hong Yu. Crow said that your strength is even greater than hers, let me see for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she extended her hand out, one that was no smaller than Ma Long\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: \u201cPlease kindly guide me Aunty.\u201d As he said that, he extended his hand out without batting an eye.</p><br/><p>They were fully pitting physical strength, as such neither side released their Power Jewels.</p><br/><p>Hong Yu was unlike Ma Long; as soon as the two gripped palms, Zhou Weiqing instantly felt a surge of power come from her. His expression changed slightly, and he dared not be careless and quickly focused his full attention. Instantly, a surge of power came from deep within, and the skin of their two palms where they met immediately turned pale from the sheer strength between.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright\u2026 Hong Yu, do you really think that your strength is greater than mine?\u201d Ma Long said exasperatedly. With a swift tap of his left Great Hammer onto the two tightly gripped palms, Zhou Weiqing and Hong Yu released their grip at the same time.</p><br/><p>Hong Yu glanced at Ma Long and said: \u201cWhat? Are you unwilling to concede? Of course your strength is not comparable to mine. If you dare, don\u2019t enter your Berserk state, and we can just compete purely in physical strength, how about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Long said angrily: \u201cHmph, if you have the capability, bring down your weight and mass to an ordinary human level!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lips twisted awry as his heart spasmed slightly. It looked like these two were not too harmonious normally.</p><br/><p>At the side, Crow suddenly burst into giggles before saying: \u201cWeiqing, don\u2019t mind them. My mother and Uncle Ma are just too used to arguing all the time. In truth, they are very good friends.\u201d Ma Long glanced at Crow and said exasperatedly: \u201cIn those days past, if not for your father hijacking my love, you will not be my daughter in law, but my daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Yu responded exasperatedly: \u201cBullshit, as if I would fall for you? Stop dreaming. Be careful, or I will report your words to sis.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Zhou Weiqing\u2019s surprise, such a stout and muscular berserker warrior like Ma Qun, upon hearing Hong Yu\u2019s words, he actually turned back with a guilty look. His voice lowered much obviously, as she said: \u201cHmph, who knows what you were thinking, you are so large, yet you can fall for such a tiny man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Yu said angrily: \u201cShut your mouth! If you dare mention him again, don\u2019t think I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d Zhou Weiqing could only intervene at such a moment. After all, they were still not in a good state, and who knew if the WanShou Empire would send reinforcements as well. \u201cTwo Tribe Leaders, we still have not escaped danger yet, we should leave first before continuing such conversation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Long furrowed his brow and said: \u201cThose Wolf Cavalry soldiers\u2026 they still number at least seven to eight Battalions worth of men. How can we leave like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cYou all retreat while protecting your tribesmen. I will lead my men to cover your retreat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour men?\u201d Both Ma Long and Hong Yu were slightly puzzled, and they couldn\u2019t help but look to the distance.</p><br/><p>No matter the two Tribes or the Wolfmen Cavalry Regiment, they could still see the Unicorn Cavalry Regiment in the distance surrounding and attacking the small Peerless Battalion troop.</p>\n</div>"}

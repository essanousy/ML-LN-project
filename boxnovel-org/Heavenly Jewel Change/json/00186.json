(2)</b></p><br/><p>\u201cFor\u2026 my\u2026 sake\u2026 Tian\u2019er \u2026 was even willing\u2026 to give up\u2026 her life\u2026, I cannot\u2026 abandon\u2026 her\u2026 Help me \u2026 apologise\u2026 to Bing\u2019er\u2026 and Fei\u2019er\u2026 Please\u2026 Also\u2026 to you\u2026 I sincerely\u2026 apologise as\u2026 well\u2026 I truly\u2026 did not\u2026 know it was\u2026 you\u2026 I did\u2026 not mean\u2026 to violate you\u2026 like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words and seeing his feeble state, no matter how much hate Shangguan Xue\u2019er had for him violating her, she couldn\u2019t possibly flare out now!</p><br/><p>She truly did not mean to kill him!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 why didn\u2019t you dodge! I didn\u2019t mean to kill you!\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er choked out through her dry sobs, tears welling up in her eyes and threatening to fall.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing \u2018forcefully\u2019 squeezed out a smile, almost a grimace\u2026 such an amazing performance indeed, with just a faint hint of sorrow, with the right mix of apology, and a thick unwillingness to part with the world. In a soft voice, he said: \u201cIt was of my own will. I know, in your heart, I have never been a good person. I am not worthy of Bing\u2019er or Fei\u2019er. Just now, I even violated you... That sword, count it as a repayment to you. This way, I do not owe you anymore. Furthermore, now that I have won\u2026 you can\u2019t interfere with me and Bing\u2019er or Fei\u2019er anymore right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even keep your own life anymore, what\u2019s the point of speaking about all that?\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er couldn\u2019t help the tears starting to fall down quietly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head slightly and said: \u201cOf course there is meaning\u2026 Bing\u2019er and I are already man and wife intimately. Please do not tell her that you were the one who killed me\u2026 just say that I have let them down, and that I took my own life. As for Fei\u2019er, please help her find a person who loves her more\u2026 I have not actually been fully intimate with her. As for you, although you made an oath just now, that was just me provoking you so that I can defeat you. Originally, I thought I could still survive, haha, I did not realise how much blood I had lost\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak anymore\u2026 in such a circumstance, you can still laugh.\u201d Unknowingly, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was holding Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body tightly as tears streamed down her cheeks, her entire body trembling violently. In her entire life, this was the first time she had such a violent emotional fluctuation.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing continued laughing foolishly as he said stubbornly: \u201cLet me finish speaking. If I do not get this off my chest, I am afraid I may not have the chance to say it in the future. Xue\u2019er, I am sorry, can you accept my apology? You are a very good person and wonderful lady, Bro Zhan LingTian seems to like you a lot, you can consider him in the future. Alright, I am done\u2026 you can go now, please let me lie here to silently leave the world? I wish to leave my last time with my girls, let me think of them as I drift away\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, you can\u2019t die like this.\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s heart trembled, her emotions veering out of control. She circulated whatever Heavenly Energy she had with all her might, trying to infuse it into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Alas, she had already spent so much Heavenly Energy in the fight, and at the end Zhou Weiqing had been just too thorough when using his Devour Skill earlier. Furthermore, only a short time had passed since she had awakened, and her emotions had been in such turmoil and turbulence since, how much could she have recovered?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: \u201cDon\u2019t waste strength anymore, Xue\u2019er. Please don\u2019t forget the words I said and help me pass them on. As for Tian\u2019er, I\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing stopped at that point, pain flashing in his eyes as the glint of tears showed, the deep orbs filled with unwillingness and sorrow. In Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s eyes, the sight caused her heart to ache so much that she found it difficult to breathe.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I will not marry anyone else. I have already lost the bet, and I will keep that oath. I will be your wife as well. If you die, I will also accompany you in death. Leaving me alone here\u2026 how could I possibly face Bing\u2019er and Fei\u2019er? The words you said\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I cannot pass them on as well.\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er burst out crying as she fell upon Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Luckily, she was not able to release her Boundless Infinitum Sword now, otherwise who knows if she might even kill herself.</p><br/><p>If Zhou Weiqing really died at her hands, how could she possibly face her two sisters, and even that Tian\u2019er? She would never be able to get past that in her heart. To her, the easiest choice would be to follow Zhou Weiqing into death, with no other problems to face. At this point, Shangguan Xue\u2019er set her resolve. Holding tight onto Zhou Weiqing, feeling his body grow colder, she thought to herself - as soon as he passed, she would follow suit.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not see that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head suddenly turn slightly to the side, waggling his eyebrow as he threw a significant look in signalling.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, a sombre voice rang out of nowhere. \u201cWhat are you two little fellows doing? What is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>A flash of light, and a massive figure descended from the skies, landing beside them. It was the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er was given a fright by his sudden appearance, before she was filled with joy. She immediately cried out: \u201cSenior Long, quickly save Weiqing. He is almost dying. Please save him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s worried eyes, Long Shiya almost burst out laughing. Almost dying? That little brat was still brimming with life. Shangguan Xue\u2019er might not be able to see it, but how could he not?</p><br/><p>In truth, when Zhou Weiqing had won Shangguan Xue\u2019er, Long Shiya had already arrived. With such strong Heavenly Energy reverberations during their fight, others might not have sensed it, but how could the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor not sense it? Long Shiya had long since returned to the Peerless Battalion, just that he had not shown himself much, staying together with Duan Tianlang and helping him with his Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. With his status, he normally did not mix around with the others too much.</p><br/><p>Just as he arrived, he had witnessed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s wretched hands on Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s buttocks moving around. However, the blood all over Zhou Weiqing had also given him a fright, and he quickly did voice transference to ask Zhou Weiqing. Upon hearing that his Master had arrived, Zhou Weiqing had quickly come up with a new plan, hence the scene that had occurred since. Long Shiya\u2019s timely appearance now was naturally to \u2018save the day\u2019 and rescue him from death\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was all part of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s master plan!</p><br/><p>With a grave look on his face, Long Shiya unleashed a powerful Angel\u2019s Blessing Skill. A thick gold light enveloping Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body. Bathed in the gold light, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression relaxed instantly, taking a favourable turn. Beside him, even Shangguan Xue\u2019er felt her Heavenly Energy recovering quickly.</p><br/><p>Watching Zhou Weiqing with a nervous and anxious look on her face, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had never felt her heartbeat race so quickly before. The abrupt rise and fall in her emotions caused her to feel so tired, but her feelings for Zhou Weiqing had undergone a total upheaval, turned upside down altogether.</p><br/><p>In her eyes, a person so close to death was definitely speaking the truth, for there was no reason to lie. These words that Zhou Weiqing spoke to her had to be from his heart. Although this fellow was quite the playboy, and shameless to boot, but his feelings for those girls were all true and strong. The hate in Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s heart had evaporated, and as she thought how he had violated her, as well as the oath she had taken, a strange feeling rose in her heart.</p><br/><p>It did not take long before Long Shiya slowly dispelled his Skill, taking Zhou Weiqing from Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s hands. He breathed a loud sigh of relief, saying: \u201cLuckily this old man came in time. How did Little Fatty sustain such a heavy injury? What were you two doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya\u2019s voice was filled with anger, eyeing Shangguan Xue\u2019er as if he was feeling enraged at her.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes weakly and said \u2018anxiously\u2019: \u201cMaster, don\u2019t blame Xue\u2019er. It was my own fault for being careless when we fought, and I was injured by mistake. It is not her fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya gave an angry humph, glaring at Zhou Weiqing exasperatedly: \u201cYou little bastard, can\u2019t you rest a bit. Previously, you already brought back one from the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and now you are provoking a new one. Hmph!\u201d These words were at least extremely heartfelt.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er flushed deeply and she said softly: \u201cSenior, it is my fault, I was the one who hurt Weiqing. Will he be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya said solemnly: \u201cHis wounds have basically healed, but at a toll to his vitality. It will take a while for him to fully recover, but he is no longer in any danger. You guys, since you are duelling, why did you use the Boundless Infinitum Sword? Don\u2019t you know the power of your own Boundless Infinitum Sword? Alright, you head back first, I\u2019ll still need to finish healing him, at least to ensure he recovers some vitality.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, Shangguan Xue\u2019er heaved a sigh of relief. She asked sincerely: \u201cSenior, can I stay to help take care of Weiqing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya glanced at her and said: \u201cNo need, having me here is enough. You head back first, if you want to take care of him, wait until he returns to the camp to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Long Shiya\u2019s distant look, and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s apologetic look at her, Shangguan Xue\u2019er sighed before turning to leave. She did not rush off, looking back several times as she did so, as if imprinting Zhou Weiqing\u2019s looks in her mind.</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Xue\u2019er finally disappeared into the distance, only then did Long Shiya dump his \u2018precious\u2019 disciple on the ground huffily. He couldn\u2019t help but scold angrily: \u201cYou little brat, bringing disaster to yet another good girl!? This old man is going to be angered to death by you in the future! Next time, don\u2019t look for me to act like this! Such a good girl like her, how can you lie to her like that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly and stood up. \u201cHaiz, I had no other choice, otherwise I would have been unable to get past that stage! Xue\u2019er is the elder sister of Bing\u2019er and Fei\u2019er, and of the three of them, she is the one who truly represents the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she does not give her consent, not only will my relationship with Tian\u2019er be in deep trouble, even Bing\u2019er and Fei\u2019er will be extremely troublesome. Only if I gain her approval, can there be a resolution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking to that point, Zhou Weiqing suddenly turned shameless once more. \u201cFurthermore, Master, don\u2019t you think it is a great thing to marry triplets? Your disciple will be marrying the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord\u2019s daughter and the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace Master\u2019s daughters! Heh heh, two Great Saint Lands!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya couldn\u2019t help but laugh as well. \u201cYou little brat, with those acting skills of yours, let alone that little girl, even I was given a big scare. If I had not gotten the voice transference from you, I would have known that you were totally fine so easily. Well\u2026 what now? Keep up the act?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

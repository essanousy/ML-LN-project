Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have been so easy for all of you to stop us earlier. Fen Tian won\u2019t let you go, just wait for destruction to arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two bangs were heard right after he spoke, and nobody expected No.1 and No.2 to self-explode. The overbearing black destructive flames exploded out of nowhere and were swept toward Long Shiya. He let his guard down as he was shocked at what they revealed to him, otherwise, he would not let them self-explode happen at all.</p><br/><p>The six-colored light began to circle like a gigantic whirlpool around Long Shiya\u2019s body and blocked the black flame outside easily. Meanwhile, No.1 and No.2 disappeared completely without leaving a single trail. Long Shiya was visibly deep in thought as he stood there and paused in thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Heavenly King-tier skeleton? They even possess the Destruction Attribute. What a relentless person Lord Fen Tian can be!\u201d He thought. It was obvious that the skeletons were the Blood Red Hell\u2019s ancestors. The fact that Fen Tian managed to do this, let alone dig up his ancestor\u2019s remains from the grave was unforgivable.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya did not stay too long as he had no idea how many people Lord Fen Tian sent this time around. Protecting his beloved discipline was his top priority. Zhou Weiqing, who was currently in mid-air did not seem to be affected by anything at all, as he continued with his consolidation without so much as a thought of what was happening outside.</p><br/><p>As there were more and more green patterns appearing in the sky, its magnificent colors were gradually showing. Meanwhile, the Jade Dragon on the other side was slowly shrinking. However, judging by its size, the consolidation process had just begun. Zhou Weiqing floated there without an expressionless face. There was only focus and perseverance in his hands, with a rhythm to both of them. He began to accelerate at a slow speed, gradually speeding up the consolidation process.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Shangguan triplets were on the ground. The Destruction Energy had certainly affected them as the pure energy was more powerful than the one that they encountered in the past. However, they had consolidated the Saint Nucleus Core before. Although it was not a true Saint Nucleus Core, its Saint Energy could not be said to be weak. It had slowly recovered after some time of recuperation.</p><br/><p>The time required for the consolidation process would be unbearably long for the outside world. Soon, three days had passed. In mid-air, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s still maintained his focused expression and his body was just as stable as the time he started the consolidation process. However, people who knew could tell that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s five-meter-tall energy body began to fade and was becoming the way it was in the beginning. It was clear that this was caused by the draining of his bodily energy. On the other hand, the Jade Dragon was now a-third smaller than it used to be.</p><br/><p>Since the consolidation process was rather lengthy, the powerhouses of the Peerless Sect did not dare to be careless at all. Under Long Shiya\u2019s coordination, they were taking breaks in turns. At the same time, he arranged many soldiers to lock down many of the passages in Heavenly Bow City and to stop business operations. For the sake of Zhou Weiqing, Heavenly Bow City had given its all, its utmost effort to make that happen.</p><br/><p>Soon, four days had passed. It had been a full seven days, but Zhou Weiqing\u2019s consolidation had yet to end. When the Jade Dragon\u2019s size had shrunken by half, the speed of his consolidation had clearly slowed down. Although nobody knew what he was doing with the decrease in speed, the slower pace meant that his consolidation as a whole would now take a longer time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s energy body had faded even more; one could even see his actual body in the body of energy. However, the only thing that did not change was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression. He was deeply focused since the beginning until this very point in time. What was most impressive was how the scroll was being consolidated out of thin air. Throughout the seven days, one could roughly make out its shape.</p><br/><p>The jade green glow looked like it was forming a huge web in the sky with many odd patterns on it; each was complicated, yet magnificent. If it was a Consolidated Equipment Scroll, one could see what was it consolidating into from the image that appeared on it. However, nobody could identify what was on the one that Zhou Weiqing was consolidating. The patterns looked like it had a pattern but nobody could identify what kind of consolidated equipment it was. It was definitely not merely a web.</p><br/><p>Amongst all of them, Duan Tianlang was the only one who knew the secret as he was the one who designed the scroll. Although it was Zhou Weiqing who was making the scroll, he had no idea what kind of consolidation transformation the completed scroll would do to his Ringless Ground Purging Set. Duan Tianlang had been watching from below, not wanting to miss any details. Even though Long Shiya came to him and tried to get him to rest, he rejected without hesitation. Safe to say, his eyes never looked away from Zhou Weiqing throughout the entire process. He ignored Fatty Long completely.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya was helpless, all he could was to help Duan Tianlang adjust his body with his Heavenly Energy carefully. Fortunately, the modification Zhou Weiqing performed on Duan Tianlang earlier was thorough. Although it drained him a lot more this time, the impact on his body was not as bad as it was before. At the very least, it would not harm his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Duan, how much longer does Weiqing need to complete this?\u201d Long Shiya could not help but ask.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang looked into the sky and shook his head lightly. He said, \u201cI have no idea as well. The pattern of the design gets more complicated as he continues. As the entire process has to be coordinated from the beginning, this is the reason Weiqing\u2019s speed is slowing down. However, you don\u2019t have to worry. If Weiqing is unable to take it, then no God-tier Master in this world would have the perseverance to make this scroll. I definitely have confidence in him. A miracle would certainly happen under the Astral Divine Territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, another seven days had passed, followed by another seven. After 21 days, neither Zhou Weiqing\u2019s confidantes nor Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya could take it anymore. In the air, the Jade Dragon had already lost its dragon form. What was left was a cloud of a jade green light. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s appearance was the main reason why they were panicking. His original energy body had disappeared, even the Astral Divine Territory in the sky had become extremely dim. The stars were blue, showing imminent signs of a collapse. Under such circumstance, who could tell how much longer Zhou Weiqing could hold on?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing who had revealed his actual body still had a glow in his eyes, but his face was pale. His body would occasionally show a slight tremble when he was moving his hands. It was clear that he could not take it any longer. Looking at his current speed, he would take at least a couple of days to complete the consolidation process! That was the reason why everyone was panicking. However, Zhou Weiqing had sacrificed so much by now. Who would dare to take the lead to ask him to stop?</p><br/><p>Time passed by, and soon, three days had passed. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body began to shake in the air. His body did not stop shaking but his hands and the expression in his eyes were the only indications of stability. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was tremendously small, hovering above Heavenly Bow City while the massive jade green light lit up everything. The Astral Divine Territory had completely disappeared yesterday, and the jade-green virtual Consolidation Equipment Scroll looked like a brand new sky, giving off a mesmerizing jade-green color that shone above Heavenly Bow City.</p><br/><p>The consolidation had come to its final moment but Zhou Weiqing\u2019s consolidation speed had been slowed down to the speed of a snail inching its way forward. Tian\u2019er, Shangguan Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, Bing\u2019er and Little Witch was not protecting Zhou Weiqing in the sky at that moment. Long Shiya was the only one there. The five of them were kneeling before Duan Tianlang. Although they did not say anything, everyone knew what they were begging for. Duan Tianlang himself could barely move with all of them at his feet.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang clenched his teeth without saying anything. To him, the scroll was too important, especially during the final moment of the consolidation. Although Zhou Weiqing\u2019s progress was extremely slow, he was still going on after all. The wings on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back were stretched open; he was not consuming his Saint Energy alone as it was completely drained now. He was now consuming his own life force; holding on with the breath in his chest.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Duan Tianlang was not only thinking about himself but also Zhou Weiqing as well. If Zhou Weiqing failed this time, one could imagine the severity of the impact on him as he might not be able to break through the Heavenly God-tier forever. However, if Zhou Weiqing managed to do it, the door to the Heavenly God-tier would be wide open for him. Even if he did not achieve this immediately, it was just a matter of time and it would definitely not take long.</p><br/><p>As the five wives sensed the draining of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s life, they all thought of something before Duan Tianlang did. They knew very well that if there was anybody who could stop Zhou Weiqing from continuing, it would not be Zhou Weiqing\u2019s father, Admiral Zhou, and not Zhou Weiqing\u2019s master, Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya, but the master junior who was in front of them.</p><br/><p>The five wives continued kneeling for an entire day and night. By then, Zhou Weiqing who was in the air became even more unstable. The scroll that he was completing on his own was too difficult. Indeed, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was sufficient, far more than enough. However, one should not forget that he was not an actual God-tier Master! He only managed to do what a God-tier Master could do because he relied on Time Reversal. When he started making this Consolidated Equipment Scroll, it consumed a majority of his Saint Energy which exceeded what the outside world could replenish. The Jade Dragon was much tougher than he had imagined. Therefore, even Duan Tianlang did not foresee that making this scroll would be this difficult.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

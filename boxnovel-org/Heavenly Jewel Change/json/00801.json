However, this time he noticed that his Ringless Ground Purging Set had already become part of his Saint Energy, and it was completely attuned to his energy. He discovered that the starlights that were hidden in the midst of the dark golden color were like an armor on his body that had been fully condensed by his Nebula Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was also clear that once his cultivation base broke through to the Heavenly God Tier, the eleventh piece of the legendary armor set that had just been completed would go through its final fusion. It would allow him to fully own a brand-new legendary suit that could be considered as the best in all the lands.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, at this moment, Zhou Weiqing did not have the time to test the changes that the Ringless Ground Purging Set had gone through. It was all he could do to look at the Elven Queen as he nodded faintly at her. In the next moment, his body slumped backward as he fell and fainted into Long Shiya\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>The consolidation through the past twenty days was just too enormous and exhausting for Zhou Weiqing. Be it his body, Saint Energy or his Divine Thought, they were all overloaded. Had it not been for the nourishment from the Elven Queen\u2019s tremendous vitality that allowed his body to go through another evolution and complete the Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation, he would have most likely long collapsed from the pressure. It was not a stroll in the park to create a miracle using the Atmospheric Energy after all.</p><br/><p>When the Elven Queen arrived, she did not believe that she could do the things that Zhou Weiqing had done. Moreover, her cultivation base was already at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier and not at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen glanced at Zhou Weiqing and was deep in thought but she did not say anything as she took a step forward in the air and vanished without a trace.</p><br/><p>Although this time Zhou Weiqing had suffered quite some damage, the returns that he gained was equally enormous as well. Whether it was due to his confidence or the control of his Saint Energy, or even the elevation of his body the moment it overloaded, they were all beneficial to him in his next step of breaking through to the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya held onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body as he descended from the sky. The sealing of the Heavenly Bow City which lasted for nearly a month and all the peculiar spectacles finally had the curtains drawn down. Even after several decades had gone by, the miracles that took place during this month would continue to be the talk of the town for years to come.</p><br/><p>Now that Zhou Weiqing had finally completed one of his important mission, the commotion in the Boundless Mainland had also died down and it became unusually peaceful.</p><br/><p>Be it the Dandun Empire or the Bai Da Empire, they both actually retreated as if nothing had taken place at all. As for the three Shangguan sisters and Tian\u2019er, they had also left the Heavenly Bow City quietly after Zhou Weiqing regained his consciousness from the coma. They returned to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palance and Heavenly Snow Mountain respectively.</p><br/><p>Those with discerning eyes could clearly see that the current tranquility in the mainland was only temporary. It was apparent that the Dandun Empire would not give up just like that. Apart from that, the Zhongtian Empire could not easily obtain news from the Dandun Empire any longer. Both the Dandun and Bai Da Empire had tightly sealed off their information from the outer world. All the major empires were in full swing, preparing and dispatching their armies. The commoners had no idea when the war would break out but every top official from all the nations knew about this very clearly. The most crucial thing lay in the upcoming Grand Tournament of Saint Lands that was about to take place.</p><br/><p>In the earlier days, the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands was held once every five years. However, it had now been changed to being held once every decade. In the previous years, this tournament was a place for the Five Great Saint Lands to display their true power. The Saint Land with the highest rank would have a greater influence on the mainland.</p><br/><p>Just take the previous Grand Tournament of Saint Lands for example, the moment the Heavenly Demon Sect came out last again in the tournament, coupled with the fact that most of its followers possessed the Evil Attribute, it was suppressed by the other four Great Saint Lands together. As a result, the influence of the sect had greatly decreased. At the same time, it was also rejected by all the other nations. Otherwise, it would not have fallen into such pitiful state in the first place. The Heavenly Demon Sect would mostly like be destroyed had it not been for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>This time, the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands would take place in the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Be it in brightness or darkness, a great number of people looked forward to the outcome of this tournament.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the people, it was clear that the Heavenly Demon Sect had long lost the qualifications to join the Grand Tournament. The Blood Red Hell\u2019s uprising influence was bound to be crushed by the other three Great Saint Lands anyway. However, nobody was able to predict what the final outcome would be. If the Blood Red Hell was successfully suppressed by the other three Great Saint Lands, then the alliance between Dandun and Bai Da Empire would definitely be squashed as well. On the contrary, this might be the best time for another great empire to rise abruptly. It would be a mystery if Zhongtian Empire was able to block the Dandun and Bai Da Empire allied forces by then.</p><br/><p>Of course, no one knew what was going on inside the Saint Lands at the moment. However, the atmosphere on the mainland was already unprecedentedly tensed. Every nation\u2019s top officials had their eyes all focused on the Heavenly Snow Mountain as they quietly waited for the arrival of the final result.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Heavenly Jewel Island, Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang was lost in his thoughts as he sat on the master throne. Shangguan Tianyue stood beside him with a calm expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave the three girls left?\u201d Shangguan Tianyang asked nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue nodded his head. A slightly dejected look could be seen on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep a daughter at home!\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint smile crept up on Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s face as he shook his head, \u201cPerhaps, this is the best outcome after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Shangguan Tianyue stared at his brother in shock. In truth, he knew perfectly well that his brother was actually concerned about having all three Shangguan sisters married off to Zhou Weiqing, especially Shangguan Xue\u2019er. After all, even if they did not take into consideration the fact that Shangguan Xue\u2019er was his daughter, she was still the one who was groomed to become the next Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace successor. On top of that, she was also the most outstanding person among all the younger generation in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang continued dejectedly, \u201cI heard that fellow has already completed the eleventh piece of his Ringless Ground Purging Set. Maybe we still have the ability to stop the rise of both Dandun Empire and Blood Red Hell. However, nobody will be able to stop him from leading the rise of the Heavenly Bow Empire anymore. Fortunately, this kid\u2019s not greedy, and he\u2019s not our enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Shangguan Tianyue thought of that little brat, a faint smile appeared on his face as well, \u201cBrother, if you\u2019re given another chance to redo everything, how do you think you\u2019ll deal with him?\u2019</p><br/><p>A cold gleam shimmered in Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll kill him without any hesitation. Or maybe, forcefully take him into the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue cracked a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re right. If we have another chance to redo everything, I\u2019ll marry Bing\u2019er off to him immediately and assist him in rebuilding his nation. Then, he\u2019ll truly become one of us Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang cast a glance at him, \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s no \u2018if\u2019 in this world. Anyway, is everything ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s face instantly turned solemn as he said, \u201cEverything\u2019s ready. We\u2019re ready to leave at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang suddenly rose from his throne, and his eyes were brightly lit, \u201cAlright, let me see how strong this Blood Red Hell actually is to the extent that they dare to provoke the entire mainland! Let us go to the Heavenly Snow Mountain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>Unlike the Wan Shou Empire\u2019s weather that was pleasant all year round, a piercing cold wind blew on Heavenly Snow Mountain that was situated atop the mountains. Even a Heavenly Jewel Master that had a slightly weaker cultivation base would have a hard time standing still here.</p><br/><p>At this moment, two people were standing, rooted to the spot. One man and one woman. The woman was leaning into the man\u2019s embrace while he gently stroked her beautiful hair</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly, you\u2019re going to become a mum soon, you know. Look at how spoiled you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>If anybody from the Wan Shou Empire happened to hear such kind words coming out of this man, their jaws would be opened so wide that it would most likely drop to the ground. This was because the man was none other than the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain who was in charge of the lives of ten million people living in the Wan Shou Empire \u2014 the strongest man in the world. Or at least, he would remain the strongest man in the entire world until somebody appeared to defeat him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, when will I be able to see Mother again? Will she come back if Weiqing and I are formally married?\u201d Tian\u2019er muttered lightly as she leaned back into her father\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s eyes turned solemn instantly. Although he had countless maids and concubines, he only had one true wife. The only child that he had was Tian\u2019er who was lying in his arms now. Could it be that he was infertile? Of course not. The reason he only had one child was because of his profound love towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess the only person who can make your mother come back and never leave is that little brat. It has never crossed my mind that he\u2019ll be breaking through to the Heavenly God Tier so soon in just within these few years. Looks like your mother is more of a visionary than I am. Still, I really want to kick this boy\u2019s ass at least once! You two are not even married yet, and he has already given me a grandson! Tell me, don\u2019t you think he deserves a good beating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026\u201d Tian\u2019er squirmed in her father\u2019s embrace. Her delicate face was completely flushed.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian chuckled, \u201cJust like the saying goes, \u2018a married daughter is just like water that has been poured \u2014 she doesn\u2019t belong to her parents anymore.\u2019 Anyway, I\u2019m not going to meddle in your other business but you have to get married here at the Heavenly Snow Mountain. I believe that the two fellows in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace will most likely have the same thoughts as I do. Zhou Weiqing is really a lucky bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er stared curiously at her father\u2019s smile before she asked, \u201cFather, you don\u2019t seem like you\u2019re worried about the upcoming Grand Tournament of Saint Lands at all? Weiqing told me that the Blood Red Hell is not a land that\u2019s easy to deal with. Not only tha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian waved his hands, preventing her from continuing, \u201cThey\u2019re just a couple of small clowns. The true enemy is the one pulling the strings behind the scene. I\u2019ve already read the letter that Weiqing told you to bring me. This time, I\u2019ll join him in this game. The mainland will not be chaotic. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Tian\u2019er did not say anything more as she continued to snuggle against her father quietly. She knew that once she became Zhou Weiqing\u2019s wife, she would not have a lot of time to spend with her father anymore. For this reason, she felt completely attached to her father.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian looked towards the far distance. Three days. Three more days before the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands. Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s heart that had not wavered in many years started to look forward to the upcoming tournament.</p><br/><p>\u201cMountain Lord,\u201d a respectful voice sounded from not far away.</p><br/><p>Creases crept up in between Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s brows. It was obvious that he was dissatisfied that his sweet moment with his daughter was disrupted.</p><br/><p>Just several dozen meters away, Gu Site, the strong and sturdy Lion King, was standing quietly with his disheveled and tousled hair. No, he was no longer the Lion King because his position had been stripped away by Xue Ao\u2019tian due to the incident previously. The person who was currently in charge of the Leontrope was his son \u2014 Gu Yingbing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Your actions have already violated the rules. In other words, from now on, the Blood Red Hell is eliminated from the Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Haha!\u201d Fen Tian threw his head back as he laughed. A ferocious look appeared on his face, and the power that he had been suppressing all along instantly burst out at once without any warning. Horrendous Destruction Energy scattered all over the place as if it had just been detonated. The sky quickly darkened on its own without needing Destruction Energy to dye it black. It immediately gave off a feeling as if one had entered a world that was full of destruction. Every attribute that was in the atmosphere was destroyed within seconds. In just an instant, the ghastly Destruction Energy became the only thing that filled the entire space.</p><br/><p>What a powerful Divine Territory! Even Zhou Weiqing faced some difficulties in controlling and maintaining his flight in the air. He quickly landed in front of the Peerless Sect and was surrounded entirely by darkness. Only the dark purple flames that were ignited on the Blood Red Hell followers\u2019 bodies allowed them to vaguely identify everything that was happening around them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier!\u201d Xue Ao\u2019tian could not help but inhale in a cold breath as he exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>Even before today\u2019s Grand Tournament took place, everyone had already held Fen Tian in high regards. However, the moment they saw Fen Tian unleashing his cultivation base that was at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier with their own eyes, all of them immediately understood that they had underestimated him and the Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>The purple flames on Fen Tian\u2019s body were like a layer of dazzling outerwear. It made his entire person look even more menacing. The surroundings were completely shrouded in darkness. He was not the only one who turned powerful. All of Blood Red Hell\u2019s followers who possessed the Destruction Attribute became powerful as well. At this moment, it was as if they were all injected with some sort of growth hormones. Each of them was emitting an unparalleled and mighty sense of powerful aura.</p><br/><p>Shen Mo\u2019s breathing had obviously become a lot heavier. It was him who caught hold of Shen Bu\u2019s dead body. When he saw that she was no longer breathing in his arms, he gritted his teeth as he growled, \u201cI\u2019ve told you before. We need to subdue them by force and directly lay all our cards out in front of them. What use is there to include this useless tournament in our plan? Shen Bu wouldn\u2019t have died had it not been the case!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you questioning my decision now?\u201d Fen Tian glared at him coldly. Shen Mo\u2019s voice instantly stopped abruptly in its track. He did not dare to make any sound as he lowered his head.</p><br/><p>As Shangguang Tianyang looked at all of the Blood Red Hell\u2019s people, he calmly asked, \u201cFen Tian, what do you mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian replied indifferently, \u201cCan\u2019t you see what I\u2019m trying to do? This is my Divine Territory. To be more precise, the Destructive Divine Territory. In my Divine Territory, unless somebody has a cultivation base that is far greater than mine and reaches the Heavenly Change Tier that only exists in the legend, nobody else but I will be the ultimate ruler here. All of your affairs will be under my control! Originally, my plan was to first weaken your strength to a certain level through the Grand Tournament because, at the very least, all of you are still from the Saint Lands and possess a certain level of strength. Unfortunately, since all of you have already found out about the truth, not to mention the fact that you even caused me to lose my beloved subordinate, I don\u2019t see a point in continuing this Grand Tournament any longer. I\u2019ll give all of you two options now!\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused for a moment as he reached here. A magical light shone within his eyes that were twinkling with a dark purplish gleam. At this moment, one had to admit that Fen Tian who possessed the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God-tier cultivation base was emitting a sense of coercion that was so powerful that everyone, including Xue Ao\u2019tian, was feeling suffocated by it.</p><br/><p>Once one reached the Heavenly King Tier, each and every small gap after that was like a chasm that needed to be crossed. A Heavenly God at the Maximum Level. It would be difficult to even rouse the desire of Xue Ao\u2019tian, who was at the Middle Level of the Heavenly God Tier, to fight him. Moreover, this Destructive Divine Territory seemed to have enveloped the entire world.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d This was the question that everyone present was dying to ask.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Fen Tian\u2019s voice continued to boom out loud, \u201cFirst option. I\u2019ll let you off safely as long as all the Saint Lands seal themselves and not show themselves for a thousand years. I don\u2019t even need you to submit entirely to my Blood Red Hell. During the sealing process, you\u2019re not allowed to interfere with anything that\u2019s happening on the mainland. I want to unify the entire Boundless Mainland!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if we don\u2019t agree to it?\u201d Shangguan Tianyue could be heard asking coldly.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian smiled indifferently, \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree to it? Well, if you disagree, then all of you will die today! Maybe killing all of you will incur huge losses to us. However, the entire Boundless Mainland will still remain under my control as long as I can annihilate all of you here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Slightly perplexed, Zhou Weiqing asked, \u201cFen Tian, since you already have the power of a Heavenly God at the Maximum Level, why did you wait until now to make your move? Are you really not going to do us any harm once we sealed off our Saint Lands? Do you really think that we\u2019re all three-year-old kids?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian scoffed, \u201cOf course I have my own reasons for doing what I\u2019m doing now. Even though we\u2019re all enemies, I\u2019ll still keep my words. As for what will happen after a thousand years, well, that will depend on your strength at that time. However, there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019d like to add! All the other Saint Lands can choose to seal themselves off but you, the Peerless Sect, cannot! Today, all of those from the Peerless Sect will have to leave your lives behind! No man will be spared!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed, \u201cI knew you\u2019ll never let me go! Saint Energy and Destruction Energy are polar opposites. Since I\u2019m still so young, you\u2019re afraid that given enough time, I\u2019ll grow even more powerful and will no longer be under your control. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian did not deny it. Instead, he stared at Zhou Weiqing as he proclaimed calmly, \u201cYou\u2019re a smart person. Although I do wonder how you managed to achieve such accomplishment at such a young age, honestly, I\u2019ve no choice but to kill you while you\u2019re still in a cradle. This is because even if you surrender and submit to me, I\u2019m still not confident enough to think that I can control you completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the two of them were at the opposite ends of an antagonistic position, just the fact that Fen Tian said this showed how much actually he acknowledged Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged his shoulders as he let out a sigh, \u201cWhat a pity! You and I have really different mindsets. What cradle were you talking about, huh? What makes you so sure that I\u2019m still in a cradle anyway? You only have two Heavenly Gods by your side. We also have two Heavenly Gods right here. Moreover, the number of people we have are no lesser than yours. Do you really think that you\u2019ll be able to make all of us here yield to you with just that stupid Destruction sorry-ass Divine Territory alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian replied nonchalantly, \u201cDon\u2019t be so insolent, young man! It\u2019s indeed true that your cultivation base is not bad and your Saint Energy is able to restrain my Destructive Divine Territory. Otherwise, Long Shiya would have been dead long ago. Unfortunately, your cultivation base is still far from being enough. How are you supposed to destroy my Destructive Divine Territory without having the same level of cultivation base as me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cFacts speak louder than words. Make sure you take a good look, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, the smile on his face disappeared. Two dots of lights instantly radiated from his face \u2014 from his eyes to be exact.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes had become as dazzling as the stars. Dense Saint Energy instantly burst out from within him without warning.</p><br/><p>This energy ripple radiated from the Saint Energy was extremely pure. Gold colored little starlight showed up on his body immediately. At the same time, a bright light could be seen lighting up in the middle of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest as well. The little starlights rose up in a spiral and forcibly dispelled the darkness in the surroundings as it expanded outwards at an extremely fast rate.</p><br/><p>At this moment, all of those who were present on the scene seemed to be in some sort of illusion. It seemed like they heard shrill screams coming from the Destructive Divine Territory and everywhere that the Saint Energy had passed through. The Destructive intent contained in the Destructive Divine Territory immediately dissipated just like snow that came across hot boiling water.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out!\u201d Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud without warning.</p><br/><p>An intense golden Nebula Saint Energy soared up to the sky at once. It was closely followed by a clear golden ray that shone down from the sky. In an instant, it was as if the dark sky was cracked open. A starry sky appeared in front of everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The starlight was so intense and dense as it hovered in the air. In a flash, gigantic nebula light cluster filled up the desolate abyss that was created by the Destructive Divine Territory. Once again, the energy of various attributes appeared in the air. Even though it was only confined to this one area on the summit of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, it was more than enough for these powerhouses from the various Saint Lands.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Territory!\u201d Some changes could finally be seen in Fen Tian\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>Apart from some innermost secrets that could not be said out loud, the reason why he did not unleash his full power when he first arrived was partly due to the strength of the other Saint Lands.</p><br/><p>Whether it was the Heavenly Snow Mountain or the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, they both had a greater lineage compared to the Blood Red Hell. The rise of the Blood Red Hell in these few years were completely due to their reliance on the Destruction Attribute. However, Fen Tian did not know what other trump cards the other two Great Saint Lands held. For this reason, he was more than willing to continuously weaken the strength of the two Great Saint Lands through the Grand Tournament. The best scenario would be him killing off Shangguan Tianyang and Xue Ao\u2019tian one after the other in the final battle. It would still be much easier for the next step of his plan if he had successfully killed off even one of them.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, due to the sudden appearance of the Peerless Sect, his plan had fallen short miserably. At this moment, it was the correct decision for him to use the Destructive Divine Territory to restrain all of the people present on the scene. Once the Destructive Divine Territory was activated, the Blood Red Hell followers would have their strength greatly enhanced and concurrently greatly reduced the cultivation base of the people from other Saint Lands. However, the Astral Divine Territory that Zhou Weiqing had just launched had completely destroyed his plan.</p><br/><p>As the caster of the Destructive Divine Territory, Fen Tian was the clearest about Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory. Indeed, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory was not as powerful as his Destructive Divine Territory. One could even say that it was much more inferior compared to his Destructive Divine Territory. However, he clearly noticed one thing. The purity of the Saint Energy contained in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Nebula Saint Energy was far greater than the Destruction Attribute in his Destructive Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>In other words, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was far purer than his Destruction Energy. It was exactly for this reason that even though his Destructive Divine Territory was far more formidable than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory, it was still unable to destroy Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory in a short period of time. Well, unless he killed Zhou Weiqing off.</p><br/><p>However, the two of them were not the only one on the Heavenly Snow Mountain right now. With the help from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace followers would undoubtedly have a great increase in their combat effectiveness while the Blood Red Hell would be suppressed by it. How should they fight in this case? Even if he could obtain the Saint Energy in the end, he would have to pay a hefty price for that.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In the next instance, Feng Yu pulled Zhou Weiqing by the arm, and in a quick flash, they appeared back in the room, and slammed shut the door instantaneously. Huyan Aobo, in a swift motion that seemed as if they had trained together innumerable times, his left hand lifted up and his third Cat\u2019s Eye Jewel shone out in a brilliant light, a silver shining light that expanded outward instantaneously to cover the entire room completely. Although Zhou Weiqing did not know what he was doing, but after the silver light dispersed, he actually could no longer hear the sound of the insects from the courtyard outside.</p><br/><p>Feng Yu looked up to Huyan Aobo, his face having a strange expression as he said in a low voice: \u201cIs this a miracle? Is there really such a Elemental Jewel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Aobo\u2019s body flashed with a silver light again, and Zhou Weiqing felt a flash before his eyes before that fat old man\u2019s belly had almost bumped into him. Huyan Aobo had both hands firmly held on his shoulder, and in a rapid speed he asked: \u201cLittle Fatty Zhou, tell me, in your Elemental Jewel, besides the Spatial Attribute, is there also the Wind Attribute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said with surprise: \u201cHow did you know? Can you see the Attributes in my Elemental Jewel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Aobo whole body seemed to deflate and stiffen, and he swallowed hard, in the next instance he loosened his hold on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shoulder and took two steps back, both his hands forked on his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWahahahahaha, Hahaha\u2026..\u201d A demented laughter exploded suddenly, so loud that not only Zhou Weiqing, but also Feng Yu was startled by him. However, this fat old man was actually dancing with joy there, looking at him it seemed like he was excited to the extreme.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a bewildered look at Feng Yu and said: \u201cFeng Senior, Huyan Senior isn\u2019t having a fit right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yu looked deeply at Zhou Weiqing, muttering to himself: \u201cEnvy, jealous, hate! Little boy, you only have one set of Jewels, how can you dare show your Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye to other humans? I never expected that in this world there really exists an Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye. Huyan Old Man naturally went crazy, having accepted a disciple with such an Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye Jewel. Let alone him, even those Heavenly Jewel Masters with 9 Heavenly Jewels would also be grinning from ear to ear. Furthermore, he did not actually know that you have the Wind Attribute, but was just hoping that you had it. And you really did. To have both the Spatial and Wind Attributes, it can be said that you are born to be a Consolidating Equipment Master, moreover one of the most outstanding ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Aobo finally stopped laughing, and when he looked at Zhou Weiqing again, it was as if he was looking at a precious treasure. \u201cLittle brat, uh no, my treasured apprentice, you should have said earlier that you had both Spatial and Wind attributes! In that case, I wouldn\u2019t have to waste time considering! Even if this old man goes bankrupt, it will be worth it. Let alone the rank of grandmaster Consolidating Equipment Master, even ZongShi level, or god level, you can also achieve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed, stepped forward two steps and held Huyan Aobo\u2019s shoulders, saying with a proud face: \u201cTeacher, you shouldn\u2019t be so excited, I already said that it was the time to witness a miracle. However, just now when you were laughing it really sounded terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Aobo was still smiling happily, even though Zhou Weiqing just gave him an insult he didn\u2019t care, he was really just too excited, \u201cLittle brat, can\u2019t you be a little more modest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cMy other teacher always said that modesty makes a human regress. If you are not proud of yourself, how can others be proud of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Aobo\u2019s smiling face froze, \u201cYou have another teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said carelessly: \u201cI\u2019ve hung out with him for two years, what\u2019s wrong? Is there a restriction to number of teachers I can have? However you can rest assured that when I was with that perverted old man, my Heavenly Jewels had not awakened yet. I haven\u2019t seen him in a long time, I\u2019m not even sure where he went.\u201d</p><br/><p>On hearing that, Huyan Aobo relaxed and said: \u201cSince your Heavenly Jewel just awakened, that means you are less than 16 years old. How long till you are 16? To start creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, you need to be at least 16 years old, otherwise you do not have grown sufficiently and will not be able to control the materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing blinked and said: \u201cTeacher, I will be 14 years old in two months time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You aren\u2019t 14 years old yet?\u201d Huyan Aobo said in surprise, staring at him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said with pride: \u201cNo choice, I matured early.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Aobo shook his head, saying: \u201cI do not mean that, what I mean is that you are only 13 years old and you have so many dirty tricks. I am really suspicious on what your first master has taught you, no wonder you called him a perverted old man, looks like he is not any good thing. You\u2019re just 13 years old and you are already like this, I can\u2019t imagine when you have grown up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing scratched his head, \u201cTeacher, I am actually a very proper person, pure and good-hearted. People have given me the nickname \u2018Honest and dependable little gentleman, Spotless and beautiful youth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBah.\u201d Once Huyan Aobo had accepted Zhou Weiqing as his disciple, the arrogance on his face had vanished, and he said with a smile: \u201cYou, this little brat, really are a funny little treasure, I really do not know why that so called miracle Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye will appear for you. However, since you are still less than 14 years old, evidently you cannot study how to create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for quite some time. What are you doing in the Heavenly Bow Empire now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cI\u2019m enlisted in the army, I just joined this year, and I\u2019m in the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s Fifth Regiment 3rd Archery Battalion, my wife is the 3rd Battalion\u2019s Commander, I am her Personal Aide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yu gave him a strange look, saying: \u201cYou entered the military and Awakened your Heavenly Jewel after right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yu said with a smile: \u201cSilly kid, if you were a Heavenly Jewel Master before your enlistment, with the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s lack of Jewel Masters, wouldn\u2019t they treat you as an absolute treasure! Your little girlfriend, I remember her, she is known as the greatest genius in the younger generation of Heavenly Bow Empire. Well, it is very good to be in the military now, it will help you to conceal your ability. Besides your little girlfriend, does anyone else know about your Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye Elemental Jewel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cJust two more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yu was taken aback, and at the other side, Huyan Aobo suddenly had an imposing aura of bloodlust, giving out a hand signal and said, \u201cThat is not good. We should kill them to eliminate a potential information leak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed, \u201cTeacher, do you want to commit suicide? The two that I mentioned, isn\u2019t it you and Feng Yu Senior?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Aobo gawked in surprise, \u201cDamn brat, you better speak properly to me. You must remember, a long as you have not broken through six sets of Heavenly Jewels and entering the Heavenly Zong State, you must ensure that as few people as possible know about your Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye okay? Otherwise, you will face two types of people. One will be resorting to all means to win you over or recruit you, and the other type will be resorting to all means to kill you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

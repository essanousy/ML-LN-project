Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dragon Silencing Seal would be completed very soon. Meng Xing had cheated. So why should he not cheat as well? He proceeded to infuse a small amount of Saint Energy into it, speeding up the rate of the Dragon Silencing Seal as it grew larger. After he resisted the clash of their Heavenly Skill Images, the seal had already appeared out of thin air.</p><br/><p>A purplish red light flashed across quickly, Zhou Weiqing could already see the emergence of the purplish red whirlpool on top of his head. He chuckled to himself, \u2018Hehe, this is a small matter. I\u2019ll just stop you from using the Consolidated and Storing skills temporarily and we\u2019ll see how you\u2019re going to continue this battle with me!\u2019</p><br/><p>However, just as the purplish red light appeared, Meng Xing\u2019s dragon claws suddenly pointed towards Zhou Weiqing as a black light also flashed across quickly. He failed to dodge this.</p><br/><p>The two lights hit the two masters almost at the same time. Meng Xing\u2019s entire body instantly trembled and her entire legendary armor set vanished without a trace. Zhou Weiqing, who was on the other side, did not have it easy too. He suddenly found that he had lost all contact with his Ringless Ground Purging Set. Even though the equipment set was still attached to his body, all of the boost effects had completely disappeared. Moreover, it seemed like he was unable to even summon his own techniques now.</p><br/><p>It could not be a coincidence, could it?</p><br/><p>At this moment, both of them were completely taken aback. Staring at each other, a trace of peculiarity could be seen in both their eyes.</p><br/><p>Even though there were some differences in the techniques that they had just cast, the effect turned out to be so similar. In the end, both had aimed to temporarily seal the other party\u2019s Consolidated and Storing skills.</p><br/><p>The skill that Meng Xing cast was much faster than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dragon Silencing Seal. However, his skill could be cast multiple times in a row. It would be very hard to decide which technique was better.</p><br/><p>Since he had lost contact with his Ringless Ground Purging Set, Zhou Weiqing decided to just dispel them. Puzzled, he stared at Meng Xing, \u201cWhat\u2019s your technique called? Don\u2019t you need to charge this powerful technique before you use it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She scoffed coldly, \u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly, \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me if you don\u2019t want to tell me. However, this is only the beginning,\u201d As he was saying that, he used his right foot to stomp on the ground. In a flash, he charged towards Meng Xing. Coincidentally enough, perhaps great minds really did think alike, she also stormed out and dashed towards him as he was charging towards her.</p><br/><p>In fact, the two of them had the exact same idea at the moment. Both of them had no idea how long the other party\u2019s sealing technique would last. If the other party was set free first, then he or she would regain their Consolidated and Storing skills. When this happened, they would definitely be in a disadvantageous situation. Under such circumstances, they had no choice but to strike first to gain the upper hand They would have to use this window of opportunity to crush their opponent.</p><br/><p>Without the boost from their legendary armor suits, be it their speed or energy, both had significantly decreased compared to earlier. However, their usage of Heavenly Energy did not slow down at all.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was much faster after all. With a wave of her hand, she headed straight for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>He could no longer use his skills. Even the Six Ultimate Godly Light skill had already been destroyed by her. A strange smile suddenly appeared on his face as he faced her claws.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not bother dodging at all as he threw both his hands out. It seemed like his hands were headed towards Meng Xing\u2019s shoulders, but in truth, his hands were aimed slightly lower.</p><br/><p>A straight line was always faster than a curved line. For this reason, he managed to grab on to her first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU\u2026 FILTHY!\u201d Boiling in wrath, Meng Xing kicked up a leg that was aimed towards his lower abdomen. Both of them were demonstrating the Sixth Jewel Tier energy and although their speeds were much slower than before, the fight was still pretty fast.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing still did not shy away from her attack. His right leg suddenly lifted from the ground before it met with Meng Xing\u2019s kick halfway.</p><br/><p>A smirk crept up onto a corner of her mouth as she thought to herself, \u2018Before this when you still had the Ringless Ground Purging Set, my power was indeed much inferior to yours. But now that you no longer have that, how is your energy supposed to win against my Dual Physical Jewels?\u2019</p><br/><p>A muffled thud could be heard as both legs collided once again. A pang of stabbing pain spread throughout Meng Xing\u2019s body all at once. The right leg that was just relieved from the tingling numbness earlier was so painful that it prompted her to retreat in a flash.</p><br/><p>Yes, she lost again. She could clearly feel that not only was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right leg far more powerful than hers, it was also extremely sturdy and hard. It felt like she had just kicked an iron pillar. Even though she did not suffer from any fracture, this action had still injured her.</p><br/><p>How was this possible?</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing did not grant Meng Xing much time to contemplate any further. Now that he had succeeded in the kick, his right leg suddenly stomped on the ground furiously. Like a hungry tiger, he pounced towards her in a rush. If she really did get pounced on in such a manner, hehe, even Shangguan Xue\u2019er was not spared last time. Let alone Meng Xing who was only using the Sixth Jewel cultivation. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Ground Technique was extremely remarkable.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s eyes suddenly turned gloomy. Until a second before, she had not regarded Zhou Weiqing as a real opponent. After all, even if she could only use Sixth Jewel Tier\u2019s cultivation base, she was still a powerful presence at the Heavenly King-tier and above. Be it her combat experience or the mastery of her Heavenly Energy, she should be a lot more superior than he was.</p><br/><p>Still, it had proven been with facts that this fella was much harder to deal with than she had initially thought. There must be something peculiar about his right leg.</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, Meng Xing\u2019s real capability suddenly erupted.</p><br/><p>In the face of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attack, when she was flying back from the kick, her left leg suddenly jolted out and slammed towards the ground. With the help of the energy from the rebound, she managed to dodge his pounce as her entire body spun rapidly in the air. At the same time, her right palm was stretched out to the back of his neck before she clawed at it. Meanwhile, she crossed her left leg at lightning speed and it was placed directly at his waist. With a twist of her body and a hook from her heel, her left leg was now locked around his waist. It allowed her to hang from his back.</p><br/><p>What amazing flexibility!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lowered his head abruptly to evade Meng Xing\u2019s direct attack but unfortunately, she had gotten too close to him.</p><br/><p>Apparently, it was not easy to throw her off him. In the next second, she had already launched her attack. Throwing her own body downwards, she brazenly threw Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body in the opposite direction. At the same time, both of her hands grabbed onto his shirt from the back before she slammed him directly onto the ground.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, he should be feeling fortunate as Meng Xing\u2019s leg was still tingling with numbness. Otherwise, he would not be thrown on the floor in such a simple manner.</p><br/><p>Crash!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was slammed onto the ground in a tenacious manner. It was so rough that he became confused and disoriented. His entire body was thrown forward more than 10 meters before it finally came to a stop.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing did not continue to pursue him as waves of pain were throbbing constantly in her right leg. She had no other choice but to stop as she placed both of her hands on her right leg before infusing rays of faint blue light into it to relieve the pain in her leg.</p><br/><p>\u2018How can his bones possibly be tougher than mine. After all, I\u2019m\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As she watched Zhou Weiqing who was thrown off and finally beaten for the first time in today\u2019s battle, question marks slowly began to appear in her eyes. His combat ability was much, much stronger than she had imagined. She was very sure that even a Heavenly Jewel Master who was at the Sixth Jewel cultivation base would not be able to win against him. How many secrets did this guy hold? As a God Tier Master, unlike her, he actually used some special methods to strengthen his cultivation base. But how could he possibly possess such powerful combat experience?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing crept up from his spot. With his body\u2019s sturdiness, this fall naturally did not hurt him. Still, he felt dismayed. After all, when it came to close combat ability, he was still a lot inferior to those who possessed the flexibility affinity. Didn\u2019t Fei\u2019er use the same method to bully him last time, too? Why was there another one now?</p><br/><p>Both of them were lost in their thoughts. Yet, none of them put their guards down. One was rubbing her leg while the other one was rapidly recovering his Heavenly Energy. At this moment, both of them wished the sealing skills placed on them by the other party would quickly dispel so that they could put on their legendary armor suit again.</p><br/><p>However, reality did not always turn out the way one wished it did. The entire ordeal only took a little more than ten seconds. The sealing skills were still far from its completion time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes rotated sharply before a proud smirk slowly crept up to his eyes. He stood in the same spot as he turned his right hand. A longbow suddenly appeared in his grasp. It was not a Consolidated Equipment. Instead, it was a genuine longbow that was made completely of Black Dawn wood.</p><br/><p>When he pulled the bowstring, three long arrows almost instantaneously appeared on the bowstring that was arched like a full moon. Along with a harsh blast, the three long arrows were shot directly at Meng Xing like lightning.</p><br/><p>In such a short distance, even if she were to use her Heavenly King cultivation base, she would still be unlikely to dodge the attack.</p><br/><p>In desperation, she held out both of her palms at the same time. Rich, vigorous Heavenly Energy burst out all at once. It formed a round shield and successfully blocked the three arrows.</p><br/><p>Actually, these three arrows were merely a probe. Instead of marching forward, Zhou Weiqing chose to retreat. While he was retreating rapidly, a barrage of arrows shot out like lightning. Some of them were shot towards the sky, some were in straight lines while some were arched. Ear-splitting and wind-piercing sound kept resonating from the rain of the Rapid Fire Arrows in the air. Particularly the arrows that were occasionally shot out with his Twisting Bowstring Effect. Because the arrows had been infused with his brutal Heavenly Energy, the arrows had a tyrannical destruction energy.</p><br/><p>Within the span of a few breaths, Meng Xing could no longer defend against them anymore.</p><br/><p>It had never crossed her mind that Zhou Weiqing would still have such tricks hidden up his sleeve. His archery skill could only be described as miraculous and divine. No matter where the arrows were directed, they would eventually make their ways towards her. Not only that, they usually came from her blind-spot as well. Apart from that, the arrows were also infused with his Heavenly Energy. The Heavenly Energy that they were using was at the Sixth Jewel Tier. In order to defend against such a dense piercing technique, she would have to consume more Heavenly Energy. Because Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arrows were too densely packed, she did not even have the opportunity to cast her Heavenly Dao Energy to absorb the Atmospheric Energy to replenish her body.</p><br/><p><em>\u2018This bastard! </em>\u2018 Meng Xing yelled angrily in her heart. Still, there was nothing else that she could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who forced me!\u201d She shouted out loudly. All of a sudden, a strong, rich Blackness aura erupted from her body. Intense Darkness Energy suddenly rose up without warning. It formed a black gigantic light ball in the air. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arrows that arrived in quick succession vanished without a trace the moment it entered the black light ball. The arrows instantly eroded away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

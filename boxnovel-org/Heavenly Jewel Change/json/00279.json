(2)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\">Overwhelming energy fluctuations erupted in an instant. Originally, the distorted Time Attribute Energy was only circling around the man in black, but at this moment, it had spread out. The space within thousands of square meters became distorted with countless fine black cracks. It was not the sight of space rupturing, but time.\u00a0</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\">The power arising from time rupture was not as simple as that of space - \u00a0once the target was hit, he might not necessarily get torn to shreds in an instant. Instead, he would either age rapidly or shrink in an instant. Additionally, the time ripples released from the cracks were different. Once the target was hit, the cracks could cause his body to show signs of time chaos. By then, he would be in utter misery, wishing he could die.\u00a0</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\">At a lower cultivation base, Time Attribute was unable to display the same might and power as Saint Attribute. It was more commonly used for defense rather than offense. However, at the Heavenly Emperor cultivation base onwards, Time Attribute as an attacking power could even surpass that of Divine Attribute, and even be on par with Demonic Attribute. In fact, it was even more tricky and hard to guard against.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\">Terrifying energy fluctuations erupted in an instant; Zhou Weiqing had a disdainful look on his face. His figure flashed and retreated. A layer of reddish golden astral light rays started spiraling from his body, forcefully obstructing the time rift on the outside, not allowing it to get near his body.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\">At this time, the man in black went up to Zhou Weiqing. As he moved forward, all the time cracks automatically moved away, creating a pathway for him.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\">He waved both hands in the air. The long sword that was originally on his back landed in his hand. Just like his body, the entire body of the sword was black. A blade light flashed and a strange distorted black blade light headed towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\">At one glance, the black blade light was only about twelve meters long. At the Heavenly Emperor cultivation base, an attack like this would only be deemed superficial. It was definitely not considered as potent. However, Zhou Weiqing was very clear about how strong and powerful that attack was.\u00a0</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\">That was not a simple and ordinary attack, and it was not purely Time Attribute in nature. The man in black actually possessed both Darkness and Time Attributes - a superior Attribute matched with a Saint Attribute. Such a combination definitely allowed him to be considered as incredibly gifted. Also, coupled with the attack power attached to the sword of his Legendary Set, one could well imagine the power and might of that attack. By perfectly combining both Darkness and Time Attributes, he was definitely worthy to be called a genius.\u00a0</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\">Unfortunately, his opponent was Zhou Weiqing. Being pitted against his attack, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s reddish golden Nebula Saint Energy became distorted as well. Immediately after, his body did a subtle spin; the two hammers in his hands were sent smashing towards him as forcefully as before.\u00a0</p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">After a loud rumbling sound, the black blade light was shattered into pieces by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s <span style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Legendary Dual God Strength Hammers. Even the surrounding distorted time rays of light were jolted open.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">As the saying goes, \u2018An incredibly strong person can beat ten martial artists\u2019. When strength reached a certain level, judgment could no longer be passed based on common sense alone. <span style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">\u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Set\u2019s property allowed Zhou Weiqing to rely solely on strength to face attacks by any Attributes head-on.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">The disdain on his face did not go away. Zhou Weiqing took a step in the air, and swung his hammers once again, attacking the man in black straight in the head.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">At this moment, the man in black was extremely shocked, not because of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s power, but because of his Legendary Set. The Attribute of his Physical Jewels was also Strength, and they were both Heavenly Emperors. However, he clearly acknowledged that the difference in his strength and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s was worlds apart \u2013 it was simply incomprehensible. <em>Why was that so? Could it be that his Legendary Set purely boosted strength?</em> From what he remembered, the only Legendary Set that purely boosted strength was Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya\u2019s \u2018Hate Sky no Handle\u2019 Set. The young man before his eyes was clearly not Long Shiya. Additionally, Long Shiya\u2019s \u2018Hate Sky no Handle\u2019 Set was silver in color, but this young Heavenly Emperor\u2019s Legendary Set was gold in color. Furthermore, this young man\u2019s strength seemed to be more terrifying compared to Long Shiya.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">Learning from other\u2019s mistakes, the man in black did not dare to forcefully attack Zhou Weiqing. He quickly retreated and placed both his hands together in the middle. The intense time rift in the air started rushing towards Zhou Weiqing.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">He did not pin all his hopes on the time rift to eliminate Zhou Weiqing. After all, Zhou Weiqing was still equipped with the Legendary Set - he could defend himself against most of the attacks. He merely wanted Zhou Weiqing to exhaust his Heavenly Energy.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">After the earlier attack, the man in black was extremely calm. He knew that getting worked up would be unwise, as there was still a Heavenly God providing support. As he retreated, he had already harbored the intention to escape. With regards to his earlier humiliation, he would take his revenge on Zhou Weiqing another day. If it were one on one, he would certainly go all out to fight Zhou Weiqing and protect his dignity.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">However, at this moment, it was clearly not the right time for him to go all out to fight him. Hence, when he was retreating, he intentionally chose to head in the opposite direction from where the Sidhe Queen was. He was waiting for the right opportunity.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">As he was retreating, at the same time, the black sword in his hand undulated, forming blade light. The blade light was as black and distorted as before - they looked like countless black snakes wriggling in the air. The black sword shook and the black rays of light broke away from its blade. At the same time, they headed towards Zhou Weiqing in all directions. <em>Since you are that strong, let me use technique and skill against you.\u00a0</em></span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">Zhou Weiqing chuckled, he did not budge or dodge. His body spun at a high speed and both hammers swirled about in the air, up and down. His speed increased exponentially in an instant; none of the black rays of light could touch his body as they were jolted apart by his <span style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Legendary Dual God Strength Hammers.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">As the Sidhe Queen was watching their exchange, she couldn\u2019t help but furrow her brows hard. Naturally, she could tell that the man in black was holding back, and that Zhou Weiqing was holding back as well.<em>\u00a0What are they doing exactly? It looks like they are putting on a play.</em> A bad thought floated in the Sidhe Queen\u2019s head: <em>Are they in cahoots?</em></span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">However, the Sidhe Queen quickly dismissed that thought. <em>Let\u2019s not talk about Zhou Weiqing being in cahoots with that man in black. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s women were still stranded within the sealed grounds. If Zhou Weiqing really wanted to leave, based on his cultivation base, he was able to easily escape via Spatial Shuttle with his wives. He didn\u2019t need to bring me here to chase the perpetrator. \u00a0</em></span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">Because of her suspicion, the Sidhe Queen felt somewhat apologetic towards him. However, even if Zhou Weiqing knew what she was thinking, he wouldn\u2019t have blamed her. After all, as a mother whose daughter had been kidnapped, it was only normal for her to be paranoid.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">Seeing Zhou Weiqing neutralizing his attack once again, his eyes suddenly lit up. He swung his sword once again. This time, the black rays of light were no longer distorted. Instead, they became an enormous blade light that headed towards Zhou Weiqing, about to strike him.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">\u201cEh?\u201d Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in shock. He held his hammers above him and shouted, \u201cOpen!\u201d At the same time, reddish golden light enveloped his <span style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Legendary Dual God Strength\u00a0</span>Hammers. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">After a loud rumbling sound was heard, the space within a radius of a few hundred meters started collapsing and the man in black flew backwards with the help of the countershock force. Immediately after, circles of distorted light appeared behind his back instantaneously. The strong driving force caused his body to shoot out like an arrow. In a blink of an eye, he became a tiny black dot. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">He was waiting for that opportunity. He was not testing waters - he truly went all out when he swung that sword, or else Zhou Weiqing would not have activated the Astral Saint Energy to defend himself. He had also used the countershock force to escape. At such a speed, at least within a short period of time, it would be difficult even for Heavenly God Stage powerhouses to chase him. Additionally, when the circles of distorted light spread out behind his back, they created a strong time rift, causing Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen\u2019s line of sight, perception, and will exploration ability to suffer greatly, making it a lot harder to pinpoint the exact direction he fled in.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><em><span style=\"color:black;\">He escaped?</span></em><span style=\"color:black;\">\u00a0The Sidhe Queen panicked and wanted to give chase, but just then, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s voice rang in her ear, \u201cLeave it to me.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">Zhou Weiqing did not move. He merely raised his right hand, pointing his hammer to the sky. A brilliant reddish golden light rose to the sky. Immediately after, the sky darkened.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">Of course he had guessed that the man in black wanted to escape. If it were him, he would have similarly looked for an opportunity to escape, instead of fighting head-on. Since he had guessed it, he had naturally made preparations.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">In truth, he did not play a series of tricks on the man in black for nothing - he had a purpose behind it. After performing the Spatial Shuttle, the consumption of his Saint Energy was so massive that he needed some time to recover. Otherwise, he would not have wasted a lot of time spouting nonsense earlier on. Additionally, he did not use his full strength to attack him earlier. Right now, relying on <span style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Dragon-Tiger Transformation, as well as his own massive Saint Energy, he had nearly fully recovered. Everything required was fully prepared. Next, all he had to do was to reel him in.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">The sky that was originally clear and sunny became dark all of a sudden. Nonetheless, the night sky was extremely clear - countless stars could be seen twinkling. When Zhou Weiqing\u2019s reddish golden Astral Saint Energy was channeled into the starry sky, all the stars in the sky started lighting up. Seconds later, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body immediately emitted dense Saint Energy ripples, before vanishing in the next moment.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">As the starry sky appeared, the time rift in the sky disappeared without a trace at the same time. The defense left behind by the man in black to obstruct his enemies had also completely vanished.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">Formidable energy ripples erupted from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. The strange reddish golden light immediately turned his <span style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">\u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Set into the same shade of color. Just like that, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body disappeared under the starlight. He re-emerged right in front of that man in black thereafter.\u00a0</span></span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm;\"><span style=\"color:black;\">The man in black naturally could sense the changes in the sky, along with the changes of his Time Attribute Energy. However, he had no other choice. He could only focus on escaping as far as he could, at the fastest speed possible. However, what shocked him was that, after the sky underwent changes, no matter how far he tried to escape, he could not seem to get out of the night sky. </span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

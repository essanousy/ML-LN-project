The reason why I have such achievements today is because I\u2019ve put myself in risky situations countless times. Still, I\u2019ve managed to survive in the end. I think it\u2019ll be extremely helpful to my cultivation in the future if I personally experience the process of how Sir Blackfiend Dragon slaughters the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ass-kissing-in this case, kissing a dragon\u2019s ass-was definitely a great skill. This time, Zhou Weiqing managed to flatter him in a very slick manner. And because of the good impression that the Blackfiend Dragon had of him, the dragon nodded his head, \u201cAlthough I won\u2019t necessarily win against the Dreadfiend Sea Naga with my cultivation base, I can at least protect a person with me. Since you want to go, go ahead. I\u2019m sure that it\u2019ll be beneficial to your cultivation. If we succeed this time, I\u2019ll let you store a skill from my body. Even though it\u2019s kind of wasteful to use it to supplement your Evil attribute, I think it\u2019s more than enough to complement your Darkness Attribute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for agreeing to it, Sir,\u201d Zhou Weiqing said with joy. This was definitely not a facade. Being able to obtain and store a skill from a Heavenly God Tier Heavenly Beast would of great help to him.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was staring blankly at Zhou Weiqing who was standing before her as she thought to herself, \u2018This guy doesn\u2019t seem as haughty as he was before!\u2019 Still, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s talent left her speechless. With her cultivation base and background, she also could not help but feel a pang of jealousy toward this guy.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace said, \u201cSince you\u2019re willing to go with us, let\u2019s plan our strategy carefully before we take any action. We must make sure that there are no mistakes at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. All of you can leave first. Dongfang, stay behind for a while with Meng Xing,\u201d the Blackfiend Dragon said in a deep tone.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave Meng Xing a reluctant glance before leaving with the four Supreme Elders and Nie Han. In truth, he originally planned to continue taking advantage of her during the return trip. With his display of the six attributes earlier, he believed that no matter how high Meng Xing\u2019s position was in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, she would not dare to do anything to him. He was actually missing the soft, warm, enticing flesh and fragrance that was in his embrace earlier.</p><br/><p>\u2018Meng Xing\u2019s Physical Jewel seemed to be about flexibility. Hmm\u2026 How nice would it be if they were to\u2026 Hehe\u2026\u2019 Of course, everything was just in his mind. At least, that was what he told himself.</p><br/><p>This time, it was Nie Han who took Zhou Weiqing back to the top of the peak. After they returned to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, Nie Han gave Zhou Weiqing a thumbs-up again before returning to his own room.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing also returned to his room. Bing\u2019er was still cultivating. She only opened her eyes when she heard him return.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Bing\u2019er asked through a sound transmission.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied with a sound transmission as well, recounting all that had happened.</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Bing\u2019er heard about the whereabouts of the Spatial Teleportation Stone, she immediately became overjoyed. Even though she usually did not consider herself a part of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, it was still undoubtedly a great thing being able to save the Heavenly Jewel Island without affecting Zhongtian City.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, how are your preparations going? Even though the Spatial Teleportation Stone might very well appear when the time comes, I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019ll be hard for you to get your hands on it in the presence of so many experts.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head in silence before he whispered, \u201cI still have to try no matter what. This may be the best and only chance that we\u2019ll get. Judging from the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s tone, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga must be very difficult to deal with. When the time comes, it\u2019s very likely that it will end up in an internecine outcome. Opportunity will present itself the moment that happens. The Blackfiend Dragon will be unable to extricate himself from that mess to deal with me. And as for the other people, even a Heavenly Emperor-tier master won\u2019t be able to catch up to me if I\u2019m really bent on escaping. If I really get my hands on the stone, I\u2019ll inform you through the Luster Sound Transmission Stone. You\u2019ll wait for me in the sea with the Neptune Shuttle and we\u2019ll leave immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a face full of concern, Bing\u2019er asked, \u201cB-But, isn\u2019t it too risky?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied with confidence, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t do anything if I don\u2019t have the absolute confidence. What\u2019s more, they don\u2019t know about my true strength at all. I\u2019m pretty confident about this. What I worry about the most is you actually. If my guess is correct, once we leave on the expedition, you\u2019ll have to stay behind. With a hostage here, they\u2019ll have more confidence in me. For this reason, once we carry out the plan, you must leave this place the instant an opportunity presents itself! By then, the people left behind to guard this place will only be some Heavenly King Masters. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have no problem getting out with your Wings of the Wind God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er nodded her head and said, \u201cI guess that\u2019s the only way. You don\u2019t have to worry about me. If somehow I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her words, she was already pulled into a tight embrace by Zhou Weiqing as he planted a deep kiss on her lips. \u201cSilly girl, there\u2019s no \u2018if\u2019. The Spatial Teleportation Stone means nothing to me compared to your safety!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was saying that, he lifted her up, and in a flash, he appeared in front of the place that he loved the most \u2013 the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the following period of time, the mood in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace turned increasingly tense. Great effort was placed into the preparations, but they were not in a rush to set off. It was apparent that this time, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace wanted to be fully prepared so that they could accomplish the task in one fell swoop. As for what they were preparing, Zhou Weiqing had no idea at all.</p><br/><p>In truth, the mood had no effect on Zhou Weiqing whatsoever. He had quite a respected and esteemed position here as an Honorary God Tier Master. Needless to say, he did not need to do anything by himself at all.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er continued to cultivate arduously every day. Due to the fact that this place was rich in Atmospheric Energy, their cultivation was much more effective and they accomplished twice as much with only half the effort. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was rising steadily as well. Although his cultivation was no longer as fast as when he was using the Immortal Deity Technique, as the saying went, a penny saved was a penny earned indeed. A day would eventually come when he would have a chance. Not only that, he also familiarized himself with the utilization of his Heavenly Dao Energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, are you there?\u201d A series of knocks came from the door as Meng Xing\u2019s sweet voice resonated from outside.</p><br/><p>Ever since that encounter with the Blackfiend Dragon, Zhou Weiqing had not seen her. At first, he thought that she was angry, but he did not hear any anger in her tone now.</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er walked over to open the door. \u201cHonorary Master Meng Xing, please enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing shook her head as she said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s alright. I just wanted to invite Weiqing to a meeting with everyone to strategize, since we\u2019ll be attacking the Dreadfiend Sea Naga soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>By this time, Zhou Weiqing had walked over as well. He did not know why, but when he looked at the bright and warm smile on Meng Xing\u2019s face, he could literally feel chills running down his spine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to go to the strategy meeting, do I? I\u2019m just an extra anyway,\u201d Zhou Weiqing replied, scratching his head.</p><br/><p>Chuckling, Meng Xing replied, \u201cHow can you say that? In our eyes, you\u2019re a genius that\u2019s one of a kind! Not only that, you\u2019ve also said that you want to gain some experience through this battle. So, let\u2019s go together!\u201d Before she even finished her sentence, she had already turned and walked away.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave Bing\u2019er a reassuring look before he followed Meng Xing\u2019s footsteps.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing walked ahead and did not speak to him at all. Very soon, both of them came to the center of the sixth floor where they could be teleported.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing thought to himself, \u2018Could it be that I\u2019ve guessed wrong and we\u2019re really going to the Heavenly Court for a meeting?\u2019</p><br/><p>Meng Xing continued to remain silent. He had no time to guess as a distorted bright light suddenly appeared before the two of them vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing soon noticed that something was amiss. When they reappeared again, they were not in the Heavenly Court where they had the meeting the last time. Instead, it was a wide open space.</p><br/><p>The ground seemed to be paved with granite yet it gave off a kind of illusory feeling. The place was so vast that it seemed to stretch infinitely.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sh*t! I was duped!\u2019 Zhou Weiqing thought to himself. His heart constricted at once. He was not certain of Meng Xing\u2019s strength, and in such a confined space, he did not know how to leave this place at all. He would be in deep trouble if problems suddenly arose.</p><br/><p>The moment they arrived, the smile on Meng Xing\u2019s face disappeared in a flash. Her gaze instantly turned chilly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell, Zhou Weiqing!\u201d A terrifying and threatening suppression as vast as mountains surged from her body all at once. With a stretch of her right palm, an intense, rich Heavenly Energy descended upon him before transforming into a gigantic palm that slapped at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Drats! Did she discover my real identity?\u2019 That was the first thought that flashed through Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mind. It was obvious that a Heavenly Jewel Master with a Sixth Jewel cultivation base would not be able to resist such a slap.</p><br/><p>A silverish light flashed past and he quickly unleashed his Blink. In an instant, he reappeared in a spot that more than a dozen meters away from his original spot. A thundering rumble could be heard coming from the place that he was standing at just a moment ago. The tremors were so strong that it sent him flying back.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Xing! What are you doing? Are you crazy?\u201d Zhou Weiqing shouted in anger. He feigned a look of outrage as he quickly racked his brain.</p><br/><p>The first thing that he needed to do was to find out if Meng Xing had discovered his identity. If that was the case, then a duel would be inevitable. He would have to defeat her if he wanted to leave alive. Furthermore, Bing\u2019er was still in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace!</p><br/><p>Seeing that her first attack missed, Meng Xing immediately launched her second attack. The milky color of her Heavenly Energy consolidated into a long sword in the air. The tip of the sword was pointed directly at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest. There was a flash of brightness as it charged straight toward him without any warning.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing inhaled deeply, he had already made a resolute decision. Agitated, he yelled loudly, \u201cKill me then!\u201d He actually planned to stand there without attempting to dodge the attack at all.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the milky light sword reached his chest. At that moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart was already in his throat. Even if he did not make any attempts to block the attack, he was confident that the sword would not inflict any serious injury on him. However, if that really happened, it would mean that Meng Xing had already found out about his identity and that was why she was so persistent in killing him. Without a doubt, it would definitely throw a wrench into his plans. For this reason, the risk he took could be considered as being closely related to his mission in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>A light flashed, and in an instant, the light sword came to a halt just half a foot away from his chest. The edge was so sharp that it gave Zhou Weiqing goosebumps on his chest. The completed Immortal Deity Shield was already formed on his skin. If he had not used his Saint Energy to suppress it, the Immortal Deity Shield would have long appeared to protect him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

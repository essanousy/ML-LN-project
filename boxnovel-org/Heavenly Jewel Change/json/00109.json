(2)</b></p><br/><p>Happiness seemed to come so suddenly, leaving Zhou Weiqing rather caught off guard. He quickly supported the two up, saying: \u201cSealing isn\u2019t required, do you think I have no trust in your characters? We are all good brothers, and we are still a team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon saying that, Zhou Weiqing turned to Lin TianAo, saying: \u201cI will no longer call you Leader, but you will always be my big brother.\u201d As soon as his words ended, a silver light flashed, and instantly Zhou Weiqing appeared beside Lin TianAo. His speed was just too fast, and no one had expected him to move so suddenly with a Blink Skill. In that moment, his palm pressed upon Lin TianAo\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>A dark red light shone forth, and before Lin TianAo could react or resist, it was too late.</p><br/><p>The dark red Seal rose above his skin, and was silently erased, and when Zhou Weiqing removed his right hand, Lin TianAo stood there, stunned. The others were also equally stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>That was because\u2026 Zhou Weiqing had actually removed the Blood Rites - Seal of Darkness he had on Lin TianAo.</p><br/><p>Ye Paopao totally could not believe what had happened before his eyes. This Zhou Weiqing had actually let go of such an outstanding Follower with such future like Lin TianAo?!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, looking into Lin TianAo\u2019s eyes before saying: \u201cI said just now, we will be brothers in the future. You are my big brother, and no matter what you decide, I will not begrudge any decision you make. If there is any Seal between us brothers, how can I be fit to be called your brother, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Lin TianAo could say anything, Drunken Bao had hugged Zhou Weiqing around his neck hard, laughing heartily as he said: \u201cWeiqing, Bro has not misjudged you indeed. Well done indeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Little Four also laughed happily. Strangely, Lin TianAo did not speak. After the short moment of surprise, his expression resumed to normal. Some things were not meant to be spoken. No matter whether he had the Seal of Darkness upon him or not, in his mind, he would forever be Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Lifetime Follower.</p><br/><p>Ye Paopao suddenly said: \u201cCrow, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d He was after all the son of the Premier of the Fei Li Empire, and naturally could not follow suit behind the rest of the team and become Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Follower. He had inadvertently been looking around and spotted Crow, who had also not expressed anything yet, and couldn\u2019t help but start at the look at her. She was currently wearing a distressed, woebegotten expression on her face.</p><br/><p>With the bitter look on her face, Crow said: \u201cI also want to be your brothers\u2026 to be with you all always. But\u2026 but\u2026 I have to go look for my fiance\u2026 I \u2026 I \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cEven if you go look for fiance, how can that stop us from being bros? When we return to the Fei Li Empire, I will help you look for him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The flavour of the Fei Li Battle Team had definitely changed. The team was still the same, but it was no longer with the basis of \u2018Fei Li\u2019. Zhou Weiqing had taken control indeed.</p><br/><p>Being able to gain the support of these companions, it was far beyond the help that gaining the support of his entire class at the Fei Li Military Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing.\u201d Just as the atmosphere was going well and harmonious, a cold voice suddenly rang out from outside.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing turned to look, and without knowing when, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was standing right outside the door. She still had her cold aura and impassive expression on, the light blue dress she was wearing accentuating that cold feeling she gave off.</p><br/><p>\u201cShangguan Xue\u2019er?\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked at her curiously. It was obvious from her expression and aura that this was not Bing\u2019er, who would not treat him this way. However, no matter facing either of her other two sisters, Shangguan Xue\u2019er or Fei\u2019er, Zhou Weiqing had a terrible headache.</p><br/><p>Both of them were Bing\u2019er\u2019s sisters, and with that relationship in mind, he could never do anything against them, even if he could bring himself to - considering how much they looked like Bing\u2019er. However, Zhou Weiqing had also suffered many disadvantages at their hands. Previously, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had giving him a heavy tight slap, while Shangguan Fei\u2019er had knocked him off his feet, almost making him fall into pieces. Facing these two, in truth he would rather keep a respectful distance if possible.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er nodded towards Zhou Weiqing, saying passively: \u201cCome with me.\u201d After saying that, she did not pause and turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing followed her hesitatingly, and she stopped after a turn in the inn corridor, silently waiting for him to catch up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIce Mountain Girl, why are you here looking for me?\u201d Zhou Weiqing stopped about two metres from her, asking teasingly.</p><br/><p>Although he did not have any designs on Shangguan Xue\u2019er, especially since she was the heir and future Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, this little rascal could not help having some fantasies in the past about \u2018gaining\u2019 all three sisters, especially after knowing they were triplets\u2026 Heh heh\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, all of that were just fantasies secretly in his heart. Everything else, if Shangguan Bing\u2019er knew that our dear Zhou Little Fatty was thinking about her sisters that way, she would definitely not let him off.</p><br/><p>In truth, it was perhaps normal for Zhou Weiqing to have such thoughts. Any normal man would definitely fantasize about something like that!</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Xue\u2019er heard him call her \u2018Ice Mountain Girl\u2019, with his eyes roving over her body like a little scoundrel, the anger in her heart rose uncontrollably again.</p><br/><p>Just like how Shangguan Tianyue was unable to control himself when facing Zhou Weiqing, this young lady who had her first kiss stolen by this little rascal was the same.</p><br/><p>However, Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not flare up. That was because\u2026 today was a very unique circumstance. No matter how hateful he was today, she would not lose her temper at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are from the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2026 right?\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er said coldly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing started. He had not expected that Shangguan Xue\u2019er would ask such a question. A questioning look in his eyes, he said: \u201cYes, I am! Why? Shouldn\u2019t Bing\u2019er have told you that a long time ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er furrowed her brow, remaining silent for a moment, before giving a soft sigh. Softly, she said: \u201cI hope that you can remain calm after hearing my words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her words, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s originally joyous heart sank like a rock, a gnawing feeling in his stomach rising. If the person who said this to him had been Shangguan Fei\u2019er, perhaps he would not have taken it to heart. However, this was Shangguan Xue\u2019er in front of him, the heir to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. With her status, she would not make some low class joke like that to him. The only reason she could say something like that \u2026 could only mean that something had happened to the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p><br/><p>With the topic involving his own home, the Indecorous, joking appearance that Zhou Weiqing had up disappeared instantly. Pausing a second to calm himself down, he finally turned to Shangguan Xue\u2019er and said: \u201cOkay, please tell me the news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er looked at him meaningfully before saying: \u201cYesterday, we just received news that the Kalise Empire received support from the Bai Da Empire. They seized the opportunity that Admiral Zhou from the Heavenly Bow Empire had returned to the Heavenly Bow City and launched a surprise attack. Striking with a force of ten times that of the border troops of the Heavenly Bow Empire, they struck right into the heart, swiftly invading deep into the Heavenly Bow Empire territories right into the Heavenly Bow City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Even though Zhou Weiqing had been prepared for some bad news, but this was just too sudden and too immense. Shaken immensely, his face turned ashen pale.</p><br/><p>At this point, Zhou Weiqing had totally forgotten about the \u2018dangers\u2019 of Shangguan Xue\u2019er, with a quick step forward, he grabbed her by her deceptively frail looking shoulders, shouting: \u201cWhat\u2026 What did you say?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shaken by the shoulders, Shangguan Xue\u2019er gently knocked his hands away, but did not do anything further. She did not know why, but when she saw this young man in front of her pouncing towards her like an injured wild beast, she did not dodge. Especially when she saw that terrifying bloodshot eyes of his, she somehow felt a small sharp pain in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down.\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er lifted her hand and slapped it lightly against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s forehead. Immediately, a cool sensation traveled to his head, causing his boiling blood to calm down slightly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s breathing was laboured, and at this point, the Fei Li Battle Team had rushed out of the room to his back, clearly having heard his previous cry.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er ignored them, continuing: \u201cWe have confirmed reports that it is definitely true. The Bai Da Empire must have planned this for a while, using the Kalise Empire as a springboard, launching their attacks from several directions. Unfortunately, the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s army strength is just too low, and I\u2019m afraid your entire Empire is probably occupied by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regaining some measure of his calmness, Zhou Weiqing said in a trembling voice: \u201cWhat about now? How about the Heavenly Bow City?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Bow Empire was his homeland, and his entire family was there. His parents, godfather, Sis Ru Se, his teachers in the Heavenly Bow Unit\u2026 All his loved ones!</p><br/><p>A sudden war\u2026 a swift and abrupt invasion. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart and mind was utterly confused and disconcerted. At the moment, he wished that he could grow a pair of wings, to fly right back to the Heavenly Bow Empire, to find his father and fight together with him.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said: \u201cThe Bai Da Empire was just too determined and well planned in their execution of the attack. The one who led the attack was the Empire Master of the Bai Da Empire, their top powerhouse, a Heavenly Jewel Master of Heavenly King Stage. With him were six other Upper Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters. By the time the news travelled to us, it has already been around five days from the start of the attack\u2026 and with the massive difference in power\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that even Admiral Zhou will not be able to do anything to save the capital city. By now\u2026 The Heavenly Bow City should be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body swayed, and Lin TianAo who was behind him quickly supported him, if not he would have collapsed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Currently, Zhou Weiqing felt as if his body was feeble and totally devoid of strength, and tears streamed uncontrollably from his eyes. Lin TianAo was supporting him fully, and could sense that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body was trembling violently. His emotions were fluctuating at an insane peak, and even his skin was starting to show the tiger tattoos of his Demonic Change State as he began to lose control.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er took two steps forward towards Zhou Weiqing and said firmly: \u201cThe matter has already happened, and already to an irreversible point. Even if the Fei Li Empire got the news and counterattacked, it is already too late to save your Heavenly Bow Empire. I have not told Bing\u2019er this news yet\u2026 she is at a critical point in her closed door cultivation, and I do not wish for her to be affected adversely by it yet. I hope you understand. This is all I can tell you so far. Father asked me to tell you not to return to the Heavenly Bow Empire now. A mantis cannot stop a chariot[1. Direct translation that should be pretty straightforward to understand], and to attempt to do so would not be wise. You are the last hope of the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

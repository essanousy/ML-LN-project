With his position in the Heavenly Bow Empire, as long he was unwilling, nobody would dare to interrupt him. He did not look for his wives because he could guess that they had private matters to discuss. Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er were unwilling to meet him, as they were still shy. Would there be anyone who would spend the night with him tonight? Zhou Weiqing became even more aroused as he thought about that. He then let out a long sigh into the sky. \u201cI\u2019m lonely, I\u2019m all alone, I\u2019m horny!\u201d</p><br/><p>After venting out his emotions, he closed the door. He had things to do today. He had to consolidate the final piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set. Even though he had Nebula Saint Energy and was extremely familiar with Consolidated Equipment Scrolls, he was still nervous. As a God Tier Master, he knew very well what completing the whole legendary armor set meant. It would multiply the set\u2019s power more than one fold since the Ringless Ground Purging Set that he was wearing was a ten-piece set and it suited his Strength Attribute the best. Once it was completed, the upgrade that he would obtain would be tremendous.</p><br/><p>He had been waiting for this day for many years. Naturally, he had the thought in his mind. If the other Heavenly Jewel Masters were to hear what he said, they might feel like beating him up. It had only been less than 10 years since he started his cultivation. However, Zhou Weiqing was going to obtain the last piece of his legendary armor set soon. One might not dare to say that no one had ever achieved what he achieved, but in the Heavenly Jewel Master world, he was definitely the first one who achieved that.</p><br/><p>He carefully took out the wooden box that contained the last Consolidated Equipment Scroll and placed it on the table. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s facial expression instantly turned serious. He turned around and bowed respectfully in the direction where Junior Master was staying at and then opened the wooden box. The Consolidating Paper for the tenth Consolidated Equipment Scroll was a lot bigger than the normal ones, and the patterns on it were very complicated. Before Zhou Weiqing reached the Heavenly Emperor Tier, he was sure that it would be impossible for him to craft the Consolidated Equipment Scroll even if he used Time and Spatial Energy and the increase in his Saint Energy. The technique that was required could not be completed using outer energy.</p><br/><p>It was all Junior Master\u2019s hard work. Zhou Weiqing held the Consolidated Equipment Scroll in his hand and with a flicker of his thoughts, eleven of his Heavenly Jewels appeared on his wrists. The 11 Physical Jewels filled both of his hands while rich Saint Energy Wave lit up the entire room with a light reddish gold color. Perhaps because the Consolidated Equipment Scroll in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand felt his Saint Energy, it was releasing a dark gold glow. Meanwhile, the nine Physical Jewels that were consolidated into the Ringless Ground Purging Set were emitting a light buzzing sound. It seemed like they were calling out for the arrival of their comrade.</p><br/><p>After taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing took the last step without any hesitation. The eleventh jewel which represented the Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivation base floated out of his body. It floated in the air under the light of the dazzling reddish gold glow. Then, Zhou Weiqing shook his wrist as Divine Light shot out of his eyes. The Consolidated Equipment Scroll turned into a streak of dark gold light and dashed towards the Physical Jewels. Rich Saint Energy waves were boiling intensely in the room. At that moment, it was impossible for anyone to interrupt Zhou Weiqing unless that person had a cultivation base that was higher than his.</p><br/><p>Nobody knew when Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya had appeared at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s door. He had even brought his own stool and had taken a seat at the side. He held a wine bottle in his left hand and was popping peanuts into his mouth with his right hand. He could not be more relaxed. However, if someone was to go near him, they would be taught a lesson from the famous Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation.</p><br/><p>Consolidating Physical Jewels was not difficult for Zhou Weiqing since his cultivation base had long surpassed the First and Second Jewel tiers. He also depended on his multiple attributes as well as the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline ability that helped him complete the consolidation by only using one Consolidated Equipment Scroll.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he was naturally using the Nebula Saint Energy. Saint Energy was also Creation Energy. Although Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was different from the pure energy that was released by the baby in Tian\u2019er\u2019s tummy, it was considered an extremely pure energy in this world. With the help of the Nebula Saint Energy, there was no problem in his consolidation. An hour passed by in the blink of an eye. Long Shiya, who was sitting outside, suddenly stopped drinking and stood up to look into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s room. His tranquil expression disappeared and his eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>As someone who also possessed a Ringless Ground Purging Set, he naturally hoped to see what the completed Ringless Ground Purging Set would look like. At that moment, there were no more energy waves in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s room. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s huge body appeared before Long Shiya\u2019s eyes as the door opened</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher.\u201d Zhou Weiqing obviously knew Long Shiya was out there. He welcomed him with a smile on his face. However, Long Shiya could see that he was suppressing his excitement behind that smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done?\u201d Long Shiya could not wait to ask.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cWhen has your apprentice ever failed? Now I\u2019m anticipating the eleventh Consolidated Equipment Scroll that Junior Master is crafting. Consolidating the tenth one is not difficult for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you die if you don\u2019t boast for once? Quick, show it to me. I want to see what the Ringless Ground Purging Set looks like.\u201d</p><br/><p>The completed legendary armor set was naturally different from those that were incomplete. Besides the physical form that went through a few changes, the original color of the armor set would be shown as well. Just like how the color of Long Shiya\u2019s Ringless Ground Purging Set was silver.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cTeacher, don\u2019t be jealous of me, alright? Watch carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bright, golden light exploded out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body as he spoke. His Consolidated Equipment God Protective Aura had changed from dark gold to bright gold. Then the Ringless Ground Purging\u2019s accessories appeared on his body one by one. Every one of them was the perfect combination of strength and beauty. The dazzling, golden glow shone and covered the majority of the space in the room.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya\u2019s mouth was wide open as he mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s gold in color! Such a showoff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Ringless Ground Purging Set could definitely be described as a showoff. When they appeared on him, the air around him seemed to implode on itself. There was a black glow around his body when he moved. That was the black hole created from the Spatial Rend.</p><br/><p>It was one of the special effects of the completed Ringless Ground Purging Set. How could the attacks from his enemy not be significantly discounted when there was a layer of Spatial Rend that seemed like a black hole around him all the time? Patterns that were not there previously also appeared on the completed Ringless Ground Purging Set. There were patterns of roses on the bright golden armor. Coupled with the different shades and intensity of the color gold, it complemented the legendary armor set, making it even more beautiful.</p><br/><p>It was definitely the most beautiful legendary armor set that Long Shiya had ever seen. Even the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set lost to the beauty of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Ringless Ground Purging Set. What made it seem flashy was the scarlet cloak on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back when the armor set was completed. It seemed like he could not be described as a showoff any longer. No matter where he went, the bright golden armor together with the scarlet cloak would definitely be in the spotlight!</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, don\u2019t you think I\u2019m like a bright sun that shines in the limelight, making all other lights lose their beauty?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked proudly.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya replied in an annoyed manner, \u201cOh, please. What sun are you talking about? You\u2019re such a narcissist.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dual God Strength Hammers in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands had changed as well. The gigantic hammers became two times bigger, and the crying face had turned into a big smiley face. An image of a rose was also imprinted on top of both the hammers. When Long Shiya saw the hammers, he felt embarrassed to bring out his Silver Octagon Plum Blossom Hammer. Compared to the Ringless Ground Purging Set, his hammer was nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe image of the rose must be a symbol of love from the senior who created the Ringless Ground Purging Set for his lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sigh could be heard from Duan Tianlang. Nobody knew when he arrived outside of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s room. As a God Tier Master, how could he not feel the energy wave from the completion of the Ringless Ground Purging Set?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing respectfully gave a bow to Duan Tianlang. \u201cThank you, Junior Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang chuckled and said, \u201cYou look glorious in this Ringless Ground Purging Set. Don\u2019t listen to what your teacher said. I believe you\u2019ll definitely be able to showcase its power perfectly. Wait until we complete the eleventh one. At that point, even the Boundless Infinitum Set will have to step aside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gently swung the hammers in his hands. Suddenly, the surroundings turned dark. It was the scene of Spatial Collapse. After the Ringless Ground Purging Set was completed, the increase in its strength was too terrifying. It was so terrifying that even the space around him could barely handle it. Under such a situation, it would be difficult to fight Zhou Weiqing with brute strength.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya looked at Duan Tianlang sadly. \u201cLao Duan, I\u2019m jealous. Quickly invent the tenth piece of the Hiltless Heavenly Purging Set for me. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang rolled his eyes at him and said, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s that easy? You might as well put me in a coffin. Compared to the Ringless Ground Purging Set, I\u2019m no longer interested in your Hiltless Heavenly Purging Set. Let\u2019s face it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even have any humanity in you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

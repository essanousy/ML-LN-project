However, in the end, he only had this one daughter, and he could not land the final blow.</p><br/><p>As for the Lion Prince, he could only swallow his pride and anger to accept it. For the sake of the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord position, as well as for the fact that he truly liked Tian\u2019er, he could only endure it, telling Xue AoTian that he was still willing to take Tian\u2019er as his bride. Feeling guilty towards him, Xue AoTian ended up doting more on this disciple of his.</p><br/><p>Half a year had already passed, and the engagement ceremony was already complete despite all of Tian\u2019er\u2019s protests. Even when she threatened to take her own life, she was unable to change Xue AoTian\u2019s mind, and he brought his daughter alongside himself. The stubborn Mountain Lord truly believed that time could change everything, and such an outstanding talent like the Lion Prince Gu Yingbing would eventually move his daughter and enter her heart.</p><br/><p>In order to sever Tian\u2019er\u2019s remaining fantasies, Xue AoTian personally set their wedding date, which was three months from the current day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Dragon Silencing Seal from the Demonic Dragon Lady.\u201d Xue AoTian said solemnly as he analyzed the image. \u201c\u2026 Underestimating your enemy is always the worst flaw. Nine-Jewels against Four-Jewels, and he could still be tricked. Batulu, how did you teach your son?\u201d Although he did not release his aura, Xue AoTian\u2019s words caused Batulu to start sweating profusely despite the icy cold temperature.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic Change State\u2026 Dragon Silencing Seal\u2026 And this\u2026 Darkness, Demonic and Lightning Attribute Fusion Skill\u2026 Hmm\u2026 a tri-Attribute Venom made from those energies.\u201d As he spoke to that point, Xue AoTian\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYingBing, arrange for a place for Batulu to get some rest, he can come collect his son in three days time.\u201d The Dark Demon God Lightning might be too much for a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse like Shangguan Longyin to handle, but it was unable to stop the strongest man in the world, who held the Divine Attribute. Of course, Butler had already been suffering from the venom for such a long time, and even for Xue AoTian, it would not be an easy feat to totally remove the poison.</p><br/><p>Batulu felt so lucky, as if he had struck the jackpot. He did not know what to say or do, and could only kneel there kowtowing in gratitude.</p><br/><p>The light image finally disappeared, and Tian\u2019er stood there as if her soul had been drained out of her. The next instant, a brilliant flash shone forth, and both Xue AoTian and Tian\u2019er disappeared. Along with them, the unconscious Butler also disappeared.</p><br/><p>When his Master had finally disappeared, the Lion Prince Gu Yingbing abruptly punched out viciously, his fist stabbing into the empty air, causing a loud explosion. His entire body seemed to be vibrating with sheer rage, his head of golden red hair whipping about in the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, it must be that bastard!\u201d Gu Yingbing felt as if his rage was about to erupt out of his body. Abruptly, he took a step forward, grabbing the Wolf King Batulu and howling angrily: \u201cTell me, where did your son meet this youth? Tell me everything in detail, don\u2019t leave anything out, not even the most insignificant thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Batulu was given a fright by the sudden outburst of the Lion Prince Gu Yingbing, and he dared not delay, hurriedly telling everything he knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhongTian Empire\u2026 Northern borders\u2026 the North West Armies\u2026 Good, very good.\u201d The words were spat out through gritted teeth, grinding so hard that the sound was audible. He felt as if the blood was about the burst out of his body with anger, and his eyes danced with rage and the light of mania, killing intent clear as day in the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Deep in the Heavenly Snow Castle\u2026 a room that was almost sealed airtight with sculpted ice\u2026 the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord appeared with his daughter. As for Butler, he had disappeared to another area.</p><br/><p>Currently, Tian\u2019er\u2019s heart was still shaken. She had not seen Zhou Weiqing for more than half a year, and seeing him so suddenly without warning, how could her heart be at peace? The emotions and feelings she had buried deep within erupted like an active volcano, uncontrollable despite her best efforts. Alas, she could only lower her head in silence, not daring to look at her father.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it him?\u201d Xue AoTian said passively.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er did not reply, biting her lower lip softly. She did not dare make a sound, as fear and dread rose slowly from her heart, sinking deep into the pits of her stomach.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it him?\u201d Xue AoTian\u2019s voice grew sterner.</p><br/><p>With a sudden thud, Tian\u2019er knelt down in front of her father. Tears streaming down her cheeks, she said in a trembling voice: \u201cFather, please, I beg you, let him go. I will marry Bro Gu, I won\u2019t look for him anymore, okay? Please, let him go.\u201d She was clear that if her father wanted to kill someone, no matter even if the person was the leader of a Great Saint Lands, he or she might not be able to escape\u2026 let alone Zhou Weiqing. To be able to find him, that was an easy task for Xue AoTian.</p><br/><p>To her immense surprise, Xue AoTian actually sighed. \u201cGet up, I won\u2019t kill him, and I won\u2019t blame you anymore.\u201d He held her and helped her up, a strange look of being deep in thought on his face.</p><br/><p>A flick of his fingers, and the tears on his daughter\u2019s face disappeared. \u201cSilly girl, why did you not tell me about him? If I knew that was so\u2026 father would not be so strict with you. Indeed, this cannot be blamed on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh?\u201d By now, Tian\u2019er was totally confused, not knowing what her father was speaking about. She could only stare in surprise at Xue AoTian, whose face had a hint of regret and apology.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian said: \u201cNo wonder you would be so attracted to him, that is not your fault, but it is a certainty due to the Attributes he has. Who would think\u2026 that someone like that would actually exist in this world\u2026 to have both the Demonic Attribute and Time Attribute at the same time! More so, his Demonic Attribute looks to be of the purest kind, a first generation who Awakened it. Both you and he have two Saint Attributes, added to the fact that his Demonic Change State is also of a tiger bloodline\u2026 naturally he would hold a great attraction to you. Being together with him\u2026 that should have a strong benefit to your cultivation right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er nodded subconsciously. Naturally, she remembered how they had met in the first place, and she had known about the Saint Attributes being a benefit to her cultivation. It had been that strange aura that had drawn her to him in the first place, and being together with him all that time had indeed sped up her cultivation greatly. She had even originally thought about staying with him all the way until she broke through the Heavenly King Stage to make full use of him.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian sighed once more. \u201cWhat a shame\u2026 if I had met him ten years earlier\u2026 perhaps I would not have opposed you marrying him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er stared at her father with her jaw agape. She had never imagined that her father would actually show such a sudden change after watching Zhou Weiqing\u2019s fight in the image.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d Xue AoTian thought for a moment before asking.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er said: \u201cSeventeen years old\u2026 not even eighteen I think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another look of shock appeared on Xue AoTian\u2019s face, and he exclaimed: \u201cSeventeen years old only\u2026\u201d His brow furrowed deeply, as if he had met with a problem he could not solve.</p><br/><p>Light flashed in his eyes, but no one could tell what he was thinking about.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er did not hold any hope about the sudden change in her father\u2019s attitude. In all her memory, as long as her father had made a decision, it could never be changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, you really won\u2019t kill him?\u201d Tian\u2019er asked tentatively once more.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian nodded and said: \u201cThis could be a chance, a turning point, for our Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2026 for you. If you had told me about him earlier, perhaps there might still have been a chance to deal with things between you and Yingbing, to turn things around. Alas, it is too late, you have already gone through the engagement ceremony. Things are troublesome then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn things around?\u201d As soon as she heard that, Tian\u2019er felt joy overwhelm her, and she asked excitedly.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian continued: \u201cHe has the Demonic and Time Attributes, and you have the Divine and Spirit Attributes. The four Saint Attributes, when gathered together and cultivating, both of you would have an extremely high chance of breaking through the Heavenly King Stage before the age of thirty. If that was so, you two might actually reach the Heavenly God Stage in the future, perhaps even breaking through together\u2026 and more importantly, have the chance to break through to a stage that I have never reached and beyond.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you had told me details about him earlier and brought him back, perhaps I could have taken him as disciple and maybe even allow you two to be together. Although our Heavenly Snow Mountain rules disallow passing on the position of Lord to females, but if you can truly raise to the cultivation level of Heavenly God Tier and beyond, who would dare speak otherwise, not even the other powerful Tribes of the WanShou Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er was stunned, totally stunned. She had never in her wildest dreams imagine that her father would speak of such to her. Clearly, in her father\u2019s eyes, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s talent was truly important, perhaps even causing him to regret making the deal between the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger Tribe and Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion Tribe.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, let me go look for him now and bring him back, okay?\u201d Tian\u2019er said urgently.</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian shook his head sternly and said: \u201cNo, it is too late for that. One cannot go back on their word. You have already been betrothed to Yingbing, and you will be married to him soon. Although that little boyfriend of yours is extremely talented, but he is still after all just one person. Unless he has sufficient powers behind him that can awe the lions, and after that, able to snatch you away from Yingbing in a fair fight\u2026 otherwise, even I cannot change such a decision that has already been made.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hope that had just risen up in Tian\u2019er\u2019s heart was once again cruelly dashed, her heart turning ice cold in despair. What force or influence did Zhou Weiqing have behind him? Even if he had some connection with the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, it was not enough for them to support him in such a matter. Let alone the fact that the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace were mortal enemies with the Heavenly Snow Mountain, whether or not their aid would be of any help in such a matter\u2026 just the fact that his connection was through his relationship with Shangguan Bing\u2019er, how could that possibly be of use? How could the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace possibly help him come seek her hand in marriage?</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian sighed and said: \u201cAlright, enough, don\u2019t think so much about this. Go back and prepare to be a bride\u2026 Yingbing truly likes you alot, no matter what you had done previously, he still does not reject you. Such a husband, what do you have to be dissatisfied with? Go then, Father needs to cultivate now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tian\u2019er left, she had resumed her previous zombie-like semblance, causing Xue AoTian to furrow his brow in worry. Despite his adamant stance, he did love his daughter very much. At the same time, in his heart, he started to feel curious about Zhou Weiqing, wanting to have a look at this youth who had stolen his daughter\u2019s heart so strongly, to attract her so much.</p><br/><p>Should I arrange things in secret? What a troublesome mess.</p><br/><p>At this point, it was extremely rare, nearly impossible to find something to cause trouble to the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord. Yet, such a thing had just appeared right now. With his status, how could he possibly allow his daughter to secretly cultivate together with Zhou Weiqing. Yet, the two Saint Attributes that Zhou Weiqing had caused even Xue AoTian\u2019s heart to itch on his daughter\u2019s behalf. This was an unbelievable opportunity after all. The Thirteenth Heavenly Jewel. What would that be like? The legendary Heavenly Jewel Change Stage!</p>\n</div>"}

Regardless of the age of the young man before them, everything he had done was enough to prove that he deserved the trust of the Dragon Emperor.</p><br/><p>When he was faced with a crisis of life and death, he did not choose to retreat. Instead, he persevered in confronting the potentially deadly attack. Even his face did not betray any changes. The Divine Beasts were originally very disdainful of human beings. In their opinions, entities like the Nether Lord would never have existed had it not been for the many negative emotions that humans produced. However, at that moment, they only had respect for Zhou Weiqing. In their eyes, the status of humans had already changed. Among humans, there were also heroes!</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing had flung Tian\u2019er\u2019s body out, he did not see the halo of platinum Saint Energy wrapped around his waist. The other end of that Saint Energy was in Tian\u2019er\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>While the black vortex was engulfing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, Tian\u2019er was using all her strength to pull on the rope of condensed Saint Energy. Although she could not pull away from the core of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s magic formation, she could rely on the inverse force to send herself back.</p><br/><p>The formidable power of the Destruction Energy vortex could only be described as horrible. The Nether Lord\u2019s terrifying and explosive energy collided with the spiraling Saint Energy that surrounded Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. This generated a strong energy impact, and the energies from both parties were drastically consumed. However, the Destruction Energy was too pure. Thus, within a short period of time, it had unexpectedly broken through the Saint Energy that was successfully condensed by the Twelve Great Divine Beasts.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Saint Energy from Zhou Weiqing and the Twelve Great Divine Beasts was not so easily countered. The black vortex had also shrunk at an alarming rate.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s facial expression remained the same. He knew very well that even if that Destruction Energy had strongly affected his body, it still would not be able to kill him. With the weakened Saint Energy, the strength of his own defensive power and the protection from his Heavenly Saint Nucleus Core, he would at most suffer a serious injury. However, the Nether Lord would surely be sealed. The moment before the destruction vortex appeared, he had already used powerful Divine Thought to send out Saint Energy to complete the entire seal. Although that led to insufficient self-defense, the seal was bound to be completed.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face changed in the next moment. Once again, Tian\u2019er\u2019s delicate body embraced his body from behind. A dense Saint Energy burst out from Tian\u2019er\u2019s body and protected both of them. It was also at this time that the black vortex had broken through the Saint Energy and engulfed both Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>The reason Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face changed was due to Tian\u2019er and also because of the peculiar changes in the Destruction Energy. Although it momentarily cut off the connection between Zhou Weiqing and the Twelve Great Divine Beasts, it did not directly attack Zhou Weiqing. As a result, the Destruction Energy only engulfed Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er. At that moment, a huge force that was pulling at them burst out. The cluster of Destruction Energy retreated instead of advancing, turning into a stream of black light before it instantly drilled back through the final of the tiny cracks of the Netherworld seal\u2019s magic formation.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>A divine light flashed and a platinum light rose instantly. It transformed into a giant pillar of light, exploding along the meandering passages before it spread out.</p><br/><p>The entire seal of the magic formation was finally completed. The seal continued to strengthen while the Saint Energy slowly accumulated after that dramatic rise.</p><br/><p>The sealed realm was filled with soft energy fluctuations. Unlike the seal originally created by the Dragon Emperor, the seal\u2019s realm at this time truly resembled a separate world. In the sky, countless stars sparkled. Under the feet, the earth emitted a milky white light. The Nether Lord was no longer visible. He had been completely sealed in the Netherworld seal\u2019s magic formation.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing, the person that had accomplished all of this, had disappeared. He and Tian\u2019er had vanished at the last moment when the Destruction Energy had swept everything away.</p><br/><p>The radiance from the Saint Energy gradually dissipated from the bodies of the Divine Beasts. When they looked at the perfect seal, the mood of each of the Divine Beasts was heavy. No matter what was said, they were still unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing\u2026\u201d The Elven Queen suddenly flashed and appeared at the place where Zhou Weiqing was at before he disappeared. She stood there in a complete daze. In order to complete the seal, Zhou Weiqing did not take precaution or evade the final attack from the Nether Lord and was forcibly brought to the Netherworld. That was the domain of the Nether Lord. Even if the Nether Lord had expanded a lot of energy previously, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er would not be his match!</p><br/><p>Two figures descended from the sky. It was Hui Yao and Duo Si who had transformed into their human forms as they landed on the ground. Duo Si could not help but rush into the arms of Hui Yao. However, Hui Yao\u2019s face looked extremely unsightly.</p><br/><p>All the Divine Beasts had descended as well. At this time, Phelia, the Entropic Nether Tiger had also rushed in from the outer circle. However, try as she may, she could not cry out.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er had disappeared, and the shock she received was equally great. She had already felt extremely guilty towards Tian\u2019er. Moreover, she had just witnessed the moment her daughter disappeared right before her. Her terrible state of mind could only be imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hero.\u201d The Dragon Turtle\u2019s voice sounded. \u201cHe\u2019s similar to His Majesty, the Dragon Emperor. They\u2019re all heroes who have saved our world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen stood there blankly, \u201cBut why must heroes die? I brought them here but I can\u2019t bring them back. How can I explain this to their soulmates? How can I explain this to the people outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a hint of grief on her face. The Elven Queen sat down cross-legged where she was and murmured to herself, \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m thinking too much. Our lives are intertwined. If he\u2019s dead, I certainly won\u2019t be able to continue living. Let me accompany him here and wait for the moment of death with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, the Empress. You should not be too pessimistic.\u201d The Dragon Turtle\u2019s deep voice sounded again. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that Zhou Weiqing might come back alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen stared blankly for a while. \u201cWhat did you say? That he might come back alive? He was taken away by the Nether Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dragon Turtle spoke in a deep voice, \u201cHowever, our seal has also been completed. Previously, when the Nether Lord attacked to destroy the seal, he had been using his Destruction Energy. Moreover, he was also attacked by His Majesty the Dragon Emperor and you. In addition, he paid the price for the final self-detonation of his powerful pair of claws in order to capture Zhou Weiqing and his partner. His own cultivation base had also been greatly weakened. Although he\u2019s very strong in the Netherworld, it will no longer receive any external negative emotions to re-energize itself since we\u2019ve already completed the seal. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s and Tian\u2019er cultivation bases are not weak. Under such circumstances, there\u2019s still a fighting chance. I just find it strange that the Nether Lord chose to take them away instead of attacking them.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to the Dragon Turtle, there were some changes in the faces of the Elven Queen and the other Divine Beasts nearby. The original somber atmosphere had slightly lightened. He was right. Previously, they had joined forces with Zhou Weiqing. In addition, the Nether Lord had to deal with the power of the magic formation. In other words, the present Nether Lord\u2019s strength was by no means at its peak. Under such circumstances, Zhou Weiqing might still have a chance.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen nodded slowly. \u201cI hope so. As long as I\u2019m still alive, it\u2019ll prove that Weiqing has not died. However, even if he defeats the Nether Lord, how is he going to break the seal that even the Nether Lord could not break through?\u201d</p><br/><p>Phelia, the Entropic Nether Tiger began to understand once she heard the Dragon Turtle\u2019s words. \u201cHer Majesty, the Empress, you don\u2019t need to worry about this. Since our seal is called the Netherworld seal, it\u2019s only effective against the Nether Lord\u2019s Destruction Energy. As long as Weiqing and Tian\u2019er can defeat the Nether Lord, they can use their own Saint Energy to return through the seal without the restriction from the Destruction Energy. God, bless the children!.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Phelia spoke, she slowly knelt on the seal and silently prayed.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao patted Duo Si who was trembling with grief. \u201cLet\u2019s go out first. The people outside are waiting anxiously. We must at least inform them about what happened here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two enormous dragons simultaneously rose and flew out of the abyss.</p><br/><p>It was dark. An endless darkness.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er were swept up by Destruction Energy, they could only feel an endless darkness. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Divine Thought was connected to the Twelve Great Divine Beasts. Due to that reason, they were already strong enough to reach the Heavenly Change Tier. Although they were forcibly disconnected by Destruction Energy, he could still perceive what was happening at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m finished.\u2019 That was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s last thought before he broke away from the seal and entered the crack. He never imagined that the Nether Lord would come up with such a method. Instead of attacking him directly, he used the power of self-destruction to pull him and Tian\u2019er along into the Netherworld.</p><br/><p>The powerful and unstable Destruction Energy fluctuated constantly. It moved around Tian\u2019er and himself, and everything around them became unreal. The distorted and illusory energy fluctuations continuously crushed them. Zhou Weiqing could only use his Saint Energy to protect himself and Tian\u2019er from getting eroded by the Destructive Energy.</p><br/><p>The only thing he was glad about was while he had been mobilizing the Saint Energy from the Twelve Great Divine Beasts previously, his and Tian\u2019er\u2019s cultivation base had reached its peak. However, even if their cultivation base was at its peak, could they overcome the Nether Lord?</p><br/><p>His body suddenly felt lighter. The surrounding Destruction Energy seemed to have collapsed. Although it still existed, it was no longer as dense and pure as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, why did you follow me?\u201d Zhou Weiqing pulled Tian\u2019er from behind him by her little hand. For a moment, all sorts of feelings welled up in his heart.</p><br/><p>The seal was completed but he and Tian\u2019er were caught in the Netherworld. At that moment, Zhou Weiqing could only feel the impending death looming ahead of them.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er looked at Zhou Weiqing. She did not seem to care about anything from the outside world. \u201cFool, how can I let the father of my child die on his own? Whatever happens, I want to be with you. Don\u2019t even think of getting rid of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing clenched Tian\u2019er\u2019s hand tightly. He did not blame her anymore. Things had already come to this. There was no point in him saying more.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery touching, isn\u2019t it? Is this what you humans call love?\u201d A neutral voice came from all directions.</p><br/><p>The originally dark space suddenly lighted up.</p><br/><p>A light came from the front. It was a faint green glow that easily brought fear into people\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>A huge body emerged from the green light; it was a huge crab. The width of its body was about a kilometer wide. As its eight long legs spread open, a closer look revealed that there were innumerable patterns on its body, and those patterns were like human faces. Each face had a different emotion. There was anger, panic, and resentment. Each one was different but all of them were strong negative emotions.</p><br/><p>Two huge eyes were located at the top of the body, looking like two small, remote green suns that were sparkling. Not far from both eyes, there were gaps in the huge body that was positioned at the front of the crab. It was apparent that these from the earlier detonation on its body.</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord. Zhou Weiqing finally saw the body of the Nether Lord. The big guy in front of him had already achieved the Heavenly Change Tier. Furthermore, it possessed the Destruction Energy from the Heavenly Change Tier. It was the polar opposite of his Creation Energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look really disgusting.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said in disdain.</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord was not angered by his words. \u201cYou\u2019re already in my world and yet, you\u2019re still so disparaging. What\u2019s the point? I did not expect that my plan would be destroyed by such a puny human like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sneered, \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll have good words for you even if I don\u2019t berate you? Will you let me go then?</p><br/><p>The enchanting voice of the Nether Lord charmingly said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t I let you go? If you allow me to imprint a destruction mark in your soul and help me break through the seal, I\u2019ll not only let you go, I\u2019ll also let you return to your human world. You can also become my spokesperson in the human world. I can even promise you that I\u2019ll set aside a piece of land for you and let you live happily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing burst out in loud laughter, \u201cHahahahaha. Nether Lord, are you trying to trick a three-year-old child? We only just sealed you up with great difficulty, and you actually expect me to release you? Moreover, do you think your destruction mark can be imprinted on my soul? My body is almost completely made up of Saint Energy. You shouldn\u2019t daydream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, the only outcome is destruction.\u201d The voice of the Nether Lord suddenly turned cold. An awe-inspiring killing intent burst out without any reservation, and like a raging wave, it ferociously smashed into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s and Tian\u2019er\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The dense platinum Saint Energy radiated from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. It shrouded him and Tian\u2019er inside. In any case, he had previously experienced the mystery of the Heavenly Change Tier. Coupled with the integration of the Dragon Emperor energy, his cultivation base had progressed another step although he could not become a Creation God.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on then. Let\u2019s see whether I can cut off some of your crab legs before you kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord did not seem to be in a hurry to act against Zhou Weiqing. His huge dark green eyes flashed with a strange brilliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, you must have found it very strange that I brought you here instead of using the final moment during my self-detonation to launch an attack on you. I paid such a heavy price for self-detonating only to invite you to the Netherworld, don\u2019t you feel puzzled?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart was moved. \u201cWhat? Do you want to dispel my doubts?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord issued a series of wicked laughter. \u201cWhy not? Do you think that the Netherworld seal that was built from your Saint Energy can completely seal me inside and that I\u2019ll never get out again? Even to the extent that I\u2019ll no longer be able to have any connection to the outside world?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, the killing intent that erupted earlier slowly dissipated.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing remained calm and collected, \u201cIsn\u2019t that so? Nether Lord, it\u2019s useless for you to play these tricks on me. Whatever it is, I\u2019ll not be deceived by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord snorted in disdain, \u201cTricks? Do I need to play any tricks on you? Your lives are in my hands. I just want you to die contentedly. Let me tell you honestly. Yes, with you as the leader and Saint Energy as the core instead of the original Dragon Emperor power, the Netherworld seal is completed. I can no longer break through. I\u2019m also incapable of connecting with the outside world through the cracks to strengthen myself. This time, I\u2019ve suffered an unprecedented trauma and do not even have the ability to break through the seal again. My cultivation base also suffered severe damage and I lost my claws. Coupled with the depletion of the original source of destruction, I\u2019m no longer even a being at the Heavenly Change Tier. I have regressed to a level that\u2019s only a little more powerful than Fen Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s eyes could not help but betray a hint of happiness when she heard the Nether Lord\u2019s words. However, in contrast to her, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes immediately looked somber.</p><br/><p>The self-detonation was short-lived. What did that mean? That meant that although the cultivation base of the Nether Lord had been weakened, he was absolutely certain he would be able to deal with the both of them. That was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first thought. Moreover, the Nether Lord did not influence them to break the seal. Instead, he gave them an account of his own circumstances. His mood was still so calm. Could it mean that he still had a way to deal with the seal? Is he going to make use of him and Tian\u2019er?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had been learning from Mu En since his childhood. He was much better at understanding human nature and words than Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the Nether Lord faintly sighed, \u201cI absolutely did not anticipate that I\u2019ll be forced into such a situation. However, I still have a slight chance and it\u2019s created by myself. I\u2019m not afraid to tell you that when I finally blew up my front claws if you had slightly let go of the formation, there\u2019s a possibility that I could\u2019ve rushed out. Even if I just ran partially out of Divine Thought, as long as I secretly cultivate and continuously absorb the grievances and negative emotions in your human world, I\u2019ll be able to restore my strength to its previous level sooner or later. Regrettably, you stopped me, to the extent of not caring about your own safety. However, would I allow you to seal me? Zhou Weiqing, you forgot one of the most important things. Although the Netherworld seal\u2019s magic formation is powerful, it needs a continuous energy injection. The Saint Energy injected this time is large enough to maintain the seal for at least ten years or more. However, what will happen after ten years? Don\u2019t tell me in your human world, there are still people like you who possessed such pure Saint Energy and can also use the energy of the Dragon Emperor as a guide? Hahahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon listening to what the Nether Lord said, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face finally changed. He already understood what the Nether Lord was trying to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, I was already desperate when you sent this girl out. After all, she has the same pure Saint Energy as you. Replenishing the formation with Saint Energy is still possible with the support from the Elven Queen and the new Dragon Emperor. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t bear to part with you so she followed you in here. Even the heavens helped me. I just need to kill the both of you here and quietly wait until the Saint Energy that supports the formation to deplete. Although it\u2019s impossible for me to break through the formation with my current cultivation base, at least I can secretly open up a small crack and once again absorb the grievances and negative emotions from the human world to replenish myself. In less than a few decades, I\u2019ll have the ability to once again attack the Netherworld seal\u2019s magic formation. At that time, I\u2019d like to see who else in your human world can stop my coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s facial expression was unsightly. Tian\u2019er was in a daze beside him. She never expected that because of her love for Zhou Weiqing, she had given the Nether Lord an opportunity that he could exploit.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, ignore his words. He\u2019s trying to divide us. If I\u2019m not mistaken, he\u2019s not absolutely certain that he can kill us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cold voice which rang in the air sounded very clear to Tian\u2019er and himself. Tian\u2019er herself possessed the Divine and Spirit Attributes. They were later transformed into the Saint Attribute. Her Divine Thought was much stronger than others of the same level. Although it was not as strong as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, after receiving this hint from him, she suddenly felt her mind becoming clear, and the negative emotions that had just emerged suddenly disappeared. Her eyes once again regained a clear and determined look.</p><br/><p>The voice of the Nether Lord came to an abrupt end. \u201cWhat did you say? I can\u2019t kill you?\u201d The Nether Lord screamed as if it had heard something ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded without hesitation and said, \u201cCorrect. You\u2019re uncertain if you can kill us. Am I right? Nether Lord, you\u2019re really devious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think everything I said was lies? Do I need to lie to a junior like you?\u201d The Nether Lord was obviously a little angry.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said, \u201cNo, you were not lying. On the contrary, you were telling the truth. That way, you\u2019ll be able to properly confuse us. You needed to use this counter-argument to divide me and Tian\u2019er, and at the same time, cause our remorse to give rise to negative feelings. Yes, there\u2019s no way you can receive Destruction Energy that\u2019s transformed from negative emotions from outside. However, you can still absorb our negative energy to replenish yourself. Both Tian\u2019er and I are at Heavenly God Tier, and our negative emotional energy is much stronger than that of ordinary humans. If everything you said is true, you could\u2019ve just killed us the instant we arrived. Everything will then go according to your plan. Why are you wasting so much time arguing with us? The only explanation is that you\u2019re seriously injured, and you\u2019re not absolutely certain you can kill us. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord quieted down, and the two eyes on top of his head moved slightly. The dense Destruction Energy suddenly converged into his body. His voice also subsequently calmed down a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019ll never be able to compare with you humans in terms of treachery. Zhou Weiqing, you win again. However, there\u2019s a flaw in your reasoning that\u2019s not entirely true. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not certain if I can kill you. I\u2019m just not certain I can kill you without having to pay a heavy price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sealed in this terrible place for far too long, and I do not wish to wait in this pitch-black realm for even another minute. I have to admit that your cultivation base has already reached a level high enough to threaten me. I don\u2019t currently have the power of the Heavenly Change Tier. However, it\u2019s not a difficult task if I want to kill you. At most, I\u2019ll need to sleep in this world for another hundred years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sneered, \u201cA hundred years? I am afraid it\u2019s more than that. If your consumption of energy is too high, how can you create a crack in the Netherworld\u2019s seal and quietly absorb the negative energy from outside? If you can\u2019t even do this, then you can only destroy yourself here. This is what you\u2019re worried about, and this is why you don\u2019t dare to use all your energy to attack us. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You bastard!\u201d The Nether Lord was furious. He never expected to be far inferior to Zhou Weiqing when it came to a comparison of treachery or perhaps, wisdom. He had already concealed matters very well but everything was still discerned by Zhou Weiqing. At that time, he had no other choice.</p><br/><p>A twisting fluctuation of the dark Destruction Energy appeared on the huge body of the Nether Lord. It could clearly be seen as his whole body began to twist violently.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing floated there motionlessly. All the starlight from the Ringless Ground Purging Set on his body subsequently lit up. Under that magnificent state, the dragon-shaped shadows also pulsated and continuously revolved around his body.</p><br/><p>A faint light circulated in the air. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes were continuously focused on the Nether Lord and did not relax. His other hand firmly gripped on to Tian\u2019er\u2019s hand and both their Saint Energies continued to be connected.</p><br/><p>The Netherworld was the Nether Lord\u2019s domain after all. It could be said that it was his Divine Territory. Zhou Weiqing feared that once he was not in contact with Tian\u2019er, they would be separated and annihilated by the Nether Lord.</p><br/><p>The black light gradually dwindled. Suddenly, the Nether Lord\u2019s body actually became incorporeal. While his body was shifting to an incorporeal state, it shrank rapidly and everything seemed rather unreal.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing pulled Tian\u2019er with his left hand, and the Dual God Strength Hammers in his right hand moved forward a little. A beam of platinum light shot out towards the Nether Lord.</p><br/><p>With a light bang, the Netherworld trembled slightly. Subsequently, the platinum light disappeared into thin air. Not to mention that it did not hit the body of the Nether Lord, it did not even manage to reach a distance of twenty meters when it was shot out.</p><br/><p>The distorted radiance gradually diminished. The body of the huge crab in mid-air disappeared. A figure about the same height as Zhou Weiqing appeared in the spot where the body of the Nether Lord was previously located.</p><br/><p>It turned out to be a human silhouette. It was approximately two meters tall with wide shoulders. The entire body was dressed in a dark green armor. The back was like Fen Tian but it had eight long legs spread out like wings. The handsome face was grim and cold, his serene, glittering green eyes firmly trained on Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>His body armor did not include a helmet and he had a huge, bald head. However, the dark green light in his eyes was too strong. The Destruction Energy around his body was extremely viscous. Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel that that human-like body was completely condensed from the Destruction Origin Energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange that I chose to use a human form to end this last battle with you? This is because I think a human form is the most suitable for fighting. Now\u2026 Both of you, die!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the Nether Lord said that, he made the first move. His body flashed slightly and the entire Netherworld suddenly turned into a serene green color. His body also vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>\u2018Here it comes.\u2019 Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart tightened. He did not hesitate to brandish the Dual God Strength Hammers in his hands. He did not target anything specifically with the Hammers. Instead, he attacked the air within the Netherworld.</p><br/><p>With a loud rumbling sound, the Netherworld shook violently. Zhou Weiqing and the Dual God Strength Hammers in his hands exuded a strong, distorted platinum light beam.</p><br/><p>In the Netherworld that was filled with Destruction Energy, he forcibly created a black hole that was three meters wide with his attack. Due to the appearance of the small black hole, the entire Netherworld went through a rapid spatial transformation.</p><br/><p>Do not underestimate Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hammer attack. On top of his invincibility, it had properties from the Spatial Law and the Time Law. Even the Nether Lord had to merge terrifying amounts of power to achieve that effect.</p><br/><p>Bzzt!</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord\u2019s body appeared on the right side of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s and Tian\u2019er\u2019s back. He was less than ten meters away from Zhou Weiqing. If Zhou Weiqing\u2019s action was a little slower, the attack from the Nether Lord would have struck him.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes had also brightened up. A dazzling platinum light sparkled in his eyes. The frightening energy fluctuated and exuded a tyrannical aura. He did not look back as he kicked his right leg backward. He carried the distorted platinum light and charged towards the direction of the Nether Lord.</p><br/><p>When he kicked his right foot out, a dense mass of incandescent luster burst out of his right foot before it turned into a condensed light with an electrical charge.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing pulled Tian\u2019er\u2019s delicate body and flung her outward.</p><br/><p>Both of them had cultivated together for such a long time that they could read each other\u2019s mind and there was no need for Zhou Weiqing to say anything. Tian\u2019er knew what she was supposed to do as a chain of Saint Energy encircled Zhou Weiqing\u2019s waist and connected the two bodies. Immediately after that, she flew tens of meters away. That was the only way she would not hinder Zhou Weiqing in his melee combat.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing kicked out his right foot, his body turned and the Dual God Strength Hammers that carried with it a terrifying force smashed directly towards the Nether Lord.</p><br/><p>When the Nether Lord saw the incandescent light ball that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right foot kicked out, he was taken aback. He did not expect Zhou Weiqing, even without the help from the Divine Beasts, to actually still be able to release such a pure form of Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>What the Nether Lord did not know was that while maintaining the formation previously, Zhou Weiqing had attained a completely new understanding of Saint Energy. Although he no longer had help from the Divine Beasts, he was still able to purify Saint Energy with the integration of the Saint Energy from both him and Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing had already completely disregarded life and death. The moment he arrived at the Netherworld, he did not keep any thoughts about getting out alive in his mind. What he wanted to do now was to weaken the Nether Lord as much as possible, inflicting a serious amount of damage to him to an extent that he would never recover. This would be the only way the seal that he initiated would not be wasted. Although Zhou Weiqing also believed that the scenarios mentioned by the Nether Lord were possible, the powerhouses led by the Elven Queen would also find ways to continue maintaining the formation. There was no pure Saint Energy but a semi-pure form of Saint Energy still existed. The cultivation base of the Nether Lord had been weakened to a certain degree and to a certain extent, it could not be restored. It would be easier said than done for him to break through the seal. In the battle between him and the Nether Lord, each time the Destruction Energy from the Nether Lord was depleted, he would be one step nearer to being destroyed.</p><br/><p>How could Zhou Weiqing have any hint of cowardice when confronting the Nether Lord after he made such a decision?</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord did not have any weapons in his hands. Seeing the ball of incandescent light that was sent in his way, his right hand flashed out like lightning, and he actually caught the ball.</p><br/><p>The ball of incandescent light was actually extinguished by the Nether Lord accompanied by a hiss. However, at the very instant when the ball of light burst, an explosive roar sounded from the Nether Lord\u2019s hand. It actually exploded and it shook his body.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hammers reached him. The eight long legs at the back of the Nether Lord moved forward to block and at the same time collided with the massive hammerheads. A ding was heard along with the terrifying energy fluctuations that burst out at that moment. Zhou Weiqing was surprised to find that he actually felt like he was unable to deploy his powers. The power of the Nether Lord was applied in all eight directions. The tyrannical power of destruction was like eight sharp needles piercing into his Dual God Strength Hammers. This immediately dissolved most of the strength with a soft bang. Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to retreat more than ten meters away.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a layer of warped light appeared before Zhou Weiqing. It blocked the eight beams of Destruction Energy shot out by the eight long legs. Wherever the Destruction Energy made contact with this warped light, it would immediately disperse. None could fall on Zhou Weiqing. This was, indeed, the Time Disorder skill.</p><br/><p>Earlier, when the Nether Lord was attacked, Zhou Weiqing had kicked a ball of light that had the Dark Demon God Lightning\u2019s version of Saint Energy. It was equivalent to combining three types of energy before it was detonated. Even the Nether Lord was tricked and suffered some damage.</p><br/><p>The brief clash and contact gave Zhou Weiqing a chill in his heart. The cultivation base that the Netherworld Lord revealed was much stronger than Fen Tian at his peak. Although it was not at the Heavenly Change Tier, the purity of the Destruction Origin Energy had far exceeded his own Saint Energy. It was almost impossible to defeat him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Just like that, he held onto her, unable to speak for quite some time.</p><br/><p>Still holding on tight onto Shangguan Bing\u2019er, Zhou Weiqing slowly lay back down onto the bed, but he did not have any other actions, just holding her tightly like that as they lay down.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er gently stroked his back. \u201cLittle Fatty, love me, okay?\u201d As she spoke those words, her beautiful face turned a shy red.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily, lifting his head to look at her. However, he shook his head, gently kissing her luscious red lips as he said: \u201cBing\u2019er, I just want to hold you like this. I do not want you to think that my love for you, my feelings for you is just because of lust.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er smiled and said: \u201cSilly, how could I think that\u2026 do I still not know you well enough? I want it, I also miss you and want you, I like the feeling when you possess me. Three years\u2026 we have been apart for three years, and I also really want to feel like your woman again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luscious red lips moved forward of their own accord as she kissed him, and the love between the two burst forth like a volcano erupting.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Dawn.</p><br/><p>The various members of the top four battle teams gathered early, led by the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace guides to the cloudy entrance area. The Heavenly Jewel Tournament was about to begin, and all of the battle team members were fully prepared</p><br/><p>Relatively speaking, both the WanShou Battle Team and the Battle Team from the HuaLuo Empire which had entered the top four for the first time in history were slightly more nervous. On the other hand, the leading Shangguan Sister seemed to be in an absent minded trance, not really paying attention to things around her. On the other side, the Heavenly Bow Battle Team was actually being led by Tian\u2019er instead, and there was no sign of Zhou Weiqing at all. However, Tian\u2019er\u2019s expression was calm and relaxed, with no sign of being nervous that he was missing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did that rascal Weiqing run off to?\u201d Yun Li asked curiously. Compared to the others, today he was in extremely great spirits; clearly things had gone well for him. Yesterday, he had not only succeeded in meeting Little Miss Muddle\u2019s Master, he had even gained the approval of the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. The relationship between him and Little Miss Muddle was pretty much settled, and Master Xing Tianyi had even agreed that when they left, Little Miss Muddle could go with them. As \u2018bride price\u2019, Yun Li had even gifted three pieces of his God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll Legendary Set designs to Master Xing Tianyi.</p><br/><p>Of course, due to the secrets and legacy of his own clan teachings, he naturally could not hand over the entire Legendary Set designs, but even gaining three pieces was already a great benefit to the three God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Of course, in return as a betrothal gift, Master Xing Tianyi decided to personally create the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls of those three designs and gift them to Yun Li. With those three Legendary Set pieces, Yun Li\u2019s power would definitely have a massive leap and improvement; how could he not be overjoyed about it? Furthermore, Master Xing Tianyi had also promised that when the Heavenly Jewel Tournament was over, the three God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master would personally guide him for a short period of time in terms of Consolidating Equipment Scroll creation. With such an opportunity, it was highly likely that in the near future, Yun Li could possibly ascend to one of the young generation God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters.</p><br/><p>Hearing Yun Li\u2019s words, Tian\u2019er smiled faintly and said: \u201cThat fellow is probably still immersed in the warmth of love. However, he should be rushing here soon.\u201d Although her words held a hint of sour tones, she had already been fully prepared in her heart, and her emotions were not influenced at all.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, two figures appeared side by side. When the four Battle Team members saw clearly the swiftly approaching pair, their eyes couldn\u2019t help but widen in surprise.</p><br/><p>Ma Qun swallowed hard on his saliva, muttering to himself: \u201cThis is the true state of attainment\u2026 we all came from the inn, but Boss actually came directly from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. This\u2026 this is true difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, the rapidly approaching pair was Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er, holding hands and walking in such an intimate fashion that even a fool could tell that their relationship was definitely extraordinary.</p><br/><p>The WanShou Battle Team and the HuaLuo Battle Team members were especially surprised. Let alone the fact that Zhou Weiqing could actually come out from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, just the girl whose hands he was holding\u2026 that already drew all the eyeballs of the two teams.</p><br/><p>Features that were exactly the same as the two Shangguan Sisters that were the Leader and Vice Leader of the ZhongTian Battle Team. What was going on?!</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Bing\u2019er had appeared on the previous Heavenly Jewel Tournament, at that time the two Shangguan Sisters had not shown themselves. In truth, there were extremely few people who knew that the Shangguan Sisters were triplets. Currently, looking at her for the first time, especially since she was holding hands so intimately with Zhou Weiqing, how could they not be surprised?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s skin had always been extremely thick, and even as he was the center of so much attention, he did not feel anything; instead showing a smug look, and anyone could see the pride in his face.</p><br/><p>In a flash, Shangguan Fei\u2019er appeared in front of them, snatching Shangguan Bing\u2019er from Zhou Weiqing. \u201cHmph!\u201d She glared at Zhou Weiqing before pulling Bing\u2019er back to the ZhongTian Battle Team.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, you are too good! Towards such a playboy like that rascal, you should teach him a lesson!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er laughed out loud, but she allowed Shangguan Fei\u2019er to pull her without saying a word. However, her eyes never left Zhou Weiqing\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing also returned to his own Battle Team, standing beside Tian\u2019er. However, in the next instant, the smile on his face froze. Sneaking in from a position no one else could notice, a small white hand was now pinching the soft meat on his waist, unkindly giving a full one hundred and eighty degree ultimate style pinch.</p><br/><p>Yet, the owner of this small hand was deliberately having a casual and relaxed expression, a sweet smile on her face, as if not paying any attention to what had happened.</p><br/><p>From the side, Ma Qun sidled over to him and asked: \u201cBoss, was that Bing\u2019er just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: \u201cAt last, I have seen Bing\u2019er again.\u201d All of a sudden, he felt an abrupt pain on his waist once again, causing him to be unable to speak. Of course, he still had to prevent himself from revealing any signs of pain.</p><br/><p>Ma Qun grinned and gave Zhou Weiqing a big thumbs up. \u201cHeh heh. Boss, awesome, that is awesome. I am most impressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave him an evil glare. \u201cWould you die if you don\u2019t cause trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qun gave an innocent look, as if he had been unjustly wronged. \u201cHow was I causing trouble? I am praising you Boss! So many unbelievably beautiful women falling for my Boss, you are truly impressive. Who else could possibly accomplish that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at his faux \u2018I am not trying to cause trouble\u2019 expression, Zhou Weiqing truly felt like giving him a tight slap.</p><br/><p>Luckily, right at that moment, Shangguan Longyin appeared, along with a group of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace Elders with the Spatial Attribute.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin first glanced at Zhou Weiqing, before turning to the rest of the present battle team members, saying solemnly: \u201cThe finals of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament are about to begin. Once again, the finals will be held in the Lustre Spatial Realm. As there are new teams this year, I will give a simple introduction to the Lustre Spatial Realm and the current situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lustre Spatial Realm\u2026 you can comprehend it as a certain type of unique power formation. This power formation has been handed down since ancient times, inscribed on the Heavenly Jewel Island. No one actually knows how it was formed, and when the ancestors and forefathers of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace first came to the Heavenly Jewel Island, it was already here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom a certain perspective, the Lustre Spatial Realm can be considered a totally different Spatial Area that exists outside of our own realm. It isn\u2019t that large in comparison, fully formed by a patch of primeval forest. Although we do not know how this Spatial Realm was created, I can tell all of you now that everything that happens in the Lustre Spatial Realm is indeed real. That is to say\u2026 if you die inside, then you will really die. It is no illusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the primeval forest of the Lustre Spatial Realm, various different kinds of Heavenly Beasts live there\u2026 from the lowest ranked to the top most. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a pattern on how they live or appear in the forest, and no one can say for sure how what kind of Heavenly Beasts you will meet. Even our Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace members do not know for sure, as every time we access the Spatial Realm, the situation within will undergo all sorts of different changes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking up to that point, Shangguan Longyin paused momentarily, his face growing bleak and serious. \u201cWhat I am about to say next\u2026 I hope that all of you will remember it clearly. It is extremely important, with regards to your own precious life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, those Battle Team members whose cultivation level has not reached the six-Jeweled stage, I suggest that you do not join in the incoming finals. That is because your Heavenly Energy cultivation is not sufficient, and it is extremely likely that you will lose your life in the Lustre Spatial Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he said that, even Zhou Weiqing was caught by surprise. The previous words that Shangguan Longyin said was pretty much the same as what he had heard in the previous Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and he did not pay much heed. However, the last line caused Zhou Weiqing to perk up instantly and pay full attention. From Shangguan Xue\u2019er, he had already learned previously that something strange was going on in the Lustre Spatial Realm, but as for what had really happened, no one knew. Since this time entering the Lustre Spatial Realm would be so dangerous, every little bit of extra information was crucial.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin\u2019s expression was extremely grave as he continued: \u201cNot long ago, we discovered that some unique changes were going on in the Lustre Spatial Realm. Due to the fact that entering the Lustre Spatial Realm is restricted to youths of less than thirty years of age, even if we wanted to enter to investigate all the changes, we were unable to do so. As a result, we will be making use of the current Heavenly Jewel Tournament to invite you all to investigate. The team which brings out the most information will be awarded the final championship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the finals this time will be far more dangerous and unknown compared to the previous rounds due to those changes, we have decided to discourage those Heavenly Jewel Masters below the six-Jeweled stage from entering the Lustre Spatial Realm, lest there be too many deaths. As for the others, we hope that you will be extremely careful. As soon as you feel that things are not going well, do activate the Lustre Gem as quickly as possible to leave the Lustre Spatial Realm. In summary, investigating the Lustre Spatial Realm is extremely important, but your lives are just as important too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Longyin\u2019s words did not have much use for Zhou Weiqing, as it did not differ much from what Shangguan Xue\u2019er had already told him. Amongst the four Battle Teams, both the ZhongTian and WanShou Battle Teams were all made up of six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters and higher, and they naturally did not have any problems. However, for the Heavenly Bow Battle Team and the HuaLuo Battle Team, they were in a relatively miserable stage, with each only having three who could actually attend.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing thought for a moment before turning to Yun Li, who wasn\u2019t far off, saying: \u201cFor this expedition, you do not need to join up. This time, Tian\u2019er and I will go by ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Li looked at him with slight dissatisfaction. \u201cWhy so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing threw him a significant look, saying: \u201cDo you want Little Miss Muddle to live in widowhood for the rest of her life?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

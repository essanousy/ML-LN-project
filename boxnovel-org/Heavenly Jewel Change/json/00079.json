(2)</b></p><br/><p>Another three days passed, and once again it was time for the next match of the tournament.</p><br/><p>The Plaza was once again crowded with masses of audience, and they were all chatting about the main attraction of the day, the highlight fight. Naturally, that was the fight between the two large empires, Zhou Weiqing and their team\u2019s Fei Li Empire, as well as the Bai Da Empire. This was likely the most important fight in the entire preliminaries. After all, in the preliminary heats, the seeded teams usually did not even have to fight. Furthermore, with the added history and enmity between these two large empires, one could imagine how tough and deadly the fighting would be.</p><br/><p>In the first two rounds of the tournament, the Fei Li Empire had only sent out four members. However, today, they all attended, of course, besides Shangguan Bing\u2019er who had been taken away by Shangguan Tianyue. Under Lin TianAo\u2019s leadership, Zhou Weiqing, Drunken Bao, Crow, Little Four, Xiao Yan and Ye Paopao arrived at the tournament grounds.</p><br/><p>The first thing they did was to retrieve their winnings from their bet on the last round. Naturally, the one who won the most was Ye Paopao, his five hundred thousand gold coins turning into six hundred and fifty thousand gold coins. Similarly, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s four hundred thousand turned into five hundred and twenty thousand gold coins. The others also had a correspondingly satisfying return.</p><br/><p>Once more, the seven of them did not hesitate to bet all their winnings on themselves once more.</p><br/><p>This was not only confidence in themselves, but also a push on themselves, to put pressure for them to win.</p><br/><p>The first two fights for the Bai Da Battle Team were good for them as well. They had surrendered to the seeded Dan Dun Battle Team, and for the other one, they had only sent out two members to gain the win in a crushing manner. As such, both teams had almost equal odds today.</p><br/><p>The odds on the Fei Li Battle Team was 1 to 1.8, and 1 to 1.9 for the Bai Da Battle Team. The reason why it was slightly favouring the Fei Li Battle Team was because they were the top 5 team three years ago; as well as the fact that some of their team members had not even been seen before today.</p><br/><p>Just as the Fei Li Battle Team members had finished placing their bets, another team arrived as well, dressed in yellow uniforms.</p><br/><p>On their yellow uniforms was a silver thread lining, and silver embroidery on their chest of their empire\u2019s symbol.</p><br/><p>When the opposing teams spotted each other, the entire air was filled with fiery tension. That was naturally because the yellow uniform-ed team was the Bai Da Battle Team.</p><br/><p>The eight of them walked ahead to the Fei Li Team members. They were also here to place their bets, and their leader\u2019s gaze landed on Lin TianAo and he smiled, saying: \u201cBro TianAo, it\u2019s been a long time. Looks like this time you are actually the leader of the Fei Li Battle Team.\u201d</p><br/><p>This leader was extremely huge, even taller than Lin TianAo, though perhaps not as well built. Bushy eyebrows and large eyes with thin lips, he gave an impression of being a harsh character. His hands were broad, matching his broad frame, giving forth a sharp edgey feel, a contrast from Lin TianAo\u2019s stable, a little introverted character.</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo said solemnly: \u201cThat\u2019s right, I am the leader. Lang Xie, it\u2019s been a long time indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them shook hands, and as their large hands clasped together, the members of both teams could clearly sense the air almost explode in that instance, the sheer force of the two palms causing the light in the air to almost seem twisted.</p><br/><p>The \u2018handshake\u2019 lasted almost three seconds before they let go at the same time. From the surface, it seemed like no one had lost out, both of them without any change to their expressions.</p><br/><p>Lang Xie continued smiling, saying: \u201cBro TianAo, let\u2019s meet on the stage then.\u201d After saying that, he swept his gaze across the members of the Fei Li Battle Team, before turning to the betting booth and saying: \u201cI place a million gold coins on the Bai Da Battle Team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drunken Bao sidled closer to Lin TianAo, saying softly: \u201cBoss, he is trying to show off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo said passively: \u201cHe is right, let\u2019s meet on stage to let our fighting do the talking. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although their fight had not started, the \u2018smell of gunpowder\u2019 between the two was already extremely thick, the tension and enmity clear between both sides as they walked past each other.</p><br/><p>Amongst the seven remaining members of the Fei Li Battle Team, only Zhou Weiqing was not actually a Fei Li Empire citizen, yet even he had been influenced by his companions. He could clearly sense how different the state of his companions were. It wasn\u2019t just excitement, it was also that sheer need to win, so much so that their eyes were all red. Even Lin TianAo, who was normally very stable and not emotional, was clearly agitated, as he walked energetically towards their rest house.</p><br/><p>As they sat down, Little Four quickly spoke out: \u201cBoss, what\u2019s the plan. Let\u2019s finish them all.\u201d Without needing any pep talk, all of the Fei Li Team members were raring to go.</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo said solemnly: \u201cI just want to remind everyone that in every Heavenly Jewel Tournament, as long as our Fei Li Empire has met the Bai Da Empire, there has always been bloodshed. Both sides will definitely not hold back, or show any mercy, and many a life has been lost on either side in the history of this tournament. For the glory of our Empire, even if we have to sacrifice ourselves today, we must not lose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the glory of the empire!\u201d Besides Zhou Weiqing, all the team members shouted out immediately, at such a volume that all the surrounding teams preparing themselves could hear them. Of course, the Bai Da Battle Team which were on their way to their own Rest House could also hear them.</p><br/><p>Lang Xie gave a cold humh, shouting out loud: \u201cBai Da Victory!\u201d And his own team members also shouted out loud in unison.</p><br/><p>The rest of the battle teams couldn\u2019t help but reveal a smile. The fight had not yet started, but the two teams whose fight everyone was looking forward to were already clashing. Without question, this would be a clash of two titans, one of the deadliest fights thus far.</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo\u2019s eyes narrowed. No one knew when his hands had gripped into tight fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, let me be the first one!\u201d Drunken Bao said excitedly. My wounds are already healed; even if I do, I will definitely be able to kill one of those Bai Da cretins!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo lowered his head, looking at his tightly gripped fists. He seemed lost in thought for a few moments, before he finally said solemnly: \u201cToday\u2019s fight\u2026 I will leave the direction to Weiqing. He has proven himself, and I am unable to keep a clear head today. Weiqing, you arrange our team\u2019s fight today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Zhou Weiqing started. He had not expected Lin TianAo to say something like this, and all the members turned to him, as if they were hungry wild beasts, causing Zhou Weiqing to feel a chill down his spine.</p><br/><p>Giving a bitter smile, he said: \u201cLeader, this isn\u2019t an easy task you have assigned me. First of all, I must get all your assurance that you will listen to all my instructions. No matter who I send out, or what instructions I give, you must follow it to the letter for this to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo nodded and said: \u201cNo problem, I will guarantee this. You are now the team leader. No matter who you send out, we will listen to your arrangement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cAll the way to the individual tactics?\u201d</p><br/><p>By now, Drunken Bao was too anxious, exclaiming: \u201cWeiqing, stop talking rubbish! Hurry up and assign us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, turning to Lin TianAo and saying: \u201cLeader, if it were you, with your current state of mind, who would you send out first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo thought for a while before saying: \u201cIf everyone was at full strength and not injured, I would definitely let Xiao Yan fight first. He is probably the second most powerful in the entire team. This first round is extremely critical, especially for the morale of the team\u2026 in fact, it\u2019s true for both sides. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want an auspicious start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and nodded before saying: \u201cVery good. In that case, for the first fight, Ye Paopao, you\u2019ll fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Almost everyone exclaimed at the same time, staring at Zhou Weiqing with wide eyes. Without question, amongst the entire team, Ye Paopao was likely the weakest. Even though he was at the four-Jeweled cultivation level, in terms of combat strength he was no match for the three-Jeweled Zhou Weiqing and Crow, let alone the other members. Although Ye Paopao was thirsting to fight, he had definitely not expected that he would be assigned to this all important first fight.</p><br/><p>After a moment of shock, Ye Paopao quickly recovered, rushing to Zhou Weiqing in joy and saying: \u201cWeiqing, in the future, you are my bro! Do not worry, even if I have to sacrifice my life, I will ensure the glory of our Empire is shown on the stage. No matter what, I will ensure victory!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Paopao was excited, but Drunken Bao was anxious. According to Lin TianAo\u2019s plan earlier, Xiao Yan would have been assigned. However, since Xiao Yan had not fully recovered yet, while his own injuries were almost fully healed, as the next highest cultivation, he should have been given the first fight. Alas, Zhou Weiqing had assigned Ye Paopao to fight instead, how could he not be anxious. With a quick step forward, he grabbed hold of Zhou Weiqing, exclaiming: \u201cWeiqing, I did not offend you before right, why don\u2019t you let me fight first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing glared at him exasperatedly: \u201cAre you the leader or am I the leader? Since you all already agreed to let me direct this fight, then you should listen to my arrangement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo said solemnly: \u201cWeiqing, this is an important fight, are you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing pulled Drunken Bao aside. In terms of pure physical strength, Drunken Bao was naturally no match for him. He walked in front of Ye Paopao, saying seriously: \u201cSenior, this time you will have to go through ignominy. For the victory of the team, are you able to sacrifice your personal honour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Paopao started. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

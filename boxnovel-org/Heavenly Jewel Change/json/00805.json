On the other hand, the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Hell Lord\u2019s eyes were lit with a vicious gleam. Although this was his first time seeing Zhou Weiqing, he had actually heard of his name many times before.</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing was stunned, \u201cY-You\u2019ve joined the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang glanced at Zhou Weiqing as he chimed in indifferently, \u201cOur Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace is only a small tiny temple, we can\u2019t possibly accommodate a god like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018He didn\u2019t join the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace?\u2019 Gu Yingbing thought to himself. His face was filled with a look of astonishment. Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian had the same expressions as well. If their memories served them correctly, the Saint Land that Zhou Weiqing was the closest to was the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Although these Saint Land Lords had never seen Zhou Weiqing as their equal, they had all heard of his name. Apparently, they had also heard of the things that he had done before.</p><br/><p>At the very least, in their opinions, Zhou Weiqing could also be considered as the most powerful person among the cultivators in the younger generation. Casting aside all the deeds that he had done aside, just the fact that he dared to come up to the Heavenly Snow Mountain to snatch his bride and successfully beat Gu Yingbing before kidnapping the Heavenly Snow Mountain Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s daughter was something his peers would never be able to do.</p><br/><p>Later, Zhou Weiqing single-handedly established Peerless Battalion with the aid of the Zhongtian Empire and successfully defeated the combined coalition of the Bai Da and Kalise Empire. Not only did he succeed in saving his nation and father, he also annihilated the Kalise Empire without a hitch. One could even say that it was the Heavenly Bow Empire that helped the Zhongtian Empire build up their defensive line on the west. That, in turn, managed to slow the combined forces of the Bai Da and Dandun coalition, effectively postponing the war that might erupt after the Grand Tournament.</p><br/><p>Due to this reason, Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian who saw him for the first time were a little curious about the young man before them. Particularly Fen Tian, because there were many Blood Red Hell powerhouses who were sacrificed in the Heavenly Bow Empire. There was not even one living person among those people that he sent out. In his opinion, although Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya were pretty strong, if it was not for the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace secretly sending a strong backup to help them, how could the small Heavenly Bow Empire be able to detain the four elders of the Blood Red Hell and even the assassins that he sent later on.</p><br/><p>Because of this, the moment Shangguan Tianyang clarified that Zhou Weiqing was not a part of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, all of them could not help but be taken aback with surprise.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian was the only one who remained unmoved. He asked in a deep voice, \u201cIf you\u2019re not here in the name of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, then I suppose you\u2019re here under the Heavenly Demon Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, \u201cDidn\u2019t Hell Lord Fen Tian say earlier that there\u2019s no more Heavenly Demon Sect in this world. I\u2019m not here to represent the Heavenly Demon Sect either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing growled, \u201cZhou Weiqing, how dare you talk so rudely like this in front of so many seniors? It\u2019s true that I lost to you last time in a duel. However, I want to issue another challenge to you today! Let us fight to the death!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, he stepped out of the crowd and walked to the front.</p><br/><p>Strangely, nobody tried to stop him at all, nor did anyone say anything. Somehow, it seemed like everyone wanted to see exactly how strong Zhou Weiqing was right now.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed softly, \u201cBrother Gu, to be honest, I admire your perseverance and potential. It comes as a surprise to me that you\u2019re able to break through to the Heavenly King Tier relying entirely on your efforts in just these short few years. It looks like my battle with you in the past managed to drive you</p><br/><p>. Had Tian\u2019er was not between us, perhaps we would be able to become friends instead. Today is the day of the Grand Tournament, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for us to snatch the spotlight away. Let us go in accordance with the Grand Tournament\u2019s rules, shall we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing roared loudly, \u201cIn what name are you worthy to join this Grand Tournament?\u201d</p><br/><p>A gleam of light flashed across Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes. Within seconds, a concise and impetuous aura erupted from his body. The original jesting look in his eyes suddenly turned solemn as his eyes shone with brilliance, \u201cI\u2019m here as the Sect Leader of the Peerless Sect, one of the Saint Land of the Five Great Saint Lands in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cP-Peerless Sect? Sect Leader?\u201d Gu Yingbing stared at Zhou Weiqing with his mouth agape. Among all of the people present, only a few people remained unaffected by the announcement. On the other hand, the rest had a peculiar look on their faces.</p><br/><p>How did a Saint Land come into existence again? It was one of the most prestigious achievements of a Heavenly Jewel Master. All of the four Saint Lands that were present had a legacy of more than 1,000 years that shaped them into how they were today. Suddenly, today, on the day of the Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands, a young man suddenly appeared out of nowhere and claimed that he was a Sect Leader who founded a sect called the Peerless Sect, a Saint Land. What the hell was this? This was probably the biggest joke in the whole world.</p><br/><p>After being stunned speechless for a moment, a weird look appeared on Gu Yingbing\u2019s face, \u201cZ-Zhou Weiqing, did you hit your head on something? Did you really just claim that you\u2019ve created a Saint Land? What do you base this claim on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing answered him calmly with another question instead, \u201cLet me ask you then. On what basis do the four Great Saint Lands here call themselves a Saint Land?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yingbing replied without any hesitation, \u201cOf course it\u2019s based on strength! It\u2019s only when a place is strong enough that it can call itself a Saint Land.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a faint smile, \u201cThen naturally, I base my claim on my strength as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust you alone?\u201d Gu Yingbing asked in disbelief. At this moment, he really thought Zhou Weiqing was a crazy person.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head slightly, \u201cNo, naturally I\u2019m not alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, he walked and stood next to Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s powerhouse. In the next moment, a layer of dazzling silverish light radiated from his chest. That brilliant luster that was filled with an extremely powerful Spatial Attribute energy ripple turned into a silverish halo before it rapidly spread out.</p><br/><p>The moment they felt this tyrannical Spatial Attribute energy, everybody, including Shangguan Tianyang and Xue Ao\u2019tian, could not help but turn pale in an instant. The looks that they were giving Zhou Weiqing at the moment were equally filled with astonishment. All of them knew that Zhou Weiqing would come and that he would definitely bring the Peerless Sect along with him. However, they were filled with doubts when they saw Zhou Weiqing appearing on the summit all by himself earlier. At this moment, the fact that such a powerful Spatial Attribute energy ripple was emitted from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body had given them even more of a shock. Although Zhou Weiqing possessed the Spatial Attribute, this attribute was not his main one after all!</p><br/><p>Soon afterward, among the people who were present, those powerhouses whose cultivation base were at the Heavenly Emperor Tier and above had noticed something peculiar. That silverish light did not come from Zhou Weiqing himself but from the top of his chest instead. There seemed to be a gemstone embedded in it. However, since the light was too dazzling, the piece of clothing on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest could no longer conceal its shape.</p><br/><p>What was he going to do? Nobody knew what Zhou Weiqing was doing. However, since all of the people present were mighty powerhouses, they could also feel that even though the silverish light that Zhou Weiqing emitted was filled with an extremely powerful ripple of energy, there was no sign of aggression in it at all. At the same time, they did not think that a young man like Zhou Weiqing could pose much of a threat to them.</p><br/><p>The silverish light circle that Zhou Weiqing released had a radius of around twenty meters. Along with the dazzling silverish light, a series of shadows started to gradually materialize out of nowhere. Each of them appeared by his side one by one.</p><br/><p>Teleportation? Mass Teleportation?</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian could not help but gasp in shock when he saw this. Although there were many powerhouses that possessed the Spatial Attribute present here, there was not a single one who could actually perform a Mass Teleportation. Even a Spatial Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master that was in the Heavenly God Tier might not be able to perform this technique. Even though the powerhouses of the four Great Saint Lands were knowledgeable and experienced, this was their first time seeing a technique like this Mass Teleportation.</p><br/><p>In fact, it could be said that the appearance of the Peerless Sect this time had thoroughly shocked everyone to the core. Those people who first thought Zhou Weiqing was merely being crazy in the first place instantly raised their guards.</p><br/><p>There was quite a number of shadows present beside Zhou Weiqing now. Although the number was not as many as the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace or the Blood Red Hell, there were at least several dozen people in total. The number was roughly more or less the same as the people brought along by Love Valley, or perhaps slightly more.</p><br/><p>The silverish light disappeared without warning, and the faces of these people finally could be seen clearly.</p><br/><p>Like the long blue robe worn by Zhou Weiqing, all of these people were wearing the same long blue robe as well. Just like this, there was a distinction of colors between the five Saint Lands now. Among them, the colors that looked almost similar was the colors worn by the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. The Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace was wearing clothes of a milky white color while the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s powerhouses were wearing ones with a snowy white color. The members of the Love Valley wore yellow, the Blood Red Hell were in crimson garb and the Peerless Sect were in blue. It was the kind of blue that very much reflected the blue, blue sky.</p><br/><p>Seeing these people appearing around Zhou Weiqing, the first person who frowned was none other than the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Hell Lord, Fen Tian. This was because he could make out the two people standing on both sides of Zhou Weiqing in just a glance. He knew the both of them. More accurately, most of the four Great Saint Lands\u2019 powerhouses present there knew who the both of them were.</p><br/><p>The man standing to the left of Zhou Weiqing was none other than the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya who was also known as the first Heavenly God. The man standing on the right, on the other hand, was the Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s Sect Leader, the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue.</p><br/><p>These two people actually showed up here at the same time. On top of that, through teleportation? How could the crowd not be taken aback by such a scene?</p><br/><p>Bewildered gazes landed on the mass number of Peerless Sect\u2019s powerhouses, particularly behind Zhou Weiqing, Long Shiya, and Wu Yunyue. As it turned out, it was the three Shangguan sisters, Tian\u2019er, Little Witch Wu Yuehan and the six Heavenly Kings of the Heavenly Demon Sect. Behind them stood more people who were also in long, blue robes but these people had their bodies covered in cloaks instead. Even their heads were completely covered, and nobody could make out the faces underneath. It was almost similar to the people of Blood Red Hell who had different attires but the same method of concealing their identities. However, the Peerless Sect people seemed to be even more secretive. Not an ounce of energy could be sensed radiating from their body, let alone estimating their cultivation base.</p><br/><p>The silverish light vanished completely and just like this, the Peerless Sect appeared in such an extraordinary manner. It seemed to have instantly nullified the previous tense atmosphere on the summit.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian hissed coldly, \u201cWu Yunyue, you\u2019re not dead yet? When did you change your sect\u2019s name, huh? It\u2019s no wonder that your junior even dared to say that the Heavenly Demon Sect is no more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Fen Tian, Wu Yunyue\u2019s eyes were ablaze with hatred facing his enemy. His face was so dark that it was horrifying, \u201cFen Tian, I\u2019ll fight you to the end today! The Sect Lord is correct, there\u2019s no more Heavenly Demon Sect. There\u2019s only the Peerless Sect now. Sect Leader Zhou is the true leader of the Peerless Sect. I\u2019m only his deputy, you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment these words left Wu Yueyun, the other Saint Land Lords could no longer contain themselves. At once, intense arguments erupted one after the other.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

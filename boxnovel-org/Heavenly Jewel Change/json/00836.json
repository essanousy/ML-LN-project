Fierce and murderous intent oozed out from their bodies. At Zhou Weiqing\u2019s inquiry, they finally told the story that took place after they went their separate ways.</p><br/><p>It turned out that after Hui Yao and his wife went their separate ways from Zhou Weiqing, they proceeded to look for their children. Relying on the connections of their bloodline, they finally found the Blood Red Hell. Just in time, they saw their children being used as the blood sacrifice for the Nether Lord that was presided by Fen Tian.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Hui Yao and his wife went crazy upon seeing this. However, the Nether Lord\u2019s Destruction Energy materialized once again at that moment. Under Fen Tian\u2019s control, it managed to inflict great harm on the two of them. With the help of the power from their children\u2019s blood sacrifice, they took the opportunity while Hui Yao and his wife were in a confused state of mind as they went berserk and enslaved them using the Destruction Energy. It was not until this moment that they finally regained their consciousness.</p><br/><p>Duo Si went to stand beside Hui Yao. The two dragons snuggled with each other with their necks touching as Duo Si burst into tears. After all, anybody would be sad losing their children.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a peculiar wave of energy suddenly caused the entire realm to quake. It caused everyone to stay vigilant on their feet.</p><br/><p>Not only did the air quiver, the ground below quaked as well. A wave of Destruction Aura blasted out from the middle of the abyss. Even though it was not particularly strong, the sense of Destruction aura in it was more than enough to elicit horrors on their faces. The sky that had just lit up seemed to have dimmed down a little as well.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress quickly urged, \u201cWeiqing, hurry! Absorb Fen Tian\u2019s Heavenly Nucleus Core! We must really go now! It must be the Nether Lord smashing the seal. It seems like the seal can no longer hold him off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not dare to waste any time. As he activated his Astral Divine Territory, Fen Tian\u2019s Heavenly Nucleus Core transformed into a stream of light and flowed into the Astral Divine Territory. Thousands and thousands of stars instantly shined brightly at the same time as it gave feedback to his body and increased his cultivation base sharply.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress did not stay idle either. She crossed her legs in midair and restored her Life Energy that was used up previously. In a sense, sealing the Nether Lord would be their true final battle.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing bathed in the pure starlight, circles of halos started to form around his Saint God Nucleus Core. Even his skin began to show signs of ripples as the Saint Energy continued to refine and purify in the midst of the elevation of his cultivation base. However, just like what the Elven Empress had said, he noticed that even if he cast the Star Feedback on a powerful Destruction Heavenly Nucleus Core like Fen Tian\u2019s, it would still be impossible for him to touch the threshold of the level that Fen Tian used to have half his foot in previously.</p><br/><p>As it turned out, having Saint Energy prevented one from entering the Heavenly Change Tier. Rather contradictorily, the creation characteristics in Saint Energy would confine and limit one\u2019s future.</p><br/><p>If the Heavenly Change Tier would allow one to become God, then he would never become a god.</p><br/><p>It did not matter much to Zhou Weiqing if he became a god or not. However, if he could not break through this barrier, how could he face the Nether Lord if he managed to break open the seal? How could he protect his family, friends, or the entire world if he could not kill him?</p><br/><p>Even though Zhou Weiqing was not particularly enthusiastic about power, he had always been a person with a strong desire to control. This was a situation that he liked the least where it was completely out of his control, and he had to rely on luck instead. However, at this moment, he had done everything that he could have done. He worked hard to improve his cultivation base, and every time he improved slightly, luck would naturally be a step closer to him</p><br/><p>The Astral Divine Territory did not expand outwards with the elevation of his cultivation base. Instead, it engulfed Zhou Weiqing entirely and made it seem like multiple stars that could emit Saint Energy was embedded in his Ringless Ground Purging Set. The Saint Energy that became increasingly pure effectively suppressed the Destruction Energy that was rising from beneath the abyss.</p><br/><p>Little by little, the starlight converged. The Astral Feedback\u2019s energy had completely integrated with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Heavenly Nucleus Core was indeed powerful. As the saying went, when things were at their worst, they began to mend. The Nebula Saint Energy that was obtained from the Feedback did not deplete as much compared to the Star Feedback of other ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master\u2019s Heavenly Nucleus Core. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was greatly raised all the way up to the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier from the Middle Level, and there was even some Saint Energy left. However, this leftover Saint Energy could only ultimately make his Saint Energy more abundant, it could not help him with another breakthrough.</p><br/><p>The Star Feedback\u2019s light dimmed down but the starlight on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Ringless Ground Purging Set did not disappear accordingly. Instead, it became even clearer. Stars shone brilliantly on the white armor as if the luster that was full of Saint Energy would easily spill out from any parts of his body with just a simple thought from him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at the Elven Empress. She was still sitting cross-legged in the void as circles of life halos spread out and converged ceaselessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s chilly voice sounded in the air. She rode the Blackfiend dragon, and in no time at all, she had arrived in front of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go as well!\u201d The three Shangguan sisters and the Little Witch quickly rushed over, too!</p><br/><p>Tears began to well in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes when he saw the eagerness and determination in the girls\u2019 eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly, what are you guys going there for? It\u2019s not like you have the Saint Energy. If we really could deal with this problem through the mere accumulations of all our cultivation bases, then the Nether Lord would not have been able to live this long. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be fine! We\u2019re just going there to reinforce the seal. We\u2019ll definitely come back in no time at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er was a little beside herself, \u201cSo\u2026 what if the Nether Lord breaks the seal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing froze for a moment before he waved his hand at Bing\u2019er, \u201cBing\u2019er, come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, jealousy was the last thing on the girls\u2019 minds. In a flash, Shangguan Bing\u2019er appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing. He spread his arms wide open and pulled her into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve let you down. You\u2019re the one who introduced me to the world of Heavenly Jewel Masters. I remember when we first met, I actually ravished your body due to the awakening of my Heavenly Jewels. Instead of blaming me, you helped and took care of me as you used your gentleness to guide me on the path of becoming a Heavenly Jewel Master. In my life, it\u2019s the happiest thing for me, Zhou Weiqing, to have you as my wife. However, I\u2019m sorry for letting you down. My infidelity must have hurt you a lot. Still, I have to tell you that my love for you has never once lessened. Bing\u2019er, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was saying that, he lowered his head and planted a deep kiss on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s fragrant lips.</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er was taken aback for a moment. However, within seconds, she quickly responded to his kiss passionately. Her arms were trembling slightly as she put her arms around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck and hugged him tightly.</p><br/><p>Their lips parted and Zhou Weiqing pulled away both of Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s arms before he gently pulled her to a side. A dazed look could be seen in her beautiful eyes as she continued to levitate quietly in the sky.</p><br/><p>With a flash, he appeared in front of Shangguan Fei\u2019er and proceeded to pull her into his arms, too.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er, even though you look exactly like Bing\u2019er, your personalities are totally different. With your vivacious and vibrant personality, there\u2019s no man that could ever be a match for your perseverance. During the most difficult time in my life, you\u2019ve always been by my side. Thank you. I love Bing\u2019er but I love you, too! There\u2019s no way for me to survive without you. Indeed, I\u2019m a selfish man but there\u2019s no way for me to not be selfish!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say such wor\u2026\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er was beside herself. However, just as she was about to say something, she was forcefully stopped by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lips. In the next moment, she melted in his arms as well.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing finally let go of her lips, no words came out from her mouth either. She floated in the air in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er,\u201d Zhou Weiqing pulled Shangguan Xue\u2019er who was standing next to Shangguan Fei\u2019er, \u201cXue\u2019er, I know that you\u2019ve always thought that you\u2019re not as precious as Bing\u2019er and Fei\u2019er in my heart but you\u2019ve never been so wrong. I love you, and it\u2019s not because it\u2019s out of convenience. I love your coldness and that unsullied nobleness. All the things that you\u2019ve done for me secretly are forever engraved in my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er took the initiative and offered her lips to him. She kissed him and left him with no chance to continue his speech.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuehan,\u201d Zhou Weiqing waved towards Little Witch as he let go of Shangguan Xue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Wu Yuehan\u2019s beautiful eyes were completely red as her tears streamed uncontrollably down her cheeks, \u201cI hate that you\u2019re doing this! Are you trying to give us your last words?\u201d Although she was saying this, she still came forward to face Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, \u201cNo, I just want to hug all of you and feel the heat of your bodies!\u201d Holding her cheeks that were soaked with tears, he kissed her tenderly.</p><br/><p>It did not matter if it were the three Shangguan sisters or Wu Yuehan, they were all currently hovering motionlessly in the air after they were kissed by Zhou Weiqing. A dazed look could be seen in their beautiful eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHanyue,\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked at Dongfang Hanyue. She was staring at him, too.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. I won\u2019t follow you there. Don\u2019t forget, I still have our son other than you,\u201d Dongfang Hanyue replied Zhou Weiqing as she paled noticeably. Her right hand that was holding the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear was completely pale as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing let out a smile, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s great. However, I still want to kiss you, can I?</p><br/><p>Her figure turned into a flash as she collided into his arms forcefully, \u201cDon\u2019t die! Promise me that you\u2019ll come back alive! As long as you come back in one piece, I\u2019ll give you my word that I\u2019ll give up my position as the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace and bring your son here to meet you!\u201d As she said that, she kissed Zhou Weiqing hard on the lips and even bit down on his lips <sup>1 </sup>.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue was still a Saint Lord after all. When Zhou Weiqing kissed Shangguan Xue\u2019er, she already had a sneaking suspicion. The few girls who had been kissed by Zhou Weiqing had clearly lost their sensibility. She understood that Zhou Weiqing merely did not want them to follow him to such danger.</p><br/><p>After Dongfang Hanyue kissed him, she hugged him tightly and refused to let him go.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed, \u201cPerhaps this is my punishment from God. It would be my greatest fortune to have either one of you, no matter which one, to be my wife but I\u2019m just too greedy. Still, I really don\u2019t have the heart to leave any of you behind. This time, if I can come back safely, all the time in my remaining life will belong to all of you. I\u2019ll use my remaining time to repay all of your love towards me. Hanyue, when I come back, I\u2019ll go to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace with you to formally bring you and our son back. Nobody will be able to stop me! Even if I have to pull and connect the entire Mysterious Heavenly Mainland to the Boundless Mainland, I won\u2019t allow the two of you to be separated from me!\u201d</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"92254d50-03da-cb9a-a662-de804bdc1486\">Ouch ._.</li></ol><br/>\n</div>"}

Nine eye-catching Heavenly Jewels were spinning around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s wrist.</span></p><br/><p></p><p id=\"docs-internal-guid-c1c65151-1240-b9e2-e4e0-4566ebb0a71a\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This had already surpassed their comprehension level. Just a mere short ten days had passed! Yet, Zhou Weiqing had somehow risen from the seven-Jeweled stage to the nine-Jeweled stage! More importantly, Zhou Weiqing was currently not even twenty two years old. In the entire history of the Boundless Mainland, it was not that there weren\u2019t any who had reached the Upper Level Zong Stage before the age of thirty, but it was considered as rare as phoenix's\u2019 feather and qilin\u2019s horns. More importantly, he was far younger than most who had done so even, and from his current situation, perhaps before he reached the age of thirty he would already reach the Heavenly King Stage.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the gold light continued shining and being absorbed, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body seemed to be undergoing a mysterious change, as if he had become a gold statue descending from the heavens, landing upon the ground. The previous overbearing aura had disappeared into his body, and soon everything seemed to turn normal. However, the four girls who were so familiar with him could sense that the current Zhou Weiqing was so different from previously, as if his world had turned upside down.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In the past, Zhou Weiqing could be said to be relatively average in terms of look, not considered suave. Currently, he now had an added wild attraction to him, his eyes filled with a strange light, like that of a treasured sword, keen and sharp. The feeling he gave others was like that of a powerful god weapon, ready to destroy any enemies at given notice.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">More shockingly, in just a matter of moments, all of the atmospheric energy in a several hundred square metres radius had actually been drained dry by Zhou Weiqing. Currently, the atmospheric energy was flowing back in from the other areas of the Lustre Spatial Realm, and the large energy reverberation that it caused gave all of them a deep impression.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Nine Jewels. Upper Level Zong Stage. To most Heavenly Jewel Masters, this was already the absolute peak that they could ascend to in their lifetimes. Zhou Weiqing had already accomplished it at such a young age, and the current him already had sufficiently power Heavenly Energy. Once he could complete his corresponding \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set pieces, his power would once again grow by leaps and bounds. At that point, even if he were to face any Heavenly King Stage powerhouse in single combat, it was likely he could hold his own.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but mutter to herself as she stared at Zhou Weiqing, her eyes filled with a strange light.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As the heir to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, she had always known that she was outstanding, the top echelon amongst all of the younger generation Heavenly Jewel Masters. Yet, currently as she looked at Zhou Weiqing with his nine Heavenly Jewels, she knew that she was no longer on the same level as he was.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That was because after the short period of shock, Shangguan Xue\u2019er quickly guessed the reason behind Zhou Weiqing\u2019s quick rise\u2026 it had to be the Saint Energy. What else could possibly have such a miraculous effect? Although she did not know why Tian\u2019er did not have a similar raise, she knew that could be the only reason. More importantly, the Saint Energy was something that the three Shangguan Sisters could not cultivate, though Zhou Weiqing had shared it with them and it greatly benefited them, it did not change the fact they could not cultivate it on their own. However, even though Shangguan Xue\u2019er felt so surprised by the sudden power of Zhou Weiqing, she found that she actually did not even feel a tinge of jealousy or competitive spirit, only a deep joy.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Her heart gripped with sudden surprise.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Could it be\u2026 I have truly started to think of myself as his woman, to just become his supporting cast?\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Looking at herself, her two sisters, then at Tian\u2019er, Shangguan Xue\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but think helplessly to herself.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">This scoundrel playboy!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Looking down at his own body, Zhou Weiqing felt as if his entire body was filled with a explosive power that could burst forth at anytime. Strangely, he discovered that the Saint Energy in his body had actually gone through some colour changes. The original homogeneous silver-white colour of the Saint Energy now had a layer of faint gold light, as if a membrane covering over the Saint Energy.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It had to be known that the Saint Energy was already considered the top of all energy forms, yet this layer of gold light was not assimilated by the Saint Energy\u2026 one could imagine that the power inherent within it had already reached an absolute top as well. This was the effect brought by the final completion of the Immortal Deity Technique, and even Zhou Weiqing did not know what it was or what its effects truly were, but he could clearly sense its powerful aura.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing was definitely not the first person to cultivate the Immortal Deity Technique, but he was definitely the first one to actually complete the Immortal Deity Technique and breakthrough all of the Death Acupuncture Points. In the process of the Saint Energy circulating, it was actually self-readjusting, and as he drew in all of the massive amount of atmospheric energy just now, Zhou Weiqing was surprised to find that the small Saint Energy whirlpool in his body had vanished. Only the energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points remained, but these whirlpools had all become filled with pure Saint Energy, and as they spun swiftly, Saint Energy was actually beginning to circulate and generate. That was to say\u2026 the current him no longer needed to worry about using up his Saint Energy as he could now recover it. In the process of completing the Immortal Deity Technique, he had successfully and completely transformed all of his Heavenly Energy into Saint Energy permanently, and from now on he would only have Saint Energy, not Heavenly Energy.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Perhaps because of this exact change, the Heavenly Jewels around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s wrists had also undergone some unprecedented changes. The Icy Jade Physical Jewels on his right wrist had all turned into the silver-white of the Saint Energy, while the Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye Elemental Jewels on his left wrist remained the same, but were now covered with an additional layer of faint gold light.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Although Zhou Weiqing did not know to what extent his power had grown, there was one direct difference he could perceive. That was, when he looked at the mother dragon Duo Si, he no longer felt the powerful and overwhelming pressure.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Immortal Deity Technique had brought him many benefits, but in order to cultivate it, Zhou Weiqing had gone through countless pain and suffering. Currently, he had finally completed the Immortal Deity Technique, cultivating it to its culmination. Although he did not yet know how he would continue cultivating from here on, at least he had accomplished this matter, cultivating the Immortal Deity Technique that no one else had ever succeeded in doing so. More importantly, the pain, suffering and worry that he had to undergo throughout the cultivation process would leave him for good. The sheer joy and sense of freedom of that suddenly caused him to raise his head and howl once more, as he felt an incomparable sense of comfort.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cCongratulations, \u00a0young man. Even I am unable to fully see through your abilities now.\u201d Duo Si\u2019s large dragon eyes were filled with surprise, with a hint of joy. The more powerful Zhou Weiqing grew, it could only be great news to her, as it meant the chances of reviving her husband was even higher now.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cLet us begin then.\u201d Looking at Duo Si\u2019s hopeful gaze, Zhou Weiqing nodded towards her. After such a long period of preparation, they were all fully ready, and it was time to begin the revival of the Dragon Hui Yao.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tian\u2019er looked at Zhou Weiqing, her heart filled with pride. Although she was still at the late stages of the seven-Jeweled cultivation level, her man had already become so strong, and somehow she felt even happier than if it had been her cultivation level rising. Furthermore, she knew that even for her father, when he was at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s age, he did not have such a cultivation level yet!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Holding hands, the pair walked towards the dragon Hui Yao\u2019s body. Turning to Duo Si, Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cDuo Si, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to stay by my side. If our Heavenly Energy is insufficient to revive Hui Yao, I will need to borrow your strength.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Duo Si took a single step forward, her giant stride bringing her massive body right beside Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er. Once again, she lay down on the ground as she said: \u201cThank you both once again. As long as my husband can be revived, no matter what price I have to pay, I am willing. You can draw from my strength as you need.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As she spoke, she lifted a claw and placed it in front of Zhou Weiqing. Currently, she was actually extremely nervous, though she tried her best to hide it. As the saying goes, the greater the hope, the greater the possibility of disappointment. She did not know if this revival actually failed, would she actually breakdown.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing said earnestly: \u201cDuo Si, do not worry, no matter what we will do our best to help you revive Hui Yao. Perhaps, we might even be able to do so without borrowing your strength, I am currently filled with confidence that we can let Hui Yao stand before you once more.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">His words were not just all big talk. After all, the Saint Energy in his body was finally able to circulate and generate freely. That was of utmost importance in the following revival, as it meant he could substantially increase the amount of Saint Energy he could infuse to Tian\u2019er. With a large amount of Saint Energy to support the Resurrection Skill, the success rate would naturally increase greatly as well.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing nodded towards Tian\u2019er, saying: \u201cLet\u2019s begin then.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With a single thought, the large Saint Energy whirlpool formed between the two of them under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lead. The current Zhou Weiqing gave Tian\u2019er a totally different sensation, as if he was as vast and deep as the ocean, and with his lead, the large Saint Energy whirlpool did not seem to have an end or limit.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A series of dark gold light sprang forth one after the other in sudden brightness, as the God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set appeared around Tian\u2019er\u2019s body. With the Saint Energy casting light upon her along with the Divine aura around her caused the entire surroundings to be covered with a sheen of gold holy light.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Raising the God Spirit Staff up high, Tian\u2019er began to chant a long series of strange and choppy incantations. This was in a language that Zhou Weiqing and the three Shangguan Sisters did not understand at all, but though they did not recognize it, the mother dragon Duo Si instantly recognized it as a sort of ancient incantation. It was nearly impossible to find anymore Heavenly Skills that actually required incantations to unleash now, but they were definitely inherently powerful. Sensing the powerful divine aura around Tian\u2019er growing stronger and stronger, the hope in Duo Si\u2019s heart also grew larger.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Behind Tian\u2019er\u2019s back, the illusory figure of the\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger slowly appeared in midair. In just a few blinks of the eye, the illusory figure of the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger had actually turned seemingly solid, the massive tiger looking imposing in midair as it raised its head and gave a bone chilling howl, before its huge body abruptly charged downwards, actually speeding and entering right into Tian\u2019er\u2019s body from her back.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Instantly, Tian\u2019er\u2019s entire body burst forth with brilliant gold light, the divine lustre enveloping both herself and Zhou Weiqing. The thick Heavenly Energy reverberations in the air were raised to the maximum, and they could see tiger tattoos appearing on Tian\u2019er\u2019s smooth skin. However, in contrast to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s usual tiger tattoos when he entered the Demonic Change State or Dragon-Tiger Transformation, hers seemed more decorative, causing her already absolute beauty to be given a wild nature.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In a stark contrast to the brilliant gold light of divinity around her, Tian\u2019er\u2019s eyes had turned a deep purple, and purple light sprang forth from them in a powerful spiritual movement.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

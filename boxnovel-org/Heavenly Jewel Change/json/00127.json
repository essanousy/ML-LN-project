(2)</b></p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile and said: \u201cDon\u2019t strip her outer clothes either\u2026 we have to give Shen Bu some face, women are extremely terrifying when they go crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said with a discontented tone: \u201cNow then your heart feels tender? When Shen Bu wanted to marry her off to you, why did you reject her then, instead chosing to come here to be a Battalion Commander\u2026\u201d The officers of the Ruffian Battalion stood jaw agape at the side listening to them, staring at Zhou Weiqing in shock. This new Battalion Commander of theirs was truly something different!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her exasperatedly and said: \u201cAlright, enough, wake her up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Shangguan Fei\u2019er suddenly realise that her actions were a little strange\u2026 almost as if she was being\u2026 jealous. Giving Shen Yi a swift kick, she stood back beside Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Shen Yi\u2019s body shuddered slightly and she opened her eyes slowly, her hand moving subconsciously to her aching neck. All of a sudden, she felt the cold wind on her body, and her heart stilled in fright, her eyes opening wide abruptly, only to see Zhou Weiqing and the rest of the Peerless Battalion staring at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d A shrill shriek pierced the air, and Shen Yi subconsciously used her hands to cover her chest, protecting her not-too-large bosom.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at her and said grinningly: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I am not interested in yours, as flat as a racecourse as it is.\u201d After saying that, he felt a sharp pain in his waist, as Shangguan Fei\u2019er had given him a savage pinch due to his shameless words.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face twitched from the pain, though he tried his best to control himself.</p><br/><p>From the viewpoint of the Peerless Battalion soldiers, they could not see Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s actions, but Shen Yi, who was on the floor, could easily see it.</p><br/><p>Seeing her own armour in Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s hands, and the closeness that their little actions showed, when Shen Yi looked back at Zhou Weiqing, there was a weird look in her eyes besides the panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder you refused to marry me\u2026 no wonder\u2026 you actually like him?!\u201d As she said that, Shen Yi\u2019s gaze landed on Shangguan Fei\u2019er. She clearly remembered how this person had subdued her so easily\u2026 \u2018His\u2019 cultivation level and power was definitely at least as strong as that Zhou Little Fatty, or perhaps even higher, yet he was willing to just be a follower\u2026 What else could this be? She had never expected that Zhou Little Fatty would actually like men!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er froze in place, and due to a strange sense of guilt, she lowered her head subconsciously. Alas, in others\u2019 eyes, that was tantamount to admitting it!</p><br/><p>The Peerless Battalion officers who were standing beside Zhou Weiqing all took a step back, looking at Zhou Weiqing with a strange look on their faces.</p><br/><p>Looking at Shangguan Fei\u2019er, then back at Shen Yi, Zhou Weiqing said helplessly: \u201cWho Your Father, I, likes is none of your business. Gather your men and leave. Go back and tell Shen Bu that I don\u2019t have much interest in the heavy cavalry equipment, let her bring money to exchange. However, the bows, horses and shields are ours now. The heavy armour and horses armour can all be sold back to you; two hundred gold per set. Next time, bring the money to exchange for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Yi clambered back to her feet, looking angrily at Zhou Weiqing as she said: \u201cYou just wait, my sister will not let you off so easily.\u201d After saying that, she turned and left. Without needing Zhou Weiqing to open his mouth, Wei Feng motioned for the Peerless Battalion to move aside.</p><br/><p>When Shen Yi saw her heavy cavalry troops all in their underpants, she almost fainted. As a young lady who lived a relatively sheltered life in that regard, seeing a whole horde of men almost fully naked, how could she stand it. Without looking back, she ran off ahead.</p><br/><p>Watching the company of soldiers leave in their sorry state, Zhou Weiqing gave the order for the Peerless Battalion to return to camp.</p><br/><p>Black Bear sidled over and said: \u201cBattalion Commander, you don\u2019t really like men do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at him, then licked his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Father, I, loves men, especially such robust and strong men like you. Tonight, you come to my tent all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh? Noooo!\u201d Black Bear yelled out and ran off.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a cold humph, turning back to the other Peerless Battalion soldiers and shouted an order: \u201cBeat up Black Bear, so much so that his own mother won\u2019t even recognize him. If you do so, I\u2019ll cook some meat for you all to eat tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that there would be meat to eat, the group of brigand soldiers instantly became a pack of wolves that smelled blood, their eyes lighting up instantly as they charged forward. Before long, Black Bear\u2019s cries of agony rang out. A brave man cannot withstand against a horde of foxes...</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dare like men, \u2018Your Mother, I[1. Think I\u2019ve mentioned this before, literal translation, more like how they say Your Father, I, more like an arrogant way of saying I]\u2019 will chop yours off.\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s angry voice rang out.</p><br/><p>Wei Feng and the others, who had been watching Black Bear get beaten up with an amused look on their faces, instantly turned to look at her with a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? I\u2019m a woman, what about it?\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er yelled with a mix of anger and exasperation. She could not stand Zhou Weiqing being thought of as a homosexual by these subordinates, so she had unthinkingly admitted she was a woman, and she also resumed using her normal voice.</p><br/><p>Wei Feng stared at Zhou Weiqing, his jaw agape, before finally saying: \u201cBattalion Commander, you actually brought your wife along to join the army?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing coughed once embarrassedly, but Shangguan Fei\u2019er jumped to speak before he could. \u201cLittle Fatty, look, this Peerless Battalion of ours seems to lack a trainer! In order to let them raise their power as soon as possible, let me be their trainer, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, Shangguan Fei\u2019er lifted her hand, stripping off her mask and revealing her face of peerless beauty.</p><br/><p>The Peerless Battalion ruffian soldiers had been cooped up here for a long time, and besides using the \u2018ten women\u2019 and the \u2018left right ultimate skill\u2019 [1. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) I translated that literally, I\u2019m sure you guys can figure out what that means heh. The \u2018left right ultimate skill\u2019 or  Zuo You Hu Bo Skill\u00a0 is the famed skill from the Jin Yong stories Legend of Condor Heroes/ Return of Condor Heroes where he is able to use both hands to strike out with different styles of martial arts] to deal with their physiological problems, there was no other way. Let alone a woman, even a sow would have been a cordial sight to their eyes.</p><br/><p>With such an unbelievable beauty appearing right before their eyes, Wei Feng and the others couldn\u2019t help but stare, some with less control even drooling in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I beautiful\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er said with a saccharine sweetness.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing palmed his forehead and groaned, quickly turning to leave. When the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace Little Demon Girl acted like this, there was nothing good that would come out of it, he had better leave as soon as possible. Before doing so, he specially dragged Wei Feng away as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cBattalion Commander, why did you drag me away?\u201d Wei Feng said resentfully, his eyes still fixed greedily upon Shangguan Fei\u2019er as he was forced away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, you better come with me now.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said softly, forcibly dragging him away.</p><br/><p>Wei Feng was angry in his heart, thinking to himself: <i>Even if that is your woman, can\u2019t I even have a look?!</i></p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t long before that anger vanished. After being dragged about twenty metres away, he suddenly saw Green Wolf and the others as if somehow provoked, leaping towards Shangguan Fei\u2019er as a group.</p><br/><p>This time, Wei Feng was dumbfounded, stricken with fear. He had experienced and seen Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength, and if his woman were to be attacked just like that, how could Zhou Weiqing let them off like that?</p><br/><p>However, to Wei Feng\u2019s surprise, Zhou Weiqing did not even bother looking back, continuing to drag him towards his tent. At that moment, the group of pouncing men were all sent flying back one by one like cannon balls.</p><br/><p>A symphony of painful cries rang out in a rhythm, increasingly louder. Wei Feng could see Shangguan Fei\u2019er moving in a flash, barely catching her illusory figure as she jumped around, as if juggling the group of them. Anyone who came within three yards of her would be sent flying savagely.</p><br/><p>The scene blackened before him. Zhou Weiqing had successfully dragged him into the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cBattalion Commander\u2026 that\u2026\u201d Wei Feng said dully, still in shock.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head helplessly and said: \u201cNow then you know right\u2026 Provoking that Little Demon Girl will never end well. Do you think my strength is abnormal, not like a Four Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master?\u201d Wei Feng nodded; after all it was the truth.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing continued: \u201cFei\u2019er is even more abnormal than I am\u2026 and more so, her cultivation level is at the six Jewels. You can think for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng shivered involuntarily. By now, how could he not understand? \u201cBattalion Commander, thank you for saving me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cLooks like Green WOolf and the others will not be able to join tonight\u2019s operation. Wei Feng, do you have the map of the northern armies, the more detailed the better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng\u2019s heart skipped a beat and he said: \u201cBattalion Commander, why do you need a map? Are you trying to get revenge on the Sixteenth Regiment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a disdainful humph and said: \u201cRevenge? What good is that? Didn\u2019t I say before, our Peerless Battalion will not do anything that does not profit us? Didn\u2019t you hear me say that I\u2019ll let our brothers have meat to eat tomorrow, if we don\u2019t go out and get some, how are they going to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cBattalion Commander\u2026 you\u2026 aren\u2019t going to rob the grain depot are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said exasperatedly: \u201cRob? What rob? We are going to collect. Originally, I was going to do so three days later, but since Shen Bu has given us such a big gift today, we shall take action tonight, collect some supplies and let our brothers have a good meal first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Audacious to the extreme; that was Wei Feng\u2019s appraisal of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Seeing his hesitant eyes, Zhou Weiqing clapped Wei Feng on the shoulder and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it will be fine. Quick, bring me the map to look at first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng had no choice but to leave quickly to do so, leaving Zhou Weiqing alone in the tent. The cries of agony from outside were still unending, evoking bad memories and sending chills down Zhou Weiqing\u2019s spine. Luckily, he was not the one screaming out right now\u2026</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, the tent flapped opened and Shangguan Fei\u2019er entered. \u201cThat was boring, what a bunch of weaklings, they can\u2019t even take a beating. Just a few hits and they can\u2019t even get up\u2026 Little Fatty, I\u2019m just about having fun now, come on out, let\u2019s spar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stared at her, dumbfounded. Currently, due to a large amount of exertions, her beautiful face had a pink flush, looking valiant and healthy. Although she was wearing an ordinary army uniform, her radiant beauty was just too stunning.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhh\u2026 Fei\u2019er, tonight we have a big operation to run, it will be fun. Do you want to come along?\u201d</p><br/><p>With an impassive look, Zhou Weiqing swiftly changed the topic. He did not want to end up in the same state as those fellows outside.</p><br/><p>As expected, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s interest was piqued. \u201cBig operation? Doing what? Of course I want to go!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

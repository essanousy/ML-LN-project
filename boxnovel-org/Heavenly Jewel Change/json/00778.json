However, this experience to her was similar to an old unmarried woman encountering a sedan. A stimulating novelty.</p><br/><p>Besides, after entering the spatial realms, the Elven Queen could only sense a soft aura with mildly supreme dignity enveloping her body. This energy had completely outmatched the existence of her Natural Energy. She and Zhou Weiqing were surrounded by pure gold brilliance. Zhou Weiqing was now undoubtedly using Saint Energy to protect them both as they traveled through the spatial realms.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing achieved Spatial Travel by using Blink. The most important point is to lock down onto a target. For example, the last time he brought his wives on a collective Blink through the skies, all he needed was a position within his sight for a successful Blink. This was the power of Saint Energy. Naturally, it was also due to his strong cultivation base.</p><br/><p>However, this was different. This was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first try at this sort of Spatial Travel. He was entirely relying on the Divine Thought placed on the Elven Princess to determine a target. If he succeeds, then not only would they be able to travel back and forth immediately from the Elf Tribe\u2019s sealed land, and return to the Boundless Mainland, they could even appear right in front of the Elven Princess. This was obviously the most efficient method.</p><br/><p>Besides, Zhou Weiqing was not at the least bit afraid of the Divine Thought disappearing from the Elven Princess\u2019 body. First of all, he was confident in his own Divine Thought. Secondly, he had locked down their position prior to their transmission. Even if they lost the Elven Princess\u2019 coordinates, he could still take the Elven Queen back to their starting point. So, he was extremely confident.</p><br/><p>The feeling of traveling through space was very fascinating. Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense the rapid depletion of his Saint Energy. This depletion was faster than when he was flying, especially when he returned to Boundless Mainland, crossing from the Elf Tribe\u2019s lands with Spatial Travel. That was when the depletion of Saint Energy was greatest as if he had used up around ten percent of his Saint Energy in an instant.</p><br/><p>However, what Zhou Weiqing did not know was that at this moment, the Elven Queen\u2019s was rather amazed. The Elven Queen herself did not have any Spatial Attributes. Naturally, she could not use Spatial Travel. However, this did not mean that she didn\u2019t understand Spatial Travel.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen had lived in this world for nearly a thousand years, so she had definitely seen a great deal. She herself could not travel through spatial realms, but she had encountered cultivators with this ability. To her knowledge, even when a Heavenly God Cultivator had received comprehension of the spatial laws, Spatial Travel cannot go on any longer than five seconds. Otherwise, even a Heavenly God cultivator with such powerful Heavenly Energy would be consumed and exhausted and end up being lost, staying in a separate realm forever.</p><br/><p>However, when Zhou Weiqing took her into Spatial Travel, this one moment of labor was already more than five seconds, even though she did not calculate it all precisely.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is this the magic of Saint Energy?\u2019 The Elven Queen secretly exclaimed in her thoughts.</p><br/><p>The reality of it appeared to be that way; the pure perfection of Saint Energy allows Zhou Weiqing to experience a far smaller depletion in his energy when using Spatial Travel than the average Heavenly Jewel Master. Regardless of the situation, Saint Energy would automatically absorb the surrounding attributes to replenish him. During the process of traveling through a separate realm, it has naturally absorbed Spatial Energy. In turn, this lessened Zhou Weiqing\u2019s personal consumption of his energy. Otherwise, Zhou Weiqing would not have been able to withstand the strain long ago.</p><br/><p>However, even so, during the short travel time, Zhou Weiqing still released his own Dragon-tiger Transformation twin blades. The twin blades splayed out from his back, to better absorb the Spatial Energy, increasing the possibilities for him to remain in a separate realm for a little while longer.</p><br/><p>Because the Elven Princess\u2019 kidnapping had only happened a short while ago, the opposition has already taken the Elven Princess far away from the Elf Tribe\u2019s sealed land. Zhou Weiqing could obviously tear out of the spatial realms to rest for a moment before a second transmission, but that would be so embarrassing! He was already planning on showing off his power to the Elven Queen in order to receive the Elf Tribe\u2019s cooperation. So, how could he not let her witness his power? How would he know that the Elven Queen\u2019s impression of him had already completely exceeded his Cultivation Base? The Elven Queen has instantly recognized him to be more powerful than she was. Simply put, an overestimation.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound her.\u201d Zhou Weiqing softly exclaimed with excitement. Just as the Elven Queen was still in shock over this fellow\u2019s ability to talk while traveling through spatial realms, the pair tore out of the spatial realms in a flash, and once again returned to the normal world.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the sky, a crack appeared all of a sudden. Then, two figures tore out, coincidentally blocking the way of a man in black, flying through the sky in a hurried manner.</p><br/><p>The man in black was flying very fast, but his powers of perception were rather substantial. He realized that something wasn\u2019t right at once, as the spatial realms in front of them tore all of a sudden. Then, two figures emerged out of thin air, thoroughly giving him a fright. His instinct was to escape in a flash, trying to avoid the two by continuing his flight. Unfortunately, he was their target.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill trying to escape?\u201d Zhou Weiqing hated the fellow bitterly. This bastard made him the scapegoat, and he nearly started a war with the Elf Tribe. The dark gold light illuminated around him like waves, equipping him in Ringless Ground Purging set. His figure flashed, as though migrating from a different realm. At the same time when his body reappeared in thin air, the Dual God Strength Hammers came smashing towards him. At that moment, Zhou Weiqing was using a hundred percent of his strength.</p><br/><p>The man in black was not ordinary either. Faced with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s close range of attack, his expression changed, and he raised both arms at the same time, creating a whirling move. A layer of bizarre and twisted, shapeless halos immediately appeared, blocking Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual God Strength Hammers.</p><br/><p>Time Attribute. Zhou Weiqing had already known that this fellow had the ability of Time Attribute. Seeing the opposition use a skill that had a similar effect to space-time turbulence to block his hammer, the corners of his lips curled into a cold smile.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the Time Attribute was one of the Four Great Saint Attributes, and a powerful destructive force at best. Generally speaking, physical attacks would be useless when faced with space-time turbulence and would be pushed aside. However, were Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual God Strength Hammers that easy to deal with?</p><br/><p>After assembling the Ringless Ground Purging Set, Zhou Weiqing was already included with an extra ability after the set was completed. For example, the ability to eradicate everything. In other words, the power of the Ringless Ground Purging set can collide with any attack from any energy or attribute, rendering the effects from the enemies\u2019 energy skills useless.</p><br/><p>A loud bang rang aloud in the clash, and the black shadow groaned, like a cannon blast, and smashed heavily downwards. You could even hear the bones in both his arms crack.</p><br/><p>The power of the amplified Ringless Ground Purging Set was absolutely terrifying, even a Heavenly God Cultivator would not willingly clash with Zhou Weiqing. This was the first time the set was ever displayed; no one had ever laid eyes on it. The bright gold armor was not simply for a dazzling sight. It contained a powerful destructive force; even ten legendary armor sets would be considered second best.</p><br/><p>The man in black, aside from feeling shocked, had his body suspended in mid-air, twisted into different angles. Suddenly, his figure retreated one kilometer away, and his newly broken arms suddenly returned to normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Time Reversal?\u201d Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in shock. That\u2019s right, the enemy used a Time Reversal and judging by his looks, he\u2019s managed to control Time Reversal. He managed to manipulate it well, to time travel to a few seconds before the attack. Thus, he not only managed to avoid Zhou Weiqing\u2019s next attack but restored his arms as well.</p><br/><p>As a Saint Attribute, how could the Time Attribute lack its own special mystical properties?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he had crossed paths with Zhou Weiqing, and the latter also had the Time Attribute. So, he naturally knew how to deal with Time Reversal. The enemy was about to use Time Reversal once, but if he allowed him to continue using it this way, wouldn\u2019t the enemy turn into a hard-to-kill cockroach?</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to make his move, the Elven Queen had already attacked. Both of them appeared from thin air and faced this man in black. Naturally, the Elven Queen would know that her daughter had fallen into this fellow\u2019s hands. Zhou Weiqing launched the first attack, and in the next moment, a layer of soft, green light was already released from the Elven Queen\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>This green light was not directed towards the enemy straight away but dispersed in all directions. At that moment, the surrounding turned completely green, giving off a feeling infused with vitality.</p><br/><p>However, this did not give the man in green a wonderful feeling at all. The feeling of vitality was still there, but in the air, aside from the six types of natural attribute elements, the other elements and attributes were expelled. Naturally, this included the Time Attribute. Besides, for the natural attributes within the green spatial realm, only the Elven Queen held control. He would not be able to amplify anything.</p><br/><p>This is the Natural Divine Territory of the Elven Queen. After her cultivation base had reached the Heavenly God stage, the largest difference she had from Heavenly Emperor stage, was that she could solidify environmental effects in the outside world. This type of solidification became a special ability, known as Divine Territory. Every Heavenly God cultivator had their own exclusive Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>In the Elven Queen\u2019s Divine Territory, you could fight back against the effects of her Divine Territory, only if you had Divine Territory abilities and were able to contend against her. Alternatively, the only other way was to breakthrough out of it, or defeat the Elven Queen in her Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>When the fearsome aura from the Demon God was previously far too powerful during the Elven Queen\u2019s fight with Zhou Weiqing and due to the fact that the powerful Evil Energy created a vague existence like a Divine Territory, the Elven Queen did not use her Divine Territory. She knew that using it would be of no use but at this moment, using it to limit this man in black was no problem. This was because both she and Zhou Weiqing saw it clearly \u2013 this man in black only had eleven Heavenly Jewels in his hand. He was a Heavenly Emperor cultivator.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

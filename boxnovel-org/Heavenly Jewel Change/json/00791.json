Heck, it could even drive the Elven Queen to experience a quantum leap in her power and strength. At this moment, these Elders had no idea how powerful the Elven Queen was now.</p><br/><p>\u201cRise, my people,\u201d the Elven Queen\u2019s soft voice resonated through the air, allowing every Elf to hear her very clearly. Her soft, pleasant voice elicited a willing submissiveness from all the Elves.</p><br/><p>No Elves dared to disobey her command; all of them rose at once.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen looked at her people with gentleness in her eyes, the way a mother would look at her children. The golden light on her body slowly became more intense and even Zhou Weiqing who was standing by her side was also brimming with this rich golden layer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy people, I believe you\u2019ve all witnessed this miracle with your own eyes. Yes, that\u2019s right! Our Elven Ancient Tree of Life had finally evolved again after thousands of years. This was definitely a God-like spectacle for us Elves.</p><br/><p>With that simple sentence alone, the Elven Queen instantly evoked the emotions of all the other Elves. In an instance, strong cheers burst out amongst the people. Strong excitement could be seen in their eyes as all of them had their gazes fixed on her. Zhou Weiqing could even feel the strong faith displayed by the Elven people. It was apparent that all of them were concentrating on the Elven Queen now.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen looked at her excited people with a smile on her face. After a long while, she slowly lifted her left hand as she gestured to stop. No matter how many Elves were present, all the voices immediately died down upon her mere gesture.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think all of us must be very curious about what had happened when I was gone and the reasons behind the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution. I\u2019ll tell you now but before that, let me introduce someone to you. The human being that is standing beside me right now; he is Zhou Weiqing, the greatest Heavenly Jewel Master amongst the humans of the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>While she was uttering these words, the Elven Queen turned her attention towards Zhou Weiqing and the excited look in the Elves\u2019 eyes immediately turned to a look of shock. At once, all their gazes landed on him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing bowed his head slightly to acknowledge the Elves. As he shared a spiritual connection with the Elven Queen, he was very clear about what she was going to do next. So as all sorts of feelings welled up in his heart; he then continued to follow her lead.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen continued, \u201cI\u2019m sure everybody must be wondering why I am holding on to a male human\u2019s hand now. It\u2019s all thanks to him that our Ancient Tree of Life could finally evolve. It was also he, who helped rescue my daughter as well. He\u2019s a great benefactor of us Elves and he\u2019ll forever be the most precious ally of our tribe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard the Elven Queen\u2019s words, the expressions on all of the Elves changed at once. The look that they gave him had also changed as well.</p><br/><p>Was it really this human being who helped the Ancient Tree of Life evolve? Disbelief initially filled their minds, but immediately, their reasoning reminded them that the Elven Queen would never play a fool.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen added, \u201cThough it may be hard for all of you to believe what I\u2019ve just said, I have to tell you that this is indeed a fact. That fateful day, it was Zhou Weiqing who chased the enemy who kidnapped my daughter and defeated him. When the enemy took the princess hostage, he did not mind being misunderstood by me and still gave his best to protect our little princess. Yet, due to my misunderstanding, I\u2019ve seriously injured him and though we had succeeded in killing the enemy \u2013 he was already dying at that point.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they heard her words, a look of guilt could be seen on the twelve Elder\u2019s faces. These Elves were actually kind in nature. At that moment, they had kept Zhou Weiqing\u2019s women as their prisoners, yet, he still made such a huge sacrifice just to rescue the princess for their sake.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen continued to say, \u201cWe Elves will never repay kindness with revenge. How could I possibly watch the rescuer of my daughter die in front of me? At that moment, Weiqing\u2019s injury was very serious and was in great desperation \u2013 I had no choice but to use the Elven Heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as these words left her mouth, all of the Elves were stunned with astonishment. This was because all of them knew what an Elven Heart meant to an Elf. At once, clamor burst out among the people.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuiet! Let Her Majesty finish her words!\u201d The Elven First Elder exclaimed loudly without warning \u2013 a strong tyrannical aura spread out from him all at once. The Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution and the Life Saint Energy that the Elven Queen had emitted told him that things were not as simple as it seemed.</p><br/><p>The First Elder had a prestigious status among the Elves. Under his pressure, all the Elves quieted down again.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen seemed to have foreseen such a reaction to take place. She continued to appear calm and composed until the racket died down again before continuing to speak calmly, \u201cYou must have thought that I\u2019ve sacrificed too much for him, am I right? However, I can assure you that what I\u2019ve repaid is akin to a drop of water in the vast sea, as compared to the things that he\u2019s done for all of us. Just the Ancient Tree of Life behind me alone is more than enough to prove my words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter Weiqing was saved by me, he found me to be in an extremely weak state and immediately, he used his Saint Energy to heal me at once. The Saint Energy is the most powerful attribute in the entire world and it possesses the power of creation, also known as the Genesis Energy. My life is connected to the Ancient Tree of Life; it was all because of Weiqing who had spared no effort in the Saint Energy infusion, that we finally have this evolution right in front of our eyes. I can tell you that I\u2019ve already risen to become an empress and my Elven Heart can actually be used more than once. Not only that, the effects of the Elven Heart had completely been embedded in my body now. All of this has been made possible by Zhou Weiqing right here.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was speaking, the six transparent wings of the Elven Queen, no, the Elven Empress, was more visible now. All six had suddenly been magnified under the golden light, allowing her people to see them more clearly.</p><br/><p>The six wings represented the fact that the Elven Queen had now successfully evolved into the Elven Empress. In the history of the Elf Tribe, it had already been several thousand years ago since they last saw the emergence of an Elven Empress. Not only did an Elven Empress need to achieve the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier, it could only also be made possible if the Ancient Tree of Life had evolved.</p><br/><p>An invisible majestic force radiated from the Elven Empress\u2019s body. The pressuring aura was so strong that all of the Elves knelt down to pay their respects once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s order is my order as well. As the ally of us Elves, he\u2019ll be able to use all the resources in the Elf Tribe from today onwards. Going against this order will be considered treason!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not only the Elves that appeared to be astonished but even Zhou Weiqing\u2019s girls too, were taken aback by this announcement.</p><br/><p>Although they had already guessed that Zhou Weiqing had managed to strike a relationship with the Elf tribe the moment they saw him and the Elven Empress holding hands, it had never occurred to them that the Elven Empress would exalt Zhou Weiqing on such a high pedestal. One could even say that his position was now equivalent to a King in the Elf Tribe. Just that single sentence uttered by the Elven Empress \u201call resources can be used by Zhou Weiqing\u201d itself had already shaken them to the core. Of course, they also believed that there must be an affair between Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Empress. They would never believe that there was nothing going on between the two of them at all.</p><br/><p>However, as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s women, they could not voice their displeasure at this moment, no matter how jealous and dissatisfied they felt. What they could only do were to throw daggers onto a certain somebody\u2019s back with their eyes.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Elven Queen finally released Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand before holding out a hand to him, \u201cWeiqing, please come to the Ancient Tree of Life for a visit with your wives. I think we still have matters on hand to talk about among us all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding his head, Zhou Weiqing replied, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the leadership of the Elven Empress, he and the five girls entered directly into the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s tree crown. As for the rest of the Elves, they seemed to be still rather dazed and had not recovered from their shock yet. Of course, they did not need to take long to regain their senses. Now that the Elven Queen had evolved into the Elven Empress, nobody dared to go against any decision or order that she had decreed.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A day later\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty Zhou, this is not your style at all! Is there really nothing between you and the Elven Empress?\u201d Flying in mid-air, Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at Zhou Weiqing, who had a look of disbelief in her eyes.</p><br/><p>After a day of having a secret meeting with the Elven Empress, they finally departed for their return journey. The day when the secret meeting had just begun, the Elven Empress could clearly feel Zhou Weiqing\u2019s awkwardness. Immediately, she proceeded to explain to the five girls that she was merely a friend and ally for Zhou Weiqing. She even made a promise that she would be willing to marry her daughter off to his son, if he had one in the future.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the Elven Princess had absorbed Saint Energy that was too pure, so she still remained in a hibernation state. Under the shrouding of the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s immense Life Energy, she was slowly taking in the Saint Energy. She would most likely experience a rapid growth, but to a human being, the long lifespan of an Elf was more than enough for her to wait until the day Zhou Weiqing\u2019s future son becomes an adult.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing going on! I\u2019m an honest person, and didn\u2019t Her Majesty already explain to all of you?\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked at the five girls pitifully.</p><br/><p>However, even the most gentle Shangguan Bing\u2019er, had her eyes full of contempt.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er scoffed coldly, \u201cWho knows if she was just deliberately covering it up for you? If you two are really not having an affair at all, why would she agree to move the entire Elf Tribe to our Heavenly Bow Empire so easily? She even\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was at a loss whether to cry or to laugh, \u201cI\u2019m really innocent! Darling Fei\u2019er, I am really not having an affair this time! Did you realize that you\u2019ve been interrogating me ever since we left the Elf Tribe? Please, drop this. I\u2019m already contented enough having the five of you accompanying me. I really don\u2019t want to bring any unnecessary trouble to myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Witch had been staying close by his side this entire time as she needed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s guidance during the flight. With a chuckle, she asked, \u201cIs that true? That\u2019s a f*cking Elven Empress, ya know? Even I can\u2019t help but feel proud if you have such an amazing partner. Are you sure you\u2019re really able to let her go?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

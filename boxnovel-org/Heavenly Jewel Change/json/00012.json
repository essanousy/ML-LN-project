Ordinary Physical and Elemental Jewel Masters can also register here and get the plaque, but they will not have the robes which represent Heavenly Jewel Masters. When going through with Skill-Storing, Heavenly Jewel Masters can enjoy a 10% discount. Every additional gem increase promotion will mean another 10% discount. Therefore, if you have the opportunity to come alone to carry on with Skill-Storing, you must remember to register any promotion first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said in surprise: \u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that those Heavenly Jewel Masters with 9 Jewels do not need to pay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er shook her head, saying: \u201cI do not know either, but it is rumoured that those Heavenly Jewel Masters who are above 6 Jewels seldom go to the Skill Storing Palace anymore. The actual reason is not for those Heavenly Jewel Masters of our level to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBattalion commander, can I ask how much money does our Skill Storing require?\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart was really itching to try it out, having the means of growing stronger right in front of him, yet being unable to do so due to money, this made him feel very out of sorts in his heart. Although his father was very honest and did not have much money, but his godfather was after all the ruler of their country, furthermore he was now a Heavenly Jewel Master, in the future when he returned to the Heavenly Bow Empire he should be able to ask for some money for Skill-Storing.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said: \u201cOne attempt at Skill Storing is about 500 gold coins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing blinked, \u201c500 gold coins, that\u2019s not really very expensive!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked at him coldly, \u201cThe success rate has less than 1%. If your luck is bad, you may not even succeed after trying several hundred times. The worst thing is the loss of the time, a Jewel Master can only go through one Skill Storing every day. The price I mentioned is also only for the ordinary Heavenly Beasts. If we are talking about the higher level Zun Beasts or Zong Beasts, the price is astronomical. However, the success rate is slightly higher for them, and their skills will also be generally better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was struck speechless; to his knowledge, the annual tax revenue of Heavenly Bow City was only 500,000 gold coins. No wonder Shangguan Bing\u2019er mentioned that their empire was not able to support many Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Heavenly Beasts are similar to us and have some sort of ranking. Alright, let\u2019s forget about Skill Storing for now. Let\u2019s go to the Consolidating Equipment Master that you mentioned.\u201d This was the first time that Zhou Weiqing realised how important money was. The cultivation of Heavenly Jewel Masters was more difficult than he had thought.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded, saying: \u201cNow you know why I always place so much importance on saving money. Honestly, even if our Heavenly Bow Empire has that many Heavenly Jewel Masters, our empire is not able to support us all. After all, our country is really too tiny compared to the huge empires like Fei Li empire or Bai Da Empire. Without our own Skill-Storing Palace, it is impossible to organize a team of formidable Heavenly Jewel Masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find a place to stay first. After we wash up a little and change, we can go look for a good Consolidating Equipment Master.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er thought after thinking a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I hear correctly? Did a steel tree bloom*?\u201d Zhou Weiqing said as he looked at her in surprise.</p><br/><p><em>*TL: A direct translation of , an idiom meaning something almost impossible happening \u2013 he is referring to her being miserly and willing to spend money on a room to stay.</em></p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s beautiful face turned red, \u201cAre you courting death? Do you want to stay or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStay, of course I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>After fifteen minutes, the two of them were standing in the hall of a small little hotel. This hotel was really small and only had one level; besides its cleanliness, Zhou Weiqing could not find another merit in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, please gives us a room.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er told the 50-year-old hotel boss standing behind the counter.</p><br/><p>The hotel boss looked at the two of them and gave them a lascivious smile, before handing over a key covered with embroidery. He said: \u201cRoom 1, one silver coin for two days. You young people, must learn to control yourselves heh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking the key, Shangguan Bing\u2019er just turned unemotionally and walked off. but Zhou Weiqing actually gesticulated to the boss and showed off his muscle, \u201cBoss, what sort of eyes do you have! Look at me so vigorous and healthy, why would I need to control?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou \u2014 Little \u2014 Fatty \u2014 !!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Zhou Weiqing answered quickly, and rushed to follow.</p><br/><p>Following Shangguan Bing\u2019er, he asked with a sad face: \u201cBattalion Commander, we finally entered a city and you only took one room, you won\u2019t make me sleep outside on the streets to save money right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er shot a look at him, saying: \u201cYou and I will stay in this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was stunned instantaneously, his brain dazed as he opened his mouth, his saliva flowing out, and he muttered: \u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026 happiness comes so quickly. Battalion Commander, are we advancing too quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty Zhou, I have endured you for too long!\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er gave a low roar that made Zhou Weiqing shut up instantly; he knew that knows, generally before a tigress attacks she would roar like that.</p><br/><p>The room was not very big, but was at least clean, it actually had a bathroom for washing and excretion, and could be considered fully equipped.</p><br/><p>There was only a single bed in the room, and Shangguan Bing\u2019er dropped off her backpack before sitting on the bed. At this moment, her beautiful face revealed her weariness, and Zhou Weiqing who was looking at her felt a pain in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty Zhou. Come here.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er beckoned to Zhou Weiqing who was standing at the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrh.\u201d Having angered her earlier, this time Zhou Weiqing came honestly, his face a picture of simple sincerity.</p><br/><p>Before he could even come to a stop, Shangguan Bing\u2019er moved all of a sudden, her speed pushed to the limit in that very instance, Zhou Weiqing was sure that in that moment she had simultaneously used both her Physical and Elemental Jewels. All he saw was a flash in front of his eyes, and suddenly both his hands were gripped and his arms were pushed down hard onto the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBattalion Commander, don\u2019t be so violent, I won\u2019t resist.\u201d Feeling the soft smoothness of Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s hands, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart instantly became lascivious. However, in the next instant he was unable to maintain that lascivious-ness.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er took out a string from an nowhere, and quickly tied up Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands and feet, then fastening him firmly to bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBattalion commander, did you like this? You won\u2019t be using the leather whip and candle right? I\u2019m afraid of pain!\u201d Even at this time, this rascal could not control his mouth.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er gave him a quick kick, \u201cIf you talk more trash, I\u2019ll take your sock and shove it in your mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m shutting up now!\u201d Nobody knew clearer than Zhou Weiqing how dirty his socks were. Probably if he took them off and threw them at the wall, they might even stick on\u2026 if those were shoved into his mouth \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A moment later, Zhou Weiqing finally understood why Shangguan Bing\u2019er tied him up, as he heard the sound of running water. This beautiful lady Battalion Commander was taking a bath now. Obviously, tying him up was to prevent this rascal from peeping. In truth, Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s actions were definitely correct. Even tied up there, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mind couldn\u2019t help but drift off into a daydream, as lascivious pictures fluttered across his mind. After all, he had actually seen her before\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

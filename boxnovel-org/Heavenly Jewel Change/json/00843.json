The light gradually faded until a golden crown appeared on top of Hui Yao\u2019s head before it turned into a golden energy that gradually sank into Hui Yao\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>This was the Dragon Emperor\u2019s legacy. It would only be passed down to the next generation of the new emperor when the older generation of Dragon Emperor was about to pass on. This was the Dragon Clan\u2019s legacy of giving place to the new.</p><br/><p>After the Dragon Emperor had completed the process, the radiance in his eyes clearly became dimmer as a large amount of fresh blood surged out from his body continuously and tainted the entire seal on the ground red.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing.\u201d The Dragon Emperor did not look at Hui Yao anymore. There was more that he wished to hand over to this junior of his! However, time was not on his side. In his perception, the disaster that might befall the entire mainland was even more important than the continuity of the Dragon Clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, Dragon Emperor.\u201d Zhou Weiqing exclaimed with great respect. Meanwhile, his Saint Energy had already completely circulated and connected with the twelve Divine Beasts. With the support of the Saint Energy and the Elven Empress\u2019 Life Saint Energy, the Divine Beasts were healing at a shocking speed.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing was not the Dragon Emperor after all. Although he possessed tremendous Saint Energy, and his cultivation base was even more powerful than the Dragon Emperor, he knew nothing about the Netherworld seal\u2019s magic formation before his eyes. He did not know how to wield the magic formation.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor muttered, \u201cFrom now on, everyone must follow Weiqing\u2019s order. After I\u2019m gone, all of you must respect Weiqing like how you respected me. Otherwise, I\u2019ll never be at ease even when I\u2019m in another world, do all of you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even when he was already on the brink of death, and he was about to arrive at the end of his life, all the Divine Beasts still simultaneously lowered their heads towards the Dragon Emperor the moment he displayed his courage and power. This was an emperor\u2019s prestige.</p><br/><p>The Divine Beasts\u2019 eyes had reddened. Many of them were shedding tears. They had been together with the Dragon Emperor for at least a few thousand years, it could be said that the Dragon Emperor was like a teacher or a father to them. Aside from the husband and wife, Hui Yao and Duo Si who had just joined, almost every single one of the Divine Beasts served the Dragon Emperor willingly after they were subdued or rescued by the Dragon Emperor.</p><br/><p>Once the Divine Beasts heard the Dragon Emperor\u2019s words, many of them could not refrain from sobbing aloud. The cavern was instantly filled with a sorrowful atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo all of you understand what I\u2019ve just said?\u201d The Dragon Emperor spoke in a lowered voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty,\u201d All of the Divine Beasts answered the Dragon Emperor\u2019s question with a voice that almost sounded like a sad cry.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor only nodded before he continued speaking to Zhou Weiqing, \u201cWeiqing, I don\u2019t have much time here. From now on, you shall do as I bid. With the existence of your Saint Energy, it\u2019s absolutely possible to restore the seal to perfection. Very well, we shall begin now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor\u2019s gaze became solemn as he spoke. He appeared just like a healthy elder. There was still a sense of strong prestige that remained on his body. He did not seem like he was on the brink of death at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe magic formation was created together by me and the former Elven Empress. There were only six Divine Beasts that aided me back in the day, out of which there\u2019s only three left currently out of the six Divine Beasts. I\u2019m not going to dwell on the magic formation\u2019s principle and structure. You\u2019ll only need to launch the magic formation. My blood has already tainted the entire magic formation so the ultimate bloodline that\u2019s destroyed by the Nether Lord earlier has been restored. Following this, you\u2019ll need to complete the connection between all the Divine Beasts and the magic formation. Meanwhile, you\u2019re the heart of this entire seal magic formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing listened quietly. The Dragon Emperor\u2019s voice had already begun to turn weaker as he spoke. It was apparent that he could die at any given moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe heart of the seal is at the position where I am now. It\u2019s also precisely the position that was destroyed by the Nether Lord earlier. This position will be empty after my death. You\u2019re going to divide your Divine Thought into twelve portions. In order to complete the connection with the Divine Beasts, you need to completely loosen your state of mind. After that, you\u2019ll lead them into infusing their energies into your body, and use yourself as the core and foundation. Convert all their energies into your Saint Energy then shoot it towards my position that\u2019s also the core of the magic formation. The entire magic formation will be triggered from that. This is not a complicated process. I can sense that your body has a similar bloodline to our Dragon Clan\u2019s Dragon Emperor Bloodlines. I\u2019m going to strengthen the Dragon Emperor Bloodlines in your body before I die so the magic formation will recognize you as the new leader. Quick, let us begin. I can\u2019t hold on much longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor\u2019s enormous body trembled violently as he spoke. Streaks upon streaks of Destruction Energy emerged from his body continuously. It was apparent that the remnant of his body would lose its suppressive effect on the Nether Lord soon.</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord could naturally sense the Dragon Emperor\u2019s actions. Although it would take time and tremendous energy to restore the seal, the Nether Lord would have no other opportunity to escape anymore once it was truly restored. That was why he no longer cared about exhausting his Ultimate Destruction Energy anymore. He used his powerful Ultimate Destruction Energy to launch an attack at the Dragon Emperor in an attempt to break through the seal that used the Dragon Emperor\u2019s body as a medium to eliminate Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er first.</p><br/><p>However, the Dragon Emperor had already made the decision to pay the price with his life. Even if the Nether Lord devoted all his effort and resources, it was still not an easy task to completely annihilate the Dragon Emperor. After all, they had dealt with each other for a long time now, and the Dragon Emperor understood the Nether Lord very well. Moreover, the Dragon Emperor had already gotten accustomed to the Destruction Energy since a long time ago. In addition to the Dragon Emperor\u2019s fire element energy that was already burning at the strongest point, he was not just combusting his life force, but his Maximum-Level Heavenly God Tier <sup>1 </sup>Heavenly Nucleus that was firmly wrapped around the Nether Lord. As long as the Dragon Emperor\u2019s life did not burn out, it was utterly impossible for the Nether Lord to charge out of the seal.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing dared not slow down. The gaze in his eyes was dull as the powerful energy from his Divine Thought spread out instantly. He was very intelligent for he did not directly divide his Divine Thought into twelve portions. He was going to connect to the twelve Great Divine Beasts. The combination of the Divine Beasts\u2019 Divine Thoughts was unimaginably powerful and far exceeded Zhou Weiqing\u2019s. Most importantly, Zhou Weiqing was not familiar with the Netherworld\u2019s magic formation. If the connection failed, there was no way Zhou Weiqing could possibly form a connection again.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Zhou Weiqing only divided his Divine Thought into two. Then, he unleashed it towards the husband and wife, Hui Yao and Duo Si, the moment he came up.</p><br/><p>The two enormous dragons and Zhou Weiqing had the closest relationship. They had known each other for such a long time, and they were very familiar with each other\u2019s auras. Moreover, it was not a problem for Zhou Weiqing to form a Divine Thought connection with the two enormous dragons due to the existence of the Dragon Emperor Bloodlines in his body.</p><br/><p>Hence, Zhou Weiqing made such a choice. In no time at all, his Divine Thought came in contact with Hui Yao and Duo Si.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could feel two waves of vast Divine Thoughts instantly flowed from the other party. The Divine Thought was very gentle, and there was no conflict between the Divine Thoughts just like he had predicted. The moment Hui Yao and his wife sensed the Divine Thought that Zhou Weiqing passed to them, they immediately completed the connection with him. Two faint golden glows could be indistinctly seen emitting out from the middle of Hui Yao and Duo Si\u2019s heads. It was similar to two silk threads that were released in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing used his own to guide their Divine Thoughts into connecting with his body. The moment the two strands of Divine Thoughts were connected to his, the Netherworld seal\u2019s magic formation below immediately ignited into a red, piercing mass of light.</p><br/><p>In just a split second, Zhou Weiqing could feel a very peculiar sensation all over his body. The sensation could not be described with words at all. He only felt as if everything that he could sense and perceive was doubly amplified at this very moment.</p><br/><p>The sensation and perception were not in macroscopic view but was in a microscopic view instead. Everything in the surroundings became crystal clear. Anyone\u2019s Divine Thoughts would be repressed to a certain extent in this situation where one possessed a combination of the Dragon Emperor\u2019s energy, the Destruction Energy and all the energies of the Divine Beasts. However, Zhou Weiqing immediately realized that his Divine Thought felt as if it was amplified after merging with the two enormous dragons\u2019 Divine Thoughts. His sensation and perception towards everything in his surroundings became much clearer until he could already enshroud the energy of the Divine Thought around the area surrounding the entire magic formation.</p><br/><p>Not only that, there was an addition of some other knowledge in his mind. The knowledge was related to the magic formation. A weird sense of understanding came to him, it was as if he had suddenly understood many things in a flash.</p><br/><p>Was it supposed to be so ingenious?</p><br/><p>It was also at this moment that movements appeared from the Dragon Emperor\u2019s side. He opened his enormous dragon mouth and spat out a ball of blood red light that shot towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Divine Thought connected to Hui Yao and his wife, the blood red energy had already arrived before him and slammed directly into the Saint God Nucleus Core on his chest.</p><br/><p>A wave of scorching hot sensation that was difficult to explain immediately spread throughout Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body. He felt as if at this exact moment, the Saint Energy in his body and even his soul was boiling. The sensation was not agonizing. On the contrary, it was filled with a hot and comfortable sensation. It felt as if his entire body was soaking in a hot spring, and the pores on his entire body were all opened and absorbing this energy that made him feel beyond comfortable in a relaxed yet greedy manner.</p><br/><p>A warm light revealed itself in the Dragon Emperor\u2019s eyes before he slowly closed his eyes. His final thought was to pray. To pray for the success of the seal, and to pray that everything he did was not in vain.</p><br/><p>That ball of red light that he just released was his Dragon-Phoenix Ultimate Energy. Just like the Nether Lord\u2019s Ultimate Destruction Energy, this was his most essential and purest energy.</p><br/><p>Although the Dragon Emperor was a Maximum-Level Heavenly God-tier powerhouse and was incapable of being equals with the Nether Lord\u2019s Heavenly Change Tier, his powerful Dragon Emperor\u2019s Maximum-Level Energy was still rather terrifying.</p><br/><p>If the Dragon Emperor had a choice, he would certainly not hesitate in exerting his ultimate source of energy to his own clansman, the next Dragon Emperor Hui Yao.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, it would only require ten years\u2019 time at most for Hui Yao to possess the same powerful cultivation base he had when he was at the ultimate level.</p><br/><p>However, the Dragon Emperor had no other choice as Hui Yao was not his replacement in becoming the heart of the Netherworld\u2019s Seal. Instead, it was Zhou Weiqing. In order to allow Zhou Weiqing to have the energy to trigger the entire magic formation, he could only choose to pass his Dragon Emperor\u2019s Ultimate Energy to Zhou Weiqing because only by doing so, he could truly launch the magic formation without causing a rejection.</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"862acb87-0860-3232-5040-992bfc18e840\">Earlier chapter mentioned by author that the Dragon Emperor was half a foot (halfway through) the Heavenly God Tier. I guess he\u2019s at the Maximum Level? Just couldn\u2019t break through to Heavenly Change like the Nether Lord</li></ol><br/>\n</div>"}

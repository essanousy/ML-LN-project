(1)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Her voice changed midway through her previously-confident words.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual Legendary Hammers had somehow vanished, and as he charged towards her he instantly used one of his supreme techniques.</p><br/><p>It was the legendary \u2018Something Something\u2019 Dragon Claws.\u00a0[1]</p><br/><p>Dreamwake\u2019s transformation wasn\u2019t complete.\u00a0Although her legs were nearly in full dragon form, her upper body was still mid-transformation.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s clawing \u2018attack\u2019 made her feel so humiliated she could die.\u00a0Worse, she could sense an incomparably powerful devouring ability sweep out from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s two hands.\u00a0A dense stream of Heavenly Energy rapidly began to sweep out of Dreamwake\u2019s body and pour into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, and her Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s True Form transformation actually came to a halt.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned cheekily at Dreamwake, up close and personal. \u201cEveryone has a few protective abilities up their sleeves. If you actually managed to finish your Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s True Form, I probably wouldn\u2019t be a match for you. However, this transformation takes a bit too long. The \u2018invulnerability\u2019 only prevents me from harming you, but it doesn\u2019t prevent me from touching you. Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dreamwake\u2019s eyes bulged out as she stared at Zhou Weiqing, unable to speak.\u00a0Not only did her chest feel numb from his \u2018claws\u2019, what was even worse was that she could sense how the Heavenly Energy was being sucked out of her body faster and faster.\u00a0The Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s True Form was actually unable to keep up with the rate at which she was losing energy.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t sustainable.\u00a0Worst of all was that she wasn\u2019t just losing a six-Jeweled cultivation base, she was losing her natural Heavenly Energy!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing himself was shocked by what he was absorbing.\u00a0Dreamwake\u2019s Heavenly Energy was far more terrifying than he had imagined.\u00a0A vast sea of Heavenly Energy was flooding into him, and it rapidly transformed into Saint Energy before then being converted into that astral, starry Saint Energy halo of light.</p><br/><p>Just ten seconds of sucking made Zhou Weiqing feel as though his Saint Energy had improved far more than it had during his previous month of cultivation.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Emperor!\u00a0She was actually a Heavenly Emperor, not a Heavenly King!\u00a0Zhou Weiqing was thoroughly stunned.</p><br/><p>Dreamwake was stunned as well.\u00a0The Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s True Form vanished, and even the Consolidated Equipment which had merged into her Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s True Form vanished.\u00a0The powerful Devour skill\u2019s sucking power was causing her to lose Heavenly Energy at an incredible rate.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you\u2026\u201d\u00a0Suddenly, a terrifying burst of energy swept out of Dreamwake\u2019s body.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing felt his entire body tremble.\u00a0His Devour skill was forcibly interrupted as he was sent flying backwards for several hundred meters before slamming into the ground.</p><br/><p>Even if he had used all his power and reinforced it with Saint Energy, he wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to stably Devour the energy of a Heavenly Emperor, to say nothing of right now when his cultivation base was suppressed to the six-Jeweled stage.</p><br/><p>Dreamwake quickly covered herself with a set of long robes.\u00a0After losing the Demon Dragon\u2019s True Form, she had become completely nude.\u00a0After dressing herself, this mighty Heavenly Emperor powerhouse actually collapsed on the ground, panting heavily as her entire body shuddered uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lay on the ground, feeling stunned.\u00a0Although Dreamwake had sent him flying, she had simply knocked him a way instead of actually releasing enough energy to kill him.\u00a0Although the fall was a severe one, given his physical strength it wouldn\u2019t result in him suffering any severe injuries.</p><br/><p>A twenty-nine year old Heavenly Emperor?\u00a0How was this possible?\u00a0He had stunned Dreamwake many times today.\u00a0Finally, Dreamwake had stunned him as well.</p><br/><p>No wonder the four Grand Elders of Xuantian Palace and Master Nie Han had all treated her so respectfully.\u00a0Her cultivation base had actually reached an incredible level!</p><br/><p>The empty space gradually fell silent.\u00a0No sound could be heard save for the two of them panting.</p><br/><p>Dreamwake\u2019s arms were folded protectively in front of her chest, her graceful body trembling nonstop.\u00a0That strange, indescribable feeling continued to spread out from her chest and into every part of her body.</p><br/><p><em>Kill him.\u00a0I should kill him</em>.\u00a0But she wasn\u2019t able to summon any power at all and had no real desire to kill him.\u00a0Her entire mental state was quite unsteady.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lay there, huffing and wheezing, without rising to his feet.\u00a0He didn\u2019t wish to endure the fiery rage of a Heavenly Emperor, nor would he try to incite Dreamwake by mentioning how she had gone against her oath.</p><br/><p>They quietly lay there for the time needed to boil a kettle of tea.\u00a0Finally, Dreamwake recovered her senses and slowly rose to her feet.\u00a0As she stood straight, her slender figure couldn\u2019t help but sway one more time.</p><br/><p>She glared at the distant Zhou Weiqing, who remained lying on the ground, then viciously tossed a black crystal at him.\u00a0In the next instant, her body turned illusory then vanished without a trace.</p><br/><p>As soon as Dreamwake vanished, the distant Zhou Weiqing quickly clambered back to his feet.\u00a0He hurriedly switched to a different set of clothes, then adjusted himself.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want Bing\u2019er to notice anything suspicious.\u00a0After doing all of these things he picked up the black crystal which Dreamwake had given him, then looked at his arms.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Energy poured into the black crystal.\u00a0Light flared, and when it vanished he had once more reappeared within the sixth level of Xuantian Castle.</p><br/><p>Dreamwake had long ago vanished without a trace.\u00a0After secretly celebrating the \u2018fun\u2019 he just had, Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit helpless.\u00a0This time, he had thoroughly offended her.\u00a0It would clearly be quite difficult for them to regain their previous camaraderie.\u00a0Still\u2026 it hadn\u2019t been completely fruitless.\u00a0At least he now knew just how powerful Dreamwake really was.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, one which was able to use the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation!\u00a0Zhou Weiqing knew that if Dreamwake used all her power, she would have the ability to cause the very heavens to shudder.</p><br/><p>In truth?\u00a0Our dear little Zhou Little Fatty, always so confident in his own talent, had been badly rattled and disheartened.\u00a0A twenty-nine year old Heavenly Emperor!\u00a0He himself knew that unless he encountered more marvels, there was no way he could reach that stage so soon.</p><br/><p>He returned to his room.\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er hadn\u2019t been training; this entire time, she had been waiting for him to return.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s duel against Dreamwake didn\u2019t take too long, and so he actually came back quite quickly.\u00a0Even though he had cleaned himself up a bit, he still looked rather bedraggled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did she summon you for?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er eyed him, puzzled.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing let out a bitter laugh.\u00a0\u201cTo kick my ass.\u00a0She wanted to test out my power\u2026 or perhaps she felt jealous of me when I revealed my six Attributes in front of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.\u00a0Or perhaps she is suspicious of us.\u201d\u00a0He didn\u2019t dare to tell the truth.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er didn\u2019t suspect the truth.\u00a0She said, worried, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u00a0She just wanted to test my power, and so she battled me while keeping her power down to the six-Jeweled level.\u00a0However\u2026 she\u2019s even more powerful than I had suspected.\u00a0A Heavenly Emperor\u2026 a twenty-nine year old Heavenly Emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u00a0Shangguan Bing\u2019er was shocked as well.\u00a0\u201cThat means there are at least six Heavenly Emperor powerhouses here, plus that Heavenly God Tenebrous Demon Dragon.\u00a0This level of power completely eclipses our Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded.\u00a0\u201cIt does seem to be the case.\u00a0They have been the sole rulers of the Xuantian Continent, after all.\u00a0It makes sense that something like this occurred.\u00a0However, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u00a0We\u2019re from the Boundless Mainland and we\u2019ve given them nothing to be suspicious about.\u00a0So long as we don\u2019t attack, we can continue to stay here in peace.\u00a0It seems we\u2019ll need to be extra, extra careful when dealing with this Terror Sea Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded, deeply convinced.\u00a0\u201cLittle Fatty, Father and Uncle both said that our safety is paramount.\u00a0They should have already completed their preparations for Zhongtian City.\u00a0Your safety is what really matters right now.\u00a0It is better for us to return empty-handed than for you to take on too much risk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say such things.\u00a0We still have plenty of time.\u00a0Let\u2019s take things one step at a time.\u00a0Staying here a bit longer isn\u2019t a bad thing for us.\u00a0This place has all the atmospheric energies we need, which is beneficial to our cultivation.\u00a0Just now, I Devoured some of Dreamwake\u2019s Heavenly Energy.\u00a0Let me first digest it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>He returned to the bed and sat down to meditate.\u00a0With but a thought, he entered his state of cultivation.\u00a0This was one of the benefits of having Saint Energy.\u00a0He didn\u2019t need to worry about suffering from any cultivation deviations.\u00a0The Saint Energy in his body circulated naturally, and Zhou Weiqing was able to clearly see how at the core of his Dantian, the starry Saint Energy had increased in amount.\u00a0The starry light within the cores of his thirty-six Death Acupuncture Points had clearly strengthened as well.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Devouring was the fastest way to improvement!\u00a0During the final moments of his battle against Dreamwake he had only been given a brief moment of time to Devour her energies, but she was still a true Heavenly Emperor!\u00a0That brief instant had granted him an enormous benefit.</p><br/><p>Devouring the Heavenly Energy of a Heavenly Jewel Master was completely different from devouring that of a Heavenly Beast.\u00a0Even the most powerful of Heavenly Beasts would have a hint of impure bestial elements in their Heavenly Energy, no matter how vast and distilled it was.\u00a0After absorbing it, he would have to repeatedly filter and expel all of those impurities.\u00a0In addition, Heavenly Beasts trained in a completely different way.\u00a0Thus, after their Heavenly Energy was filter out only a small fraction would be available for Zhou Weiqing to use.</p><br/><p>Dreamwake was different. She was a genuine Heavenly Jewel Master who had reached the Heavenly Emperor stage. The Heavenly Energy within her body was so pure, Zhou Weiqing had to sigh in awe. Although it was of a different Attribute from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy, after he Devoured it he didn\u2019t need to filter it at all. He simply needed to convert it into a replenishing source for his Saint Energy.</p><br/><p><span class=\"footnote\" id=\"footnote_1\">[1] The \u2018real name\u2019 of this technique is \u2018Titty-Squeezing Dragon Claws\u2019.

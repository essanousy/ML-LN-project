He looked up at the sky and took two deep breaths. The clouds in the sky shook vigorously from his breathing alone. That was the ability of a Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouse. He was the emperor of the heavens and earth.</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing bade his teacher and Junior Master goodbye, he went out and found an empty place so he could get used to the changes in the Ringless Ground Purging Set. He only returned when the sky turned dark. Even after he had eaten, he still did not see the five women. Could it be that Yuehan did not benefit from his Saint Energy? That was impossible. It should have helped her breakthrough from the Seventh Jewel to at least the Eighth Jewel!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing returned to his room as he continued pondering about the matter. As he opened the door, he felt like he was showered with immense love. The Shangguan triplets were in his room. They were sitting together and talking softly among themselves. When they saw Zhou Weiqing entering the room, the three women started blushing. Shangguan Xue\u2019er instantly stood up and pulled Shangguan Bing\u2019er with her as they ran out of the room like they were running for their lives.</p><br/><p>How could Zhou Weiqing not understand what they were trying to do? Naturally, he did not stop them and let them escape before he closed the door. Shangguan Fei\u2019er sat there with her head lowered. At that moment, she did not seem like the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace anymore. She was so shy that even her neck turned red.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was not in a hurry as he took off his outerwear and put it aside. He walked towards her in a leisurely manner and sat down next to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeauty, why are you here?\u201d Zhou Weiqing chuckled as he asked.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er moved her body as she attempted to avoid his hand that was reaching for her waist. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch me, you idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled again and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you here for me to touch you? Fei\u2019er, I\u2019ve been waiting for this day for a long time. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked up and showed a pitiful expression, \u201cMaster, will you really be gentle?\u201d</p><br/><p>His beastly blood was boiling! Zhou Weiqing\u2019s desire rose when he heard her calling him \u2018master\u2019 and he pounced on her like a tiger. Shangguan Xue\u2019er giggled and turned around. Her amazing flexibility was fully displayed as she escaped from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pounce.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing blinked his eyes as he went closer to her, \u201cLet\u2019s not wait anymore, Fei\u2019er, I can\u2019t take this anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said in disdain, \u201cLook at you! You\u2019re so promiscuous. Tell me, did you fool around with Little Witch all night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing subconsciously nodded.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er scoffed and said, \u201cYou playboy, I definitely won\u2019t let you off today. You can have your way with me but you\u2019ll have to listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing quickly said without any hesitation, \u201cYes, my queen. I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to, I won\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er felt a sense of satisfaction as she said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Go lie on the bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing used Blink to get to the bed while he salivated. If the Heavenly Beast who created that skill knew that Zhou Weiqing used Blink for something like this, it would probably be so angry that it would be spitting blood. Shangguan Fei\u2019er walked to the bed and proceeded to straddle Zhou Weiqing. She held on tightly to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest as she vigorously tore his clothes apart. She lowered her head and bit onto his muscular chest as her bouncy little ass rubbed against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s stomach intensely.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026 Ohh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er who was hiding outside heard the sound that was coming out of the room. She could not help but ask Shangguan Bing\u2019er, \u201cWhat are they doing? Why are there howling noises?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er giggled playfully and said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s a howl. A satyr\u2019s howl.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing thought to himself, \u2018Too wild! This is too wild. Even Tian\u2019er who\u2019s a Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger is not as wild as Shangguan Fei\u2019er! I\u2019m having sex with a strong woman!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it to me. Let the storm grow wilder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s character had always been different from the others. In the beginning, she was extremely shy. However, the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace took over and she became wild and enthusiastic. Unfortunately, due to the fact that she was inexperienced, she became a little lamb that was delivered into a fierce tiger\u2019s mouth during the critical moment.</p><br/><p>However, it was Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s first time after all so Zhou Weiqing held himself back. He loved Shangguan Fei\u2019er, and she could be considered as the person who had sacrificed the most for him in all these years. It was impossible for Zhou Weiqing to build the Peerless Sect without her. Zhou Weiqing felt like he owed her the most. Therefore, he was extremely gentle tonight and he really treated her like a queen. He could be considered as someone who was rich in experience so he showed his San Shou 108 <sup>1 </sup>that brought harmony to the both of them.</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar, you liar! Where\u2019s my breakthrough? I\u2019m going to teach you a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You don\u2019t even have a child yet, why are you calling yourself a mother? <sup>2 </sup>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m telling sister. You\u2019re such a liar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you. Aren\u2019t we almost there? You must know that your body won\u2019t absorb the essence if you leave it like this. It\u2019ll be difficult for you to break through. A treasure like that will have the best effect if you eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so disgusting. Go away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. I\u2019m not human if I\u2019m lying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not human anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t believe me but I\u2019m telling the truth. The effect is instant and you\u2019ll break through immediately. I\u2019m definitely going to the Elf Tribe. I won\u2019t dare to bring all of you with me if you all are not Heavenly God Tiers. Otherwise, it\u2019ll kill me if I put any of you in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was quiet for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bite you if I find out that you\u2019re lying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a decent man. Why would I lie to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph\u2026 Then, close your eyes. No, cover yourself with the blanket.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026 Ooh\u2026\u201d Soon after, howls could be heard again. However, the noise was muffled this time because they were under the blanket.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Bing\u2019er had gotten up early and they waited nearby for Shangguan Fei\u2019er to come out. As it happened, they heard Zhou Weiqing howling again. The sisters looked at each other. Let alone Shangguan Xue\u2019er, even Shangguan Bing\u2019er had a hard time trying to understand that. Could it be that they were having sex all night? Little Fatty was really too much. It was second sister\u2019s first time after all. The both of them had been waiting outside for an hour when suddenly, a rich Saint Energy wave spread out from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s room. They could clearly feel all the Atmospheric Energy of the heavens and earth rushing towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>What was that? Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s eyes were opened wide in shock. Was it truly successful? Such an intense wave of Saint Energy! Apart from that time when Zhou Weiqing was training, it only happened\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing walked out of the room in a relaxed manner. He had satisfaction written all over his face as he smirked at Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Bing\u2019er. His eyes were trained on Shangguan Xue\u2019er, and he was looking at her with a playful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er had reached a critical juncture. She\u2019s finally starting to break through. Please look out for her. I\u2019m going to get something to eat. I\u2019m exhausted from helping her to break through the entire night!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er was speechless as she looked at him. She would believe anyone else who helped an Upper-Level Heavenly Zong-tier to breakthrough to Heavenly King Tier but did Zhou Weiqing do it without fooling around last night? Nobody would believe that.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er pulled a funny face at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cPretending to be innocent after taking advantage someone. Look at you. Are you really tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing walked towards them, and as he was walking pass Shangguan Xue\u2019er, he softly said, \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you tonight.\u201d He walked away with 110% satisfaction after saying that.</p><br/><p>Happiness, that was happiness! That was a blessing indeed!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had never felt this happy in a very long time. His family had been rescued, the Heavenly Bow Empire was growing and the enemy had been defeated. He had completed the consolidation of the legendary armor set and he was together with all his wives. Perfect. His life could only be described as perfect right now. If he did not have to handle that matter, he really wished that he could enjoy his life like this forever. Marrying the five women and becoming the emperor of the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p><br/><p>However, for the most part, when one experienced extreme joy, unexpected things might happen due to God\u2019s jealousy. It was said that extreme pleasure was followed by sorrow. When Zhou Weiqing returned to his room excitedly after breakfast, he was ready to tease Shangguan Xue\u2019er. He could not wait to spoil the eldest sister of the Shangguan triplets. However, he was speechless when he found Shangguan Xue\u2019er sitting outside his room. She seemed to have entered a trance. The Atmospheric Energy in the air was entering her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why! God, why do you have to mess with me like that? I\u2019ve yet to have sex with her. Why did you let her breakthrough? I, I\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing was having breakfast, perhaps it was because the triplets were connected by heart, they sensed their sister\u2019s breakthrough again. Moreover, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s cultivation base was higher than Shangguan Fei\u2019er. She went into the breakthrough state as the shyness in her heart was negated by the energy wave that instantly enlightened her.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing noticed that something was wrong when he returned. The problem lay with Shangguan Xue\u2019er. Perhaps it was due to her shyness, she was hasty and entered the breakthrough state directly after the enlightenment. However, she forgot the two most important things. One, she would need a lot of Atmospheric Energy to break through. Shangguan Fei\u2019er was already in the process of breaking through. Now that Shangguan Xue\u2019er was also in the process of breaking through, she would take away a portion of the Atmospheric Energy.</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"44d8ff23-d6d1-0496-5edc-1acd323ed09b\">A kind of taiji form I think. Long, deep and slow movements.</li><li data-annotation-id=\"f411f595-2ade-5b81-9004-ed779fdcdcef\">I think the author is trying to say that Shangguan Fei\u2019er jumped to conclusion too quickly. Like how would she know that having sex with ZWQ won\u2019t help her to breakthrough?</li></ol><br/>\n</div>"}

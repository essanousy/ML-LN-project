In the past, she had always had a good impression of Zhan LingTian. After all, he was young, handsome and powerful. Amongst the young generation of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, he was truly stood out, a dragon amongst men.</p><br/><p>However, at this time, she was surprised to discover that when she stood looking at Zhan LingTian and Zhou Weiqing face off, her heart was fully on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side. In her eyes, Zhan LingTian was too small minded and petty, too simple minded and easily displaying all his emotions outwardly. In contrast, Zhou Weiqing was smiling so sincerely. Although she knew that the rascal was acting, but facing an opponent like Zhan LingTian who was displaying his enmity so outright, being able to do such a thing just proved how much stronger his psyche was. In such a comparison just showed a stark contrast between the two.</p><br/><p>My Little Fatty is indeed the best. Shangguan Fei\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but say inwardly. Of course, she did not realise that this was a case of love being blind. In terms of looks alone, Zhou Weiqing was actually no match for Zhan LingTian.</p><br/><p>Facing Zhan LingTian\u2019s outright enmity, the smile on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face grew as he said: \u201cBro Zhan, there is no need to be like that. In the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, I had no choice but to do so. After all, everyone wants to get the championship, alas I accidentally injured Bro Zhan, it is truly a misunderstanding. In terms of power, how can I compare with Bro Zhan? You are one of the future successors to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, how can you bother yourself with the likes of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing him say that, although Zhan LingTian knew that this rascal probably didn\u2019t mean it, it still sounded good. Of course, that honest smiling face of Zhou Weiqing still made him feel like giving him a tight slap.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, don\u2019t think I do not know what you are doing here. Hmph, trying to make use of the power of our ZhongTian Empire to try to revive your Heavenly Bow Empire? Stop daydreaming.\u201d Zhan LingTian\u2019s piercing gaze landed upon Zhou Weiqing, as if trying to shoot right through him.</p><br/><p>A gloomy look crossed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face as he lamented: \u201cHow could I possibly have such thinking! How could I revive my Empire just by myself? I came here to join the army because the Fei Li Empire chased me out, so I had no other choice but to come to the northern border to temper myself on the battlefield, to maintain my training and cultivation. My home has been destroyed, and I am homeless, and I do not know where else to go, so my only option is to stay on the battlefield, to reduce my pain by fighting and killing. Alas, who knew that I somehow offended the Sixteenth Regiment Regiment Commander, and I was sent here. This place is so frozen, cold, and isolated from the world, who could be worse off than me? Although I managed to become a Battalion Commander from the Dueling Corner, what use has it been to me? Bro Zhan, you don\u2019t really think that I can actually use this thousand men and run back to revive my Empire just like that? Not to mention, these brothers might not even be willing to follow me back, that isn\u2019t realistic at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>This speech of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s was delivered almost perfectly, making absolute sense and yet full of rich emotion, almost as if tears were about to fall. Let alone Zhan LingTian, even Shangguan Fei\u2019er who knew the truth was almost convinced by him. She almost began to suspect that in the last three months Zhou Weiqing had been practicing his acting skills and facial expressions, not tempering his various Skills. That performance just now was definitely worth an academy award.</p><br/><p>Seeing the emotional Zhou Weiqing, almost on the verge of tears, as he gave his fervant speech, Zhan LingTian\u2019s expression softened slightly. \u201cSince you\u2019re willing to fight on the battlefield, no one will begrudge you that. In any case, a mere Low Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master like you won\u2019t be able to cause much trouble. You better watch out, don\u2019t try to have any designs on Third Young Miss. Who do you think you are? Trying to marry into our Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing blinked and said: \u201cSuch a thing is not up to me, nor is it up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold light flashed in Zhan LingTian\u2019s eyes and he said: \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t go and stick to Third Young Miss, there is no up to anyone. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for taking care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing glanced at him, then said: \u201cBro Zhan, you must be mistaken. I heard Fei\u2019er say that\u2026 the person you like is Bing\u2019er\u2019s big sister, the heir to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, that ice lady, and not my Bing\u2019er. So, why are you looking for trouble with me? In fact, your thinking is on the wrong track, you should instead be trying to have a good relationship with me. If in the future I actually become a son-in-law of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and me and Bing\u2019er support you in chasing Shangguan Xue\u2019er, that would be more beneficial to you. After all, if we both are son-in-laws of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, we would be considered related.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d Zhan LingTian started momentarily. Indeed, he had never thought about it in that way, and hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, his heart was definitely tempted. He was clear how important Shangguan Bing\u2019er, as the youngest of the three sisters who had been missing for so long, was to Shangguan Xue\u2019er. Yet, he had not had any prior contact with Shangguan Bing\u2019er. If he wanted to gain her support, perhaps this little rascal in front was a good route.</p><br/><p>However, though he was tempted in his heart, he did not reveal it in his words. \u201cThat would have to depend on whether or not you can gain the approval of the two Palace Masters first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed inwardly to himself. He could tell that after his words, Zhan LingTian\u2019s psyche and attitude had definitely changed. At least, he would not think too much about him and the Peerless Battalion.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro Zhan, in a few days, I will be leaving for a few days. Will you still be staying here or returning to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace?\u201d Only at this point did Zhou Weiqing ask the question in an innocent manner. In truth, he would not feel good about leaving Zhan LingTian here.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Zhan LingTian said: \u201cIt is time for me to return to report on my task. Second Young Miss, you should pack up and return with me as well. This time, both Palace Masters were extremely worried and urgent when you ran away from home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er was startled, and she quickly said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not leaving. I have things to do as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat things could you possibly have to do? Keep watch on this little brat? Even if you want to do so, you don\u2019t have to do it personally. I will let the northern command know to take care of him.\u201d Zhan LingTian furrowed his brow.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er shook her head and said: \u201cNo, I will be going with him to the WanShou Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! No way.\u201d Zhan LingTian said firmly. \u201cWhat is your status?! How could you possibly go to the WanShou Empire? If the Heavenly Snow Mountain catches any wind of it and catches you, the two Palace Masters will be left in a very difficult position. You have to return to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s eyes reddened, and she said vexedly: \u201cBig bro Zhan, you haven\u2019t even learnt what I am trying to do and you are already stopping me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was on the verge of crying, Zhan LingTian furrowed his brow. Although Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked exactly like Shangguan Xue\u2019er, he did not have any feelings for her. Since a young age, the amount of people pranked by Shangguan Fei\u2019er were just too many, and he was one of them. Towards this Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, the only feeling he had was to keep away from her if possible.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er continued: \u201cFather\u2019s birthday is coming soon. This time, I am following Zhou Weiqing and the others to the WanShou Empire to look for some rare and precious Heavenly Cores of Heavenly Beasts, as a present for Father. That is a just a token of filial love from me, yet you want to stop me? You don\u2019t need to say anything else, if you don\u2019t let me go, when I go back I\u2019ll tell big sis. You know she is the most filial one! Hmph Hmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Looking at Shangguan Fei\u2019er, Zhan LingTian felt a migraine coming on as his brow furrowed deeper and he said: \u201cHow long will you all be going for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said: \u201cI have already gotten the northern army command to prepare all the various merchant documents and necessities. We leave in three days, and I estimate it will take us between one to three months or so before we return. Big bro Zhan, you go back to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace first and inform Father and Uncle. I will definitely return when I am back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhan LingTian looked to Shangguan Fei\u2019er, then towards the expressionless Zhou Weiqing who was quietly looking down to the ground. He couldn\u2019t help but hesitate, not knowing what to do.</p><br/><p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing had lowered his head in order to keep himself from laughing. Just now, he had been acting with all his might, and now, Shangguan Fei\u2019er was doing the same!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s alright. I will go along with you. If I go back just like that, what if anything happens to you, how can I account to your sister and the two Palace Masters? When we return from the WanShou Empire, you can come back to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace with me. I will send a letter back first so that the two Palace Masters can rest easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhan LingTian finally made his decision, though it rendered the two amazing actors speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to come with us to the WanShou Empire?\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er said reluctantly. The reluctance was of no other reason besides the fact she was worried that Zhan LingTian might notice that the she and Zhou Weiqing might be a little too close. Furthermore, with Zhan LingTian there, she would not even want to get intimate with Zhou Weiqing!</p><br/><p>Zhan LingTian gave a cold humph and said: \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t want me to come along? Could it be you have something else up your sleeve? Second Young Miss, you only have two choices now, come back with me or let me go with you. Do not try to command me on this, I have known your ways since young.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo then, go then. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er said huffily. She could not think of any reason not to allow Zhan LingTian to accompany them to the WanShou Empire.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s all go together then.\u201d</p><br/><p>As such, things were settled. Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not know why Zhou Weiqing had agreed so readily. From his expression, it was as if he had hoped that Zhan LingTian would accompany them.</p><br/><p>As such, Zhou Weiqing handed the Peerless Battalion fully to Wei Feng and the teachers of the Heavenly Bow Unit. Three days later, he brought Lin TianAo, Zhan LingTian, Crow, Ma Qun and Shangguan Fei\u2019er, and the six stealthily returned to the TianBei City before heading north to the largest city on the borders, the ZhongBei City. From there, they advanced on the only trade route directly into the WanShou Empire.</p><br/><p>As all the documents had been properly prepared and handled, their movement was smooth and not delayed. In order to raise their overall speed, they even gave Zhan LingTian a Ghost Demon Horse as they headed northwards deep into the belly of the WanShou Empire.</p><br/><p>In truth, a huge reason why Zhan LingTian actually decided to follow them was because of his own reasons. He had always been very curious about the WanShou Empire, and that would be his first time entering it.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s target was the northern part of the WanShou Empire, an area called the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens.</p><br/><p>The WanShou had over a hundred different tribes, big or small, and amongst them there were over a dozen of the strongest tribes. One of those which had ruling power was the Lionheart Tribe.</p>\n</div>"}

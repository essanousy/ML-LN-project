Zhou Weiqing first smelled the faint fragrance on his hand before secretly chuckling in delight as he followed from behind. At the same time, he began to observe his surroundings.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was rather ghastly in the valley. Even the rocks in the surrounding area were black in color. Sunlight could not pierce through the fog that was hovering at the top. There was not even a single blade of grass in the entire valley. There were only jagged rocks with grotesque shapes.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing realized that there were two attributes that he was extremely familiar with that were particularly active in the valley. Not only that, the rich density could even be compared to the Fire Attribute that the gigantic dragon Duo Si blew out in her wrath when he was still in the Luster Spatial Realm. These two were the Darkness and Evil Attributes.</p><br/><p>That was right. The Evil Attribute was indeed present here. Even though the Evil attribute here was not entirely pure, it was something that Zhou Weiqing had never come across before.</p><br/><p>Despite the rough terrain in the valley, it did not affect any of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace experts at all, they were moving at a very fast speed. The further they proceeded in the direction that Meng Xing and the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace were headed in, the denser the Darkness and Evil attributes in the atmosphere became.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Meng Xing, who was walking in front, came to a halt. She let the four Supreme Elders overtake her before walking by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side again. However, the smile on her delicate face earlier had completely disappeared. It was replaced by a look that was as frosty as ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 M-Meng Xing. I really did not mean it,\u201d he explained in a whisper.</p><br/><p>Glaring at him, she snapped, \u201cFollow me closely! Stay within five meters of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was saying that, an aura that Zhou Weiqing found to be familiar and warm immediately radiated out from her body once again. The aura enveloped both their bodies. The moment this strange aura was released, the Darkness and Evil energy in the surroundings were instantly repelled and it no longer invaded their bodies.</p><br/><p>The terrain suddenly became flat again. The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, who was walking in front, suddenly stopped and the four Supreme Elders spread out in a line behind him. Meng Xing, on the other hand, led Zhou Weiqing to the Palace Master\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>In front of the flat terrain was a thick black fog that permeated the bottom of the valley. If they continued to walk forward, Zhou Weiqing was sure that they would enter a state of total darkness.</p><br/><p>Now that they had reached here, the Darkness and Evil attributes became a lot purer. However, it was not the kind of purity that a single attribute possessed. The purity was a combination of two attributes.</p><br/><p>The Blackness Attribute? Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart stirred. He immediately recalled the Blackness Attribute that Meng Xing had told him about. It seemed like the big shot who was living at the bottom of the valley was skilled in using the Blackness Attribute. Not only that, the fact that he was thought of so highly by the upper echelons of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace must have meant that his cultivation base must be extremely profound.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace looked at Meng Xing. After she had given him a nod, she flipped her wrist. All of a sudden, a black spindled crystal appeared in her hand. The black crystal stood out sharply in contrast to her fair and tender small hand.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing shook her wrist. A black light flashed across, and before they knew it, the crystal had already shot out into the black fog.</p><br/><p>As he turned to look at the four Supreme Elders and Nie Han, Zhou Weiqing realized that they had a respectful look on their faces at that moment.</p><br/><p>In just a short while, an overwhelmingly fierce and cold suppression erupted from the dark fog without warning. Dense black fog surged straight at the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Meng Xing\u2019s voice resounded in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ears. In the next moment, the dense black fog had completely enveloped the eight of them. Zhou Weiqing finally understood why she told him to stay within five meters of her. Within this boundary, the aura that Meng Xing was exuding helped him repel the effects from his surroundings.</p><br/><p>Even though he had molested her earlier, she still cared about his safety. His liking towards her immediately increased several folds. Then again, he had always had a penchant for beauties\u2026</p><br/><p>The dense, heavy dark fog lingered and filled the air. The entire surroundings could no longer be seen clearly. Because he was still within Meng Xing\u2019s aura, Zhou Weiqing did not dare unleash his perception. It was necessary for him to remain vigilant at all times. He could faintly feel that there seemed to be some aura in the thick black fog that was affecting his bloodline. It made his blood boiled in eagerness to fight in a battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d A deep attractive male voice with bold undertones resonated around them. The terrifying suppressive force that even the group from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace had to be careful against dissipated along with it.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master from Mysterious Heavenly Palace said respectfully, \u201cSir, there is a Dreadfiend Sea Naga that keeps resurfacing near the West Sea recently. It has caused heavy losses to our ships. Somehow, it seems like its attacks are targeting us. It lingers around the coastal waters, refusing to leave. After a discussion among ourselves, we\u2019ve decided to launch an attack. We would like to invite you to help us, Sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA Dreadfiend Sea Naga?\u201d A hint of surprise could be heard in the heavy male voice. After a moment of silence, he continued, \u201cDo you know what the actual situation over there is like?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Palace Master from Mysterious Heavenly Palace shook his head. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t. We received the news from a letter brought by a bird. All who have encountered it are dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d An angry snort rang in the air. \u201cHow dare the Dreadfiend Sea Naga appear offshore! It\u2019s obviously courting death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Palace Master Mysterious Heavenly Palace tried to incite him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s trying to provoke your dignity, Sir. Our power is probably insufficient to go against it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here to invite you to come along with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can lure it up to the shore like you did last time, I can help you kill it. However, if it\u2019s in the ocean, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do anything,\u201d The deep male voice spoke after a moment of silence.</p><br/><p>After listening to his words, everyone\u2019s faces changed a little. Slightly unconvinced, Meng Xing asked unconvinced, \u201cIs the Dreadfiend Sea Naga really THAT strong? Didn\u2019t our predecessors manage to kill one in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>The deep male voice replied, \u201cThat was because the naga that was killed was simply a rash idiot. It actually continued its pursuit up to the shore. That was how we managed to kill it collectively. Still, we paid a rather hefty price for that fight. Till today, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga still remains as one of the most powerful dragon species in this world. Its intrinsic origin is second only to the inheritors of the Dragon Emperor Bloodline. It\u2019s also an existence at the Mid-level Heavenly God Tier. When it\u2019s in the ocean, it can rely on the power of the sea to strengthen itself. Even if it engages in a duel with a Dragon Emperor Bloodline in the sea, it still stands a chance of winning that duel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s brows knitted slightly as she asked, \u201cThen, do we let it roam free in the ocean just like that? This will bring a great deal of trouble to us! Even if we can\u2019t kill it, we need to drive it out at least! Or, could it be that you\u2019re just simply afraid of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Zhou Weiqing\u2019s surprise, the powerhouse hiding amid the black fog was not offended by Meng Xing\u2019s question. Instead, his tone turned much milder. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not afraid of it. However, if we\u2019re to fight with him in the sea, I could still retreat safely unharmed but the same can\u2019t be said for all of you. Not only that, it will be difficult for me to drive it out with my strength alone too. If this Dreadfiend Sea Naga really is targeting the lot of you, then I think this must have something to do with the other naga that was killed last time. It must be well prepared for it to wreak such havoc. Besides, I\u2019m sure this time it\u2019ll be difficult for us to lure him up to the shore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Fire asked, \u201cSir, what if we use the Spatial Teleportation Stone to help us? With the assurance the stone provides, we can launch an attack with all our might. It\u2019ll be possible to inflict severe damage on it if we gather all of our power under your leadership, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Spatial Teleportation Stone?\u201d The dense male voice became silent for a moment. \u201cThis sounds like a feasible idea. However, we can\u2019t have too many people with us. The transportation ability of the Spatial Teleportation Stone is not as good as it was before. It can only be used three more times at most. And each time, we can\u2019t transport more than ten people at once. It\u2019s not worth it to use the stone if we\u2019re only going to inflict severe damage to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. However, it\u2019s a different story if we\u2019re using it to kill the naga. Alright, alright, I\u2019ll take the risk of being heavily injured myself and accompany you all this time. However, if we are able to kill it successfully, I want the Nucleus Core of that naga to aid my recuperation. I can also break through to the Mid-level Heavenly God Tier or maybe even higher if I have the Nucleus Core to absorb.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing quickly frowned and said, \u201cNo, we can\u2019t give you all of it! You can only take a small part, that\u2019s all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too greedy, lass!\u201d The heavy male voice was obviously dissatisfied. Still, even though his voice sounded dissatisfied, Zhou Weiqing could detect a hint of fondness in his voice.</p><br/><p>The black fog in front of them suddenly dissipated. Although the surroundings remained blanketed in darkness, he could vaguely see a thing or two in front of him.</p><br/><p>Two glowing lights that were flickering abnormally and exuded a rich Darkness Attribute slowly lit up.</p><br/><p>\u2018W-What was that?\u2019 Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart skipped a little. Under the shadow of the strange red light, he quickly saw a gigantic body slowly standing up just a few hundred meters away from him.</p><br/><p>Black scales that looked like fragments of black crystals were embedded in his body. The body was gigantic. It was at least 40 meters long. As he stood up, the huge wings slowly unfurled as well. And that pair of strange devilish lights turned out to be its eyes.</p><br/><p>A dragon! It was actually a dragon!</p><br/><p>At once, Zhou Weiqing felt like his throat was suddenly being constricted! He actually saw a dragon! Not only that, from the reaction of people from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, he could clearly see that this dragon was a peerless expert who guarded the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>Entirely pitch-black scales and dense Blackness Attribute aura. This was obviously a Blackfiend Dragon! A powerful dragon of the Heavenly God Tier Lower Level.</p><br/><p>The Mysterious Heavenly Palace indeed lived up to its name as the only saint land in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland! They actually had a Blackfiend Dragon guarding the palace right here. No wonder! It was no wonder the people of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace were so respectful of him! With such a strong Heavenly God Tier expert, coupled with the enormity of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, the Five Great Saint Lands of the Boundless Mainland would not stand a chance even if they were to join forces and dispatch an overseas expedition.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing finally understood why the Five Great Saint Lands in Boundless Mainland would form a non-aggression agreement with the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. The Mysterious Heavenly Palace had a strong card up their sleeves indeed.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a cold sweat covered his back. It was a good thing that he had not done anything reckless since he came to this place. Perhaps, he would stand a chance in fleeing from all of these Heavenly Emperor Tier masters, but if it was a Heavenly God Tier master, he probably did not even have the qualification to flee.</p><br/><p>Although the Blackfiend Dragon did not deliberately unleash his aura, a strong suppression immediately enveloped each and everyone the moment it stood up. Zhou Weiqing suddenly noticed that the bloodline energy in his body was surging, inciting him and making his entire body fall into a state of intense excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d The Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s pair of red eyes that was as large as a lantern suddenly looked at him\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

For two Heavenly King Tier powerhouses to breakthrough at the same time, it was best if they were surrounded by mountains and water or used a unique way to gather Atmospheric Energy from afar to ensure success. However, they were clearly nowhere near those places.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s hasty breakthrough caused her aura to be impure. Moreover, her cultivation ability was different from Shangguan Fei\u2019er. She was affected by Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s energy wave. The attributes in her body did not completely react with the energy wave which caused her own energy aura to be in a mess.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed. In the end, he still did not fulfill his dream of having sex with the triplets because his work was unfinished. Zhou Weiqing stood next to Shangguan Xue\u2019er wistfully. Naturally, his cultivation base would not affect Shangguan Xue\u2019er. When Zhou Weiqing saw her frowning, he waved his right hand in the air. It was different from when he summoned the starry sky. This time, a sparkling Galaxia appeared when day turned into night within seconds.</p><br/><p>Ever since leveling up to Heavenly Emperor Tier, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Galaxia had been greatly enhanced. However, he could not use the majestic Galaxia that he summoned to attack his enemies directly. In order to do that, he had to combine it with his own abilities. Its main function was to assist him.</p><br/><p>Under the guidance of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand and the appearance of the galaxy in the sky, the density of the Atmospheric Energy in the air multiplied just in time. That solved the first issue that Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er had encountered. Next, Zhou Weiqing simultaneously released all six of his attributes as six colored glows shone upon him. Under the reddish golden glow, the Heavenly Energy in Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s body began functioning as they were supposed to at once.</p><br/><p>With a light pat, a rich and pure Galaxia Saint Energy was sent into Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s body. It flowed to the middle of her chest where the Heavenly Core Nucleus was in the process of solidifying. She was finally on the right path of her breakthrough. Shangguan Bing\u2019er could not help but laugh when she noticed the disappointment on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like you won\u2019t get to sleep with her. Sister is so talented that she even managed to break through on her own. Hehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing approached Shangguan Bing\u2019er and pulled her into his arms. Naturally, he knew that with Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s character, she did not need to have sex with him to break through. Perhaps he would not be able to get what he wanted in this short period of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should pay your sister\u2019s debt. I\u2019ll be eating you tonight. Hehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not have the intention to avoid him at all. On the contrary, she leaned into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms fondly. She really cherished her time with him. No matter how generous she was, she still had to share her man with the others after all. Feeling Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s affection, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression became much softer as he patted her head and held her softly while enjoying her affection.</p><br/><p>The Shangguan sisters\u2019 breakthrough took exactly three days. Moreover, it was under the condition that they had the help of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Galaxia Saint Energy. Meanwhile, the Heavenly Bow City had not seen daylight for three days consecutively. However, it did not cause any fear to the people. On the contrary, the bizarre scene in the sky brought a lot of benefits to the people of Heavenly Bow City. One must know that under the condition where the Galaxia appeared in the sky, the Atmospheric Energy had given extra energy to the Heavenly Bow City. It even benefited the body of people who were not Heavenly Jewel Masters. At the same time, Heavenly Jewel Masters seized the chance to cultivate since one day of cultivation was equivalent to a couple of days of cultivations.</p><br/><p>On the fourth morning, six people flew up to the sky and headed out of the Heavenly Bow City silently as they stepped in the air. The six people were none other than Zhou Weiqing and his five wives. Apart from Little Witch, the remaining four women had broken through to Heavenly King Tier and possessed the ability to fly. Shangguan Bing\u2019er had used the Wind Spirit Saint Nucleus Core. Judging from her flying speed alone, she was comparable to a Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouse.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing carried Little Witch with him. Although she had not broken through to Heavenly King Tier, with the help from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Galaxia Saint Energy, she had entered the Ninth Jewel Realm. She had never imagined she would possess such a cultivation speed. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Galaxia Saint Energy was indeed magical. However, it was impossible to use it regularly. The reason why he did not mind draining his energy was because the five women were the closest to him. The entire time he was helping them break through to the next level, not only were there no improvements to his cultivation base, he had even wounded his Qi. That was why he did not help Little Witch to break through to Heavenly King Tier. That would have to wait for now.</p><br/><p>As they flew in the sky, Zhou Weiqing would occasionally look at Shangguan Xue\u2019er. He had an unwilling expression on his face. However, Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not even look at him as she coldly continued flying in front of him. However, upon closer inspection, one could see that she was secretly smiling intermittently.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er who was flying next to Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not bother with Zhou Weiqing as well. That bastard did something so bad to her the other day. Although she broke through eventually, Shangguan Fei\u2019er still could not accept what he did to her. Meanwhile, Tian\u2019er and Shangguan Bing\u2019er were flying together. The four women were flying in front, Little Witch was the only one by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing spoke to Shangguan Xue\u2019er telepathically, \u201cXue\u2019er, actually, it\u2019ll be beneficial for you if you do it. The first time is the most beneficial. Although you\u2019ve broken through to the Heavenly King Tier, there\u2019s still a long way for you to go before you get to Heavenly Emperor Tier. If we do it often, perhaps you\u2019ll be able to break through to Heavenly Emperor Tier soon. At that time, you\u2019ll be able to wear the complete Boundless Infinitum Set! That\u2019s the best set in the world. With the help of the Boundless Infinitum Set, our Peerless Sect\u2019s ability will increase tremendously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er turned around and glared at him, \u201cIdiot, how is it possible for me to wear the Boundless Infinitum Set! Although our Heavenly Expanse Palace is financially rich, the Boundless Infinitum Set is exclusively reserved for the Palace Master of the Heavenly Expanse Palace. Nobody is allowed to own that apart from the Palace Master of the Heavenly Expanse Palace. I already have a couple of them on me but that\u2019s an exception. Uncle will definitely not allow me to wear the Boundless Infinitum Set. Look at you, you already have the four of them. Why are you still thinking about doing that with me? You should think about how you\u2019re going to handle the matter of the Elf Tribe. Although our abilities have been upgraded, our Consolidated Equipment isn\u2019t complete yet. Not all of them have been imprinted. It definitely won\u2019t work if we try to enter the Sealed Land by force. Besides, you promised me that you won\u2019t kill any of the Elf Tribe\u2019s people.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s words, Zhou Weiqing was not angry at all. On the contrary, he was over the moon. Shangguan Xue\u2019er had said that she would not be able to wear the Boundless Infinitum Set. Did that not mean that she had already decided to stay by his side and relinquish her position as the Palace Master of the Heavenly Expanse Palace. Although Zhou Weiqing had an inkling of her thoughts, the feeling was different when he heard it directly from her mouth.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing flew next to Shangguan Xue\u2019er and looked deeply into her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er, don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019ll solve the problem of your legendary armor set. After this Elf Tribe matter is over, I\u2019ll bring all of you to participate in the Saint Land competition. We\u2019ll return to the Heavenly Expanse Palace after the competition is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are we going back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cOf course to propose the wedding and to bring a wedding gift. The three of you are as beautiful as flowers. The most precious darlings of the Heavenly Expanse Palace are married to me, how can I not give a wedding gift that\u2019s worthy of you all!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time Zhou Weiqing did not speak telepathically so the other women heard what he said clearly.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said angrily, \u201cAre you really that kind-hearted? I think you\u2019re just going there to ask for the dowry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was stunned and thought to himself that Fei\u2019er definitely read his mind! He smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cFei\u2019er, can you not understand me so well! How do you know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er scoffed, \u201cHow can I not know based on your filthy character? When have you ever put yourself in an unfavorable position?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed, \u201cI\u2019m asking for the dowry for all of you anyway. Since the Heavenly Expanse Palace is marrying off their daughters, they should give a complete set of equipment. I guess it\u2019s not too much to get legendary armor sets for all of you.While we are it, we can imprint some skills for all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not say a word. It was obvious she agreed with what Zhou Weiqing had said.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Shangguan Xue\u2019er and said, \u201cI have my own way of settling Xue\u2019er\u2019s Boundless Infinitum Set. Nothing is impossible. I believe that uncle will be understanding if I show enough sincerity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said to him softly, \u201cLittle Fatty, don\u2019t sacrifice too much for me. I can ask the God Tier Masters to remove the Boundless Infinitum Set and pick another legendary armor set.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to do that. Believe in your husband.\u201d Zhou Weiqing dismissed her plan immediately.</p><br/><p>It was a fact Shangguan Xue\u2019er had always used the Boundless Infinitum Set since she was young to cultivate her foundation. It was safe to say that her most powerful ability came from the Boundless Infinitum Set. If she was to change her legendary armor set, it was easy to imagine what an impact it would have on Shangguan Xue\u2019er. How could Zhou Weiqing allow that to happen?</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er, now that we\u2019ve departed, you can tell us about the Elf Tribe\u2019s situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Shangguan Xue\u2019er had agreed to help Zhou Weiqing look for the Elf Tribe, up till now, she still had not told Zhou Weiqing where the Elf Tribe Sealed Land was located.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er nodded lightly and said, \u201cThe Elf Tribe Sealed Land is located on the east of the Blancpain Empire that intersects with the Mi Ou Empire. It\u2019s pretty far from our Heavenly Bow Empire. Even the Blancpain Empire has no idea where their exact location is at.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing thought about it and said, \u201cThe Elf Tribe\u2019s so-called Sealed Land means that the Elf Tribe is sealed in there or there\u2019s a layer of seal outside that prohibits human from entering?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er shook her head and said, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong on both counts. If the situation is like as you said, humans would have discovered the Elf Tribe since the beginning. It would\u2019ve been impossible for them to hide for so many years in peace. To put it simply, the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land is the same as our Heavenly Expanse Palace\u2019s Luster Spatial Realm, a parallel realm that our mainland built with the help of a powerful force.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

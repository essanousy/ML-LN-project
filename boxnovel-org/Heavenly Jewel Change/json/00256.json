When she looked at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pathetic, sniveling face, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a sourness in her heart. She forgot that she was the Xuantian Palace Lord and, in this moment, became nothing more than a little girl. <em>If I was the one who was in trouble, would he be this anxious?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse.\u00a0Go ahead and kill me.\u201d\u00a0Dongfang Hanyue raised her head and stared coldly at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was dazed.\u00a0When he saw that Shangguan Bing\u2019er was fine, he suddenly went through yet another mood swing, soaring from the depths of depression to the heights of joy.\u00a0By now, he no longer felt that much enmity.</p><br/><p>When he heard Dongfang Hanyue refuse, he actually didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0He didn\u2019t know how he was supposed to handle this situation.\u00a0Only, when he saw that stubborn look on her face he couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sorry for her.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was Shangguan Bing\u2019er who resolved this deadlock.\u00a0\u201cLittle Fatty, what the hell are you doing?\u00a0Hanyue has been treating me wonderfully.\u00a0I\u2019m fine!\u201d\u00a0As she spoke, she summoned her Wings of the Wind God and flew over towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Clearly, no one was going to stop her. Dong Fang and the four Grand Elders had completely shut up. They could clearly sense that if anything was to actually happen to Shangguan Bing\u2019er, Zhou Weiqing probably really would\u2019ve ordered these two enormous great dragons to level Xuantian Citadel. No matter how crafty they were, they had no solutions for dealing with these two leviathans.</p><br/><p>The Wings of the Wind God were incredibly fast, allowing Shangguan Bing\u2019er to almost instantly appear before Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0Ignoring the fact that so many people were present, Zhou Weiqing immediately pulled her into his arms while using both hands to roam around her body shamelessly.\u00a0Only after making sure that she was completely unharmed did he finally and truly relax.</p><br/><p>Even though many people were watching, Shangguan Bing\u2019er didn\u2019t resist in the slightest.\u00a0She just tightly held onto his waist, pressing her face tightly against his chest.</p><br/><p>Although she and Dongfang Hanyue had arrived just moments ago, the conversation outside the citadel had been carried out using Heavenly Energy.\u00a0Thus, even inside the citadel she knew exactly what was happening.</p><br/><p>For her sake, this man had been willing to face down the entire Xuantian Palace.\u00a0He was going to bathe it in blood, all by himself.\u00a0How could she not feel moved?\u00a0This was her man, her Little Fatty!</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue stared at Zhou Weiqing, who was standing atop the enormous head of Hui Yao.\u00a0Her eyes couldn\u2019t help but redden, because she knew that a few days from now she might never see this man again.\u00a0She was jealous of Shangguan Bing\u2019er, jealous of the fact that she could be with him while Dongfang Hanyue herself had to shoulder all those responsibilities by herself.\u00a0Her father\u2019s legacy, Xuantian Palace\u2019s future\u2026 they were the heaviest shackles she had to bear.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er cuddled together for quite some time before slowly separating.\u00a0None of the Xuantian Palace powerhouses actually dared to disturb them.\u00a0The awesome presence of the two Heavenly God-level great dragons was simply too terrifying.\u00a0At a time like this, they no longer worried about Xuantian Palace\u2019s face.\u00a0They were worried about Xuantian Palace\u2019s continued survival.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, you were wrong in blaming big sister Hanyue. She treated me very well and she told me many things. Previously, Xuantian Palace did in fact temporarily confine me to my quarters because they weren\u2019t certain as to why we had come, but they didn\u2019t hurt me. When big sister Hanyue heard the news, she immediately came back to persuade them otherwise. \u00a0I was planning to come out and search for you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head, sighing mentally to himself.\u00a0He felt as though his life was changing far too rapidly.\u00a0He then turned to stare at the distant Dongfang Hanyue, feeling rather awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, uh, Hanyue\u2026 um\u2026 I guess this was a misunderstanding?\u201d\u00a0Zhou Weiqing stuttered.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue bit her lower lips, struggling to prevent her tears from falling down.\u00a0However, she simply couldn\u2019t stop them.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing spread his wings and flew towards Xuantian Palace.\u00a0The great dragons Hui Yao and Duo Si simply remained where they were, waiting for him.\u00a0They were certain that no one would dare to cause trouble for Zhou Weiqing with them present.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er didn\u2019t head over, she just remained on Hui Yao\u2019s head, a rather odd look on her face.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue hadn\u2019t held anything back in her talks with Shangguan Bing\u2019er, including what had happened between her and Zhou Weiqing and the feelings she felt for him. At first, Shangguan Bing\u2019er had blamed Zhou Weiqing for this. No matter how gentle she was, she was still a woman\u2026 and she had two sisters back home! <em>This Little Fatty, he really does have a lover in every port.\u00a0Even when he goes to a different continent, he still won\u2019t stop!</em> But when Zhou Weiqing had risked everything to challenge Xuantian Palace today, that bit of resentment vanished from her heart. Now, she actually sympathized with Dongfang Hanyue.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue was Xuantian Palace\u2019s Palace Lord.\u00a0There was naturally no way she could return with Zhou Weiqing to the Boundless Mainland.\u00a0She liked him, but she couldn\u2019t be together with him.\u00a0This was the most agonizing type of feeling there was.\u00a0In comparison, Bing\u2019er was much more fortunate.</p><br/><p>Dong Fang and the four Grand Elders were now thing more than spectators.\u00a0In truth, they mostly felt admiration for Dongfang Hanyue.\u00a0Even though she might\u2019ve guided by her feelings, her evaluation of Zhou Weiqing was spot on.\u00a0Who would\u2019ve imagined that this young man could actually summon two great dragons?</p><br/><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for Dongfang Hanyue bringing Shangguan Bing\u2019er out, there would probably be no way to return from what was about to happen.\u00a0Xuantian Palace\u2019s foundation, built up over thousands of years, probably would have been completely destroyed!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er was now back by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side, metaphorically speaking. Judging from the looks of things, this wasn\u2019t going to result in a fight after all. Dong Fang let out a slight sigh, then waved her hand and led the four Grand Elders back into Xuantian Citadel. She did this partially because their presence here was superfluous, and partially to show that Xuantian Citadel didn\u2019t have any hostility towards Zhou Weiqing. Dong Fang wasn\u2019t a fool. Letting Dongfang Hanyue chat privately with Zhou Weiqing was actually the best choice right now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Dreadfiend Sea Naga are practically invincible in the ocean. Even with the palace\u2019s ability, it\u2019ll be almost impossible to kill it. Even if we succeed in killing it, the losses will be severe. We\u2019ll lose more than we gain. It\u2019s better to think of a way to drive it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Fire frowned as he said, \u201cDrive it out? How do we do that? Would that guy even listen to us? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll just ruthlessly attack us. I think killing it isn\u2019t entirely impossible if we plan this properly. If our predecessors could do it, why can\u2019t we? Although it\u2019s extremely risky to kill the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, it would bring great benefit to the palace if we managed to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two Supreme Elders presented firm and radical opinions before Elder Earth spoke. \u201cThis Dreadfiend Sea Naga should be the offspring of the one that the predecessor killed years back. It probably has a grudge against us. As soon as it finds out that the palace is using the Darkness Attribute, it will be difficult to drive it out. At that time, it won\u2019t be us doing the killing. Instead, we\u2019ll be the ones getting annihilated. So we have to be extremely cautious about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chose to interrupt at this point. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just pull back our operations on the sea temporarily? Besides, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga won\u2019t decide to come ashore that easily. If it does that, its ability will be greatly weakened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone present clearly did not expect for Zhou Weiqing, who was attending the meeting for the first time, to open his mouth randomly. Everyone stared at him as if he was an idiot.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Meng Xing came to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s rescue. \u201cHonorary Master Zhou, the situation isn\u2019t as simple as you think. Although our Mysterious Heavenly Mainland is vast, land suitable for planting is scarce. Most of the land consists of mountains, hills, and rocks. Throughout the years, we\u2019ve been getting food and riches from the ocean to maintain the daily lives of the civilians. For quite some time, riches in the coastal waters have been unable to meet mainland\u2019s needs. Therefore, we have at least 100 ships sailing across the ocean to bring back massive amounts of food and treasures every year. This involves the livelihood of the people. As soon as fishing and treasure hunting activities are cut off, I\u2019m afraid that we\u2019ll be faced with food shortages in the mainland soon after.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Is that so? I\u2019m sorry. I rarely concerned myself with external matters in the past so I\u2019m not too clear on this. Everyone, please carry on.\u201d Zhou Weiqing shut his mouth immediately.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the four Supreme Elders did not question him, and they just smiled kindly. Zhou Weiqing was just a young man in their eyes. Although he had impressive talent, he still wasn\u2019t mature enough.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace proceeded to say, \u201cElder Wind, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wind was a tall and skinny old man. Among the four Supreme Elders, he had been the friendliest one to Zhou Weiqing ever since he arrived more than a month ago. The reason was naturally due to Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s gigantic Wings of the Wind God.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a guarantee that we can retreat unscathed, I think we should try killing it. Aside from being beneficial to us, it\u2019ll also serve as a deterrent to the other powerhouses in the ocean. Every year, losses are bound to occur in our fishing operations. If we retreat this time, I\u2019m afraid that, apart from the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, other ocean beasts with comparable strength will become more audacious. If that happens, it\u2019ll be a disastrous blow to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Fire and Meng Xin nodded slightly after listening to what Elder Wind said. Elder Earth frowned, but he did not say anything. Elder Water shook his head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say. How do we guarantee that we can retreat unscathed? In the ocean, even if the four of us fight together, we might not be able to stand up to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s full attack. It can manipulate the force of the ocean. Although our abilities are top-notch on the mainland, compared to the ocean, we\u2019re just a drop of water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nie Han, who was sitting to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side, closed his eyes as the four Supreme Elders sitting across from them were arguing with each other as if this matter did not concern him at all; Zhou Weiqing realized that this matter would be handled and dealt with by the four Supreme Elders. Although God Tier Honorary Masters like them were respectable, their authority was incomparable to the Supreme Elders.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace then turned to Meng Xing. \u201cHonorary Master Meng Xing, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The four Supreme Elders who were arguing became silent when they heard the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing looked serious as she replied, \u201cI agree with what Elder Wind said. The war with the Dreadfiend Sea Naga is unavoidable. As it has already come to coastal waters nearby to attack the ships, it\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s provoking us. Instead of suffering more losses, it\u2019s better to solve this problem as soon as possible. Now regarding what Elder Water said about avoiding losses, I think that\u2019s what we should consider right now instead of considering whether we should fight or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master who barely speaks nodded lightly after hearing what Meng Xing said. \u201cDoes anyone have any ideas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Water looked at Meng Xing who was sitting across him and thought for a while before speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there are no solutions. If we\u2019re really going to take action, then we\u2019ll at least need to prepare two things. First, we need to get that person to help us. If that person is willing to fight, then we\u2019ll definitely have enough firepower. Next, we\u2019ll need to bring out the Spatial Teleportation Stone to build the Teleportation Formation. As soon as something goes wrong, we\u2019ll leave immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing almost lost himself when he heard about the Spatial Teleportation Stone. It took some effort for him to calm himself down. He cheered secretly in his head. \u2018Bring it out, bring that thing out so that I have the opportunity to get my hands on it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Elder Fire then proceeded to say, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t do. Whether we can get the help of that person remains a problem. Besides, the Spatial Teleportation Stone can only be used two or three times at the most before it breaks. The preceding Palace Master instructed that this great treasure shouldn\u2019t be simply used unless it concerns the life or death of the palace. Moreover, the energy consumption of the Spatial Teleportation Stone depends on the number of people. If we\u2019re going to kill the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, there\u2019ll definitely be a large number of people going on the trip. How could it possibly teleport so many people? What if the Spatial Teleportation is destroyed on our watch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Water glared at him madly. \u201cYou old thing, you were the one who suggested we fight, and now, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s being paranoid. Aside from the two things that you mentioned, is there no other way we can restrain the Dreadfiend Sea Naga and at the same time guarantee our complete retreat? We\u2019ll just be digging our own graves if we fail to get that person to join us. Also, if we push the Dreadfiend Sea Naga to its limit, we might not be able to handle its final attack. Who would dare to go without the guarantee of the Spatial Teleportation Stone? Nobody would dare to give their all even if they go. Even an old man like me still wishes to live for a couple more years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Fire then scoffed, \u201cYou\u2019re already so old and you\u2019re still afraid of death. No wonder you can\u2019t break through to Heavenly God Tier even though you\u2019re more talented than I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Elder Water glared at him like he was going to blow up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. You two Elders, now is not the time to fight.\u201d The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace stopped them with his deep voice. Only then did the two Supreme Elders calm down for the time being.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master turned around to speak to Meng Xing again. \u201cHonorary Master Meng Xing, what do you think about Elder Water\u2019s suggestion?\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking for a moment, Meng Xing replied, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about using the Spatial Teleportation Stone first, we should at least ask for that person\u2019s permission before discussing further. It\u2019s impossible to fight the Dreadfiend Sea Naga without that person\u2019s help. If that person is unwilling to fight, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to formulate a new plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, the four Supreme Elders nodded almost at the same time. It was clear that they agreed with what Meng Xing said. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing did not have anything to say. No matter how much approval he had gotten from everyone when it came to making Consolidated Equipment Scrolls, he was still ranked the lowest when it came to authority and did not have much of a voice here. He was content to not speak at all anyway. However, he had finally heard about the Spatial Teleportation Stone. Although he was still not sure if he would be able to see it, what he heard had confirmed that there really was such a thing in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. At least he was not wasting his time here.</p><br/><p>Seeing that everyone had come to an agreement, the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace nodded and spoke again. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, let us see that person together.\u201d</p><br/><p>He waved his hand as he spoke. Zhou Weiqing was not sure of what he had done, but he felt the space around him distorting. In the next moment, they appeared at the formation on the sixth level again.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace took the lead while the four Supreme Elders followed behind. Meng Xing walked to Zhou Weiqing and said to him softly. \u201cWeiqing, stay close to me. No matter what you see later, stay within three meters from myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zhou Weiqing gave a short reply as he looked at Meng Xing with slight astonishment.</p><br/><p>The eight of them left the Mysterious Heavenly Castle. Soon after they arrived at the iron bridge that connected the Mysterious Heavenly Castle to the outside world. Where were they heading to? Who were they seeing? Zhou Weiqing had many doubts in his mind. It was clear that the person that these upper echelons from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace were going to see someone with powerful abilities. That person might even have a higher position than all of them, including the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Why else would they come in full force? In his heart, he remained extremely vigilant as he adjusted the Saint Energy in his body carefully to better disguise himself.</p><br/><p>Just when Zhou Weiqing thought they were going to cross the iron bridge, the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace leaped into the air and down toward the abyss below. Zhou Weiqing was shocked when he saw that. Then, the four Supreme Elders did the same thing. The five of them disappeared into the thick mist of the abyss below in mere seconds. Nie Han gave Zhou Weiqing a light smile and leaped down as well. Meng Xing then grabbed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go down. Don\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she leaped with Zhou Weiqing while speaking, Zhou Weiqing felt a gradually growing force as they fell towards the abyss below. Was the person that they were meeting in the abyss? Though Zhou Weiqing was surprised, he did not react slowly. He needed to do something that matched his current cultivation base to prevent the others from suspecting him. That was what he thought but what he did in reality was\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As for Kou Rui, he was looking at Zhou Weiqing with a fiery, passionate, adoring gaze. With a *swoosh*, he had jumped off from his bunk.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss! I want to be your subordinate, let me follow you from now on!\u201d Kou Rui said directly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing started. \u201cWhy? Wasn\u2019t it a mistake earlier? That Zang Lang fellow is actually protecting the other commoner students? Why do you want to follow me? Is that fellow okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Rui said: \u201cThat day, he awoke not long after you left, he did not sustain any heavy injuries. When he left, he did not say anything. Perhaps what the rest of the seniors said is true, and that he has always been protecting the commoner students. However, to me, all I saw was that when we were being bullied, you were the only one in our dormitory who stood up to defend us. You are a Spatial Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, I can still recognize the Blink skill\u2026 Furthermore with three sets of Jewels and Consolidated Equipment to boot. We commoner students are already being suppressed, so I am more than willing to follow you during our study period. I believe that if we meet something similar again, you can do a lot better than Zang Lang.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cGood. I\u2019ll take care of you in future, I like intelligent fellows like you.\u201d As he said that, he grabbed the quilt from his bed. \u201cHowever, I will not be staying in the dormitory in future, I\u2019ll see you all in class tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Rui started. \u201cBoss, you are moving out to stay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head, saying: \u201cI already rented a house, Kou Rui. Oh yes, are you a Physical Jewel Master or a Elemental Jewel Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Rui said rather gloomily: \u201cI\u2019m a Physical Jewel Master, 2-Jeweled, without any Consolidated Equipment. My attributes are half agility and half coordination, one of the most useless combinations of Physical Jewel Masters, without any form of attacking capabilities. If not for that, I would have rushed to fight with them as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, saying: \u201cThere are no such thing as useless powers or abilities, it is just a matter of finding your path of training. We can speak more about that in the future, I have to go now to confirm my new lodgings. I\u2019ll talk to you when we meet back up in class.\u201d As he said that, he headed out towards the exit. From start to end, none of the other roommates spoke a single word to him. Besides Ma Qun, the other five were looking at him with obvious fear and hesitation.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing reached the entrance of the dormitory building, Shangguan Bing\u2019er was already waiting for him. With exit permits in hand, they managed to leave the school. After walking for several minutes, crossing a small path, they finally reached the room that Zhou Weiqing had found.</p><br/><p>As they neared the entrance, they heard the sound of an argument.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry young lady, that is not possible. I have already accepted another person\u2019s deposit. Even if you pay more, I cannot break my word, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another voice sounded out: \u201cUncle landlord, look at me, a lone girl, could you bear to kick me out all alone into the streets? At most\u2026 I\u2019ll pay double of your asking price.\u201d The voice was extremely soft and seductive, yet with a strand of coldness within, extremely unique and intriguing.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhhmm....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, double the price will not do! Don\u2019t you understand the meaning of first come first serve?\u201d Zhou Weiqing pushed open the door and said as he entered the house.</p><br/><p>The landlord was a middle aged man of almost fifty years of age, with an awkward look on his face showing the dilemma he was facing. In front of him stood a young lady dressed in white.</p><br/><p>Looking at the young lady, Zhou Weiqing started, thinking to himself: <em>Isn\u2019t that Ming Yu\u2019s little sister? Why isn\u2019t she staying at home instead of trying to rent this room here?</em></p><br/><p>Indeed, the person who was bargaining with the landlord was Ming Hua.</p><br/><p>When Ming Hua spotted Zhou Weiqing, she was obviously startled as well. Looking at Shangguan Bing\u2019er beside him, her mouth curled in an amused smirk.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a peek at Ming Hua\u2019s voluptuous, sexy body, ripe as a peach, and couldn\u2019t help swallow a gulp of saliva. <em>Damn, she is hot!</em></p><br/><p>Ming Hua looked to be about 20 years old or so. Compared to Shangguan Bing\u2019er, her beauty was the sort that was displayed out and more mature looking, a contrast with Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s sweet, quiet and graceful beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the ones who want to rent this place?\u201d Ming Hua\u2019s eyes shone with a seductive gleam as she smiled faintly and said in a soft tone. \u201cHow about letting me have the place instead please?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was almost dazed by her look, and almost agreed to it when he felt a sharp pain on his waist as Shangguan Bing\u2019er pinched him. \u201cNo, we were the ones who rented this first. Little Fatty, pay the rent.\u201d It was indeed a rare sight to see Shangguan Bing\u2019er so resolute and firm, clearly Ming Hua\u2019s beauty gave her a sense of danger.</p><br/><p>Ming Hua gave a faint smile, looking at Zhou Weiqing who was standing at the side swallowing saliva in several large gulps, and she said once again in a softer, more gentle tone. \u201cWon\u2019t you let me have it please?\u201d As she said that, she thought to herself. <em>Brother said this little fellow is dangerous, but it seems that despite his abilities, looking at his character, he doesn\u2019t seem to be much.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. If my wife says no then of course the answer is no.\u201d Just as Ming Hua was full of disdain towards Zhou Weiqing in her heart, the lustful looking rascal suddenly seemed to morph instantly into a gentleman, speaking suavely. The speed of him changing face was indeed impressive.</p><br/><p>Ming Hua started faintly, though the expression on her face did not change. She was not called the Flower of Hades\u2019 Underworld for nothing. \u201cWhat if I do not want to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErrr\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing turned his head to look at Shangguan Bing\u2019er with a troubled look on his face. Although he liked beauties, without question Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s place in his heart was unshakable, which was why he was able to change faces so quickly. However, looking at Ming Hua\u2019s expression of \u2018not giving a damn\u2019, he was at a loss on what to do.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er couldn\u2019t stand Ming Hua\u2019s seductive look and said solemnly: \u201cThis lady, please control yourself and think of your own reputation. If you aren\u2019t willing to leave yourself, then we will have to ask you to do so personally.\u201d As she said that, she lifted her right hand, and in a flash of green light, her three Dragonstone Jade Physical Jewels appeared around her wrist.</p><br/><p>Ming Hua\u2019s eyes revealed a hint of surprise.<em> Another 3-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master? How surprising! This year\u2019s crop of commoner freshmen students are indeed impressive! Even the Fei Li Heavenly Jewel Master Academy might not even have 3-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master freshmen.</em></p><br/><p>Upon seeing Shangguan Bing\u2019er release her Physical Jewels, the landlord\u2019s face turned pale. Such a pure white colour surely meant she was a Heavenly Jewel Master! He did not dare to offend any Heavenly Jewel Master. His last shred of hesitation disappeared, and just as he was about to open his mouth to ask Ming Hua to leave, she also lifted up her right hand. With another flash of light, four milky white waxy Jade Jewels appeared around her wrist - denoting the Flexibility Physical Jewel.</p><br/><p>This time, it was Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s turn to be shocked. Shangguan Bing\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but cry out in surprise: \u201cLower Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Hua\u2019s beautiful face blushed with a tinge of embarrassment, making anyone who looked at her feel an urge to protect her. \u201cI have to protect myself right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMasturbate\u2026 [1. pun / wordplay  &amp;  both read as (zi wei)\uff0cthe former meaning self protection and the latter is self pleasure *ahem*]\u201d Zhou Weiqing felt a rush of blood to his head and nearly bled out from the nose as he stared at Ming Hua with a strange expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Ming Hua blushed fully red, this time it was for real. How could she not hear what Zhou Weiqing meant. \u201cHmph, you\u2019re only sixteen years old, so young, yet what is in that head of yours! What a pity this beautiful young lady is with you. Fine, I won\u2019t act with you anymore, I am definitely renting this house. If you have the capability, you can defeat me and I will let you have it instead, if not, it is mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>The landlord had by now retreated far away. Both sides were Heavenly Jewel Masters, and he certainly did not want any part in this argument, and letting both sides resolve the matter between themselves was the wiser choice on his part.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ming Hua\u2019s words, Zhou Weiqing asked puzzledly: \u201cHow did you know I am sixteen years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Hua gave a cold humph and said: \u201cIf I know means I know, stop talking rubbish. If you want to rent this house, you\u2019ll have to defeat me first. Aren\u2019t you so good at fighting eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stared at her speechless for a while, before finally saying: \u201cBeautiful lady, aren\u2019t you being unreasonable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Hua laughed enchantingly: \u201cAre you asking a lady to be reasonable? You must be dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she sashayed towards Zhou Weiqing, her slim waist moving like a slim tree in the wind, as if about to break at any time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her voluptuous figure with another gulp, before thrusting out his chest, acting in a bold manner. \u201cFine, fight it shall be! As if I will be scared of you!? Bing\u2019er, move aside a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er made a slight sound of agreement, moving to the side. Although she had warned Zhou Weiqing earlier not to cause trouble, she knew that if someone was looking for trouble and being unreasonable, they had no choice but to act as well. After all, she was kindhearted, not stupid. Furthermore, from the look of Ming Hua\u2019s Heavenly Jewels, it was likely that she was no match for Ming Hua. However, it might be different for Zhou Weiqing, as Shangguan Bing\u2019er was very clear how much power her Little Fatty had now, especially after breaking through to his third set of Heavenly Jewels, she herself was no match for him already. It could be said that, with his six attributes and that Demonic Right Leg, Zhou Weiqing was unbeatable amongst anyone of equal level. Even with four sets of Jewels, Ming Hua might not be able to defeat him. Basically, for the Heavenly Bow Unit to let the two of them out half a year early, they indeed felt that there was nothing more they could teach the two of them, most especially Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As he has entered the Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation state, the scales on his body slowly vanished. The only thing that was changing was the color of his skin that had begun alternating between black and grey. His hair slowly turned grey as well, and his body began to emit an indescribably powerful aura. It was an aura of someone at the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>This did not mean that Zhou Weiqing has already reached the Heavenly God Tier. However, the aura in his bloodlines seemed to have already reached the Heavenly God Tier. It was clear that if his cultivation base went through a breakthrough, would his body\u2019s capabilities still be limited to that of the Heavenly God Tier?</p><br/><p>You could say that the combined effects of the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodlines, the Dragon Emperor Bloodlines, and the Elven Queen resulted in the creation of a powerful bloodline that Zhou Weiqing has never possessed before. His cultivation base remained the same, but the frightening thing about the state of his body now was the fact that even dragons could not hold be compared to him right now.</p><br/><p>With a gentle sound, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body released a ball of dark green light. The dark green light then blossomed to reveal the Elven Queen. However, her face was now very pale as she yelped and spit out a small mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen had fast reflexes. She waved her right arm and solidified her blood in mid-air. Then, a small, dark green bottle appeared in her hand. Under her control, the blood trickled into the bottle.</p><br/><p>Once that was complete, she could no longer hold it in. Her body came crashing down from the sky and landed on Zhou Weiqing. The two fell to the ground at the same time with a soft thud before the Elven Queen lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>The mystical feat displayed by the Elven Queen was one of the most mysterious abilities of the Elf Tribe, known as the Elven Heart.</p><br/><p>Only adults of the royal lineage within the Elf Tribe would be able to harness the powers of the Elven Heart. Once the Elven Heart is released, you could move the heavens and earth to create the purest form of Life Saint Energy. Simply put, if the Elf Tribe were to be at risk of extinction, the strength of the elven soldiers would double and they would become immortal as long as the Elven Queen released the Elven Heart. Under these circumstances, even a Heavenly God-tier cultivator would find it difficult to kill the average Elf under the sustenance of the Elven Heart.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the Elven Heart was considered to be the Elf\u2019s Tribe\u2019s final resort in ensuring their survival. Generally speaking, only Elven Queens of past dynasties would have access to such abilities.</p><br/><p>For every Elven Queen, the Elven Heart can only be used once in her life. At this moment, the current Elven Queen of this era has utilized the one and only Elven Heart she had in her lifetime and given it to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>You could say that the Elven Heart was more important to the Elven Queen than her chastity. This was a powerful ability that involved the Elf Tribe\u2019s lineage.</p><br/><p>Mere moments ago, the Elven Queen could not think of any other way to save Zhou Weiqing, aside from utilizing this ability. With her heart clouded in remorse and a change in her psyche, she finally decided to utilize the Elven Heart.</p><br/><p>Once an Elven Queen has used her Elven Heart, she must abdicate the throne within the next ten years, and allow the next Elven Queen to take over. It could be said that although the Elven Queen had attacked Zhou Weiqing and caused him heavy injuries, she has paid a far greater price. This would be beyond Zhou Weiqing\u2019s comprehension.</p><br/><p>An Elven Queen who has utilized the Elven Heart would become considerably weaker. Her initially near-limitless Life Energy would become ten times weaker, and she would not even think of regaining her vigor in less than ten years.</p><br/><p>Yet, she who has completed such a task displayed a delighted smile on her face. The Elven Queen did not regret her decision. If she did not do so and Zhou Weiqing died, it would probably bring destruction to the Elf Tribe all the same. Besides, she could never forgive herself for her mistake today. Furthermore, her daughter has been saved. The loss of one Elven Heart signified the growth of a new Elven Heart.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen may have lost her Elven Heart, but her daughter would certainly grow more rapidly as a result. Within ten years, with the help of the elders and the current Elven Queen, she would gain the ability to replace the Elven Queen.</p><br/><p>After an unknown amount of time had passed, Zhou Weiqing slowly awoke from his coma. When he recovered his state of mind, he felt a strange energy coursing through his veins. The strangest thing of all was that his Divine Thought seemed to have grown stronger than before. Without even having to deliberately sense anything, his spiritual world would light up immediately, and everything within his body was present in his consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this?\u2019 Zhou Weiqing was stunned.</p><br/><p>Be it his circulation, bones or internal organs, everything felt more durable than before, so powerful that it would make one boil with anger. On his bones, a faint layer of black-grey energy circulated continuously, glimmering with a faint fluorescent light. His entire body from head to toe was filled with a terrifying power that could tear through the heavens and the earth.</p><br/><p>The Nebula Saint Energy in his body seemed to have received some sort of quenching, its originally pure gold hue seemed to have grown a few shades lighter and developed towards the direction of a white-gold shade. Even his cultivation base has actually broken through to the Upper Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier.</p><br/><p>What the f*ck! Was he dreaming? How was this possible? Even if he back-tracked through the Galaxia and absorbed four to five Heavenly Emperor cultivators\u2019 Heavenly Core Nucleus energy, he would not have increased that much. The changes to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body gave him a strong otherworldly feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?\u201d Just then, he felt something soft on top of him, and opened his eyes instinctively.</p><br/><p>The first thing that entered his gaze was a head of dark green hair. That faint Natural Energy melting into the purest of all fragrances gave Zhou Weiqing a carefree and relaxed feeling. He raised his arms automatically and held the delicate figure above him in his arms. The soft and supple feeling gave the guy a kind of reaction.</p><br/><p>Who is this? None of his female companions had dark green hair!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing turned over, sat up and hugged the delicate figure close to his chest. However, once he saw the features on the pale face, his eyeballs nearly fell out of their sockets as he narrowly threw the charming person in his arms away.</p><br/><p>The sky is falling, the ground is caving in! What is the Elven Queen doing butt-naked in my arms?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was so in shock that his elation immediately turned to naivety. He was not even this nervous during his wretched appearance with Dongfang Hanyue. His first thought was that if the Elf Tribe knew that he was hugging the Elven Queen, butt-naked on top of that, it would be impossible not to provoke the entire tribe into hunting him for his blood.</p><br/><p>During this short period of shock, Zhou Weiqing did not dare to flip the Elven Queen off. Instead, he quickly looked left and right, dispersing his Divine Thought to ensure that there wasn\u2019t a single human within a radius of several hundred miles around them. He quickly pulled out a set of his own clothes and quickly put them on the Elven Queen. He then carefully placed her on the ground, and put on his own clothes. Only then was he able to recall everything that had happened.</p><br/><p>The fight. The first thing that Zhou Weiqing remembered was the fight.</p><br/><p>Earlier on when they began hunting down the man in black, Zhou Weiqing had already expected that the enemy might use the Elven Princess to threaten them and had made preparations for this.</p><br/><p>Plainly speaking, he anticipated that the Elven Queen would descend into madness and attack him once he moved to attack the Elven Princess. At that moment, he had no way of warning the Elven Queen. No matter what methods he could have used to warn her, even a slight change in the look in his eye would put the man in black at height of anxiety. Besides, he was also a Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivator and would have been able to pick up on it. If that were to happen, their previous efforts would have gone to waste. It may also result in the little Elven Princess\u2019 death.</p><br/><p>So, at that time, Zhou Weiqing could only grit his teeth and assume responsibility. The ball of white-gold light was a special ability that he had received after his promotion to the Heavenly Emperor Tier. It could temporarily utilize the nebula from the sky and explode into the most powerful offensive or defensive stance. This ability was the Nebula Cosmos.</p><br/><p>Whenever he used Nebula Cosmos, Zhou Weiqing would temporarily receive Nebula Saint Energy at one level higher than his own instantly. That is also to say, that it is quite possible that he can only receive the white-gold Nebula Saint Energy once he entered the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>In order to ensure the little Elven Princess\u2019 safety, Zhou Weiqing placed all of this energy into her body, without holding anything back. One can only imagine the terrifying might of Saint Energy at the Heavenly God Tier, so you could say that the little Elven Princess has profited from a disaster. Receiving Zhou Weiqing\u2019s own exceptionally purified Saint Energy would also render all attacks from the man in black against her completely useless. Under these circumstances, Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen would definitely be able to get her back.</p><br/><p>This was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s plan. He had also thought of the Elven Queen\u2019s reaction, so when he released the white-gold light, he raised his defense to the highest level at that moment in time and stiffly endured the Elven Queen\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>However, he still underestimated the power in the slap of a Heavenly God-tier cultivator. His powerful defense was broken through and the full force of the Elven Queen\u2019s slap broke through his Ringless Ground Purging Set. It would be at least ten days before he could utilize the set. At the same time, she also broke through his Immortal Deity Shield and Demon God Protective defense. If Zhou Weiqing did not have so many defenses, coupled with the fact that his body was unyielding enough, he might have lost his life in that one attack.</p><br/><p>Saint Energy was not all-powerful. If Zhou Weiqing was thoroughly destroyed, even his Saint Energy would not be able to save him.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Zhou Weiqing managed to endure it all and even used his final shred of strength to kill the enemy. Once he had completed this, he naturally heaved a sigh of relief. The enemy was dead, and the little Elven Princess was saved. No matter how stupid the Elven Queen was, she should be able to see what he had accomplished.</p><br/><p>So, at the moment he lost consciousness, his face broke into a smile. The hint of craftiness was because he thought that this time, the Elven Blood was in his hand, for he had put in so much effort! He even ended up wounding himself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

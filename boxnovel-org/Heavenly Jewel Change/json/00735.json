However, even if it was just a tiny quiver, it still attracted a considerable amount of Atmospheric Energy. Zhou Weiqing could feel his cultivation was slowly improving. This process of improvement was to convert the Atmospheric Energy from outside into Saint Energy, which was then compressed into Saint Energy Galaxia.</p><br/><p>It was a slow process but this continuous improvement was what most Heavenly Jewel Masters with a Nine Jewel cultivation base could only dream about.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s meditation took a whole day. When he finally woke from the meditation state, he had returned to his spirited self.</p><br/><p>The room had already been cleaned, and there was even a new serving of food. Zhou Weiqing did not feign courtesy. He finished the food quickly and left a satchel of gold. He did not even bid the village girl goodbye. He went out the door, identified his direction, and leaped into the air while unleashing his Dragon-Tiger Transformation Wings before rushing toward the Mysterious Heavenly Palace as fast as he could.</p><br/><p>This concerned Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s life, how could he not be worried? In his mind, the Spatial Teleportation Stone was nothing compared to Shangguan Bing\u2019er. Nothing could be more important than his Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>On the seventh floor, Mysterious Heavenly Castle, Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>The entire Mysterious Heavenly Palace management was seated. However, the atmosphere was currently pretty somber.</p><br/><p>This time, Dongfang Hanyue sat on the main seat, while the previous Palace Master, her mother, a classy middle-aged lady, sat on the seat Dongfang Hanyue occupied when she pretended to be Meng Xing.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue had just returned not long after she received the news.</p><br/><p>On the day Zhou Weiqing fell into a coma, she had wanted to bring him back to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace before she suddenly received the news about Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>Her mother and several other Supreme Elders were back too. Not only that, they had restricted Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s movement as soon as they had the chance of capturing her. This was why Zhou Weiqing was not able to communicate with Shangguan Bing\u2019er after a while.</p><br/><p>The Mysterious Heavenly Palace had something similar to a Sound Transmission Stone as well. Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s mother, Dongfang, used it to determine everyone\u2019s safety as well as informing her about the capture of Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue was naturally impatient. She had asked her mother to release Shangguan Bing\u2019er without success. Left with no other choice, she dared not bring Zhou Weiqing back directly, so she left him at the fishing village to take care of the issue herself. She did not know how the relationship between Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er was, but she was still Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lover! If she was hurt in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, Zhou Weiqing would probably antagonize her immediately after. That was not what she wanted to happen.</p><br/><p>In that sense, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s guess was not right. He could not have guessed the complexity of the matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease Shangguan Bing\u2019er immediately,\u201d Dongfang Hanyue ordered without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Elder Water frowned, \u201cPalace Master, please calm down. This is something we need to discuss in detail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue said angrily, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to discuss? Let\u2019s ignore Zhou Weiqing\u2019s status as an Honorary Master of Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Shangguan Bing\u2019er is still an Elder. Most importantly, it was Zhou Weiqing who saved all of us at a critical time when we fought the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. We shouldn\u2019t treat him like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Water sighed and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Zhou Weiqing saved us. However, Palace Master, did you consider one issue? Zhou Weiqing hid his true power from all of us without us even noticing. Is there not something wrong with that? Moreover, what\u2019s that skill he used at that time? Even a Heavenly God-tier\u2019s power was suppressed. It might not be an offensive skill, but it clearly illustrates how Zhou Weiqing has the power to threaten us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow old is he? Early twenties, I suppose. Yet he already has a cultivation base of Nine Jewels, as well as that weird Heavenly Energy. Would you believe it even if it\u2019s not suspicious? Furthermore, he doesn\u2019t have the inheritance that you have. I am afraid he has an ulterior motive joining the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. It\u2019s true that he had done us a great service. However, for the sake of our survival, I\u2019ll like you to reconsider. We have to investigate thoroughly, so we should wait for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s return. Shangguan Bing\u2019er is our trump card, we did not mistreat her. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s face was scary. It was flushed with fury and pale with worry. She had to admit that the Elders had a point. She also knew what Zhou Weiqing was trying to accomplish. \u2018However, if he returns, will the Elders let him off easy? What to do? What can I do?\u2019 she thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho ordered the house arrest on Shangguan Bing\u2019er? You dare decide on things on your own when I\u2019m gone?\u201d Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s voice dropped into an eerie tone, her eyes betrayed her killing intent. She was also utterly confused. She had yet to clarify the matter between herself and Zhou Weiqing, and something like this happened in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was me,\u201d Dongfang who sat quietly since before spoke up.</p><br/><p>Hearing her mother\u2019s voice, Dongfang Hanyue was startled, \u201cMother, how could you do that? Won\u2019t that be pushing Zhou Weiqing to oppose us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang\u2019s eyebrows were knitted together. She said, \u201cHanyue, the things one holds dear to one\u2019s heart often confuses them. It looks like you really fell for him. If he\u2019s an Honorary Master, I\u2019ll not object to releasing her. However, it\u2019s not clear what his intention is. How can we not thoroughly investigate this? You\u2019re the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, how can you be so reckless? Think about the big picture, don\u2019t you think we need to find out? Also, regarding Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s house arrest, only a few of us know about it. Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t have possibly found out. After we sort things out when he returns, there\u2019ll be no problem if he\u2019s really not planning to do anything to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue could throw a tantrum at the Elders, but how could she do it to her mother? Even though she was the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, she had not held the position for long. If her mother stood together with the four Supreme Elders, her influence would not be enough.</p><br/><p>Elder Water advised, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad. Zhou Weiqing saved us, we\u2019ll never forget that. We\u2019re not people who\u2019ll betray a person\u2019s trust like that. However, it\u2019s also imperative for you to consider the state of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. We\u2019ve lost six Elders in this battle, it can be said that we\u2019re rather beaten up. In this critical period, it\u2019ll be a disaster if problems arise within the Palace. We only decided on this after giving it a thorough consideration.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue kept quiet. The Elders and her mother were not wrong. If she could have kept calm, she would have understood that they were only doing the right thing. Zhou Weiqing was still an outsider after all. However, Zhou Weiqing had earned an immovable spot in her heart. She had even given him her most precious possession. In this situation, she had already taken Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>There was also the operation against the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Instead of calling it a success, it was more of a lose-lose situation. Even though one Dreadfiend Sea Naga was dead, there was still the other one. The dead one had also exploded. No one had gained any benefits. Instead, they had lost six Elders. It was no wonder the four Supreme Elders were being so cautious.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue took a deep breath as she tried to calm herself down with mediocre success. She clenched her jaw a little and made up her mind. Sometimes it was better to explain things than to leave people in the dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I know his intentions,\u201d Dongfang Hanyue sighed and reluctantly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d Dongfang looked at her daughter in surprise, \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue smiled wryly, \u201cAfter the sea naga exploded, we were both sent by the shockwave to the same place. We drifted on the sea for a while before we arrived at a deserted island. It was there that we met up. At that time, I had the same questions as you do. I even suspected he would attack me. When we met up, I was badly injured and was only left with less than one-tenth of my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was describing, everyone listened in shock. When they had seen her returning without injury, they thought she was not hurt at all. When the Dreadfiend Sea Naga self-destructed, the Supreme Elders and Dongfang powered up the Ward of Darkness with their full strength. Although they were injured, they managed to retreat safely because of their Heavenly King tier cultivation. Once it was mentioned by Dongfang Hanyue, they were suddenly reminded that Dongfang Hanyue was right in the middle of the explosion since she was one of the main force attacking the Dreadfiend Sea Naga!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he do anything to you?\u201d Dongfang asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue sighed and said, \u201cMother, if he wanted to do anything to me, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here. Not only did he not hurt me, he even used the miraculous Heavenly Energy that he called Saint Energy to heal me. It didn\u2019t take long before I was completely healed and recovered to my peak state.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had forced him to answer me about his background at that time. He told me everything without withholding anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right there and then, Dongfang Hanyue told them everything about Zhou Weiqing. Every one of their faces paled when they heard that Zhou Weiqing came from the Boundless Mainland and that he did not belong to any Saint Lands.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 he approached us with the intention of acquiring the Spatial Teleportation Stone. If he had been waiting on the side when we were battling the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, with his cultivation base, it\u2019s not hard for us to guess how easy it would be for him to succeed. If it wasn\u2019t for him, we would have to face two Dreadfiend Sea Nagas! However, he didn\u2019t do it. He saved us knowing there\u2019s a risk the nagas might kill him. I\u2019ll admit that I was moved. In that split second, I fell in love with him.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

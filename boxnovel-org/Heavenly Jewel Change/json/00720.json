To repay kindness with kindness and hostility with hostility. He was not one to repay kindness with hostility!</p><br/><p>Therefore, Zhou Weiqing was conflicted. He knew this was as good a chance as any, but he considered staying his hands. In any case, it all depended on how the situation developed. He even considered coming clean with his identity. The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace might award him the Spatial Teleportation Stone for his honesty. Admittedly, the chances of that happening were very low. The elders had already said so, the Spatial Teleportation Stone only had a few uses left in it. The chances of them willingly borrowing him the stone was low.</p><br/><p>Oh, well, he would shift the sails as the wind blew. Even though Zhou Weiqing was formulating his thoughts, he was on full alert. This was because he was within the range of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s powerful demonic and soul energy. He did not dare to fully release his perception as well. One wrong move and he might get seriously injured, therefore, he only relied on his eyesight as he watched the scene unfold.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing perched on a spot that they had passed by on the way there. Behind him was the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. Since the Dreadfiend Sea Naga lived in the deep ocean, waiting so close to land meant that the Dreadfiend Sea Naga would not appear close to him.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s bellows did not cease. If anything, the dragon\u2019s spirited howl had only gotten louder and louder. The same went with the presence radiating from his body. He was not only manipulating the power of darkness between heaven and earth, he was gathering power for himself.</p><br/><p>When one had reached the Heavenly God Tier, every battle was extremely dangerous. Even a small mistake could tip the scales of the battle greatly.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing suddenly perked his ears. Down near the horizon, an equally scary collection of energy had appeared. The collection of energy was so palpable that Zhou Weiqing could see it with his naked eyes. At the end of his sight, the dark clouds that originally covered the sky started to part in ripples.</p><br/><p>In its place was not the blue sky but a wall of waves that were practically joined to the sky.</p><br/><p>Yes, a wave. The wall of seawater was so high that its crest had reached the sky. The giant wave was crashing down in their direction with incredible speed like it was powered by an electrical motor.</p><br/><p>No wonder the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was called the ruler of the sea. While Zhou Weiqing was awestruck, he shuffled a few steps back.</p><br/><p>Through the haze, he could see in the middle of that giant wave was a gigantic dragon\u2019s head that was formed by the consolidation of sea water. It was howling crazily. It was the call of the sea, and it swallowed the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s powerful bellows.</p><br/><p>Such power.</p><br/><p>In just a blink of an eye, the sea had changed back into an azure, clear state as if all the impurities had been washed away. The whole sea had started to bubble, great walls of waves rose into the sky and concentrated water energy burst into the air like gushing fountains, cleansing the demonic energy.</p><br/><p>This was the ocean after all. The most concentrated element had to be water! Furthermore, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s cultivation base was higher than the Blackfiend Dragon. After this initial onslaught, the presence that the Blackfiend Dragon had manifested earlier waned considerably.</p><br/><p>However, the Blackfiend Dragon did not show any sign of compromise. Even though the howling gradually ceased, the dark clouds in the sky hung around like they had crystallized, continuously coming into conflict with the sky-high waves. Each collision created sparks like lightning and various elements between heaven and earth shivered from the collisions.</p><br/><p>This was a fight between Heavenly God Tier powerhouses. Be it the sea or dark clouds, these were manifestations of nature. They were manipulating the power of nature to combat each other.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing observed the battle with glowing eyes. He would not have the opportunity to witness a combat of this caliber more than a few times with his eyes. Even the smallest energy maneuver could greatly benefit his cultivation training.</p><br/><p>The wave suddenly stopped when it reached the height of several thousand meters. It slowly parted to reveal a gigantic shadow supported by the weight of the blue ocean.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga. This is the Dreadfiend Sea Naga?</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon was not a looker but in comparison to this Dreadfiend Sea Naga, he could be considered handsome.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga was a lot larger than the Blackfiend Dragon. The length of its body was more than a hundred meters but it did not have wings. Its physical body had the appearance of a cylindrical pillar but one that was covered in dark blue spines. The spines around its head were more than half a meter wide and combined with its gaping maw, it was truly a terrifying sight to behold.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou finally have the guts to show yourself? Done hiding in your mountain valley?\u201d the Dreadfiend Sea Naga had the voice of a lively youth and his tone was dripping with derision.</p><br/><p>Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s gaze was solemn. The Dreadfiend Sea Naga before him had a higher cultivation than he did as he had expected. Furthermore, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga had not wandered into the range of the Ward of Darkness yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have been raising tsunamis and chaos in the ocean causing so many loss of lives. Aren\u2019t you afraid of attracting the heaven\u2019s wrath? You should know, now that we\u2019ve reached this stage, it\u2019s very easy to attract the heaven\u2019s ire,\u201d Blackfiend Dragon said coldly.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga started laughing like he had heard the best joke in the world. \u201cHeaven\u2019s wrath? Do you want to talk about causing the loss of lives with me? You must be joking. Also, that human on your head. If you really want to talk about the loss of lives, I am pretty sure humans are the winner. How many benefits have you humans reaped from the ocean every year? How many innocent sea creatures have you humans slaughtered? And you want to criticize me for causing the loss of lives? At the end of the day, what\u2019s heaven\u2019s wrath? After all, heaven\u2019s wrath might not even be able to kill me. Blackfiend Dragon, so many years ago, my father was lured to land by the people from Mysterious Heavenly Palace to be slaughtered with your aid. So many years have passed and I have cultivated enough to ensure that as long as I am alive, none of you people from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland will be able to benefit from the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s gaze turned cold. \u201cYour father? If he was not so arrogant so many years ago, would he have been slaughtered? Also, have you forgotten the criminal things he had done? He used Ocean Beasts to lure Jewel Masters so he could consume them to increase his own power. It was because he had consumed so many Heavenly Core Nucleus of numerous Heavenly King Tier powerhouses that we from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace were forced to intervene due to the immense public outcry. His end also caused us a great amount of loss. Why do you wish to walk on the same path as him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga scoffed condescendingly, \u201cStop trying to guilt trip me. You\u2019re extremely clear that in our world, the most powerful is king. What are humans but ants? If not for the fact that they have a greater affinity for cultivation than us Heavenly Beasts, this world would have no space for them to exist. The ocean is mine, I\u2019m the ruler of the sea. The fact that you humans trod into the ocean is a personal slight. Today, after I\u2019m done with you, I\u2019ll deal with those humans on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. After my cultivation base has increased, it won\u2019t be an issue to submerge the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon had been vying for the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s Nucleus Core and it was the same for the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Furthermore, this Dreadfiend Sea Naga was extremely familiar with the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. On the entire mainland, only the Blackfiend Dragon, this Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, could rival him. If he killed the Blackfiend Dragon, the entire Mysterious Heavenly Mainland would be in his grasp. At that time, even the distant Boundless Mainland might fall under his influence. Regardless, this was only just a plan. After all, to go after the Boundless Mainland still required plenty of contemplation. It was the birthplace of the Dragon Emperor Bloodlines after all.</p><br/><p>The wings on the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s back slowly unfurled. He stared at the Dreadfiend Sea Naga residing in the waves and roared, \u201cIf you still persist on being so stubborn, then today will be your last. Your ending will not be that different from your father\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, the Blackfiend Dragon roared angrily as his gigantic body rose into the sky. Then, the demonic clouds in the sky contracted as they wreathed themselves around the dragon\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>In just a blink of an eye, a giant ray of black light shot towards the ocean.</p><br/><p>The black light was completely made out of demonic clouds. When it was shot out from the sky, the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s body was in its full glory. In other words, the dark clouds that had concealed the sun from view earlier had all disappeared. This blow had consolidated the energy of all the demonic clouds.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon was familiar with the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s power, especially when it was in the ocean so he did not hold back.</p><br/><p>The large ray of black light fused and shifted into the shape of the Blackfiend Dragon as it shot through the sky. A dragon made out of pure energy surged towards the ocean.</p><br/><p>In the deep waves, Dreadfiend Sea Naga whipped its gigantic head and instantly, a dragon\u2019s head constructed from waves of water ascended from the ocean. It collided head-on with the Blackfiend Dragon made from demonic clouds.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt shaken to his very soul. Without him realizing what had happened, his whole body fell into the ocean. A thunderous boom shattered the spirit world.</p><br/><p>The momentous collision knocked him into the ocean.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Zhou Weiqing had an amazing physical constitution. Without Saint Energy, a normal Jewel Master with a Six Jewel cultivation base would have died from the pulsating tremors alone.</p><br/><p>The collision of Heavenly God Tier powerhouses could definitely bring the world to ruins!</p><br/><p>The energy fluctuation exploded in the next second. The ocean was roiling. When Zhou Weiqing broke through the water\u2019s surface, he saw the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s huge body drifting back. Obviously, he was injured during the collision earlier.</p><br/><p>A ray of blood red glint shot out from atop the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s head. The blood red glint came from the dragon spear in Meng Xing\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Then, an odd thing happened. The conceited Dreadfiend Sea Naga showed a trace of caution when it noticed the bloody red glint. It stopped chasing the Blackfiend Dragon and chose to submerge itself back into the ocean.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Among the Heavenly King tier powerhouses of Blood Red Hell, he was one of the better fighters. However, he had a weak point, and that was his cocky attitude.</p><br/><p>When he faced opponents who were weaker than him, he loved playing with them before killing them in cold blood. His personality was one of the more hated ones in the Blood Red Hell. He really could not think of how he would lose to a twenty-something-year-old like Zhou Weiqing. Wanting to impress the four Elders, he decided to battle only with one hand.</p><br/><p>Never once did Zhou Weiqing\u2019s smile waver. However, it took Long Shiya, who was behind Zhou Weiqing, all his concentration to not break into a smile, but his plump cheeks quivered a little.</p><br/><p>Ever since Zhou Weiqing started to bargain with his opponents and discuss the bets, Long Shiya had wanted to laugh.</p><br/><p>The day before, when Zhou Weiqing met the Demonic Emperor, he had invited his own teacher here to discuss countermeasures against the Blood Red Hell\u2019s invasion. Without a doubt, they understood really well that the Blood Red Hell had decided to obliterate the Heavenly Demon Sect, as well as destroy the Heavenly Bow Empire on the side. If it was so, the Blood Red Hell would have brought a large number of powerhouses along.</p><br/><p>There was only a small chance for them to win in a head-on fight. However, this battle had been unavoidable, and the Demonic Emperor, Wu Yunyue, had had no idea how to respond to the challenge.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the initiative fell into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lap. He had his hands in every section of the plan.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, he had laid a trap, and the trap was based on his power level as a foundation. Anyone who had made a bet against Zhou Weiqing would know his betting behavior.</p><br/><p>That was why Long Shiya kept wanting to laugh. He was watching his dearest disciple lay the traps and his victims jump headfirst into them.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strategy was very simple, and it was to weaken. He kept weakening his opponent\u2019s strength, and when both sides had a similar power level, heh\u2026</p><br/><p>Using a tournament-style betting system was clearly the best way to weaken his opponent. His rule about unlimited participation was one that was tailored to him. As someone who had the Devour Skill, how could his stamina be compared to normal people\u2019s standards?</p><br/><p>Having witnessed how Tian Lei had underestimated his disciple, Long Shiya had already marked him as good as dead.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Wu Yunyue felt something different. He had heard many things about Zhou Weiqing, but this was his first time meeting him. He was not sure what Zhou Weiqing\u2019s real strength was, but judging from the way he stood there, how he could talk so casually in front of someone who was much stronger than him, and how he manipulated his opponents to follow his logic, he was already a talent. Wu Yunyue recalled his own path when he was still at the Heavenly King Tier cultivation base. He would never have been able to put down his ego and talk as if he was placating someone. It was as if Zhou Weiqing did not even have self-awareness as a powerhouse.</p><br/><p>However, people like this were the most dangerous ones. A powerhouse who was willing to do just about anything was more tricky than his peers.</p><br/><p>A hint of a smile appeared on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face. Compared to Tian Lei\u2019s cockiness, he looked as if he was a little scared and bowed slightly to his opponent.</p><br/><p>Tian Lei\u2019s arrogance determined that he would not attack Zhou Weiqing during that exchange. If he could not tell that, Zhou Weiqing would have wasted his time all this while.</p><br/><p>Tian Lei said pompously, \u201cCome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he even finished his sentence, Zhou Weiqing disappeared from his sight, still maintaining the bowing pose from earlier.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing liked it when people underestimated him. With opponents like this, he did not feel pressured at all.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s sudden disappearance surprised Tian Lei, but he was still a Heavenly King Tier powerhouse from Blood Red Hell, and he reacted as soon as possible. A wave of Heavenly Energy with a mix of Fire and Destruction Attribute burst out of his body. His whole body was lit up into a ball of fire, and the explosive force that was born from it caused a non-discriminatory attack on everything around it.</p><br/><p>Everyone else had already retreated to the sides. A battle between Heavenly King Tier powerhouses could affect a large area, and no one would want to be involved.</p><br/><p>At the same time Tian Lei erupted in flames, he turned around. According to logic, if the opponent disappeared in front of oneself, they would most likely appear behind the person. Even until now, Tian Lei was still prepared to only battle with one arm, so as he turned, a fiery dragon was conjured out of his right hand, curling around his body. As soon as he found Zhou Weiqing, this fire dragon could be used to strike a fatal blow to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Tian Lei was pleased, as he felt he had hit his mark right as he turned around.</p><br/><p>The truth was not far off. The Fire Attribute Heavenly Energy that burst out of Tian Lei\u2019s body had hit Zhou Weiqing behind him. When Tian Lei turned around and saw Zhou Weiqing, he could even see the hint of surprise on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Naturally, with a personality like Tian Lei\u2019s, a sense of pride immediately appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s instinct took over, protecting himself by pushing forward with his hands. He looked as if he was waiting to be hit rather than to evade.</p><br/><p>The fire dragon on Tian Lei\u2019s hand immediately flew out and found its mark. Even though it was a competition, considering the relationship of both parties, killing one of the opponents would definitely be the easiest way to dampen their morale.</p><br/><p>The fire dragon hit Zhou Weiqing without any sort of deviation, bursting into a conflagration.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Emperor on the other side closed his eyes. He did not think Zhou Weiqing was so weak that he would not be able to even dodge a reactive attack. Did he not already have a Heavenly King Tier cultivation base?</p><br/><p>However, right after he closed his eyes, he heard the others gasping.</p><br/><p>Both Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands had landed upon Tian Lei\u2019s body, his face still in surprise, while Tian Lei\u2019s body stood frozen. The pride in his eyes turned into disbelief.</p><br/><p>What did Tian Lei see? He saw Zhou Weiqing getting hit by both his attacks, and without donning any Consolidated Equipment, Zhou Weiqing stepped out of the flame, and his palms came into contact with his chest. With flames covering him, Tian Lei could not even react.</p><br/><p>A terrifying suction came from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palms. Tian Lei felt his Heavenly Core Nucleus pulse violently before his Heavenly Energy poured out as if it had leaked.</p><br/><p>In addition, Tian Lei\u2019s body could no longer move, he could not even struggle. At that moment, about ten Fetters of Wind had his body fully bound.</p><br/><p>Even without counting the existence of the Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Energy was on the same level as Tian Lei\u2019s. Having ten abilities stacked on him at a moment\u2019s notice, it would be surprising if Tian Lei could shake it off in such a short time. With time, as his Heavenly Energy spilled out, his struggle would only become weaker and weaker.</p><br/><p>With a \u2018poof\u2019, Zhou Weiqing sank into Tian Lei\u2019s chest. What followed next was Tian Lei\u2019s body shooting out like a cannonball, flying through the air for tens of meters before dropping onto the ground, clearly dead.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stood there stunned as he looked at his own hands. His face showed a mix of disbelief and confusion.</p><br/><p>It was as if he did not know what had happened, how this victory was handed to him.</p><br/><p>This sudden turn of events caught the Blood Red Hell powerhouses by surprise. What they had seen was Zhou Weiqing being attacked by Tian Lei, but the battle was finished in the next moment. No one saw that a Heavenly Core Nucleus was received by Zhou Weiqing enveloped in his Saint Energy Galaxia.</p><br/><p>The four Elders were a little taken aback. With their Heavenly Emperor Tier cultivation base and their attentiveness to the battlefield, it happened so quickly that not even they could say what happened in that split second before the battle ended. From Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression, he was surprised too.</p><br/><p>Two people from the Blood Red Hell went and dragged Tian Lei\u2019s corpse back. His chest had a big hole, his heart was completely shredded to pieces, and his blood was splattered all over his body. There was no sign of life left in him.</p><br/><p>All four of the Blood Red Hell Elders were angry. They knew Tian Lei had been careless from the beginning. Even though they were not sure how Zhou Weiqing had won, if it weren\u2019t for Tian Lei\u2019s carelessness, it would not have turned out this way.</p><br/><p>The Third Elder was the most direct in his expression. He kicked Tian Lei\u2019s body away, saying, \u201cUseless, what do we even need you for!\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Elder scoffed before the Third Elder stopped desecrating the corpse.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing seemed to have realized what had happened. He turned around and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened! Everyone, this is not my fault. Senior Tian Lei was really strong, so I had to give it my all. How was I supposed to know that his defense was so weak? Oh, I understand now, maybe because I was born immune to fire, his fire attack didn\u2019t do much to me. Senior Tian Lei didn\u2019t use any Consolidated Equipment either. I got lucky, so lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Born immune to fire? That was right! Was he not born immune to the Fire Attribute?</p><br/><p>When they were at the Northern border, Zhou Weiqing had battled with one of the Heavenly King Tier powerhouses of the Blood Red Hell. He only got away unscathed because of his Fire Attribute immunity. The people from the Blood Red Hell knew this, but no one remembered a moment ago.</p><br/><p>The First Elder of the Blood Red Hell\u2019s face twitched. Even though losing one Heavenly King was not that big a deal to the Blood Red Hell, a lot of resources had been poured into raising someone of that caliber, and this idiot had lost his life even without activating his Consolidated Equipment. The First Elder was as livid as the Third Elder. If Tian Lei had given it his all from the beginning, given the robustness of his Heavenly Energy, even though Zhou Weiqing was immune to Fire Attribute, he could still be injured.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said embarrassedly, \u201cIn any case, we have won the first round. In the second round, it\u2019s the Blood Red Hell\u2019s turn to send a competitor on the stage first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Elder of the Blood Red Hell frowned. The loss in the first match had been a surprise, adding a lot of variables into this fight, so they could not afford to lose the second round. He turned toward the Second Elder and said, \u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Second Elder nodded. No matter whether it was Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya or Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue, they would not be careless. Among the Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouses, these two had been famous for years, especially Long Shiya. He was named The Mightiest below Heavenly Gods, and his reputation was not without justification. Among the four Elders of the Blood Red Hell, the First and Second Elders had the highest cultivation base. Therefore, if they sent the Second Elder out, even if they could not win against Long Shiya, they would still be able to badly injure him, disabling him from returning to the arena.</p><br/><p>From the First Elder\u2019s standpoint, even if the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and Demonic Emperor won, as long as they were injured, they would still undoubtedly win the next four rounds.</p><br/><p>The First Elder was still very interested in recruiting the two Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouses. If they could successfully recruit them, the strength of the Blood Red Hell would certainly grow again. At that point, what else would they have to worry about facing the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace?</p><br/><p>Seeing the Second Elder walking out, Zhou Weiqing retreated beside Long Shiya and whispered something in his ear. He then walked over to Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue and whispered to him.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone thought Long Shiya would come onto the arena, Zhou Weiqing reentered the arena and said with a smile, \u201cBecause the first match had such a surprising outcome, ending in the loss of one of your people, we have decided that we will forfeit this match as an apology.\u201d</p><br/><p>Forfeit? When everyone in the Blood Red Hell heard the word, they were perplexed. They could no longer understand what his plan was; they could not even tell what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>Were they just running through the motion? Don\u2019t forget, the competition ruled that anyone could reenter the arena for any round, so there was no point in forfeiting a match in favor of another. This forfeit would mean they had given the Blood Red Hell a free win.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head, seemingly unaware, and said, \u201cSenior, shall we go ahead and send our participants for the third match?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Second Elder looked at him with a lost expression and nodded subconsciously.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing explained, \u201cIn this match of seven rounds with ultimate victory of four, the third match is two versus two, the fourth match one versus one, the fifth match two versus two, and we will end with the sixth and seventh match to decide the ultimate victory. In this third match, my teacher and I will be competing in one team. Just like the saying, \u2018father and son, battle as one\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya took a step forward, arriving beside Zhou Weiqing, and said, \u201cWho will be representing your side?\u201d</p><br/><p>All this had happened so quickly that the Blood Red Hell Elders could not even process what had transpired. Had they won the second match? Even though they still had to face Long Shiya in the third match, to them, Zhou Weiqing could not do much damage at all; he was not a threat.</p><br/><p>However, to be safe, the First Elder nodded at the Fourth Elder.</p><br/><p>With two Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouses against Long Shiya and Zhou Weiqing, to the First Elder, even though Long Shiya was stronger than him, he would not come out of this match unscathed. Not to mention, the Second Elder was almost at the peak of Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>The Fourth Elder approached and stood next to the Second Elder. Neither Elder was not looking at Zhou Weiqing, they were focused entirely on Long Shiya. They greeted him with closed fist salutes. \u201cWe have heard so much about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya nodded. He was older and more senior than either of the two, so he said calmly, \u201cNo need for pleasantries. Let us start. If you want me to bow to the Blood Red Hell, you have to show me your strength.\u201d As the saying goes, go hard or go home[1]. Cooperating with Zhou Weiqing, the proud Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor dropped hints about the possibility of admitting defeat. It was only a possibility, of course.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked anxious, he followed his teacher, keeping a half-step behind. Everyone watching could feel that Zhou Weiqing was scared of the two Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya frowned and glared at Zhou Weiqing. \u201cCan you not be so useless? Did I teach you to be like this? I don\u2019t know how I could be so blind as to take you as an apprentice at the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked toadyish. \u201cWasn\u2019t it because of my six Elemental Jewel Attributes, like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing him, the First Elder of the Blood Red Hell felt that this young man was a little naive. He had already exposed his immunity to the Fire Attribute, and he revealed the number of his Elemental Jewel at this point. Even though all the fighters from the Blood Red Hell knew that already, he had revealed his uniqueness so casually even though they were in a match. Was that not naivety?</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing was talking to Long Shiya, he had already activated his Consolidated Equipment. Dark golden lights flashed one after another. Soon after, the nine pieces of his God Tier Ringless Ground Purging Set were equipped on his body, showing his nervousness even more.</p><br/><p>However, the Second and Fourth Elders followed. Zhou Weiqing was nothing to worry about, but Long Shiya was different. His title of Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was too famous, so the two Elders did not dare to get careless. Both of them immediately leaped backward, unleashing their own legendary armor set.</p><br/><p>With their positions in the Blood Red Hell, they had the best Consolidated Equipment. However, a good set of legendary armor was still rare, and both their sets were sets of eight pieces. One of these was not easy to find, but it was still quite a different from Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor\u2019s Hiltless Sky Purging Set.</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing equipped his armor set, he hid behind his teacher immediately.</p><br/><p>When facing two Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouses at the same time, not even Long Shiya could afford to be careless. He unleashed his nine-piece Hiltless Sky Purging Set, as well as activated the Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation.</p><br/><p>Behind Long Shiya, Zhou Weiqing also activated his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. Both of them started glowing with six-colored lights. Even though the fighters from the Blood Red Hell looked down upon Zhou Weiqing, it was undeniable that it was impressive to see the both of them glow in such dazzling way.</p><br/><p>Six Elemental Jewels! This unique talent was only known to exist in Long Shiya and Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>The First Elder of the Blood Red Hell shook his head. He thought, \u2018Zhou Weiqing\u2019s talent is not bad; no wonder he was chosen by the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor. His attitude, however, is lacking. No matter how good his talent is, if he is not strong enough, he won\u2019t amount to much. As long as we win the competition today, or better yet if we can heavily injure Long Shiya, we will surely be able to win.\u2019</p><br/><p>He even started to get lax. After all, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s performance was not memorable.</p><br/><p>The legendary armor sets on the Second and Fourth Elders were blood red. It was the true color the armor sets would show when they finished assembling.</p><br/><p>Their armor sets were identical too. After all, blueprints for legendary armor sets were limited even in Saint Lands.</p><br/><p>Eight piece sets were still not enough to cover their whole bodies, but most of their bodies were already covered. The legendary armor sets on their bodies were similar to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, they were full of spikes, but these spikes were fiery red. They each had a blood red spear in their hands. As they finished donning the armors, they raised the spears, pointing at Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor. The pressure of Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouses burst out of them and focused on Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor.</p><br/><p>A fearsome wave of energy swept through the arena. Compared to the first match with Zhou Weiqing and Tian Lei, this match was evidently more exciting.</p><br/><p>As soon as the pressure of the two Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperors were released, they solidified. Remarkably, the space behind them turned a shade of red and was focused on them.</p><br/><p>Destructive force fused with Darkness Energy was boiling beneath the coverage of flames. Through the spears in their hands, they could even focus their pressure into a beam that they direct wholly onto Long Shiya. Because of that, Zhou Weiqing, who was hiding behind Long Shiya, did not need to endure anything.</p><br/><p>As expected of Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, even when he was facing the pressure of two Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouses, he was still unfazed. In his hands, Octagon Plum Blossom Hammers were crossed in front of him, defending against the two strong enemies\u2019 pressure on his own. Even Long Shiya\u2019s fatty parts were glowing with six-colored light.</p><br/><p>Both sides were patiently waiting for an opportunity to attack. At their level, the pressure was even more dangerous than hacking at the opponents. As soon as the other side had their weakness exposed, the battle would probably be over in a very short time.</p><br/><p>Enduring the pressure of two strong opponents, Long Shiya did not flinch. Conversely, the six-colored light became even stronger, his eyes that were hidden behind layers of fat twinkled brightly, and his body kept shifting around minutely.</p><br/><p>The Second and Fourth Elders were doing the same thing, they kept shifting their angles to try and affect their enemy in an attempt to influence him to show his weak point.</p><br/><p>Regarding Long Shiya\u2019s strength, the First Elder was astonished. He was sure now that he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle Long Shiya\u2019s cultivation base. If it weren\u2019t for this situation of two versus two, it would be nearly impossible to claim victory over him.</p><br/><p>Even though Long Shiya was in the defensive position, he was deflecting two people\u2019s attacks on his own! Zhou Weiqing did not help his teacher at all. However, he was not at a disadvantage at all. To defend was nothing; if he was given a chance, he could turn around and go on offense at any moment.</p><br/><p>The Second and Fourth Elders understood this. It would be nigh impossible to find Long Shiya\u2019s weakness with just pressure alone. Both of them exchanged glances. In the next moment, they shouted at the same time and dashed toward Long Shiya, their bodies turning into blood-colored lightning.</p><br/><p>They were swift. Blood red lights flashed, and they appeared in front of Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya roared, \u201cOpen!\u201d The Octagon Plum Blossom Hammers lashed out at the same time against his two opponents.</p><br/><p>At their level, skills were not a big help. With the thick layer of defensive Heavenly Power, normal skills were not in the least effective. The ones that might be effective were the ones like Heavenly Skill Projection. However, once those skills were cast, the user\u2019s pressure almost definitely would waver, exposing weak points, so it was better to not use them.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, the higher level the battles were, the easier it would get. For example, the one currently happening was like this. This was purely a clash of Energy; there was no flourish to witness among the fighters, it was all a show of strength and Energy consumption.</p><br/><p>After a boom, the two blood-colored lights separated and Long Shiya was suspended in the air. He coughed out blood, which immediately started burning with black flames and disappeared. That was the power of Destruction.</p><br/><p>However, the two Elders were injured too. They were also in the air, coughing out blood. Their condition was not much better than Long Shiya\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Their attack was just a probing attack, but they did not expect Long Shiya to use his full strength as soon as he attacked. When they realized what Long Shiya did, it was too late for them to fully prepare an all-out attack. Their strength added together was definitely more powerful than Long Shiya. However, in this situation, they had not gained the upper hand. On the contrary, both sides seemed to have been injured, though it looked like Long Shiya\u2019s injury was heavier.</p><br/><p>The Second and Fourth Elders did not stop. Their bodies turned around in mid-air and dashed toward Long Shiya a second time. This time, they changed their strategy. They controlled the Blood Spears to pierce through the air, raining light and shadow upon Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya\u2019s Hiltless Sky Purging Set would boost his strength by a lot. If it were only comparing pure strength, Long Shiya could easily compensate for the difference between him and the two powerhouses with his overpowering strength. That was why the Second Elder and the Fourth Elder chose to attack with their skills from the beginning.</p><br/><p>Six-colored light enveloped Long Shiya\u2019s body, and his face was somber. Facing the Second and Fourth Elders\u2019 attack, he made an unexpected choice.</p><br/><p>He turned and charged. Forsaking the direction from which the Second Elder was attacking, he brandished his Octagon Plum Blossom Hammers and dashed at the Fourth Elder. At the same time, the six-colored light around his body expanded sharply, permeating the air and causing all kinds of Attribute Energy to become violent, dulling the blood-colored light of the Fourth Elder.</p><br/><p>Within only one round of exchanges, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had chosen an attack that was either win or lose it all.</p><br/><p>\u2018How could it be?\u2019 The Blood Red Hell\u2019s First Elder stared in disbelief and yelled, \u201cFourth, be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya was really strong. With him putting all his eggs in one basket, Fourth Elder would have a hard time deflecting the attack. However, choosing this would mean he had also abandoned his defense. The Second Elder, who was stronger than the Fourth Elder, was attacking from another angle. When opportunities like this come up, the Second Elder would not give them up!</p><br/><p>This would mean that, in the end, Long Shiya might not be able to kill the Fourth Elder, but he would definitely be mauled in the Second Elder\u2019s attack. Who would choose strategies like this? Long Shiya did. It could be because it was unexpected that he chose to do it.</p><br/><p>The Fourth Elder felt a sudden intimidation and panicked. Long Shiya\u2019s cultivation base was much higher than his own, after all. Moreover, in this all-or-nothing situation, Long Shiya\u2019s strength might even force Heavenly God tier powerhouses to tread lightly.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, the Fourth Elder abandoned his offense. He retrieved his Blood Spear and released all of his Heavenly Energy for defense. All he needed to do was to endure this round of Long Shiya\u2019s attacks. As long as he lived, he could win this fight.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the Second Elder did not rest easy. His own comrade was in trouble, forcing him to use his full power. He charged at the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor with full speed. The faster his action, the less time the Fourth Elder would have to endure the attacks.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Second Elder suddenly found himself facing a smiling face. A silhouette had appeared between him and Long Shiya. It was Zhou Weiqing, who had stayed hidden since the battle started.</p><br/><p>The Second Elder did not react to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s appearance much. To him, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s blocking was to invite death. He could at most be a nuisance for a split second, but not enough to completely stop him from attacking the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing knocked the Dual God Strength Hammer together in front of him. Immediately, a huge, black silhouette appeared in front of him, blocking the Second Elder\u2019s attack. It was Hell\u2019s Angel.</p><br/><p>Hell\u2019s Angel did not pause once it was summoned. When the Second Elder\u2019s Blood Spear pierced into his body, Hell\u2019s Angel immediately self-destructed.</p><br/><p>Because of the loud explosion, the Second Elder\u2019s body inevitably paused for a little while, and at this moment, a pair of massive wings sprouted from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back. His whole body turned upside down in the air as he flung his Dual God Strength Hammer against the Second Elder\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>This created another bang. It was as if a thunderclap had happened in mid-air. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was thrown backward and somersaulted a number of times before he could balance himself.</p><br/><p>The Second Elder was not in good shape either. He had been knocked from the sky forcibly. It seemed like it was no longer possible for him to save the Fourth Elder.</p><br/><p>All of the cover-ups that were done before were leading up to this point. This was also Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first fight against a fully-armored Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouse after he had become stronger.</p><br/><p>Overall, Zhou Weiqing might still be weaker, but his ardent physique and defense nullified the damage he would otherwise have endured. After all, the Second Elder had used his full strength in the attack just now. Even though it was affected by Hell\u2019s Angel, the power it contained was difficult to defend against, even for a Lower Level Heavenly Emperor tier opponent!</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing had successfully intercepted the Second Elder, the clash on the other side finally happened.</p><br/><p>Poof!</p><br/><p>A mist of blood exploded into the air as the Fourth Elder\u2019s body was blasted into smithereens, disappearing into nothingness.</p><br/><p>Rewinding to just a moment before, as the Fourth Elder had been preparing to defend against the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor\u2019s attack, a burgundy silhouette appeared behind him stealthily. Because Long Shiya had taken all of his attention, the Fourth Elder did not notice it.</p><br/><p>The burgundy silhouette turned into a beam of light that enveloped the Fourth Elder. When Long Shiya\u2019s attack arrived in the following moment, the Fourth Elder no longer had even a piece of rag to defend himself with.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya\u2019s attack might not be able to slay a Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouse with maximum defense, but without his Consolidated Equipment and Jewel Stored Skills, with what could the Fourth Elder defend himself?</p><br/><p>Was the burgundy silhouette not Demonic Dragon Lady? Of course, it was not just summoned; before the match started, it was hidden away. In the crucial moment when Zhou Weiqing was intercepting the Second Elder, it was sent to the arena with the Spatial Teleportation Stone.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya\u2019s choice of the seemingly-suicidal attack was set up from the beginning, was it not? Everything that happened was within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouse was killed just like that, and the difference between the power level of both sides was immediately closed.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Dragon Lady did not disappear immediately. As the Fourth Elder\u2019s body was blown into pieces, the Demonic Dragon Lady turned into countless beams of burgundy light, pouring down onto the Blood Red Hell powerhouses. Every single beam carried a Dragon Silencing Seal. So long as a single beam hit, it would be enough to have the person\u2019s Consolidated Armor and Jewel Stored Skills disabled.</p><br/><p>After Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor slaughtered the Fourth Elder, his body glowed brightly with his six-colored light and light arrows shot out toward the Blood Red Hell powerhouses, interspersed between the Dragon Silencing Seal beams.</p><br/><p>What was deceit? Zhou Weiqing showed everyone with his actions. Of course, it wasn\u2019t only the beginning of his deception.</p><br/><p>In the direction which the Second Elder was thrown stood Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue and the six Heavenly Kings of the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p><br/><p>As soon as the Second Elder crashed onto the ground, the Demonic Emperor\u2019s Demonic Change had already been completed. It was a full set of God Tier Consolidated Equipment. The Heavenly Demon Blade, his strongest attack, aimed for the Second Elder.</p><br/><p>What competition? What bet? All the adulations and hints of surrendering had been part of a plan. With so many Blood Red Hell powerhouses, if the enemies decided to swarm them, the only thing Zhou Weiqing could do was to try and flee. However, if a few of them could be removed from the picture, it would be a completely different story.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

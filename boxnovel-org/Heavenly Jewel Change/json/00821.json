As expected of the Wan Shou Empire! Looks like the trump card of the Heavenly Snow Mountain does not lie with their Heavenly Jewel Masters but with the Heavenly Beasts instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er rolled her eyes at him, \u201cWhat? You only just found out? There are no human beings living on the Heavenly Snow Mountain at all. It\u2019s just that some of us are able to cultivate to take the form of a human being and some can\u2019t! According to the rules that our ancestors passed down to us, Heavenly Beasts who are not able to cultivate and take human form are not qualified to claim themselves to be part of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. However, as long as their cultivation base is higher than the Heavenly King Tier, they\u2019ll be allowed to enter the Heavenly Snow Mountain from the Wan Shou Heaven and cultivate under the shelter of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Otherwise, you human poachers would just enter the Wan Shou Heaven and kill them all! It\u2019s only when the Heavenly Snow Mountain is faced with a life-and-death situation that these Heavenly Beasts will finally come out and help us fight. They are the guardians of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Only the progeny of the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain can command them!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the appearance of the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s guardians \u2014 the Heavenly Beasts, the scale that was slightly tilted to one side seemed to gradually return to an equilibrium. There was no need to mention anything else. Just the mere presence of so many Heavenly Emperor-tier Heavenly Beasts was more than enough to pose a great threat to the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley. Even though they had four Heavenly God-tier powerhouses with them, the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation was not something that could be easily defeated. On top of that, there was also the presence of Xue Ao\u2019tian and Long Shiya who were both Heavenly Gods</p><br/><p>Fen Tian looked at Xue Ao\u2019tian as he let out a sigh, \u201cBrother Xue, you know, originally, I really had no intention to cross swords with you. Indeed, be it the Heavenly Snow Mountain or the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, I\u2019m sure all of you have your cards hidden up your sleeves. However, do you really think we would make our appearance here if we do not have absolute faith in our own ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>A black light burst out from Fen Tian\u2019s hand. A gigantic purplish black light instantly condensed into a halo before it spread out above the purplish-black Destructive Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrrrrr\u2014, Grrrrrr \u2014\u201d Two deep ferocious roars reverberated at once from the distant sky. Immediately afterward, two gigantic figures charged into the Destructive Divine Territory while emitting dark red light like two huge meteors and made their way towards the summit of Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>Other than the four Heavenly God-tier powerhouses, there was another trick up the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley\u2019s sleeve? Xue Ao\u2019tian and Shangguan Tianyang looked at each other. Both of them saw the solemness in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The reason why both parties did not take the lead in an attack yet was because there were too many powerhouses gathered on the summit of Heavenly Snow Mountain now. With these many powerhouses, it would be impossible to stop once a battle broke out. Not only that, the situation would become very chaotic and messy as well. Other than Zhou Weiqing and the few other young people, all of the people present here were all old-timers who were laden with experience. They understood clearly that morale was the most important thing in a large-scale chaotic war. If both sides were equal in strength, the side with the higher morale could even achieve the final victory by paying as small a cost as possible. It was because of this reason that they were both currently trying to overwhelm their opponents with their imposing manner.</p><br/><p>Despite all of that, the preparation their enemies had made was far more horrifying than they had first thought. The horror was contained in the two masses of the dark, red light\u2019s energy that was at least at the Heavenly God Tier or higher.</p><br/><p>The two huge meteor-like rays came into view at the Heavenly Snow Mountain in a split second. Instead of landing on the ground, they merely hovered above the summit of Heavenly Snow Mountain. The moment they made their entrance, a commotion immediately broke out among the Heavenly Beasts who were the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s guardians. The originally imposing momentum instantly deflated. Fear could even be seen in every single one of their eyes.</p><br/><p>The two masses of dark red lights started to fully reveal their figures at this moment. When everyone finally had a clear look at their figures, all of them could not help but take in a breath of chilly air. Horror immediately dawned on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The reason why they did not land on the ground was because the size of their bodies was just impossibly huge. It turned out that they were both actually a pair of fiery red gigantic dragons that were more than 100 meters long. However, a layer of black light was currently emitting out of their fiery red body. Their eyes had also turned a ferocious evil-looking purplish black.</p><br/><p>\u201cHui Yao? Duo Si?\u201d Zhou Weiqing could not help but exclaim in surprise.</p><br/><p>Before coming to this Grand Tournament, Zhou Weiqing had tried to summon the two of them but somehow, he did not receive word from them. It had never crossed his mind that they would actually appear on the summit of Heavenly Snow Mountain at this precise time and become their enemy on top of that. It was obvious to him that right now, Hui Yao and Duo Si were not completely conscious of their actions. They had been eaten away by the Destruction Energy and were mere puppets now.</p><br/><p>However, it did not mean that their strength was weakened just because they had become puppets now. On the contrary, after the fusion with the Destruction Energy, these two gigantic dragons seemed to become even more powerful now. Particularly Hui Yao who was easily causing cracks to appear in the Destructive Divine Territory with every slight movement of his. Presently, their appearance had instantly increased the imposing manner of both Blood Red Hell and Love Valley as it suppressed the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, Heavenly Snow Mountain and Peerless Sect\u2019s powerhouses who had all gone pale.</p><br/><p>After all, with the legendary gigantic dragons making their entrance on the battlefield, not to mention that they were the opponents that had to go against the dragons, nobody would possibly be able to smile at the sight of this.</p><br/><p>Worse, it was not only Hui Yao and Duo Si who made their grand entrance. There were hundreds of figures each on their backs. These figures were all clad in black with a black hood. All that one could see was only the eyes that were as eerie as the will-o\u2019-the-wisps. There was no doubt that these people had a cultivation base that was at least at the Heavenly King Tier. Just the sheer number itself had put Zhou Weiqing\u2019s party in a completely disadvantageous situation.</p><br/><p>Even Huang Xingyun could not suppress the sense of pride on his face, \u201cSo? Are you still trying to go against us now? You should understand very well now that your resistance would only end up in vain. My advice still stands. As long as you\u2019re willing to seal off your Saint Land, your lives will be spared!\u201d Having said that, a hint of jealousy could still be seen in the depth of his eyes. This was because the two gigantic dragons were not taking orders from him but only from Fen Tian. In Huang Xingyun\u2019s mind, he who possessed the Time Attribute had far greater potential than Fen Tian but the Lord had chosen to give Fen Tian greater authority instead. He was merely a coordinator.</p><br/><p>After a short moment of astonishment, Zhou Weiqing finally snapped back to his senses. Staring at the two gigantic dragons in the air, he could not help but feel a pang of pain in his heart. It was apparent that Hui Yao and his wife had fallen into the hands of the Blood Red Hell when they went forward to rescue their children. He vowed to free the two of them from this ordeal no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuang Xingyun, Fen Tian, there\u2019s no need to be hasty! All of you have your trump cards so there\u2019s no reason for us Peerless Sect not to have ours, right?\u201d Zhou Weiqing sneered coldly.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun laughed out loud, \u201cWhat an ignorant brat! All you can do is rely on your teacher, Fatty Long. Do enlighten me, what other trump card do you have that can turn the situation around?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smirked and turned his attention towards Ling Dang who was standing not far away from him, \u201cYour Highness, looks like it\u2019s your turn to make the grand entrance now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuang Xingyun, you actually sent somebody to kidnap my daughter! In public or in private, I\u2019ll make you pay today!\u201d A pleasant voice that was filled with a hint of wrath resonated in the air. Ling Dang slowly took off the cloak above her head and revealed a gorgeous, stunning face that could stifle a man\u2019s breath and make women go green with envy.</p><br/><p>A dazzling light gleamed in the Elven Empress\u2019s eyes as she lifted both her hands up. A layer of greenish brilliance rose up to the sky. Immediately afterward, twelve other cloaked men standing behind her took off their cloaks respectively as twelve turquoise rays soared up at the same time to the sky. Then, all thirteen turquoise rays began to merge together and transformed into a staggering light beam that pierced upwards through the sky. A rich, intense breath of life and the Destruction Energy from the Destructive Divine Territory erupted in a unparellel violent collision.</p><br/><p>WHAM \u2014</p><br/><p>The entire world quaked. To everybody\u2019s surprise, a huge hole was smashed open in the tyrannical Destructive Divine Territory. That almost endless spread of green color slowly spread apart and pitted its wits equally against the Destructive Divine Territory in a heartbeat. Under the guidance of the Elven Empress, the Natural Divine Territory that was formed together with the twelve Elven Elders was not the slightest bit inferior compared to the Destructive Divine Territory that was formed by Fen Tian, Huang Xingyun, and four other Heavenly God-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>That was right! This was the Peerless Sect\u2019s trump card. Previously, when Zhou Weiqing was still at the Elven territory, he had already discussed this matter with the Elven Empress. Even supposing the extraordinary relationship between the two of them did not come to exist, the Elven Empress would still make her way here. The reason she came was because of the Lord pulling the strings behind Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian. After all, she was also one of the people involved in sealing the Nether Lord last time. How could she possibly allow the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley to do what they wished without restraint and bring the Nether Lord to the human world?</p><br/><p>A Maximum Level Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. When the Elven Empress unleashed her Natural Divine Territory, everyone on the scene immediately felt her powerful cultivation base. Moreover, there were also four other Heavenly Gods among the twelve Elven Elders who unleashed their power at the same time with her. The remaining eight elders were also at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier.</p><br/><p>What a powerful force this was! Not only that, as it turned out they were on the Peerless Sect\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Other than Blood Red Hell and Love Valley, the person who was most in shock was none other than Shangguan Tianyang. The Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and the Elf Tribe had always maintained a good relationship with each other. They could even be considered as allies to a certain extent. However, Shangguan Tianyang was very clear that he would never be able to invite the Elven Empress out at all. More importantly, he had seen the Elven Empress before in the past. If memory still served him right, the Elf Tribe was far less powerful than they were now. During that time, only the Elven Empress was at the Heavenly God Tier in the entire Elf Tribe. Even then, she was definitely not at the Maximum Level.</p><br/><p>One could say that the appearance of the thirteen powerhouses from the Elf Tribe had once again turned the situation around. The momentum that was suppressed by the emergence of the two gigantic dragons had reversed entirely. Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun no longer had the upper hand.</p><br/><p>Standing side by side with the Elven Empress, Zhou Weiqing smiled, \u201cYour Highness, I\u2019ll leave the two dragons in the air to you. They\u2019re both my friends, and they\u2019re merely under the control of the Destruction Attribute now. Please don\u2019t hurt them. Once we\u2019ve dealt with the problems here, I think I might have a way to help them regain their senses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Dragon Tribe is a friend of the Elven Tribe, too,\u201d the Elven Empress nodded her head lightly. The look that she gave Zhou Weiqing was so gentle that most men would turn green with envy if they saw it. At the same time, the rest of the Lords of the Saint Lands could not help but be taken aback as they thought to themselves, \u2018What exactly is the relationship between Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Empress? He actually has a way to make her obey his orders?\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The five meter tall Zhou Weiqing suddenly opened his eyes. When he opened his eyes, his entire being seemed to have come to life. He no longer looked like a body of energy but instead, was an enlarged version of Zhou Weiqing. It was as if his own body had gone through puberty once again. Even his gaze was similar to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s. There was no difference at all.</p><br/><p>All of the witnesses present were cultivators throughout an entire generation. However, at this moment, they were all completely stupefied from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s actions. They were even a little numb. They simply could not figure out how Zhou Weiqing had done it. However, they vaguely sensed that everything Zhou Weiqing had done was to amplify himself so that he could become more powerful.</p><br/><p>The Six Ultimate Heavenly God, Long Shiya clearly noticed that after Zhou Weiqing had grown to five meters tall and was now one with the Astral Divine Territory in the sky. The most fearsome thing was that the aura he emitted could no longer be described as one from a cultivator at the Heavenly Emperor-tier but instead, one that was from someone on the Heavenly God-tier.</p><br/><p>It was similar to what had happened long ago when Zhou Weiqing used the Demonic Change to upgrade himself except now he was using the Astral Divine Territory to temporarily boost his cultivation base to the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>During this kind of transformation, one had to manifest the Astral Divine Territory. The golden light that bound the Jade Dragon grew significantly stronger and gave off a white-gold luster. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s five-meter tall body had also transformed from a lighter shade of gold to a whitish-golden color. Obviously, this white-gold color is the color of the Saint Energy that he would receive once he reached the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath, the blueprint before him vanished as it rolled up and entered his body. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing went all out with his Divine Thought and had branded all of the contents of the blueprint in his mind. This did not mean that he understood the secrets behind the blueprint. However, he had completely memorized it and would never forget them.</p><br/><p>Based on his current age and his understanding of Consolidated Equipment Masters, it was impossible for him to completely comprehend it. At the very least, it was not possible for him to do it in such a short time. However, this would not affect his crafting process, especially under circumstances similar to this moment where he possessed such a high amount of power.</p><br/><p>One had to at least have a Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivation base in order to craft the eleventh piece of the legendary armor set. The higher one\u2019s cultivation base was, the easier the crafting process would be. Moreover, Zhou Weiqing could also use Time Reversal as a safeguard to speak to the Consolidating Equipment Master about techniques that were against the heavenly stages.</p><br/><p>Drawing Saint Energy Ink, and consolidating it in the void. The words shone in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart like a lighted pathway. At this moment, he had completely entered another kind of state.</p><br/><p>If one were to say that Duan Tianlang was like a lofty mountain on the ground when he was crafting Consolidating Ink, then at this moment , Zhou Weiqing was like a cloud in the sky. Pure and imaginary yet unsurpassed, a cloud above everything else. The fearsome energy fluctuated in the air. Currently, no one was able to sense Zhou Weiqing\u2019s presence. If they closed their eyes, they would only be able to sense that there was no energy, attributes or elements present. There was only the Jade Dragon, who was like a third wheel, and Zhou Weiqing who looked like he was detached from his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u2018Junior Master, don\u2019t you worry. I won\u2019t let you down.\u2019 Zhou Weiqing said in his heart. He slowly opened his mouth and took a deep breath. Instantly, countless starlight scattered throughout the sky. At that moment, the surroundings seemed to have transformed into a resplendent galaxia. It was as if the galaxia had fallen down to earth from high above. The density of the blurry radiance and the fluctuations of the Saint Energy had also reached its highest point. It caused all the present cultivators to turn pale from the shock as they flew backwards in panic. It did not matter that they were at the Heavenly King Tier or the Heavenly Emperor Tier.</p><br/><p>Those who had received Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy were a little better off. They did not feel it too much. However, those who had never been baptized by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy seemed to feel a force that repelled them and it made them feel like they wanted to run away and distance themselves immediately. Otherwise, it felt like they would be torn apart by this terrifying energy.</p><br/><p>It was Saint Energy, and also a form of Galaxia Sedimentation, one of the most powerful abilities that Zhou Weiqing could currently use. It was one of the Astral Divine Territory\u2019s powerful abilities, and it was a display of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s comprehension of it.</p><br/><p>Since the dawn of the existence of Heavenly Jewel Masters until this day, Zhou Weiqing was the first to comprehend the Astral Divine Territory. That was why he did not have anyone to learn from or refer to. Everything he knew now, he had to learn from his own mistakes when cultivating as he slowly experienced all the subtleties of Astral Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>The higher his cultivation base was, the more he could sense the near infiniteness of Astral Divine Territory, especially the Creation Energy it contained. This pushed Zhou Weiqing in his cultivation even further. It was the best driving force behind his cultivation. At this moment, he was using this feeling to expand the Astral Divine Territory\u2019s Galaxia Sedimentation. From there, he raised the might of Astral Divine Territory and his Saint Energy to their highest potential.</p><br/><p>A large vortex of stars came spiraling from below. It was obviously impossible for this to be an actual nebula. It was completely condensed through Saint Energy, drawn by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s powers. Even so, this horrifying nebula began spiraling the minute it arrived. The density of Saint Energy filled Heavenly Bow City with a kind of incomparably suffocating Saint Energy aura.</p><br/><p>When a Heavenly Jewel Master was faced with such a terrifying amount of Saint Energy, all they could do was to stop resisting, bow out sincerely and acknowledge their allegiance to Saint Energy. Only then would he be able to wholly avoid elimination from the Saint Energy. The higher the Heavenly Jewel Master\u2019s cultivation base was, the more they would be affected. In contrast, the average citizen would receive quite a number of benefits from this dense Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Normal citizens would only feel the air grow denser as they breathed, and with every breath they took, their bodies would feel more relaxed. This feeling was difficult to describe. However, in just a short amount of time, they would feel mentally refreshed and their entire being would look as if they had become a few years younger.</p><br/><p>The best benefit was reserved for the unborn children in the belly of every pregnant woman in Heavenly Bow City. This was because they had congenital Qi and therefore were able to accept Saint Energy, which was the ultimate source of energy in the simplest way possible. Saint Energy was absorbed by their mothers before it was slowly integrated into their bodies. One could say that all these unborn children, regardless of their original gifts and natural endowments, had the possibility of becoming Heavenly Jewel Masters in the future, thanks to having absorbed the dense Saint Energy. This is a conversation for another day in the future. Presently, even Zhou Weiqing himself had never thought that the consolidation in the void would also bring great benefits to Heavenly Bow Empire and establish a prosperous foundation in the future for Heavenly Bow Empire in the Boundless Mainland.</p><br/><p>After the terrifying Saint Energy fluctuations appeared, the Jade Dragon cowered meekly. Although it possessed all attributes and had reached the Heavenly God Tier, it did not have a biological body because it was created from a large amount of energy. It only had basic instincts, that was why it could not possibly use a Divine Territory, like the Six Ultimate Heavenly God, to go up against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory. With its instincts, the restrictions on in the Astral Divine Territory on it would be even greater. Coupled with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s tyrannical power, it would be unable to fight back and would be like a lamb waiting to be butchered.</p><br/><p>Following the Galaxia Sedimentation that was placed in the middle of the violent circle of turbulent Nebula Saint Energy, it was further restrained from fighting back. In the face of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Nebula Saint Energy, its enormous body slowly came together as it was slowly suppressed.</p><br/><p>The jade green light grew stronger and stronger. However, its body grew smaller and smaller. Soon, it slowly shrank from over a hundred meters in length to merely eighty over meters in length.</p><br/><p>The five-meter-tall body Zhou Weiqing remained suspended in air. At this moment, he was the core of the heavens and earth, the center point of this spiraling nebula. Everything in sight was within his grasp.</p><br/><p>From embodying a body of energy to the Galaxia Sedimentation, Zhou Weiqing had worked for about half a day. If this was on a battlefield, no enemy would ever grant him the luxury of that much time to consolidate such amounts of energy. However, at this moment, Zhou Weiqing who had completed Galaxia Sedimentation could render any Heavenly God-tier powerhouse\u2019s Divine Territory useless when they were within the territory of Galaxia Sedimentation. Essentially, even if he faced a renowned Heavenly God-tier powerhouse, he may actually stand a chance at winning. This was his domain, his Divine Territory. If Long Shiya or the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain, Xue Ao\u2019tian were to carry out an evaluation, they would not go overboard if they called this the number one Divine Territory in the world.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing slowly raised his right hand before he beckoned towards the Jade Dragon\u2019s direction. At the same time, the orbiting Nebula Saint Energy around him dispersed immediately, creating a space that was about a hundred meters in diameter in width.</p><br/><p>The empty space was pitch black. It was pure, clean, shade of black. There was no trace of energy and it wasn\u2019t a spatial tear. It was so pure that one could not see any flaws.</p><br/><p>A ray of jade green colored light was drawn out from the Jade Dragon\u2019s body after it began trembling. It instantly entered the pure black space that was nearly a hundred meters in width.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand movements grew quicker, and the jade green light subsequently began moving in the middle of the black space. It left ray after ray of jade green cracks. The most bizarre thing of all was that the other side of the jade green light that was constantly connected to the Jade Dragon\u2019s body had stayed intact.</p><br/><p>Lure the dragon into the scroll. That\u2019s right, lure the dragon into the scroll. It was just as Duan Tianlang had previously mentioned.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes took in all of the radiance. He did not stop waving his right hand. Draw the ink from the void and lure the dragon into the scroll. This was the way to craft the final legendary armor set. The bizarre sight made everyone watch with absolute focus. It was likely that such a marvel would be a rare sight even in a hundred years! However, it had now appeared in the sky of Heavenly Bow City. To the average citizens, this was a feat, and to the Heavenly Jewel Masters, this was a miracle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

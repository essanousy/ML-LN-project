No matter what, he is still currently your fiance!\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s voice was rather cold.</p><br/><p>Alas, when Difuya heard the word fiance, she felt a rush of worry in her heart, totally missing the expression on Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s face. After all, this was right in front of Ming Hua! The Prince Charming in her mind\u2019s only younger sister! How could Difuya not be worried about Shangguan Bing\u2019er mentioning the fact about their betrothal in front of Ming Hua.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er Little Sis, you can\u2019t speak nonsense like that\u2026 who is his fiancee? That\u2019s just a political betrothal arranged by my father. This time I left home, I never planned on returning. I do not want that betrothal, even if I must marry a pig or a dog, I would not marry him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s face turned frosty. \u201cDifuya, you\u2019re too much! What\u2019s wrong with Little Fatty, that you must treat him like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him\u2026?\u201d Difuya started a little. For her to actually state out what was wrong with Zhou Weiqing, she was also at a loss momentarily. At that point, she could only say stubbornly: \u201cNo matter what, I already have someone else I like. Do not mention that Zhou Weiqing, as useless as he is, even if he were a top genius in the world, I would still not like him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Hua said impatiently: \u201cEnough. You can stop trying to proclaim your love and loyalty in front of me. It\u2019s useless. I know my brother best, and once he has decided on something, he will never change his mind. In any case, I know why he doesn\u2019t want you\u2026 you are indeed a fool. In front of someone\u2019s girlfriend, you keep insulting him, I really do not know how to describe a fool like you. Also, there is one thing that you got correct. Indeed, I have never seen a greater talent and genius than that little brat Zhou Weiqing, not even my brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Ming Hua took her papers and left. She had no mood to talk to a foolish girl like Difuya.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ming Hua\u2019s words, Difuya went into shock. Seeing Shangguan Bing\u2019er with a cold look on her face, she said inconceivably: \u201cBing\u2019er, you\u2026 You actually became his girlfriend? Is that for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing'er said solemnly: \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be for real? I have been together with Little Fatty for two years. Difuya, you may not like him, but it doesn\u2019t mean everyone does not like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Little Fatty, who is useless in your eyes, is an exceptional man in my eyes. I will not speak with you further on this, I am heading to the canteen to wait for him.\u201d As she said that, she headed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d Difuya said as if in sudden comprehension. \u201cIt must be because of Admiral Zhou, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing'er stopped in her tracks, turning back towards Difuya and saying in an icy cold voice: \u201cYour Highness, please do not insult me, and do not insult yourself. From today onwards, we are no longer friends. Also, I hope that you remember every word you said today. I will never let you have Little Fatty\u2026\u201d Though at first she felt ashamed and guilty towards this official fiancee of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, now Shangguan Bing'er did not feel that anymore. In fact, she even felt that it wasn\u2019t even important to try to dissolve the engagement anymore, as she knew Zhou Weiqing would never like a person like that.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing did not know what had happened in the classroom, as he was currently walking together with Dean Xiao. As they walked, he said sincerely: \u201cDean Xiao, thank you so much for everything you did yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi smiled faintly, saying: \u201cYou little brat, you are rather well informed! Well, you do not need to thank me, that was all your own capabilities. If you weren\u2019t outstanding, I wouldn\u2019t even have noticed you, let alone protect you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was rather surprised at Xiao Shi\u2019s directness. He found that he was growing to like this Dean of Students even more.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing continued asking: \u201cDean Xiao, why did you look for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi laughed and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not me who is looking for you. It is our Principal who wants to meet such an outstanding and talented young genius like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the words genius, Zhou Weiqing thought about the test they had just taken and how he had not known anything. In a rare sight, he flushed red in embarrassment, saying: \u201cI am far from being any genius, I will have to depend on Dean Xiao in the future to take care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi said: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t considered a genius, then there aren\u2019t any genius in the world. According to your registration records, you still haven\u2019t reached the age of seventeen, and you are already a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master. Not only are you the first Consolidating Equipment Master in our school, you are also the youngest Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master I have ever heard of. Even those who inherit the heritage of famed Consolidating Equipment Masters, they are still mostly Low Level Consolidating Equipment Masters at such an age. We have indeed high hopes for your talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they spoke, Xiao Shi led the way up the stairs. The principal\u2019s office was at the fifth level of the main building, which was also the highest level.</p><br/><p><i>Hmm\u2026 Principal?</i> Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mind was instantly filled with images of that distinguished and elegant beauty he had seen the other day. She had definitely left an impression on him.</p><br/><p>Very soon, they had reached the fifth level, which was obviously a lot quieter than the rest of the academy. This was the level where all the high ranking members of the academy had their offices.</p><br/><p>Leading Zhou Weiqing to the deepest parts of the level, Xiao Shi finally stopped at a door with a sign portraying the Principal\u2019s Office. With a respectful expression on his face, Xiao Shi knocked softly twice on the door.</p><br/><p>A calm, elegant voice came from within. \u201cPlease enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Xiao Shi push open the door and enter together with Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>The office was rather large, almost three hundred square metres, and was entirely adorned in a pale yellow look, giving a peaceful yet refined feel. All the furnishing in the room was meticulously designed and well thought out, and right behind a large semi-circular table sat the beautiful lady Principal, Cai Cai.</p><br/><p>Just like yesterday, she was dressed in her unique black teacher robes, her long hair bundled up to her head. She had a small, pleasant smile on her face, and her expression was peaceful and calm, without an imposing aura like one might expect from someone of her position.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincipal, I\u2019ve brought Zhou Weiqing before you.\u201d Xiao Shi said to her with a slight bow.</p><br/><p>Cai Cai smiled and inclined her head in greeting: \u201cThank you Dean Xiao, I have troubled you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi smiled in return and said: \u201cIt was no trouble at all, Principal. I shall take my leave now, you can have a good talk with him.\u201d He bowed once again before leaving the room. Before he did so, he gave Zhou Weiqing an encouraging look.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Shi left, he closed the door behind him, and there was only the two of them left in the office. When Zhou Weiqing had seen Cai Cai from afar previously, he had been awestruck by her beauty. Now, to see her at such a close range, he almost felt a little uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>This Principal Cai Cai gave him somewhat of a feeling like a goddess who shouldn\u2019t be sullied, giving forth a natural, untouchable aura. That invisible stress seemed to have a presence in the room itself, and her noble grace seemed inbred into her very bones, making others feel a strange sense of inferiority despite the lack of arrogance.</p><br/><p>According to Kou Rui\u2019s information, this beautiful lady principal was already thirty-five years old. However, just from outward appearance, she looked barely twenty years old. Yet, her aura and presence seemed to be that of a person in power of fifty to sixty years of age. Such a unique combination of presence was more than sufficient to draw the eye of anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cStudent Zhou Weiqing right, please have a seat.\u201d Cai cai pointed to the high backed chair in front of her desk.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not hesitate, pulling back the chair and sitting down in it, not really caring about any noble etiquettes. After all, he was a commoner student in the academy\u2026 Furthermore, to compare noble etiquettes with this lady, that would be something useless to do.</p><br/><p><i>In front of a beautiful lady, in order to draw attention to yourself, you must either be stronger than her, otherwise the other route is to just be something extremely unique and different. </i>This was Mu En\u2019s teachings to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Principal Cai Cai.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Cai Cai started a little, even the teachers of the academy did not usually call her by her full name. Furthermore\u2026 This youth, Zhou Weiqing, was a lot more mature and stable than she had expected.</p><br/><p>Naturally, what Zhou Weiqing had done at the opening ceremony yesterday was not hidden from her. In fact, every detail of the entire incident was reported to her. In this academy, she held the ultimate authority.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, do you know why I asked Dean Xiao to call you here?\u201d She asked passively.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: \u201cNo, I do not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cai Cai said: \u201cI saw your entrance exam, and I heard that General Ming Yu right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: \u201cYes, the examiner teacher then did not like my answer, and General Ming Yu passed by and saw it, and he thought it was still okay, and gave me a pretty good score.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay? In my view, your answer deserved a zero.\u201d Cai Cai\u2019s voice suddenly turned cold, so much so that Zhou Weiqing felt as if the entire temperature in the room dropped a few degrees.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing started a little. It seems this Principal wasn\u2019t too friendly towards him.</p><br/><p>Cai Cai said solemnly: \u201cIn your answer, I saw an unbelievable amount of bloodshed and death, and the suffering of countless citizens. Perhaps, your tactics might be successful, bringing victory. But at what cost? How many will die with you commanding? Every life only has one chance to live here, and no one should have the right to strip them of this right. When someone dies, it also brings suffering to their families. Perhaps you might think it\u2019s a petty kindness, but what I want to tell you is that a commander who does not care about the lives of citizens will never be a true leader, and his army will never be a champion army.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

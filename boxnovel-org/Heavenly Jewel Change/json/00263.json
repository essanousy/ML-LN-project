It could be said that if Zhou Weiqing could really become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, it would hold an extraordinary meaning to Duan Tianlang.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing nodded, describing the process on how he had become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Duan Tianlang\u2019s temper had always been gentle and peaceable, but when he heard the entire process on how Zhou Weiqing had actually become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, he couldn\u2019t help but curse rudely: \u201cYour sister! This is just not fair at all! Do you know how much effort I poured into becoming a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in the past? This is truly a case of comparisons being truly odious Ahhhh! Fatty Long, my greatest regret now is that I did not snatch Weiqing over from your hands. At that time, I only thought that he had the six Attributes, such a rare opportunity, and I also had other disciples\u2026 so I let you have him. So\u2026 Weiqing\u2019s talents in the Consolidating Equipment Scroll world is no less than his talents in cultivation!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">At this point, Long Shiya was already grinning so widely that his eyes could barely be seen.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Right at this moment, noisy footsteps could be heard outside.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWeiqing.\u201d The person had not reached, but the voice had already traveled in. Soon after, a white figure dashed into the tent, ignoring everyone else as it flew right into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arms. Wasn\u2019t it Tian\u2019er?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A year had already passed, but time did not seem to have left any signs on Tian\u2019er. Instead, she looked even more attractive than ever. Currently, her face was filled with tears, streaming down like rain, causing everyone to feel for her.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing had left for an entire year! How could she not miss him? Holding him tight around his waist, it was as if she was afraid he would disappear again.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Behind Tian\u2019er, Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er also walked in. Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s face wore her usual chilly expression, but Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s lips were pursed slightly as she watched Tian\u2019er embracing Zhou Weiqing, clearly a little jealous.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Behind them, Mu En, Hua Feng, Ming Yu and the other Heavenly Bow Empire upper echelon had also come. With Zhou Weiqing back at last, they naturally put everything down immediately and rushed over.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Instantly, Duan Lingtian\u2019s tent was filled with people.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Under the gazes of so many people, Tian\u2019er finally released Zhou Weiqing, her cheeks stained red in a blush. However, Zhou Weiqing did not let her go, lowering his head to whisper something in her ears.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Tian\u2019er\u2019s beautiful face turned even redder, but she finally nodded at him, causing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face to be instantly filled with excitement and joy.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Shangguan Fei\u2019er walked over, pull Zhou Weiqing back and enveloping Tian\u2019er in her own embrace. \u201cBad fellow, you better watch out. Tian\u2019er is under our protection, you\u2019re not allowed to hug her.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">What Zhou Weiqing had just asked was whether or not the pregnancy of Tian\u2019er was verified.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After gaining her confirmation, knowing that he would be a father, how could he not be excited?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ming Yu glared savagely at Zhou Weiqing, saying exasperatedly: \u201cYou still know to come back!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily as he walked forward, giving him a huge hug.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ming Yu instantly gave a helpless look, pounding Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back with a fist. At last, he couldn\u2019t help but smile as well. No matter what, it was great that he was finally back. He was the spiritual pillar and leader of the entire Heavenly Bow Empire! All of the Heavenly Bow Empire upper echelons were pretty much drawn in by him and were following him. If he continued with his disappearing act, although Ming Yu could still command the army without problems, there were still many other things he could not control. After all, he did not have the rightful name to lead the entire Heavenly Bow Empire!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After hugging Ming Yu, Zhou Weiqing turned to the Shangguan Sisters and gave them each a big hug as well. He then proceeded to give everyone in the tent a bear hug as well, without exception.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When he finally walked to the last person who was hiding in a corner, he couldn\u2019t help but be stunned for a second. Still, he spread his arms out wide similarly. \u201cBig Sis RuSe, it has been tough on you.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">That person was indeed Xiao RuSe. However, her current complexion wasn\u2019t too good, pale and ashen, though she still walked forward into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s embrace.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing could vaguely hear her mumble softly: \u201cI\u2019m born before you were born, when you were born, I am already old.\u201d</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u00a0[1] These simple words, but they caused Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart to tremble violently. Although he knew he could no longer afford to enter yet another relation, to incur another debt of love\u2026 he could not help but feel great pain in his heart. All the memories of him growing up with Xiao RuSe flashed in his mind.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The entire process was over very quickly, but Zhou Weiqing felt his originally excited feelings had grown heavy. As he hugged Xiao RuSe, he somehow said in a low tone: \u201cTime is not a problem, age is never a barrier.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Xiao RuSe\u2019s eyes lit up instantly, but they quickly dimmed again as she broke free of his embrace and stepped to the side.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Indeed, Xiao RuSe was quite a few years older than Zhou Weiqing. Currently, she had just stepped into her thirties, but Zhou Weiqing was barely in his young twenties. The years of fierce battles and a hard life had left its mark on her, and she was no longer that same level of beauty like the Shangguan Sisters or Tian\u2019er. It was no wonder she did not feel worthy at all.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">There were just so many people in the crowded tent that Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t chase after her. In the end, he turned around and face the crowd, giving a deep \u2018ninety-degree\u2019 bow. \u201cAll of you, you have worked hard. Weiqing thanks you sincerely.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was a simple line, a few words, but many of those present had their eyes redden.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ming Yu\u2019s feelings ran the deepest, and he sighed inwardly as he thought.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The mark of a true leader! This fellow truly had all the markings to make a great Emperor!</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u00a0Although he thought highly of his own talents, in the end he could only be a great General or Commander. In that area, Zhou Weiqing was perhaps not his match, but that personality and charisma\u2026 it was something that he did not possess. This was the reason why he was able to gain the support of so many different people.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">From the time the Heavenly Bow Empire had been vanquished, to their current development today\u2026 it might seem like Zhou Weiqing had not really done much in terms of actual deeds. However, all that he had done was the most critical areas. He was the true soul of the current Heavenly Bow Empire!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ming Yu gave a polite cough and said: \u201cLet us relocate somewhere else to speak, lest we disturb Master Duan.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Duan Tianlang laughed heartily and said: \u201cI don\u2019t mind this minor disturbance, it\u2019s just that my place is so small, so Weiqing won\u2019t be able to be close to you all. Haha.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Everyone couldn\u2019t help but join in the laughter.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">As they left Duan Tianlang\u2019s tent, the entire party headed towards the main headquarter tentage of the army. Ming Yu invited Zhou Weiqing to sit at the main seat, but he refused obstinately, wanting Ming Yu to sit there instead. In the end, they left it empty, instead having two chairs brought below it for them. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a round of small talk, they finally began to speak of the important matters. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing did not wish to speak of all of his experiences, so he just gave a brief summary before leading the discussion to the current situation of the Heavenly Bow Empire.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Ming Yu\u2019s accounting was far more detailed than Kou Rui, including much of his own analysis and opinions. According to Ming Yu, the Heavenly Bow Empire looked to be in a great situation, but in truth they were in grave danger. Of course, their backs were secure, but the problem was with just their army of over hundred thousand men, if they had to face against the full might of the one behind the Kalise Empire, the Bai Da Empire\u2026 could they really withstand it? Towards this point, even Ming Yu did not have full confidence. All he could guarantee was to do everything to the best possibilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Currently, the matter of greatest importance was the upcoming war that could break out at anytime. The invasion of the Heavenly Bow City was absolutely critical, especially since they needed to save the Royal Family of the Heavenly Bow Empire, as well as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s own family. However, this also posed the greatest problem to them now. A forceful siege was not possible. Even if they ignored the fact that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s family was there, none of the Heavenly Bow Empire warriors would be willing to risk the destruction of the Royal Family to enter the Heavenly Bow Empire. If they gave the order to attack just like that, the morale of the soldiers would definitely be greatly affected.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201c... Weiqing, you need to make a final decision as soon as possible.\u201d After describing their current situation, Ming Yu prompted him.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing nodded, asking: \u201cWhat is the exact enemy military might in the Heavenly Bow City and the surroundings?\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Hearing that question, Ming Yu\u2019s expression turned ugly. \u201cThose bastards from the Kalise Empire and Bai Da Empire, they are utilizing the strategy of fortifying the city and clearing the surroundings. Since the Heavenly Bow City isn\u2019t particularly large, they are unable to station too many troops in the city itself. As such, they are mainly using the Heavenly Bow City as a central base of operations, heavily fortifying it while they constantly clear out the Star Forest around it. Already, a large number of Star Trees have been chopped down and transported away. Currently, their military force consists of around fifteen Regiments, but their actual combat might is definitely no match for us directly. Out of the fifteen Regiments, ten or so will belong to the Kalise, a force they have built up over all these years. As for the rest, they should be from the Bai Da Empire. Currently, from the state of things, they do not show any signs of sending more reinforcements. It is clear that their main purpose is to hold us down here, to delay us until the Dan Dun Empire and Bai Da Empire have completed their moves in their region, and can take the time to finish us off.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes narrowed, but he did not speak out directly. Those closest to him, especially the ladies, could easily tell from the look in his eyes that their Little Fatty was truly enraged.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">To Zhou Weiqing, having his homeland invaded and conquered was already a great insult. Now, these invaders were destroying his homeland, destroying the Star Forest, and using the lives of his family to threaten and prevent him from counter attacking them. One could just imagine the sheer rage in his heart now.</span></p><br/><p><span class=\"footnote\" id=\"footnote_1\">[1] This is a reversal of a very famous Tang Dynasty poem which is oft quoted</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

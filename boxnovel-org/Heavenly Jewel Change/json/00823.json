Zhou Weiqing soared up to the sky with the hammer in his left hand pointed to the sky as the wings on his back flapped violently.</p><br/><p>The sky was the true battlefield for the Heavenly God-tier powerhouses. After all, with the constant clashes between the Heavenly God-tier powerhouses on the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s peak, it would not take long before the impact of the clashes completely annihilated the Heavenly God and Heavenly King-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing was still cultivating in the Mid-Levels of the Heavenly Emperor Tier, he had managed to forcefully resist the Elven Queen. Now that he was at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier, why would he be afraid of Fen Tian? The Creation and Destruction Energies restricted one another. However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pure Saint Energy was a result of his own cultivation. On the other hand, Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Energy originated from an external source. It was impossible to compete against the purity of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>The entire battlefield was divided into five areas following the two individuals\u2019 ascension to the sky. The battles in the sky were divided between the Elf Tribe who was fighting against the two gigantic dragons, Long Shiya who was clashing with Shen Mo, and the leaders, Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian who were battling each other.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the pair of husband and wife from Love Valley who was at the Upper Levels of the Heavenly God Tier \u2014 Huang Xingyun, and Yun Ruoyun \u2014 were battling the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation that belonged to Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace on the ground. At the same time, Xue Ao\u2019tian led the powerhouses from the Heavenly Snow Mountain and Peerless sect to confront the siege by hundreds of powerhouses from Love Valley and Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>If one was to compare their actual strength, the Elf Tribe that was battling in the sky had the upper hand. However, the Dragon Tribe\u2019s combat capability was much stronger than the Elf Tribe even though they were on the same level. Moreover, the Elf Tribe had a standing order that the Elven Queen received from Zhou Weiqing to not cause harm. There was no way to determine the victor and the loser in a short time since they were at a stalemate.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya and Shen Mo were also evenly matched. There was no way to determine the victor and the loser in such a short amount of time as well. Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian\u2019s battle played the most crucial role in the grand scheme of things. However, victory and defeat was not something that could be determined quickly.</p><br/><p>It could be said that all three battles in the sky required a prolonged period of time to determine victory and defeat.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on the ground.</p><br/><p>Even though the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation was brutal and tyrannical, Huang Xingyun and his wife had been working together their entire lives.They were both at the Upper Level of the Heavenly God Tier, and with their combined effort, they were able to completely subdue the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s powerhouses even if they failed at breaking the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation.</p><br/><p>It could be said that all four battles had reached a stalemate. The only certainty was it was a battle with the largest number of people. The battle with the largest number of people was the only battle that was showing the most apparent/obvious standards.</p><br/><p>Even though Xue Ao\u2019tian personally took command of the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s side, the enemies\u2019 numerical strength almost exceeded theirs by four times. Moreover, all of them possessed the Destruction Attribute. The moment the enemies approached, they were completely subdued and placed in a disadvantageous position. They could only take the defensive position in face of the enemies from the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley.</p><br/><p>After all, there were more than seventy powerhouses at the Heavenly Emperor Tier and above on the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley\u2019s corner. Meanwhile, there were only over three hundred remaining powerhouses at the Heavenly King Tier on their corner. They were capable of setting up an extremely powerful Destructive Divine Territory just by joining hands and relying on Destruction Attribute. The Heavenly Snow Mountain lost six to seven Heavenly Beasts with just one blow from them.</p><br/><p>The combat strength of the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s corner was now less than a hundred, and this included the Heavenly Beast Guardians. The Peerless Sect was even more pathetic. They were made up of a total of less than a dozen people.</p><br/><p>The situation on the battlefield was already very apparent. As long as the people from Heavenly Snow Mountain and Peerless Sect were eliminated first, the powerhouses from Love Valley and Blood Red Hell would be able to aid Huang Xingyun and his wife. At that time, they would be invincible when facing the resistance from Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation that belonged to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Once the battles on the ground ended, how could the battles in the sky still pose a problem? The only thing that might possibly be problematic was the Elf Tribe. However, as long as their assault force could merge together, surely the Elf Tribe would not be able to resist?</p><br/><p>Even though Zhou Weiqing had invited so many powerhouses from the Elf Tribe, Blood Red Hell and Love Valley still had the upper hand when the situation was viewed as a whole.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not expect this situation earlier.The crux of the problem laid with the Elf Tribe. The Elf Tribe\u2019s kindness and their aversion to killing stopped them from giving free reign to their actual strength. Moreover, the appearance of the pair of enormous husband and wife dragons, Hui Yao and Duo Si, was also out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expectation. The situation on the battlefield became complicated because of this.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian continuously waved the God Spirit Staff in his hand. He was relying on the Heavenly Spirit Divine Territory to resist the opponent\u2019s Destructive Divine Territory. Even though he was a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse, he was afraid that his army would be annihilated quickly if he yielded to the Destruction Energy.</p><br/><p>As the former number one powerhouse in the world, Xue Ao\u2019tian never felt as oppressed as he did now. However, there was nothing he could do. He managed to withstand it for a little longer due to Tian\u2019er\u2019s reinforcement and assistance from her God Spirit Staff that released Saint Energy. Otherwise, just Xue Ao\u2019tian alone would not be enough to forcefully resist the Destruction Energy that was unleashed by the 400 powerhouses on the enemy\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Even though the Tiger King Xue Ao\u2019ying and the Lion King Gu Site were riding on their Heavenly Beast Guardians to offer support, the Blood Red Hell\u2019s powerhouses had evidently trained together for a very long time, making their teamwork really good. There was no chance at all for them to battle these people one on one. With their combined attacks, the Blood Red Hell somehow managed to force them into a steady retreat.</p><br/><p>Among the Heavenly Snow Mountain and Peerless Sect, it was the dozen members of the Peerless Sect that racked up the most kills. The most apparent one was Shangguan Xue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er was attired in a Boundless Infinitum Set and her body was just like an unsheathed sharp blade.</p><br/><p>The crystal clear armor that was on her body was like a layer of rubber, and the mist that circulated inside the armor was never in a completely solid state. The only thing that remained unchanged was the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum sword in Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The power of the eleven piece Boundless Infinitum Set would be displayed on the battlefield soon.</p><br/><p>With just one person and a sword, Shangguan Xue\u2019er charged into the enemy\u2019s battle formation.</p><br/><p>The sword went forward in the most direct way, similar to a dragon emerging out of the ocean whilst glimmering with the snowy-white color of the sword\u2019s reflection. Meanwhile, at least a dozen powerhouses from Blood Red Hell and Love Valley simultaneously launched their attacks towards Shangguan Xue\u2019er who was charging towards them.</p><br/><p>However, when their attacks struck Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s body, the only sensation she felt was like a vast expanse of mist enveloping her. It was as if their attacks were struck into the water and vanished without a trace. On the other hand, the terrifying sword\u2019s intent that was bursting out of Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s body claimed two Heavenly King-tier powerhouses\u2019 lives in a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Core Nucleus that was solidified by Shangguan Xue\u2019er was half a Saint Nucleus Core, just like her two sisters. That was why the Destruction Attribute barely caused her any damage. She had trained laboriously in swordsmanship since she was a child. The sharp energy that burst out of her powerful sword\u2019s intent was ever triumphant. Moreover, the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses were facing Shangguan Xue\u2019er who was fully suited with the Boundless Infinitum Set at this moment. They would need to dodge the enemy\u2019s blunt force for now rather than confronting her forcefully.</p><br/><p>As a result, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was just like an alien as she moved with ease within the enemy\u2019s battle formation. The Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses managed to counterattack or dodge her attacks with great effort. However, seven Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses were killed by her sword in succession in just a short while. Four of the powerhouses even turned into skeletons immediately upon their death.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell and Love Valley were capable of cultivating so many Heavenly King-tier and Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses in just a few short years. Just like those people who raided Zhou Weiqing in the beginning, more than half of the powerhouses dug out the graves of their family\u2019s ancestors and resurrected their ancestors\u2019 skeletons to help them in their battle. While these skeletons were only capable of regaining a very small portion of their living memories, most of them were only acting as killing machines.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian had learned about this situation from Tian\u2019er earlier. However, after witnessing the scene with his own eyes, he was in a great shock. At the very least, they were all from Saint Lands. However, the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley were somehow willing to sacrifice their ancestors. This made the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain detest them bitterly.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there was Shangguan Xuer\u2019er\u2019s series of attacks. Due to that, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and Peerless Sect\u2019s powerhouses could stand steadily and gather to form a densely arranged formation to resist the enemy\u2019s attacks with great effort. The casualties from both parties were growing at an alarming rate. The Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s Heavenly Beasts guardians were injured the most.</p><br/><p>What should he do? At this moment, Xue Ao\u2019tian was filled with immense hatred in his heart. He wished that he could charge into the enemy\u2019s formation and detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus so that he could perish together with the other parties. This was his Heavenly Snow Mountain after all! Although the duration of the battle was short, the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s peak was already in a chaotic mess. Even Snow Castle had been destroyed earlier. How could the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain not be infuriated by the scene?</p><br/><p>He understood very well that it would not be an easy task for him to spontaneously self-detonate. Even if he was to do so, it was not certain that all the enemies would die, and he was afraid that no one from his side would survive. He might even extensively affect the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace nearby. It was impossible for him to spontaneously self-detonate. However, if the situation was to drag on continuously, it would only become more and more disadvantageous to them.</p><br/><p>The difference between the two parties was truly too great. The enemy did not even have a single Heavenly God-tier powerhouse on their side. They could only rely on the advantage from their attribute and devote all their effort to suppress the Peerless Sect and Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s powerhouses like Xue Ao\u2019tian. They could not even enter the battle. It could be said that this was the arrival of a critical moment \u2014 one of life and death.</p><br/><p>Judging by the situation, the four battlefields were at a balanced state for now. The Elf Tribe still had the upper hand but in reality, as soon as the result on the battlefield was revealed, a chain reaction would immediately follow.</p><br/><p>At the moment when the scales were dangerously tipped to a side, a deep and awe-inspiring dragon\u2019s roar echoed suddenly. An enormous body charged up directly next to the cliff of Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>The wind was blowing wildly as the swift and fierce figure charged directly into the middle of the battlefield. As a result, Blood Red Hell and Love Valley\u2019s powerhouses at the vanguard stopped to take a look and subsequently, their attack was also temporarily halted.</p><br/><p>It was an enormous black dragon that continuously emitted a dense aura of darkness. Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s heart sank the moment he sensed the Darkness Attribute that the dragon\u2019s body emitted.</p><br/><p>It was over. The enemy owned a black dragon, and it was a black dragon at the Heavenly God Tier. How could the battle continue with the involvement of this black dragon? They would certainly be defeated without a doubt.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

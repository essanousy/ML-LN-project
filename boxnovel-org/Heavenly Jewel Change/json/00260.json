In the end, she didn\u2019t say anything. \u00a0As the saying goes, a daughter\u2019s heart will invariably be with her husband. If this really did end up causing such a bitter fight that Zhou Weiqing stormed off with all three of her daughters, she wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to regret her actions.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue lowered his head slightly, as though he hadn\u2019t heard Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words. \u00a0Although on the surface it seemed as though he had been acting against Zhou Weiqing the entire time, in truth this \u2018father-in-law\u2019 cared about him the most and had been helping him out in secret. \u00a0The ever-smiling Shangguan Tianyang was actually the toughest one to handle, as he was the true controller of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue didn\u2019t respond to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s aggressive words, because he knew that Shangguan Tianyang really was bullying him a bit too much. \u00a0Before Zhou Weiqing had left for the Xuantian Continent, Shangguan Tianyang had already made a vague promise to allow all three Shangguan sisters to marry him. \u00a0Now, he was putting up new roadblocks. Anyone would be unhappy with this.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang lived up to his reputation as the Palace Master. \u00a0His smile didn\u2019t change at all, despite Zhou Weiqing\u2019s rather provocative words. \u00a0He nodded and said, \u201cWe were waiting for you to return in order to finalize these things. \u00a0There\u2019s naturally no way that there shall be no further alterations. Weiqing, would you like to rest first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head. \u00a0\u201cNo need. If I don\u2019t handle this, I won\u2019t be able to fall asleep. \u00a0Where shall we do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang smiled. \u00a0\u201cRight here at the Drill Grounds of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had never before visited the drill grounds here, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel secretly surprised at what he saw. \u00a0It was a large, empty area filled with swirling clouds that was actually a miniature spatial plane of its own.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was no longer at the same level he had been in the past. \u00a0He didn\u2019t know what sort of mechanism Shangguan Tianyang had activated, but he was sure that they had been teleported to this place.</p><br/><p>Aside from everyone else who had been within the meeting hall, Zhan LingTian was also here in the drill grounds. \u00a0Or, to be more precise, Zhan Lingtian had been training here. When Shangguan Tianyang saw him, he gestured for him to remain and watch. \u00a0Zhan Lingtian was also Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s disciple. The chance to view this battle would have varying levels of benefits for any Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>Although this was a flat plane, it didn\u2019t seem to be different from the Boundless Mainland. \u00a0The sun shone in the skies as it would anywhere else, but the clouds swirling around it made it look like an Immortal realm.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang brought Tang Xian, Shangguan Bing\u2019er, and Zhan Lingtian over to stand and watch from afar, then nodded at Shangguan Tianyue. \u00a0At the same time, his lips trembled slightly as though he was saying something to this little brother of his.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue frowned slightly, but then nodded slowly. \u00a0As for Zhou Weiqing, his lips curved upwards slightly. He didn\u2019t even need to guess; he knew that Shangguan Tianyang was telling Shangguan Tianyue not to show any mercy and to defeat Zhou Weiqing with all his power, ensuring that Xue\u2019er would remain their heir.</p><br/><p>A long stick of sandalwood joss incense flew out from Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s hand and hovered in the air. \u00a0He was the Palace Lord, after all. There was no way he would permit for any cheating.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue and Zhou Weiqing had already walked over to the drill grounds and were staring at each other. \u00a0Shangguan Tianyue said calmly, \u201cUse all the power you have. I won\u2019t show any mercy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing respectfully bowed towards Shangguan Tianyue. \u00a0\u201cGo ahead, father-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue was very satisfied with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s respect. \u00a0<em>All my hard work wasn\u2019t for nothing, at least</em>. \u00a0In truth, if it wasn\u2019t for his hidden support, there was no way that Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace would\u2019ve supported Zhou Weiqing and the Heavenly Bow Empire at such an early stage. \u00a0In fact, it wouldn\u2019t even have given him the chance to meet with the three Shangguan sisters on so many occasions. It could be said that the person who favored Zhou Weiqing the most was actually Shangguan Tianyue. \u00a0The constant complaints he directed at Zhou Weiqing were meant to prevent the kid from becoming too complacent and smug. Now, it seemed, Zhou Weiqing finally understood what his intentions had been, which was why the kid was now so respectful.</p><br/><p>But of course, none of that had anything to do with this battle. \u00a0They had to fight this duel, and Shangguan Tianyue was going to fight with all his power. \u00a0His brother was watching. If he showed any mercy, it would be discovered. That would just cause more trouble. \u00a0However\u2026 Shangguan Tianyue was thinking something else to himself. \u00a0<em>Oh, dear brother\u2026 did you really think Zhou Weiqing would be this easy to handle?</em></p><br/><p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing had reached the island, Shangguan Tianyue had personally tried to sense just how powerful the kid had become. \u00a0Alas, he had been unable to do so. It might seem common for a person to be unable to detect how powerful a second person was, but what if the first person was a Heavenly Emperor? \u00a0What level of power had Zhou Weiqing actually reached for that to happen?</p><br/><p>Now, Zhou Weiqing only needed to hang on for the time it took for the stick of incense to burn, not actually win. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t completely impossible. Although Shangguan Tianyue felt a bit conflicted as to whether or not he really wanted to let this little brat take such advantage of him and steal all three of his precious daughters, he was also a bit eager to test Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>The two, prospective father-in-law and son-in-law, stared at each other from afar. \u00a0A vast aura that was as awesome as the sea had already begun to emanate out of Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s body\u2026 but the strange thing was, he didn\u2019t cause any disturbances in the world around him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing quickly scanned the area and learned why this was so. \u00a0These drill grounds were rather unique. They were completely cut off from the atmospheric energies of the outside world, which meant that neither of them would be able to borrow energy from it. \u00a0They would have to rely on their own cultivation bases to fight each other. That way, the power of their attacks would drop dramatically. Otherwise, if a Heavenly Emperor\u2019s power was to actually explode forth on Heavenly Jewel Island, even the Zhongtian City would be affected by the shockwaves.</p><br/><p>In the face of the Heavenly Energy ripples emanating from Shangguan Tianyue, Zhou Weiqing simply stood there unmoving. \u00a0He looked as calm as ever, almost as though he was nothing more than an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Zhan Lingtian watched from Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s side, staring unblinkingly at Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0He had heard long ago that Zhou Weiqing had made yet another breakthrough, and so he himself had been training like a madman. \u00a0Just a short while ago, he himself had broken through to the nine-Jeweled stage as well. He was filled with enmity towards Zhou Weiqing, his romantic rival, and this had served as motivation for him to train harder.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know what had happened, the fact that Zhou Weiqing was actually facing up against Shangguan Tianyue caused Zhan Lingtian to feel stunned. \u00a0Shangguan Tianyue was a Heavenly Emperor! Forget about surviving for the time of a joss stick to burn, even a casual blow from the man would be beyond what Zhan Lingtian could withstand. \u00a0Did this mean that Zhou Weiqing was now at a level where he could actually block attacks from someone like the Second Palace Master? This was impossible, right?</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang felt just as shocked. \u00a0He was a Max Level Heavenly Emperor, and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s calmness caused him to feel incomparably stunned. \u00a0Just like Shangguan Tianyue, he was actually unable to see through this youth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us begin,\u201d Shangguan Tianyang said. \u00a0He waved his right hand, causing the joss stick in front of him to light up. \u00a0A wisp of smoke began to rise from it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing wasn\u2019t in a hurry to attack. \u00a0He took a half-step back with his left foot, staring intently at his father-in-law.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue naturally knew what this meant. \u00a0He snorted, then struck out with his right palm, sending a fierce burst of Heavenly Energy towards Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0It could be said that he was the first to attack.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, bringing up both hands. \u00a0His Personal Jewels were already gleaming, and when Shangguan Tianyang and Zhan Tianling actually saw the ten sets of Heavenly Jewels glistening around his wrists, they couldn\u2019t help but stare wide-eyed.</p><br/><p><em>Heavenly King. \u00a0He\u2019s actually a Heavenly King</em>! \u00a0In this instant, Zhan Lingtian\u2019s heart plummeted. \u00a0He had thought that after reaching the nine-Jeweled level, he once more had the right to challenge Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0Now, it seemed, the distance between them had become as vast as heaven\u2019s moat. He had grown up in Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and so he naturally knew how enormous the difference between a nine-Jeweled cultivator and a Heavenly King was. \u00a0Simply put, Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace had many powerhouses, but it had less than a tenth as many Heavenly Kings as it did nine-Jeweled cultivators. This was just a single step\u2019s difference, but it represented a distance as vast as the starry sky! \u00a0In addition, Zhou Weiqing was much younger than him.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Shangguan Tianyue actually attacked. \u00a0As he had said, he didn\u2019t show Zhou Weiqing any mercy at all. \u00a0An incomparably mighty aura came blasting out of his body. The Boundless Infinitum Technique was, by nature, a technique which carried boundless majesty and weight. \u00a0This powerful pressure he controlled instantly condensed around Zhou Weiqing, completely focusing on him.</p><br/><p>This showed the difference between a Heavenly King and a Heavenly Emperor. \u00a0Heavenly Kings also had tremendously powerful auras, but there was no way they could actually control their auras the way Heavenly Emperors could.</p><br/><p>A dim layer of golden light emanated from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body in response to the enormous pressure. \u00a0Aside from him and his opponent, the only person present who understood what was happening Shangguan Tianyang, because only he was at a level high enough to understand it.</p><br/><p>Although Tang Xian didn\u2019t understand how this duel between the two worked, she could tell that the ever-present, calm smile on Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s face had suddenly vanished without a trace. \u00a0What had he just seen?</p><br/><p>He saw that when Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s incredibly dense aura had pushed down upon Zhou Weiqing, it had simply parted and rolled past him without having any effect at all. \u00a0The faint golden light emanating from Zhou Weiqing looked very weak, but with it covering him it resulted in something not even Shangguan Tianyang could understand.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue didn\u2019t release his Consolidated Equipment since Zhou Weiqing wasn\u2019t using his either. \u00a0As a senior, how could he possibly summon his equipment first? This impacted his honor as an expert.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He lightly knocked the door and said respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Duan Tianlang said from inside his room, but his voice sounded like he was exhausted.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was startled for a little. It was only several months ago that Duan Tianlang was rejuvenated with his Saint Energy. Even though his physique could not compare to his prime, he should still be full of life, not as weak as he is currently!</p><br/><p>Puzzled, Zhou Weiqing entered the room.</p><br/><p>As soon as he saw Duan Tianlang, Zhou Weiqing was shocked. \u201cJunior Master, what happened to you?\u201d he said as he dashed beside Duan Tianlang. Zhou Weiqing grabbed Duan Tianlang\u2019s arm and started transferring his reddish-gold Saint Energy into Duan Tianlang\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang\u2019s condition at that moment could be described as horrendous. His face was in a tint of grey, his black hair turned white, and his face was crawling with wrinkles. His eyes were dull and without life, no matter how Zhou Weiqing looked at it, he was like an old man on the brink of death.</p><br/><p>Receiving Zhou Weiqing, Saint Energy, Duan Tianlang\u2019s body trembled as his condition improved. His life force was restored, and under the cleansing of the Saint Energy, his physical functions started to rejuvenate from its waning state.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was aghast as he healed Duan Tianlang. He could clearly feel that if his cultivation base had not been elevated to Heavenly Emperor tier, he could at most delay Duan Tianlang\u2019s imminent death for a few months with his Saint Energy Galaxia. Saint Energy was not omnipotent, there were things that cannot be reversed. Fortunately, his reddish-gold Saint Energy was purer than before and could save Duan Tianlang from death.</p><br/><p>The effects of his Saint Energy was immediate, Zhou Weiqing could see that Duan Tianlang was slowly recovering. The dullness in his eyes was slowly replaced by a hint of surprise.</p><br/><p>An hour later, with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s diligence, Duan Tianlang had finally recovered enough to compare to a few months ago when Zhou Weiqing last helped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, you\u2019ve improved again. I really thought I was done for this time. However, I was not doing it on purpose, it\u2019s beyond my control! Haha, you\u2019re really my lucky star!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang laughed, but Zhou Weiqing was livid, he glared at Duan Tianlang angrily. He said angrily, \u201cJunior Master, what have you done? I had just nursed you back to health, how could you take such bad care of yourself? What exactly did you do, your body had almost fallen apart!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s reprimand, Duan Tianlang scratched his head embarrassedly. He sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s an old problem. I can\u2019t help it, it\u2019s so ingrained in me. Once I entered the state of researching Consolidated Equipment Scrolls, I can\u2019t stop. I think this time around I have not slept for more than a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? More than a month? Without rest? You\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing was out of words.</p><br/><p>When Duan Tianlang said he had not slept for more than a month, it was not only that he did not sleep, he had been awake every minute of the day for a month researching Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. If it were not for that, how would Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy have depleted so quickly?</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang said apologetically, \u201cIt\u2019s entirely my fault. However, Weiqing, let\u2019s not talk about this. Look at what I\u2019ve done here.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, Duan Tianlang leaped up like a groom about to be married and pulled Zhou Weiqing to his work desk, on which a scroll with meter-long sides was spread.</p><br/><p>On the unfurled scroll, the first thing Zhou Weiqing saw was grey lines interwoven tightly. These lines were outlined with a special pen, the scroll was made of good quality sheepskin, which is known for its durability.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had wanted to talk to Duan Tianlang, however, when he saw the scroll, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of normal people, those grey lines would give them dizzy spells. However, Zhou Weiqing was not normal people! As his cultivation base was raised to Heavenly King and then to Heavenly Emperor tier, he could finally be called a God Tier Master.</p><br/><p>As the large scroll appeared in front of his eyes, the only emotion he could feel was a shock.</p><br/><p>Yes, it was a design of a Consolidated Equipment Scroll, its patterns were more complicated than any other Consolidated Scrolls Zhou Weiqing had ever seen. There were many segments where it was slightly messy, but following the lines, Zhou Weiqing still squealed every once in a while.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang stood beside him, reading along. The difference between him and Zhou Weiqing was that his eyes only exude fascination. It was as if he was looking at the most beautiful woman in the world, and occasionally, he even caressed the sheepskin scroll, he was practically living in his own world.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Master! Junior Master, you did it! My goodness, this is a miracle, it can only be called a miracle,\u201d Zhou Weiqing squealed, unable to hold back.</p><br/><p>His head snapped up and looked at Duan Tianlang. Even though Zhou Weiqing was not as persistent as Duan Tianlang in creating Consolidated Equipment Scrolls, he was still a God Tier Master and an heir of the Strength Legacy. How could he not marvel at an epic creation like this particular Consolidated Equipment Scroll? He could not imagine how a scroll like this could actually be designed, some concepts in it could only be described as a masterpiece.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve succeeded. Even I didn\u2019t think I could succeed,\u201d Duan Tianlang murmured. \u201cPerhaps, perhaps it was because I have walked to the edge of the realm of the Dead, I\u2019ve kept my heart calm enough and brave enough to abandon everything else, that the Heavens finally presented me with such glorious achievement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even after finishing the Ringless Ground Purging Set, Duan Tianlang had not once mentioned the word \u2018achievement\u2019, but at this moment, pride was written all over his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Master, you\u2019ve succeeded, you have! This, this is the design for the eleventh piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set! If we could finish this piece of Consolidated Equipment Scroll, the Ringless Ground Purging Set could very well surpass the Boundless Infinitum Set, becoming the strongest armor set in existence!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding lightly, Duan Tianlang\u2019s tears were struggling to roll down his face, \u201cIn the past month, my inspiration had not stopped, and I barely ate, I never slept, but even if I knew I might die, I still wouldn\u2019t stop. Weiqing, I beg of you. No matter what, please create this scroll when I\u2019m still alive. I have the power to design it, but I cannot build it. Only you, with your mastery over Time and Spatial Attributes, could build this piece of armor. If I\u2019m not wrong, you are now a Heavenly Emperor tier, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded enthusiastically and said, \u201cJunior Master, don\u2019t you worry. I will definitely do my best in building this piece. Junior Master, I can say this without any worry now, you\u2019re the finest God Tier Master in the Strength Legacy, even more so than the ancestor who created the Ringless Ground Purging Set. At the same time, you are the greatest, strongest God Tier Master in existence, no one would be able to surpass your achievement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I think so too, hahaha!\u201d Duan Tianlang laughed heartily. Usually calm and collected, he had finally shown his wild side.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang\u2019s biggest dream had been to be able to see the design of the Ringless Ground Purging Set, it was Zhou Weiqing who helped him achieve that, and he even managed to build the legendary armor set. He was the first God Tier Master who had built both the Hiltless Sky Purging Set and Ringless Ground Purging Set in the history of the Strength Legacy. Not only that, he had actually designed the eleventh piece of armor for the Ringless Ground Purging Set. It could be said that this design was not only born of his talent but also external variables like luck. Duan Tianlang could say with confidence that if he were to do it over, he would not succeed in a hundred years.</p><br/><p>With this eleventh piece of design, not even the three God Tier Masters from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace could say they had the better achievement. Master Xing Tianyi only preserved what was created, while Duan Tianlang was creating. As soon as this design was finished, he had officially stepped onto the altar of Consolidating Equipment Masters. No one in the current generation could claim to be better than him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, the next segment will be your part,\u201d Duan Tianlang smiled. \u201cThis design was finished, but I still need to do a little adjustment. I\u2019ve already prepared the formula for the Consolidating Ink, we still have most of the ingredients we require from what you brought back from Heavenly Jewel Island, but there is one thing I need you to procure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Master, what is the ingredient that not even Heavenly Jewel Island has?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang said, \u201cBy the eleventh piece of legendary armor sets, there are too many required ingredients that clash with each other. To completely merge these ingredients without the clash, we need to use certain special materials to fuse them. Your Saint Energy could be a good choice, but it is still an external force. Even if we succeeded, it would affect the quality of the Consolidating Ink, which would then affect the scroll-making process. Therefore, we will not be using a pure internal energy as a blending solvent.</p><br/><p>At this point, Duan Tianlang paused before continuing, \u201cThe blending solvent must have strong Attributes to it so it completely covers the other ingredients before it could succeed. So you need to look for the Elven Queen\u2019s blood. Not much is needed, three drops should be more than enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Elven Queen? Who\u2019s that?\u201d Zhou Weiqing had not heard of this character, but with a title of \u2018Queen\u2019, she must not be a weak character.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang smiled slightly, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual that you don\u2019t know about her, it takes hundred-year-old geezers like me to have heard of the Elven Queen. The Elves are an ancient race, they existed even earlier than us humans in this world. Eons ago, the rulers of the mainlands are the Dragons, the Elves, and several other extinct races. Humans at the time were still very primitive, suitable only to be their slaves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs time goes by, human intelligence and the ability to cultivate slowly developed. In addition, humans\u2019 reproductive abilities are stronger than the other races, so we slowly dominated the mainlands.The few races that had extinct almost always had something to do with humans. The Elves and the Dragons were still pretty close to us humans, especially the Dragons. Their reproduction was too slow. Therefore, for some time, they even treated humans as their spokesperson. However, the development of the human race had far exceeded the dragons\u2019 expectations to the point that they could not control anymore. By that time, the mainlands slowly belonged to the humans, and the original ruling races had either weakened or gone into seclusion. You\u2019ve seen dragons before, how many would you say there were on this mainland? Far too rare, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said, deep in thought, \u201cThat means, the Elves were pretty much the same with the Dragons? Did they go into seclusion too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang nodded, saying, \u201cIt would be more appropriate to say that they have sealed themselves in. The Elves were the favored race of nature, they can merge with nature and easily use any ability of the Nature Attribute. They don\u2019t have Heavenly Jewels like us, only the power to control the nature. To avoid being taken over by the humans, The Twelve Elders of the Elves at the time combined their powers to isolate a space for them to live in on this mainland. The Humans at the time had also made an agreement with the Elves. The Elves would not leave the Sealed Land, and us Humans would not invade their space.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was a long, long time ago. After that, the Elves had actually withdrawn from the history of this mainland, no longer appearing in front of the Humans. This was also why you had not heard about this race at all. The Elves did not come into our world, but there were records of humans journeying into the world of the Elves. After many years of being in seclusion, the Elves had become much stronger than before. However, Time had diminished their wanderlust as a race, they don\u2019t even want to leave the Sealed Land, and they are friendly to the Humans. Some humans who had gained their approval could even gain many benefits from their visits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Elves are the children of nature, the purest Nature Energy lies within the bloodline of the Elven Queen. If we could procure three drops of her blood, this final process to create the Consolidated Equipment Scroll would be as easy as pie, and the Consolidating Ink would be at its optimal capacity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head and said, \u201cJunior Master, this mission would not be easy to complete! Do we even know where the Elves hid? Also, the Elven Queen is the leader of the tribe. It would not be easy to get her blood. If the Elves are strong even for you, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for us to carry out this task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang laughed heartily, \u201cOther people may not be able to, but you\u2019re different, you have already created so many miracles by yourself. What comes next would be on you. As for the position of the Elves, it\u2019s even easier. You only need to ask those wives of yours, they must know about this. The Elves could be left alone for so long by the Human world, they would naturally have a connection here in the Human world. The one with whom they have the best relationship is Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Did you think the Boundless Infinitum Set would not need the special blending solvent for their final piece? They did not need the blood of the Elven Queen, but it was also a precious item that was only produced by the Elves.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Duan Tianlang\u2019s hint, Zhou Weiqing had finally understood a little better. The Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace had a good relationship with the Elves, it would mean it was not impossible to ask the Elven Queen for her blood. \u2018If the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace could build a relationship with the Elves, why couldn\u2019t my new Peerless Sect do it?\u2019</p><br/><p>The Elves were an ancient race, if Zhou Weiqing could build a good relationship with them, it would be very beneficial to his Peerless Sect.</p><br/><p>At the thought of that, Zhou Weiqing nodded and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll do it, Junior Master. But promise me, before my return, please don\u2019t damage your own body again. If anything happened to you, I would seal this design up and will never touch it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang smiled, nodding yet again, \u201cI would not die before I witness the creation of this eleventh piece of Ringless Ground Purging Set, so don\u2019t worry about me and go. However, be careful, if it could not be done, don\u2019t force it. The Elves could be stronger than what I had imagined. Even though they didn\u2019t appear on this mainland, I\u2019m guessing there are plenty of powerhouses among the Elves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and nodded. He was not that worried about the powerhouses of the Elves. One\u2019s confidence would increase the stronger they get. Currently, Zhou Weiqing was no longer the original Zhou Weiqing, he had become a Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouse. With his reddish-gold Saint Energy Galaxia, there were not many people he would be scared of. If he had to rob her with his power, he would still be confident that he would succeed.</p><br/><p>After leaving Duan Tianlang\u2019s room, Zhou Weiqing immediately left town. With his current cultivation base, the limitation of distance to Blink was pretty much nullified, he could reach anywhere immediately with just a thought about his destination, as long as his destination was within several thousand meters in displacement.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Shangguan Fei\u2019er had been keeping their eyes on Shangguan Bing\u2019er who was cultivating in mid-air. It had been several days, but Shangguan Bing\u2019er had been absorbing the Atmospheric Energy non-stop, her aura was also becoming stronger and stronger.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

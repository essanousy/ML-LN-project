The Heavenly Jewel Masters knew who they were and their abilities as well. They calmed down as they thought to themselves, \u201cWhy would these three men who are clearly not very powerful be on the stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Er Chun was concerned. He knew that the longer he took, the chances of them finding out the truth about the competition would increase. However, there was nothing else he could do. He had used 80% of his strength in the punch. To be fair, in his disguise, he could not use any more Heavenly Energy. After all, the Heavenly Jewel Masters who were watching were not dumb. Although the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was powerful in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, Er Chun was not the one who called the shots. If the news spread, he would have to pay a significant amount of money to settle the matter.</p><br/><p>Er Chun decided to try one last time. If it did not work, it would be unfortunate for those people who had paid. \u201cGood, I\u2019m happy that you guys passed the third assessment. Unfortunately, only three will advance to the final round where one of you will be disqualified. I\u2019ve watched your performance earlier and have a rough understanding of all your abilities. The fourth assessment is something extra that I came up with to showcase each and every one of your abilities. You\u2019ll draw lots to decide who goes first. The one who goes first will be surrounded by the remaining three people. The goal here is to see how long you\u2019ll last when you\u2019re fighting against three people. The one who gets kicked out the fastest will be disqualified.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing thought it was funny how Er Chun set up something so elaborate just to get rid of him. Instead of exposing him, Zhou Weiqing decided to just go along with it.</p><br/><p>Er Chun proceeded to speak, \u201cEverybody knows that a simple fight will not be enough for a Heavenly Jewel Master to showcase his skills. Therefore, you\u2019re allowed to attack in whatever manner you see fit. I\u2019ll be the judge and stop the fight if I think you can\u2019t continue any further. Alright, let\u2019s draw lots.\u201d</p><br/><p>Er Chun then turned around and waved at Sang Tan.</p><br/><p>It was not Sang Tan\u2019s first time meeting Er Chun. He knew what he was trying to say and was secretly happy. Although Master Er Chun was greedy, he was good at what he did. However, Sang Tan was a little worried. His son was not very powerful. Would he be able to get away when it was his turn to go against three people?</p><br/><p>As expected, Zhou Weiqing was the \u2018lucky\u2019 one who was chosen to go first. When Er Chun was drawing lots, he was glaring at the three of them at an angle where Zhou Weiqing could not see him. The three brats were not dumb. How could they not understand what he was trying to say? Moreover, with their powerful family backgrounds, their abilities were not that bad even though they were spoilt rotten.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not complain as it still looked fair on the surface. Although the Heavenly Jewel Masters knew that it was a setup, most of them were timid and did not dare to speak up. Er Chun retreated to the side and nodded to Zhou Weiqing. \u201cYoung man, show us your skills. Everyone, please remember that I\u2019ll be looking out for your well-being. Don\u2019t be afraid to attack. Let\u2019s start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing cursed him inside for reminding the brats to attack him with all they got at such a critical time. If they actually killed him, all Er Chun had to do was say that he did not manage to save him in time. If Zhou Weiqing died, there would only be the three of them left, and they would advance to the final round directly. What a thorough plan! No blame could be placed on Er Chun even if the plan was exposed.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, luck was not on Er Chun\u2019s side because he encountered Zhou Weiqing this time around. Little did he know, the young man before him was one of the most powerful individuals among the younger generation of the Boundless Mainland. His cultivation base was probably superior to Er Chun\u2019s.</p><br/><p>As per Er Chun\u2019s instructions, the three brats surrounded Zhou Weiqing from three different directions as they released their Consolidated Equipment sets. All three of them had 5-piece Consolidated Equipment sets with them. Out of the three, Sang De had the best 5-piece set. Apart from the sword, he had a breastplate, helm, waistband and a pair of gloves. Those were considered to be the better pieces of equipment available. Although the other two were slightly less well-equipped than Sang De was, they had Consolidated Equipment sets with them as well.</p><br/><p>The three of them knew each other well, and it was not their first time doing a dirty deed together. As Sang De and the other man with a spear shouted, they simultaneously charged towards Zhou Weiqing. Sang De\u2019s jewel was imbued with the Wind Attribute which created a cyclone out of the sword in his hand. It looked glorious and covered a wide area. Although his cultivation base was unstable, the power of his attacks was considered to be quite good with the help of the Consolidated Equipment pieces he had on him.</p><br/><p>Sang Tan smiled as he watched his son from his seat. The brat who wielded a spear had the Fire Attribute. With the help of Sang De\u2019s Wind Attribute, he stabbed his spear towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s stomach. With his agility jewel, his speed and attack abilities were not bad. Although their Consolidated Equipment sets were good, their skills were truly lacking. Zhou Weiqing knew that it was related to their willpower. The level of one\u2019s skills was closely related to willpower. The stronger the willpower, the higher the level of one\u2019s skills. Looking at the brats who surrounded him, he wondered if they even possessed any willpower?</p><br/><p>However, the three of them were sly. As two of them attacked Zhou Weiqing directly from the front, the man behind him stayed silent. The man held a black dagger in his hand and then lowered his body to the ground. Like a poisonous snake, he slithered towards Zhou Weiqing. He had obtained the skill from a snake beast. Because he had the Darkness Attribute, it complemented his skill perfectly, and since the three of them had done dirty deeds together regularly in the past, their teamwork was pretty good.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

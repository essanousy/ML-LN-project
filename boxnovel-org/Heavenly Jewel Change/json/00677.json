Even if it was the Mountain Lord of the Snow Mountain who cast this technique, caution still had to be observed. Not only that, the amount of energy used in the process would differ based on the target of resurrection. After all, resurrecting a mouse and a dragon would, of course, consume a different amount of energy.</p><br/><p>Her right hand that was holding the God Spirit Staff gradually started to move around. Lines were drawn in the sky, sketching complex golden symbols that solidified into golden lights one after another in the air.</p><br/><p>After the symbols were fully drawn, they floated directly up to the sky and hovered above Hui Yao\u2019s body. Every time there was an addition of a new symbol, a new ray of golden light would emit from the symbol as it entered Hui Yao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Right now, Zhou Weiqing who was sustaining the huge Saint Energy Whirlpool with Tian\u2019er did not feel anything yet. So far, all of the energy that Tian\u2019er used was her own Heavenly Energy, not the Saint Energy. After all, Tian\u2019er\u2019s Saint Energy had not reached the stage where it could regenerate by itself. For that reason, she chose to use Heavenly Energy first to cast her technique.</p><br/><p>The time it took to activate the Resurrection Skill was a lot longer than they had expected. It had taken them 2 hours just for the preparation. When the 108th golden symbol emerged from thin air, all the symbols suddenly came together to form a gigantic golden halo in the air.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Tian\u2019er paused for a moment before casting a glance at Zhou Weiqing. He instantly started to feel nervous. He knew that from this point onwards, the real resurrection process was about to take place. Tian\u2019er was finally done with all the preparatory work.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>The 108 golden symbols that were hovering on top of Hui Yao seemed to have activated on their own simultaneously. Without warning, they dropped from the sky and entered Hui Yao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the Atmospheric Energy in the air began to ripple rapidly. A bright golden beam suddenly erupted from the God Spirit Staff on Tian\u2019er\u2019s hand, piercing its way through the clouds up to the sky.</p><br/><p>At that instance, the entire Lustre Spatial Realm quaked because of the rising golden beam. In a blink of an eye, the beam was infused into the center of the 108 golden symbols.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing could feel the Heavenly Energy in Tian\u2019er pouring out in torrents from her body into the God Spirit Staff that she was holding.</p><br/><p>A layer of golden luster slowly began to form a combination of the 108 golden symbols before enveloping the entire body of Hui Yao the dragon. The originally red color of its body now had a shine of brilliant gold.</p><br/><p>The Resurrection Skill was a technique that countervailed the creator of heaven and earth. Every time the technique was activated, those who witnessed the technique would receive a different enlightening in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Slowly closing his eyes, Zhou Weiqing activated his Immortal Deity Technique, the golden whirlpool from before appeared once again. Actually, it was not a real whirlpool but when his body turned golden in color, the Atmospheric Energy would be sucked in by him in a horrifyingly rapid speed that looked like a whirlpool was being activated on his body. Even the speed of Tian\u2019er\u2019s God Spirit Staff absorbing the Atmospheric Energy was far slower than him.</p><br/><p>Not to say that the God Spirit Staff was not powerful but it was just that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Immortal Deity Technique was far too compelling. Not only that, his cultivation base was also at a much higher level compared to Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>The golden beam that was shooting out of the God Spirit Staff started to have a hint of silverish white color in it. In just such a short amount of time, Tian\u2019er\u2019s Heavenly Energy had been completely depleted and at the moment, the energy that she was unleashing was the Saint Energy. With the Saint Energy joining in the mix, Tian\u2019er\u2019s face finally eased off a little. After the Saint Energy was unleashed into the technique, the energy consumption rate dropped drastically, a far cry from earlier when she was using her Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>Duo Si was looking at them nervously at the side. Its claw remained unmoved in front of Zhou Weiqing, just in case he needed to use it; the other dragon claw had long dug into the hard rock on the ground, showing how nervous it was, watching the scene that was unfolding in front of its eyes.</p><br/><p>The three Shangguan sisters who were standing behind were so nervous that they did not even dare to breathe out loud. The most nervous of all was none other than Shangguan Xue\u2019er. After all, the resurrection of the dragon was related to the safety of the entire Lustre Spacial Realm which meant it was also related to the safety of the millions of commoners residing in Zhongtian City. How could she possibly not feel nervous about it?</p><br/><p>The golden light that fell upon Hui Yao continually seeped into its body. Like a gigantic sponge, its body kept absorbing the massive amount of divine energy.</p><br/><p>Between Tian\u2019er and him, Zhou Weiqing was the one that felt more tired. Under his Immortal Deity Technique, the Atmospheric Energy was constantly being absorbed and transformed by him into Saint Energy before it was being passed on to Tian\u2019er. Like a converter, she would convert the Saint Energy that she received from him into Divine Energy before inserting it into the Resurrection Skill.</p><br/><p>Currently, a faint smile could be seen playing on Tian\u2019er\u2019s mouth. She did not expect that using the Saint Energy to cast this technique would have a far slower consumption speed. No doubt, she had faith that she would definitely be able to complete the technique. However, whether Hui Yao would be resurrected or not was a different story. That would have to depend on God\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>Just like that, a day had passed. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face appeared to be slightly paler than usual. Although he could regenerate the Saint Energy in his own body now, it still could not withstand the prolonged consumption of the Resurrection Skill. Being able to keep it up for one whole day showed how tough he was, although he had already strained himself to the limit. Perhaps, not even a Heavenly King tier person could endure it.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes and looked at Duo Si.</p><br/><p>From the very start, Duo Si had never moved its eyes away from Hui Yao. As a couple, it had the most profound perception towards its husband. Duo Si could clearly feel that under the Resurrection Skill, its husband\u2019s vitality was beginning to be restored and now, finally, a weak heartbeat could be heard and the heartbeat was getting stronger and stronger with every passing second.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Duo Si\u2019s body quivered without warning. Quickly turning its head over to look at Zhou Weiqing, it saw that his palm that was casting the Demonic Devour had made contact with its claw.</p><br/><p>Duo Si nodded its head at him as it unleashed its horrifying Heavenly God tier Heavenly Energy, letting Zhou Weiqing access the power that it had.</p><br/><p>The fact that he was able to hold out for one whole day was more than enough to leave a great impression in Duo Si\u2019s mind. It could clearly sense the petrifying Heavenly Energy consumption speed of the Resurrection Skill and this man was actually able to persist for so long? Even Duo Si, who was at the Heavenly God-tier, was alarmed by his ability.</p><br/><p>Once the Demonic Devour was activated, relief could be seen on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face. With the completion of the Immortal Deity Technique, all 36 major Death Acupuncture Points and meridians were much tougher than ordinary people by several times. For that reason, the Demonic Devour was able to transform the Saint Energy without any difficulties as well.</p><br/><p>Before, Zhou Weiqing had tried to devour the Heavenly Energy of Heavenly King beasts but compared to Duo Si, those beasts were like ants to Duo Si\u2019s elephant. The pure Fire Attribute Heavenly Energy in Duo Si\u2019s body was like a vast ocean. Although it could not be compared to the Heavenly Energy at all, the amount that it possessed was extremely vast, so vast that it stretched far off into the distance and out of sight. At the moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s devouring speed could be considered as extremely speedy but somehow, it did not seem to affect Duo Si at all.</p><br/><p>With such an \u2018insurance\u2019 by his side, Zhou Weiqing immediately increased the Saint Energy output that he passed on to Tian\u2019er. Before this, she had told him that after the Resurrection Spell was cast, the shorter the completion time, the greater the chances of resurrecting the dragon would be. Now that there was no need to worry about the depletion of Saint Energy anymore, he, of course, sped up the process without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Gradually, strange changes began to appear on Hui Yao\u2019s body. The gigantic body that was rendered in gold by the Divine halo slowly had golden stars emerging on the skin. Hints of vitality started to throb from its gigantic body.</p><br/><p>It meant that the Resurrection Skill had finally completed the process of reviving the body\u2019s vitality. What was left now was the awakening of its soul. Only when the soul and body completely combine that the Resurrection process could be called a success.</p><br/><p>It was also for this reason that generally, the Resurrection technique would have to be performed within 2 hours after the victim\u2019s death. It was because during this time, the soul had not fully dissipated yet. But of course, dragons had Nucleus Core that helped converge its soul so there was no need to worry about the soul dissipating after its death. However, there had never been any precedent for resurrecting a dragon in the history of Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger, nobody knew whether they would succeed or not.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s face turned serious at once. The God Spirit Staff in her hand drew much more complex golden lines compared to the ones earlier. With a shout, the lines suddenly gleamed brightly before it was imprinted on the dragon\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>In an instant, Zhou Weiqing could feel that half of his Saint Energy was being sucked out by Tian\u2019er. The moment the golden lines touched the dragon\u2019s forehead, the gigantic head rose up without warning. Between the dragon\u2019s orbs on the central skull position, a blinding golden light suddenly burst out.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the horrifying energy ripples trembled violently, releasing a sense of tyrannical pressure that forced Zhou Weiqing and the girls to retreat hastily from their positions.</p><br/><p>Quickly, Duo Si cast a red light shade, enveloping the five of them in that light. Its eyes had never been so bright as it stared in a trance at its husband\u2019s lifted head. The claws that Zhou Weiqing was holding on to was trembling uncontrollably. Now that the Resurrection had reached its final stage, Duo Si\u2019s heart was filled with anxiety.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er pointed the God Spirit Staff outwards. Her body began to tremble slightly, too. It was apparent that the amount of Saint Energy that she could bear had already reached its limit.</p><br/><p>Another golden symbol was drawn on the sky. Tian\u2019er called forth all her energy and at once, the golden symbol was imprinted on Hui Yao\u2019s forehead once again.</p><br/><p>The bright dazzling golden light was so blinding that none of them could open their eyes. All of a sudden, the golden light vanished as it merged with Hui Yao\u2019s body. Promptly, its gigantic head began to lift up high.</p><br/><p>Just as Duo Si was about to cheer out loud and rejoice, Hui Yao\u2019s gigantic head suddenly fell and slammed on the ground fiercely without warning.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I want to see, with what capabilities will you rain blood onto my Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Let me inform you about your wife. She had been executed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words were only spoken out of anger. However, to Zhou Weiqing, it was as if thunder had come out of nowhere in bright daylight. At that moment, Zhou Weiqing was stunned into silence.</p><br/><p>Among the sky warriors who were surrounding him in mid-air and on the ground, those who were in front of him could clearly see Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes rapidly turning terrifying blood-red.</p><br/><p>His body was shivering and an unstable wave of energy burst out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s torso.</p><br/><p>\u2018Terrifying\u2019 could not even begin to describe the wave of energy. It was vast and deathly silent. One could even describe it as a gloomy bleakness. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s bones were crackling throughout his whole body. Inside it, the Saint Energy that had been flowing slowly started to move with surprising swiftness.</p><br/><p>A rich silvery-white light ribbon started to swirl out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. The galaxy-like brilliance that it radiated filled him with an intimidating aura.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bing\u2019er is dead?\u2019 he thought. To Zhou Weiqing, this was no longer just a blow. At that moment, Zhou Weiqing was also thinking, \u2018No wonder Dongfang Hanyue doesn\u2019t want to come out and see me. They\u2019ve killed Bing\u2019er.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, my dear Bing\u2019er,\u201d he lamented silently.</p><br/><p>When he thought about how Shangguan Bing\u2019er had died in this place and that he might not even find her body, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart felt like it was going to explode.</p><br/><p>Whenever anyone was pushed to the extreme, they would usually go into a catatonic state. They might not be reasonable by that point and they might not even have much time to think. However, they would definitely have their potential fully activated.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, I will turn the entire Mysterious Heavenly Palace into a blood sacrifice for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAAARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>An extremely shrill howl came out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mouth. Together with that, a silvery-white light ribbon with a hint of sanguine scent burst out of his body.</p><br/><p>Within a split second, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s most fearsome strength was unleashed as it enveloped him. Even though they did not plan to attack, the warriors who were still in the sky all simultaneously fell.</p><br/><p>A frightening, almost perishing bloodline presence burst out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. How could Heavenly Beasts that were not even a Heavenly King tier resist? The sky warriors who never considered that Zhou Weiqing would attack were taken by surprise.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not even look at these people, as one after another dark golden light rays rose from his body. In the next moment, he clutched at the diamond-shaped pendant on his neck and forcefully yanked it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cMysterious Heavenly Palace, oh Mysterious Heavenly Palace. I will not rest until you\u2019re all dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s being so rambunctious? I wanna see how you\u2019re going to rain blood onto the Palace,\u201d a deep gruff voice said. Following that, a massive dark silhouette rose slowly from the abyss. Its wings flapped, creating a gust of wind that caught the falling sky warriors, helping them land safely.</p><br/><p>It was the Blackfiend Dragon, it had appeared!</p><br/><p>Dongfang who stood in front of the entrance watching Zhou Weiqing was also surprised during his sudden transformation. However, when the Blackfiend Dragon appeared, she immediately relaxed.</p><br/><p>It was only a kid who had not even attained a cultivation stage of Heavenly King tier. With him alone, what could he do even if he was furious? At this point, Dongfang had decided she wanted to capture Zhou Weiqing. He had behaved so badly. If they were to let him go, the reputation of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace would definitely be affected. No matter what, he had to be caught. What happens after that was not important.</p><br/><p>The appearance of the Blackfiend Dragon pushed back the intimidating aura Zhou Weiqing had emitted. However, the Blackfiend Dragon was also shocked. Similar to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, he recognized Zhou Weiqing\u2019s aura had a hint of Dragon Emperor Bloodline. Not only that, there seemed to be another bloodline. It was fused with the Dragon Emperor Bloodline, and it seemed to have an even more powerful origin.</p><br/><p>To the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s knowledge, it was impossible for something like this to happen, but it was happening right in front of him. It was not up to him to not believe it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline was originally not as strong as his Dragon Emperor Bloodline. However, after he had activated the pure Essence of Demon God within the bloodline, it had undergone a mutation.</p><br/><p>Staring at the Blackfiend Dragon, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression did not change. Instead, the blood-red became even more intense. It looked almost similar to the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s crimson eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can stop me, not even you,\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s stated coldly without any expression. At this point, he lifted his right hand with the Spatial Teleportation Stone. The galaxy-like, silver Saint Energy immediately rushed into the Spatial Teleportation Stone.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is he doing?\u2019 Everyone who saw his action thought in unison.</p><br/><p>He had already made such a wild claim, was he trying to teleport away with the Spatial Teleportation Stone?</p><br/><p>That should be the standard reaction. With so many powerhouses around, what chance did he have?</p><br/><p>However, now that Dongfang decided to capture him, if he had left, it would be a huge concern in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Blackfiend Dragon, please intercept him. Do not let him leave,\u201d Dongfang asked with a little urgency in her voice. At the same time, she and the four Supreme Elders leaped up, flying towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>A surge of hair-raising energy streamed through the air. The five Heavenly Emperor tier powerhouses emanated their Heavenly Energy at the same time. What a spectacular scene it was. Even if a Heavenly God tier powerhouse were to take them on, they would not dare to be careless about it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing hovered in the air quietly as if he was not aware of his surroundings. With intense stimulation from the Saint Energy, the pendant in his hand burst into a radiant silver light like a small silver sun. Its radiance was strong and intense, preventing people from looking at it directly.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon was also heavily injured after the battle with the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. It had only been a few days, so naturally, it had not completely healed. It only appeared because it was startled by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first yell. There was someone who dared to appear outside of Mysterious Heavenly Castle yelling Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s name, and in such a rude way to boot. How could he not be surprised? How strong was this person that he was not afraid of offending everyone?</p><br/><p>Hence, he hurried towards the ruckus. When it saw the perpetrator, however, it was only Zhou Weiqing. The Blackfiend Dragon did not harbor any resentment towards Zhou Weiqing. On the contrary, he liked the kid. After all, a few days ago, it was him who saved his life. Otherwise, he would never have made it back here alive.</p><br/><p>Even so, it could see that Zhou Weiqing was clearly in a crazed state. He did not know what had happened, but he thought it would be best to restrain him for now. Whatever issues he might have with the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, they could deal with it themselves.</p><br/><p>A darkness washed over the land as a huge black light screen fell on the valley, covering a large area ranging thousands of meters.</p><br/><p>The Ward of Darkness, that\u2019s right, it is the Ward of Darkness.</p><br/><p>This was one of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s strongest abilities. The other day, because he had to fight a powerhouse like the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, he needed help from outsiders to set up the Ward of Darkness. Facing Zhou Weiqing, he reckoned even if he was hurt, he would have enough strength to trap Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Seeing the black screen of light trapping Zhou Weiqing, Dongfang and the four Supreme Elders all let out a sigh of relief. If they really let the kid get away, it would be problematic in the future. It could even be a ticking time bomb that could overturn the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>With the Ward of Darkness completely set up, as long as the Blackfiend Dragon could maintain it, if the person using the Spatial Teleportation Stone did not have a higher cultivation stage than him, it would be impossible for the person to teleport away.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze was cold as he continuously released his Saint Energy. Regarding everything else, it was like he did not even care. What mattered was the intense blood-red under his eyes that expressed his intent to die with his enemies.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon said in his deep voice, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. However, young man, you need to stay calm. I\u2019m still here, I can\u2019t let you wreck this place. Your cultivation is not bad among those in the younger generation. However, if you want to teleport away from my Ward of Darkness, I have to tell you it\u2019s impossible. Surrender, and talk it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSurrender?\u201d Zhou Weiqing had descended into semi-hysteria. \u201cAsking me to surrender, you\u2019re not strong enough. You think the Ward of Darkness can contain me? It\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his chilly voice was like stuffing one\u2019s ear with ice fragments. The weather was not cold, yet one still shuddered. Because of his killing intent, it was almost possible for everyone to see the bright scarlet color of blood.</p><br/><p>For the sake of his wife, he had arrived alone and taunted the Mysterious Heavenly Palace on his own. This was already an impressive deed. But now, facing the Blackfiend Dragon, he was still on par in terms of aura. All these had left the powerhouses watching below with their mouths gaping.</p><br/><p>At this moment, from the center of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palm, there was a clear crackle followed by a strong silver light pillar that shot out towards the sky.</p><br/><p>The Ward of Darkness might be able to prevent the light pillar from leaving, but in the next moment, the silver light had filled the whole thousand-meter area.</p><br/><p>A humongous and complicated symbol appeared in the sky. Rich, intense wave of the Spatial Attribute seemingly made everything else around it distort.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad. He\u2019s not trying to flee, he trying to perform a summoning,\u201d the Blackfiend Dragon yelped, he flapped his wings, sending a strong Darkness Energy towards the silver light pillar.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

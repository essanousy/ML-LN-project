At that moment, Zhou Weiqing felt his mind go blank.</p><br/><p>But in the eyes of the Goddess of Nature, everything had turned to grey.</p><br/><p>The overwhelming force of death instantly appeared in the Elven Queen\u2019s heart. Almost a moment later, a loud shriek exploded from the Goddess of Nature\u2019s throat. A strong green light wrapped her body into a large green crystal. At the same time, twelve cracks formed out of thin air not too far away from the crystallized body and twelve elderly figures appeared behind the crystal. Then, twelve rays of green light simultaneously entered the crystal.</p><br/><p><em>\u201cDing!\u201d </em></p><br/><p>The sound caused the Elf Tribe\u2019s sealed land to tremble, even causing the enclosed space around it to rattle.</p><br/><p>The handle of the Demon God Sword, which Zhou Weiqing was unable to take a good look at, seemed to disappear into thin air. At most, he could sense a grey shadow and the green crystal containing the Goddess of Nature gentle touch, before disappearing.</p><br/><p>Then, the Demon God summoned by Zhou Weiqing followed suit and disappeared into thin air, exposing all six of their bodies.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face drained of color. The string of fights may have happened very quickly, but they were rather complex to him. Ever since he reached the Heavenly Emperor-tier, this was the first time he had experienced such a great depletion. He almost could not withstand it.</p><br/><p>The crystal and the twelve figures in mid-air seemed to be frozen in place.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked unhappy. He could already guess that the Elven Queen must be at the stage of Heavenly God. Besides, the twelve figures that appeared behind her, at least four of them would be at the at the apex of the Heavenly Emperor Tier if they were not already Heavenly Emperors.</p><br/><p>The members of the Elf Tribe only reach adulthood by their hundredth year, and at one glance, one could tell that these elders already had one foot in their graves. How long had they lived for, to be at that age? The power of the Elf Tribe was far more terrifying than what Shangguan Xue\u2019er had described. At this moment, the strength depletion between him and his five wives was no small number. If this Elven Queen could still maintain her Goddess of Nature state, and continue her attacks, it is highly likely that he could only use the air nebula to escape as soon as possible. After all, he could not just sit here and await death.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart began a string of changes, the large crystal in the sky began to display a hint of change.</p><br/><p>One soft bursting noise was heard, but it came out of the twelve figures at the same time. Their bodies flew backward, and every one of them began spitting out grey-colored breaths. That\u2019s right, they were not spitting out blood, but grey breaths. The sight of it was certainly bizarre.</p><br/><p>Then came an ear-piercing, shattering noise. Cracks began appearing on the green crystal. That was a hundred foot tall, rhombus-shaped crystal! Imagine the mind-blowing shock they all had as they witnessed the thick, long, snake-like cracks appearing continuously.</p><br/><p>Finally, following a violent blast, numerous green lights turned into thick breaths of life had emitted into the air. A figure came into view in mid-air.</p><br/><p>It was no longer the silhouette of the Goddess of Nature, soaring ten feet high, but a six meter tall, dainty and exquisite girl with two transparent wings on her back.</p><br/><p>She had long ears, long aquamarine hair just like the Goddess of Nature, and dark blue eyes. Even her clothes were exactly alike. At one glance, she looked like a miniature version of the Goddess of Nature. Even her features were no different from the Goddess of Nature.</p><br/><p>Except, she now looked extremely unsightly \u2014 pale and white like a piece of paper, worse than how Zhou Weiqing looked. Her body swayed in the air, and the wings behind her expanded. This forced her to control herself from falling to the ground. Her beautiful, dark blue eyes were now filled with shock.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing heaved a large sigh of relief. Based on the current situation, it was obvious that the Elven Queen has suffered quite a substantial loss. Meanwhile, at the same time, a sense of pride rose spontaneously. After all, the opposition was at the stage of Heavenly God! Furthermore, it was not at the simple basic level either. In the end, she even summoned twelve Elf Tribe elders for help in order to forcibly block the Demon God Sword\u2019s attack. To top it off, he was only a Heavenly Jewel Master at the Heavenly Emperor Stage. To have achieved such a result in battle certainly deserves a sense of pride.</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing knew it himself. That Demon God Sword cannot be summoned whenever he wished. However, after experiencing the Demon God Sword\u2019s terrifying power, a flame was ignited in his heart. If, one day, he was truly able to control the power of the Demon God Sword, then what else would he be, besides invincible?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you? How could you possibly have control over the Demon God Sword? Not even the Heavenly Demon Sect Master would ever be able to do it.\u201d The Elven Queen\u2019s voice rang aloud. At the same time, she waved her fair hand in the air, and a scepter appeared in it. A faint green light appeared once again. It was just like she said, this was the Sealed Land of the Elf Tribe. It held a great amount of life energy. In one quick sweep, she enveloped herself and the twelve Elf Tribe elders within. It was clear for all to see, that a large amount of life energy was entering their bodies continuously. No one knew if it was to heal their wounds or to replenish their cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, it was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy that provided a rather large influence. If it were to be another Heavenly Jewel Master, he would never have been able to absorb the Natural Element in a place like this, especially when faced with the Elven Queen. Only Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy could utilize this stage and forcibly absorb it all.</p><br/><p>As for the Demon God summoned by Zhou Weiqing earlier on, it was not through the immediate usage of Star Energy, but also due to this parallel space. He wasn\u2019t sure of whether he could truly summon Star Energy in this parallel space, and use it for battle. So, he thought of the Demon God. After all, his cultivation base had now entered Heavenly Emperor stage, and would clearly have greater power in controlling the Demon God and the following battle had proved this. Except, unfortunately, he still had no way to truly control the Demon God into entering battle. Far from the Elven Queen\u2019s control over the Goddess of Nature.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Zhou Weiqing, hailing from Heavenly Bow Empire. Your Majesty, may we speak peacefully? As you can see as well, I may not be able to defeat you all, but, if we wish to leave, I believe you would not be able to stop us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cordial but independent voice rang throughout the vast space. At the same time, a faint, pure gold light illuminated from within his being, enveloping him and his five wives in its radiance.</p><br/><p>He had no choice but to release his Star Energy, for he was brazenly stealing the Natural Elements in the air from the Elven Queen, for his own recovery. Otherwise, if everyone on the opposing team were to achieve full recovery, and if his party members were still depleted, he may not be able to escape at all.</p><br/><p>Seeing the pure gold Star Energy surrounding Zhou Weiqing, the Elven Queen violently narrowed her pupils. She murmured, \u201cZhou Weiqing? Zhou Weiqing. This name is very familiar. I seem to have heard it before. You are\u2026 Could this be\u2026 Ah! I remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen began muttering to herself continuously, even Zhou Weiqing was unable to make sense of the matter. It was also this moment when the Elven Queen looked as if she had come to a realization, and her eyes, gazing upon Zhou Weiqing, softened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know Phelia?\u201d The Elven Queen\u2019s words shocked Zhou Weiqing at the same time.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stared at her in astonishment, \u201cOf course I do. She\u2019s my mother-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er could not contain herself, \u201cYour Majesty, you know my mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Elven Queen\u2019s expression glowed with warmth. She looked at Tian\u2019er and nodded, \u201cYou must be Tian\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er quickly nodded, staring at the Elven Queen with surprise, \u201cYou\u2019ve really met my mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen gently nodded her head. Gazing upon Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er, her eyes were filled with disbelief, \u201cYou actually managed to cultivate Saint Energy. This is simply unbelievable, and your cultivation base had even reached this stage. When I met Phelia a year ago, she only told me that you had a chance at finding a way to cultivate Saint Energy. I never expected this. I really never expected this at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, could you tell me where my mother is?\u201d Tian\u2019er asked with a hint of impatience.</p><br/><p>To any child, the loss of a mother\u2019s love at a young age is the greatest pain of all, and Tian\u2019er\u2019s longing for her mother\u2019s love was incomparably strong.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen gently shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I cannot tell you where she is. Even if I did, you would not be able to get there. However, since you now have Saint Energy, perhaps you can help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze shifted when he heard her say \u2018us\u2019, instead of referring to Phelia in particular.</p><br/><p>As she spoke, the Elven Queen led twelve sick-looking Elf Tribe elders and descended from the sky, landing in front of Zhou Weiqing and the rest.</p><br/><p>The oldest-looking Elf Tribe elder shuffled closely behind her and whispered, \u201cYour Majesty, the princess\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen shook her head and said, \u201cSince she is Phelia\u2019s daughter, she couldn\u2019t possibly have taken my daughter away. Besides, can\u2019t you all tell? This human, Zhou Weiqing has always shown mercy. He\u2019s never truly harmed any of our tribe members.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed bitterly, \u201cYes, Your Majesty. We may be here with a request, but we mean no harm. We have indeed seen the princess earlier on, I hope that you\u2019ll give us a chance to explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing as she was acquainted with his mother-in-law, Zhou Weiqing had to be courteous. Besides, the Elf Tribe\u2019s powers were far stronger than his estimation. If they really wished to risk their lives, they might not be able to defeat the powerful Elf Tribe. Zhou Weiqing did not truly have the ability to summon the powers of the Demon God Sword.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I thought she can\u2019t use skills any further?\u2019</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was pondering, the Blackness Attribute suddenly vanished without warning. When he saw Meng Xing again, he could not help but exclaim in shock, \u201cA transformation?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, the Meng Xing now was no longer the same as she was before.</p><br/><p>All of the clothes on the tall, slender body had completely disappeared. Instead, they were replaced by a layer of fine black scales. Upon closer inspection, the scales looked almost similar to the scales on her legendary armor set. What was most peculiar was that both of her eyes had turned a demonic red, similar to the eyes of the Blackfiend Dragon that Zhou Weiqing saw before.</p><br/><p>A pair of gigantic dragon wings were spread open widely behind her back. Right now, her body was entirely filled with a sense of power and allure and seemed to have grown a lot longer. A mask covered her face completely, only the demonic red eyes were exposed.</p><br/><p>At this moment, an arrow reached her all of a sudden. Meng Xing did not even try to evade the arrow. With a light \u2018ding\u2019, the scales on her body easily disintegrated Zhou Weiqing\u2019s arrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard! I won\u2019t let you off today!\u201d Even her voice seemed much colder than before. In a flash, her speed had doubled at least. Almost immediately, she appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing. The pair of hands that had already transformed into dragon claws proceeded to grab his shoulder directly,</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon Transformation. This was one of Meng Xing\u2019s biggest secret. Even the Supreme Elders did not possess this powerful skill.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon Transformation doubled her speed and power and tripled her defensive abilities. It was an extremely powerful transformation. At this time, she could not use any Consolidated and Storing Skills but it did not affect her from using her bloodline energy at all.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not even have time to utter a word. He had just enough time to put up his fists to stop Meng Xing\u2019s claws. However, it was obvious that his energy was not on par with Meng Xing who was under the effect of the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation at this moment. Like a bullet, his body was slammed backward with a loud bang.</p><br/><p>The wings behind Meng Xing flapped suddenly. In an instant, her body accelerated and powerful attacks hailed on his body like raindrops. It crashed down on him until he screamed out in pain again and again.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Meng Xing did not really intend to kill him. She did not fully unleash her power. Even though the attack that was raining on Zhou Weiqing was very painful, it was not that bad to the point that it would inflict serious injuries on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really want to kill me?\u201d He asked furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re audacious! You\u2019re wretched! Yes, I really want to kill you!\u201d Meng Xing\u2019s voice resonated ceaselessly. The attack on Zhou Weiqing did not seem to be slowing down at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fight till the end with you! Do you really think you\u2019re the only one who can transform?\u201d At this moment, a wave of extreme coldness suddenly erupted from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. Immediately. his palms were raised to meet her dragon claws.</p><br/><p>There was a loud crash. This time, Meng Xing was the one who got blasted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did his strength suddenly increase? The sealing skill hasn\u2019t expired yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, she saw Zhou Weiqing had undergone a transformation too.</p><br/><p>All of the clothes on him were completely ripped apart in the air. His entire body had grown several sizes bigger. The superfine and gorgeous yet full of devilish aura tiger tattoo was moving on his skin as if it was alive. A regal pattern that was printed on his forehead was radiating a strong domineering feeling. His eyes had also turned red in color. A pair of gigantic wings were spread out behind him. His entire body exuded a rich and intense grey Qi current. He raised his right leg slowly behind his body. Instantly, it suddenly turned into the shape of a hook.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-This is? He can transform too?\u201d Meng Xing could vaguely see a huge Heavenly Skill Image of a tiger looming behind him.</p><br/><p><em>Demonic Change. </em></p><br/><p>That was right. The transformation that Zhou Weiqing underwent was the Demonic Change, not the Dragon-Tiger Transformation.</p><br/><p>From Meng Xing\u2019s Blackfiend Dragon Transformation, he could clearly see that the Blackfiend Dragon bloodline flowed inside her body. As for his own dragon bloodline, he definitely could not display it just like that. This was because the dragon bloodline that he inherited was the Dragon Emperor Bloodline from Hui Yao. This bloodline did not belong to this mainland but to the Boundless Mainland instead. The Blackfiend Dragon had mentioned this before. If he suddenly exposed his Dragon Emperor Bloodline, wouldn\u2019t this be like telling everybody that he came from the Boundless Mainland? For this reason, he could only use the Demonic Change.</p><br/><p>Because of his Saint Energy\u2019s strength, Zhou Weiqing could easily split up his own transformation. The main boost of the Demonic Change was in the strength. It increased the strength by three folds. The defensive power increased as well, even though it was not as much as the boost by the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation. Of course, the Cold Perception that he possessed was not something that the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation had.</p><br/><p>In overall, in terms of boost, the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation was slightly inferior compared to the Demonic Change. Even so, the moment Zhou Weiqing unleashed his Demonic Change, it gave Meng Xing quite a shock. The eyes that were staring at her had a queer look in them.</p><br/><p>At this time, Meng Xing felt like she was looking at a huge treasure vault as she stared at Zhou Weiqing. It seemed like she could always dig out secrets from his body. And these secrets either showed he was a genius or had great power and strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat transformation is this?\u201d Puzzled, Meng Xing stared at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>He chuckled as he said, \u201cHave you forgotten that I have the Evil Attribute? Besides, this Evil Attribute of mine is from the first generation. Of course, it\u2019s a Demonic Change \u2013 A controllable Demonic Change. Have you heard of it? Well, anyway, do you think more highly of me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing curled her lips. She had to admit, Zhou Weiqing had given her many surprises.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith just that Demonic Change of yours, you really want to go against my Blackfiend Dragon Transformation?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, both their bodies suddenly trembled at the same time. Almost without hesitation, rays of dark golden light rose up into the air. It turned out that both of their sealing skills had reached the time limit at more or less the same time. Naturally, they immediately unleashed their Consolidated Equipment again.</p><br/><p>At least, from Meng Xing\u2019s point of view, the dark golden legendary armor suit coupled with their own transformations were the strongest power that they both could demonstrate right now.</p><br/><p>The moment they put on their Consolidated Equipment, both of their bodies charged forward almost simultaneously. Under the rapid boost of speed, they rushed forward to each other like lightning.</p><br/><p>None of them chose to use any skills. After a series of fierce collisions, no one was able to gain the upper hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, you\u2019re very strong! Much stronger than I expected!\u201d Slightly out of breath, Meng Xing stared at him.</p><br/><p>Both of them had used up a lot of their Heavenly Energy. Even though her Heavenly Energy supply was almost endless, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attacks always caused something peculiar to happen. Especially after he had cast his Demonic Change, his own energy continued to triple. That was a threefold increase of the original 64 folds increase by his Consolidated Equipment. Even though she could use her flexibility to dodge his attack as many times as possible, it still posed quite a great threat to her. Therefore, in a series of exchanges earlier, the Heavenly Energy that she had used up was far greater than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s.</p><br/><p>This power was just too crazy! Right now, she could only use a Sixth Jewel cultivation base but she had to fight against a strength that was at the Heavenly King-tier. How could she fight against him? Well, unless she exhausted his Heavenly Energy first.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cYou\u2019re the same! After all, you\u2019re still limiting your Heavenly Energy. Meng Xing, what do you think? Let us just call it a tie and consider today a friendly match!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing snorted coldly, \u201cIn your dreams! Do you think you\u2019ve won?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was saying that, she lifted her pair of dragon claws slowly. An intense ripple of Heavenly Energy suddenly exploded out of her body without any warning. It was still at the Sixth Jewel Tier but somehow, Zhou Weiqing had no idea why he could sense that something was not right this time.</p><br/><p>Indistinctly, he could see that Meng Xing\u2019s body had somewhat grown a little bigger than before. To be more precise, it looked like the legendary armor set on her body was slowly merging with her Blackfiend Dragon Transformation.</p><br/><p>\u2018What power is this?\u2019 Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes went wide as he thought to himself. He had never seen anybody use their own energy to merge with their Consolidated Equipment.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing stared at him coldly, \u201cThis is the second change of the Blackfiend Dragon Transformation \u2013 the Blackfiend Dragon True Entity. You should feel proud for being able to force me to unleash this ultimate skill of mine! I\u2019ll not lose! After I use the Blackfiend Dragon True Entity, the powers of my abilities will be doubled. In this state, even supposing my cultivation base is only at the Sixth Jewel, I can still withstand it even if I\u2019m facing a Heavenly King-tier master. Yes, your power is very strong but in front of my Blackfiend Dragon True Entity, you\u2019re still a tiny little ant. The Blackfiend Dragon True Entity allows me to temporarily possess the true power of a Blackfiend Dragon. Of course, it\u2019s still a Blackfiend Dragon with a cultivation base that\u2019s only at the Sixth Jewel but this is more than enough for me to deal with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she was talking to him, Meng Xing\u2019s body suddenly transformed and an intense Blackness Attribute aura kept gushing out from her body continuously. Her entire body was slowly transforming into an actual dragon \u2014 well, a miniature dragon.</p><br/><p>Had he not seen it with his own eyes, Zhou Weiqing would probably have a hard time believing this was all real. Even though he could transform to the second stage of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation as well, it was only some minor changes to his body. It was definitely not like Meng Xing where she could directly transform into a dragon for real.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing found the Mysterious Heavenly Palace to be even more mysterious. In this powerful Saint Land, how many other wonderful skills were out there?</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t wait anymore!\u2019 Zhou Weiqing thought to himself. He also did not want to lose this battle. The main reason was that he did not want to be beaten to a pulp by the other party.</p><br/><p>The reason why Meng Xing asked him out today was probably not as simple as wanting to test his ability. There must be some other things that prompted her to do this as well. If he was really defeated in this battle, not only would she probably look down on him, she would also very likely inflict serious injuries on him.</p><br/><p>A red light flashed across his eyes. Before Meng Xing could complete her Blackfiend Dragon True Entity Transformation, Zhou Weiqing proceeded to take action first. Like a lightning, he charged speedily towards her.</p><br/><p>As she stared at him, a look of disdain could be seen in her eyes before she snorted and said, \u201cIt\u2019s useless! During the process of my Blackfiend Dragon True Entity Transformation, my body enters a period of invulnerability. Unless your cultivation base is far stronger than my original cultivation base \u2014 at least the Heavenly Emperor-tier and above \u2013 you\u2019ll never be able to stop me from transforming! W-Wait! W-What are you d-doing?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

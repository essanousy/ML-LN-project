In that moment, she had felt a fatal threat to her life. At her cultivation level and power, for her to have such a feeling, it was clear what strength this attacker of theirs contained.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression had changed, pale and ashen in fright. His senses and perception were far beyond the ordinary, and when he had dragged down Shangguan Fei\u2019er, he was facing upwards. He had seen that silver light that had passed over them, and it was just too familiar to him indeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilver Emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s voice was filled with shock. Indeed, the silver light that passed over them in that flash was the figure of the Heavenly King Stage Heavenly Beast, the Silver Emperor, that Zhou Weiqing had Skill Stored from before! However, this Silver Emperor was smaller than the ones that he had Skill Stored from, but was just as fast and agile. Previously, that silver light had been it passing through with one of its three powerful skills, the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing also knew that Skill, but naturally the power when he used it compared to when the Silver Emperor used it was like the difference between heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er had said that there were no Heavenly King Stage Beasts in the mainland, then\u2026 what was that?! Zhou Weiqing was both shocked and enraged, but now was not the time for blame, and he immediately shouted out loud: \u201cAll of you, do not come here!\u201d As he shouted that, he held onto Shangguan Fei\u2019er hard, rolling swiftly to the side. Another silver light struck down to where they had been lying down, exploding in a loud bang, leaving a large, ten yard long hole in the ground. It was the Spatial Rend.</p><br/><p>Lin TianAo and the others heard Zhou Weiqing\u2019s instructions and stopped in their tracks, and at the same time, the silver light in the sky launched another attack at Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er.</p><br/><p>The Silver Emperor was just too fast. In such a critical moment of danger, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er activated their Legendary Set Consolidated Equipment at the same time.</p><br/><p>Two layers of dark gold light bubbles appeared almost simultaneously, causing the two of them to be shoved apart. The new incoming silver light flicked against their respective Consolidating Equipment God Protective Auras. Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s one gave a ear-piercing sound as it clashed, cracks forming all around it, but did not shatter. However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s one shattered almost instantly, and he had to make use of a Blink Skill to barely avoid getting destroyed by the silver light.</p><br/><p>So strong! Such power!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing paled in shock and fear, but his character was such that when he was in intense danger, he was better able to make full use of his power and abilities.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, a person who feared death so much was able to show much courage in the face of death; that was because, his most treasured life was being threatened, and he would fight with all his might to stay alive.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was such a person. At the same time as he Blinked away, his second Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura flickered and formed around him, along with the Demonic Change State. On the other side, Shangguan Fei\u2019er had sprang to her feet in a combat stance.</p><br/><p>The difference in their cultivation level showed right then. With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Heavenly Energy stage, he was only able to summon his Legendary Set Consolidated Equipment one piece by piece, while Shangguan Fei\u2019er instantly summoned all four of her God Tier Consolidated Equipment at the same time.</p><br/><p>The wings behind her back flapped hard, and her figure darted about like a bolt of lightning in mid air, fluttering about in a sort of rhythmic pattern, causing two illusory figures to form and charge towards the Silver Emperor.</p><br/><p>Another ear piercing explosion, and Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s body was slammed back down onto the ground, but at the same time, the Silver Emperor\u2019s next attack was sent soaring into the skies, disappearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not at the Heavenly King Stage yet, it\u2019s at the top level Zong Stage, on the verge of breaking through!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s voice rang out in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ear softly.</p><br/><p>That Silver Emperor was clearly angered by Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s blocking of its attack, and with a shrill bird-cry, it finally showed itself.</p><br/><p>The silvery white feathers glowed in the sunlight, as a brilliant silver light shone forth from its body, threatening to overwhelm even the bright sun.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud: \u201cCareful! It is about to unleash its ultimate Fusion Skill, the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend!\u201d As he said that, he did not hesitate to unleash his most powerful skill, and the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic Dragon Lady appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend was unleashed much faster than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dragon Silencing Seal, and before he could even prepare to do so, the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend descended upon them.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could also use the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend, and it had saved him or snatched victory for him against powerful enemies. This time, seeing it unleashed by the Silver Emperor with his own eyes, it just had a whole different feel about it.</p><br/><p>The Silver Emperor glowed a brilliant resplendent silver once more, leaving behind a black space behind it, and the air all around rushed towards that tear in the space. There was no sound at all, but every inch it moved, that terrifying pressure increased several fold. Zhou Weiqing was suspicious, how could this fellow not be at the Heavenly King Stage yet?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a huge shield flew in a diagonal motion from the side, blocking right in front of Shangguan Fei\u2019er. A loud clash, and the shield was shattered into bits, and far off at the side, blood spurted out from Lin TianAo\u2019s mouth. Even with his six-Jewel Assembly Set Shield,</p><br/><p>Even so, it had helped block the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend for a time.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s close combat skills were extremely powerful, and how could she let go of such an great opportunity? Jumping up in a flash, the wings behind her flapping hard, and her claws struck out at the silver light.</p><br/><p>The Silver Emperor was definitely one of the most powerful Heavenly Beasts amongst its level, mainly because its speed was just too fast. With the Silver Emperor Spatial Rend blocked momentarily, its body twisted to the side, the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce activating in a bright flash, its speed increasing wildly by three hundred percent, and it flew off towards Lin TianAo.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Beasts generally had stronger senses than humans, and it could clearly sense that there were many other humans at the other side, much weaker than these two troublesome ones over here. The Silver Emperor loved eating brains the most, especially human brains, and with easy food at the side, it would not waste the time and effort to clash with these two.</p><br/><p>However, just at the very instant it activated the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce, a purple red vortex appeared silently over its head even as it sped away, enveloping its entire body in that purple red light, causing its insane speed to slow down drastically.</p><br/><p>The Overlord Bow had appeared out of nowhere into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands, and a lightning fast arrow flew right through the purple red glow onto it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not plan for the arrow to actually hit, and just as the Silver Emperor dodged it swiftly, the arrow exploded, bearing two Skills, a Lightning Explosive Palm and the Absolute Delay!</p><br/><p>With the difference between Zhou Weiqing and this top level Zong Stage Beast, most of his Skills would not have any effect on it. However, those Skills with absolute effects were different, and the Dragon Silencing Seal and Absolute Delay were two such Skills indeed.</p><br/><p>No matter how fast the Silver Emperor maximum speed was, after being afflicted with the Dragon Silencing Seal and losing its Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce, it was considerably slowed, especially after being also inflicted with the Absolute Delay.</p><br/><p>At this time, Shangguan Fei\u2019er finally caught up to it, her claws glinting in the light as she clashed together with the Silver Emperor.</p><br/><p>The Silver Emperor\u2019s sheer power and terrifying strength was put out on display here. Despite being afflicted by both the powerful Dragon Silencing Seal and the Absolute Delay, just from its own raw power alone, it was able to block most of Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s attacks from her powerful Consolidated Claws. It was only because of the Absolute Delay causing its speed to slow drastically that she managed to strike it once, out of all her attacks, clashing against its back and tearing away a bunch of feathers.</p><br/><p>*Chitter* *Chitter* The Silver Emperor sensed that it was in danger, and at that moment, it did not plan on staying around.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing did not stay idle at the side. Although he knew that most of his skills would be useless against this high level beast, even just a tiny effect could turn the tides of battle. As such, he threw Control Skill after Control Skill at it\u2026 Fetters of Wind, Touch of Darkness, Curse of Doom\u2026 throwing them out so swiftly as if he did not know what the meaning of saving Heavenly Energy was. The vast numbers of Control Skills lit up against the little terror, powered by the Overlord Bow.</p><br/><p>Four seconds passed just so quickly, and the duration of the Absolute Delay ended. The Silver Emperor\u2019s speed rose back drastically to its usual. However, it was still caught by surprise by the sudden change, causing its defenses to slip momentarily. Shangguan Fei\u2019er immediately seized the opportunity, twisting in an almost impossible hundred degree turn in midair, her claws savagely smashing down onto the Silver Emperor\u2019s back. As if in a choreographed motion, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Overlord Bow, Twisting Bowstring Archery Skill powered arrow reached at the exact same time.</p><br/><p>This arrow was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s final attack, using up the last of his Heavenly Energy in doing so. He had long since calculated that the Silver Emperor would be momentarily disconcerted by the ending of the Absolute Delay and had prepared for this moment. At the same time, Shangguan Fei\u2019er also knew the timing of his Absolute Delay, and at that moment, they had been in a perfect rhythm.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had gained ten Socketing Scrolls in the Heavenly Jewel Island, and he had used one on his Overlord Bow. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to add more, but if there were too many sockets, it would greatly increase the drain on his Heavenly Energy when he used the Overlord Bow, which could be more of a detriment than gain, especially with his current cultivation level. Even so, with three Sockets and the number of powerful skills he had, the current Overlord Bow was already comparable to most ordinary Zong Stage Consolidated Equipment.</p><br/><p>With this arrow, Zhou Weiqing had imbued three Skills within. The first that activated was called Lightning Suffering, the fourth of his Lightning Attribute Skills that he had Stored in the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p><br/><p>The Lightning Suffering Skill. On striking an enemy, it would instantly release a number of extremely powerful lightning bolts, striking through the enemy, causing much damage and numbness at the same time. Of course, the number of Jewels the user had would determine the number of bolts.</p><br/><p>This was also a Heavenly King Stage Skill. Lightning Attribute Heavenly Beasts were considered rather rare, and if not for the Heavenly Jewel Island, Zhou Weiqing might never have been able to Store such a Skill.</p><br/><p>They could clearly see four powerful lightning bolts pierce through the Silver Emperor\u2019s body savagely. This Lightning Suffering Skill might seem like a powerful offensive Skill, but it was actually also a Control Skill as well, and as the numbness from the four bolts began to add up to the Silver Emperor, it was definitely not something to be dismissed easily.</p>\n</div>"}

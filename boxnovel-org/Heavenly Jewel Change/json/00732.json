With the assimilating effect of his Saint Energy, he braced himself with all his might.</p><br/><p>Had it not been the fact that the Dreadfiend Sea Naga hated him to the core and wanted to torture him, it would have unleashed a technique that was far more terrifying than this.</p><br/><p>In fact, the sea naga was in no hurry to kill him off. Instead, it wanted to slowly torture him and letting him fall into endless fear, little by little.</p><br/><p>The aura that a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse released was just too intimidating. It did not only come from its physical body but from the soul as well.</p><br/><p>All Zhou Weiqing could think of right now was the fact that his body would completely be crushed to powder by the water element if he even relaxed a little, not even leaving a tiny trace of his soul behind.</p><br/><p>It was all that he could do to resist the attack with all of his power.</p><br/><p>If he used the Saint Energy to activate the Ward of the Demon God, he definitely could solve the pressing matter on hand right now, but that would be his last resort. With his cultivation base, he would have to expend a huge amount of Saint Energy to summon the Demon God\u2019s Mirror Illusion. On top of that, the level of the Demon God\u2019s Mirror Illusion that was summoned was not something he could easily control.</p><br/><p>If it turned out similar to the previous time where it appeared to be powerful to the point that it could even hold all elements between the heavens and earth completely in awe, and yet could not even withstand a single attack in real life, it would be meaningless to him. The Dreadfiend Sea Naga only needed to destroy the Demon God\u2019s Mirror Illusion before it continued pressuring him again. By then, his chances of escape would be even slimmer.</p><br/><p>For this reason alone, Zhou Weiqing was actually waiting and waiting for the Dreadfiend Sea Naga to send him a fatal blow. If he were to summon the Demon God at that time, there might be a chance for him to escape after all.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s follow-up measures were not limited to this only one plan. Out of absolute necessities, he still had other several unique ways to deal with the situation that he was facing right now. Therefore, even though he was facing such a terrible pressure, he was still not panicking at all. Opportunities would always present themselves at any time anyway.</p><br/><p>As the tremendous pressure externally kept growing, Zhou Weiqing did not even need to control the Saint Energy inside his body. It was already operating by itself inside him, in the face of immense pressure.</p><br/><p>The 36 major Death Acupuncture Points\u2019 Energy Whirlpool had fully integrated and was operating at a jaw-dropping speed.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, it was not like the intimidating pressure from the outer world was entirely unhelpful to him. At the very least, Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel that in the face of this colossal pressure, he could almost touch the threshold of the 38th-tier of the Saint Energy. It was possible for him to experience a breakthrough anytime now.</p><br/><p>Of course, with the gap between him and the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, it would probably be of not much use even if he had broken through to the 38th-tier Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, a sudden detonation resonated from the sealed-off area at this moment and it was apparent that his detonation was not caused by the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. The shock itself did not matter much. However, the pressure from the domineering water element that had already put a great pressure on Zhou Weiqing seemed to have suddenly doubled without warning.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga wanted to torture him so it did not use his full power immediately. Zhou Weiqing was also waiting for his opportunity to arrive. As for the detonation that had happened rather abruptly, it was too sudden to the point that he did not even manage to respond at that very instant.</p><br/><p>What was this pressure, that had already pushed his endurance close to its limit to suddenly double again? All Zhou Weiqing could do to quickly summon the Ward of the Demon God, by using his Saint Energy as he would be swallowed up by the horrendous pressure the very next moment.</p><br/><p>A bloody red figure penetrated the intense water element. The long, slender Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear transformed into a bloody red bolt of lightning as it headed straight toward the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, piercing directly through it.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue who was dressed in a full Blackfiend Dragon Set turned up immediately. She was the one who caused the violent detonation just now.</p><br/><p>Even though she did not have any back-up from the Blackfiend Dragon, there was something that made her different from Zhou Weiqing \u2014 she was a true Heavenly Emperor Master through and through. Not only that, she was wearing a full set that consisted of eleven pieces of high-grade Consolidated Equipment.</p><br/><p>Previously, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga that was more formidable even refused to touch the almighty Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear, let alone this one right here.</p><br/><p>The humongous body leaped away all of a sudden. Rays of blue light blasted out from the ten spikes behind the naga before they gathered in the sky and gathered towards the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear, blocking the attack in a brutal manner.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue was not Zhou Weiqing after all. With her legendary armor set, the impact was not at all that bad though the water element blockade had an impact on her.</p><br/><p>The force of the high-grade legendary armor set did not lie solely in its appealing appearance. A legendary armor set that was made up of eleven pieces of equipment was already the most powerful presence in this world.</p><br/><p>In the Boundless Mainland, though the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord, Xue Aotian was powerful and almighty, the Heavenly Snow Mountain was still not able to become the first in the ranks of the top five Saint Lands in the Boundless Mainland. Why was that so?</p><br/><p>This was all because of the Boundless Infinitum Set that belonged to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace! Even though the God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set was extremely formidable, the gap between them was still obvious if it were to be compared to the Boundless Infinitum Set. Thanks to the Boundless Infinitum Set, Shangguan Tianyang who was at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Emperor-tier was not able to defeat the Heavenly Snow Mountain Mountain Lord, he could resist all of the attacks directed at him.</p><br/><p>Even though Dongfang Hanyue had not reached the same level as someone who was at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Emperor-tier, the succession of her predecessor\u2019s strength coupled with her efforts in cultivation had managed to let her enter the Upper Stages of the Heavenly Emperor-Tier. If they were on land now, it would not be a problem for her to go up against the Dreadfiend Sea Naga that had just broken through to the Heavenly God-tier. As the Mysterious Heavenly Palace master, she was not that easily defeated.</p><br/><p>Before this, when she was recalling the memory of her and Zhou Weiqing on the beach, she suddenly felt dramatic energy ripples on the sea. Right away, she understood that he might have encountered some troubles so she rushed over quickly.</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, good people will be rewarded. Had Zhou Weiqing never chosen to help treat and restore Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s body and cultivation base, she would never have been able to come to his rescue in her most optimum state.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear\u2019s bloodcurdling aura melted the pressure that the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was imposing on Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, a strange change suddenly took place within his body.</p><br/><p>Both Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes were tightly shut and his entire body was trembling slightly. On his Ringless Ground Purging Set, a distinctive grey light could be seen, making him look like a crystal that was glowing and converging continuously. It was obvious that the energy ripples on his body were awfully unstable.</p><br/><p>Of course, Dongfang Hanyue did not know that it was because of the intimidating pressure earlier that had cause Zhou Weiqing to become like this. She was the one who initiated it. At this time, she also had no time to ask about his conditions. Instead, she could only give him a look of concern before she dove down and launched a crushing attack on the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.</p><br/><p>Prior to that, even though she was aided by the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s power while she was battling it out with the other Dreadfiend Sea Naga, the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s most important role was to suppress the Dreadfiend Sea Naga in an imposing manner and be the main decoy in the fight against it. However, in truth, Dongfang Hanyue was the actual weapon that was going to be used to attack.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear\u2019s main purpose was purely for assault. Her Blackfiend Dragon Set was best in its attacking prowess as well. If one were to talk about pure attacking power, even the Full Boundless Infinitum Set might not stand a chance against her Blackfiend Dragon Set.</p><br/><p>Apart from that, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga before her had only just entered the Heavenly God-tier. It was far too weak compared to its senior. On top of that, its senior had died in the hands of Dongfang Hanyue. How could it possibly not feel the slightest ounce of fear in its heart? In the state of one\u2019s waxes and wanes, under Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s endless ferocious attacks, it was forced to take a defensive stance.</p><br/><p>In the previous battle against the much stronger Dreadfiend Sea Naga, Dongfang Hanyue had managed to gain more experience in defeating this creature. Her cultivation base had also elevated after the battle of her limits. On top of that, coupled with the improvement Zhou Weiqing gave to her body by using his Saint Energy, the current Dongfang Hanyue had an increase in her overall strength compared to the olden days. Right now, she had found this newfound increase to be very handy when she launched her attacks. Not only that, she was shocked to discover a whirlpool that looked like a silver galaxy in her Dantian. Although she could not produce the same strange Saint Energy as Zhou Weiqing could, it was obvious that her absorption of the Atmospheric Energy had sped up significantly now with its presence in her body.</p><br/><p>In fact, compared to the Blackfiend Dragon, Dongfang Hanyue had a greater advantage when dealing with the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Her advantage relied on the fact that her Elemental Jewel did have the Water Attribute imbued within. This allowed her to be more at ease in her fight in . the sea compared to those who did not have the Water Attribute. Right now, with the help of the Saint Energy whirlpool, her absorption of the water element around her was much faster; greatly improving her continuous combat capabilities. Even Zhou Weiqing did not come to possess such an advantage.</p><br/><p>Although in overall strength, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was still slightly inferior to that of Dongfang Hanyue. She had managed to find its weakness in a rather straightforward manner \u2014 which was why it was afraid of dying.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue was extremely clever. When the two Dreadfiend Sea Naga appeared at the same time, it was because the one in front of her right now was so frightened by Zhou Weiqing as he was the one who caused the death of its comrade. At the time, it could certainly take a gamble by attacking Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Demon God\u2019s Illusion but it did not do so in the end. Why was that? Well, it was because it was scared of dying, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>For this reason, right now when she was launching her attack, she was using techniques that would cause destruction to both sides. She did not even bother to set up her own defenses and instead, she went to great lengths for each of her attacks. She made no effort to protect herself, as she just wanted to inflict injuries on the enemy.</p><br/><p>As a result, even though the Dreadfiend Sea Naga had greater overall strength compared to Dongfang Hanyue, it was completely beaten to a pulp and was backed to the corner by her attacks. There were several occasions where it was not so careful and got slashed by the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear, leaving deep scars on its body.</p><br/><p>Be that as it may, these scars were the ones that triggered the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s ferocity.</p><br/><p>Without warning, its tremendous body came to a halt in the water as it blasted up all of its spikes. Thousands of intense blue rays shot up into the sky, not just targeted towards Dongfang Hanyue, but at Zhou Weiqing who was floating abnormally in the air as well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

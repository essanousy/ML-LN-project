He will surely fail.\u2019 The two God Tier Masters had the same thoughts. However, would Zhou Weiqing really fail?</p><br/><p>The answer was a definite yes.</p><br/><p>Before the consolidating brush in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands had twisted twice and before he even completed the first stroke, deviations had appeared.</p><br/><p>As mentioned previously, any mistakes even as fine as hairs would cause the entire thing to fail. Besides, the God Tier Master Level Consolidated Equipment Scroll that was being made by Zhou Weiqing used strokes that were finer than strands of hair. The entire scroll needed thousands of these brush strokes to be completed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Failed. And so quickly too. I knew that he couldn\u2019t be a God Tier Master.\u2019 The two widened their eyes at the same time. They did not know why but they both felt relief in their hearts. Perhaps subconsciously, they did not want to believe that a 25-year-old with only a Five Jewels cultivation base could be a genius at the God Tier Master level.</p><br/><p>However, they only managed to heave half a sigh of relief before their bodies tensed up again.</p><br/><p>At the moment Zhou Weiqing made the mistake, a strange scene unfolded in front of their eyes. A strange insect-like shadow appeared behind him. Strange energy emanated from it, causing everything in the room to be warped.</p><br/><p>What was even stranger was that, following the emergence of the large transparent insect and the distortion, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body started emitting a silvery-white light immediately after.</p><br/><p>Everything wound back to a few moments ago. Although it only returned by a few seconds in time, it went back to the time before Zhou Weiqing made the mistake.</p><br/><p>The old man could no longer stay calm or constrict his own aura. He stood up in shock as he blurted out, \u201cThe Time Attribute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to him, the woman was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>With their cultivation base, how could they not see what Zhou Weiqing had done? Only the Time Attribute could have such an effect! Although they did not know what technique Zhou Weiqing had used, he had clearly used a technique to turn back time. He rewound time back to just before he made a mistake with his Consolidating Brush before continuing from there.</p><br/><p>\u2018It can even be done this way\u2019</p><br/><p>At this moment, the two God Tier Masters realized that their understanding of the creation of Consolidated Equipment Scrolls had been completely subverted.</p><br/><p>It was not just them. Even Shangguan Bing\u2019er who came with Zhou Weiqing was equally shocked.</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Bing\u2019er first arrived, she was very nervous because she knew Zhou Weiqing best. She knew that he had never made a Consolidated Equipment Scroll before, so how could it be possible for him to be a God Tier Master? After arriving, although she was not able to judge the strength of the two God Tier Masters, she could sense that their cultivation base was much higher than hers and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s. Under such circumstances, if Zhou Weiqing was unable to pass the test, it would be difficult for them to leave this place, let alone obtain the Spatial Teleportation Stone.</p><br/><p>Had it not been because of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s constant reassurance that he could pass the test, she would never have agreed to him coming here.</p><br/><p>However, over time, Shangguang Bing\u2019er became increasingly shocked with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s performance. She was not surprised about the Unity of Heaven And Man because she knew the secret behind. However, when Zhou Weiqing started preparing the Consolidating Ink, she realized her understanding of this little fatty was really far off.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing was extremely focused. Although he was not particularly handsome, in the eyes of women, men that were completely focused on what they were doing were the most handsome.</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Bing\u2019er witnessed that scene earlier, she finally understood why Zhou Weiqing said he could make God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. It looked like Zhou Weiqing\u2019s trump card was the Time Attribute. However, Shangguan Bing\u2019er knew that Zhou Weiqing was actually relying on the Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>On their way to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, Shangguan Bing\u2019er had naturally gotten a grasp of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s abilities. She thought to herself, \u2018Did Zhou Weiqing just use the highest leveled skill from the Time Attribute, Time Reversal?\u2019</p><br/><p>This skill had once saved Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s life so Shangguan Bing\u2019er remembered it clearly. In normal circumstances, Time Reversal would bring the user back one hour in time. With some difficulty, the user could control the time better or return back slightly further in time. Furthermore, after using Time Reversal, the user would not be able to control the flow of the reversed time, nor could they alter what followed after reversing time.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing had done just that. Undoubtedly, it was because Zhou Weiqing had used the Saint Energy to cast Time Reversal. The originally useless God Tier skill had now evolved into something that defied natural order.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was not a God Tier Master, but with his Time Reversal skill, he could slowly make a God Tier Master Level Consolidated Equipment Scroll. So what if he made a mistake? If he made a mistake, he could just go back in time and attempt it again and again. As long as there was some improvement each time, it would eventually be completed.</p><br/><p>As for the consumption of Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing only needed a miniscule bit to maintain the Time Reversal. With his cultivation base, he could keep it up even if he only had Five Jewels instead of Nine.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Fatty. You are really too smart.\u2019 At this moment, Shangguan Bing\u2019er eyes were full of admiration. Her Little Fatty was too smart. Obviously, he had already planned for all this when he claimed to be a God Tier Master.</p><br/><p>While Zhou Weiqing continued on, the two God Tier Masters were stupefied. They obviously felt that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s actions were shameless. However, he had the Time Attribute!</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this? This is an innate gift. This is definitely a heavenly talent!\u2019 they thought to themselves.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had utilized the Wind, Space, and Time Attributes. With those three Great Attributes combined, it meant that the most powerful and gifted God Tier Master was born.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing first came into contact with the Consolidated Equipment Scroll through Huyan Aobo. When the man found out that Zhou Weiqing had gathered those three Attributes, he was pleasantly surprised.</p><br/><p>Huyan Aobo might have been pleasantly surprised, but the two God Tier Masters from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace felt nothing but pure shock at the discovery.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, they were unable to recognize the Time Reversal that Zhou Weiqing had demonstrated. Even if they recognized it, they would not consider it as being the same Time Reversal.</p><br/><p>In this set time that Zhou Weiqing turned back time, he was in full control of it. If the skill was used in the midst of a battle, the results would be terrifying.</p><br/><p>What they didn\u2019t know was that for this absolute control over time, even with Saint Energy, the most Zhou Weiqing could only rewind time was by five seconds. Additionally as Shangguan Bing\u2019er thought, it did not require a lot of Saint Energy. However the consumption of Spiritual Energy was significant and had been out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expectations as well.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Zhou Weiqing was not really a Five Jewel Master but a Nine Jewel Master. His Spiritual Energy was also far above the reserves of an ordinary person. Under these circumstances, Zhou Weiqing could still continue crafting the Consolidated Equipment Scroll.</p><br/><p>As time passed, sweat began to form on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head, but the sweat was unable to drip onto the Consolidating Paper. There was already a layer of spatial vibration above the Consolidating Paper. Anything that fell on it would be bounced away.</p><br/><p>Line after line, stroke after stroke, Zhou Weiqing continued drawing. It was the first time Zhou Weiqing had been so serious and persistent in making a Consolidated Equipment Scroll. What he was making was the Ringless Ground Purging Set that he was most familiar with. Moreover, it was the set he needed the most, the seventh set.</p><br/><p>His cultivation base had already reached Nine Jewels. However, he only had five Ringless Ground Purging Sets. Including the Overlord Bow, he would only have six Consolidated Equipment sets. If he had one more Ringless Ground Purging Set, it meant his cultivation base could continue to surge and his strength would be doubled.</p><br/><p>Once his power doubled up again, Zhou Weiqing felt he would be able to face a strong Heavenly King Stage enemy, perhaps even an enemy at the maximum level of the Heavenly King Stage.</p><br/><p>As for the Heavenly Emperor Stage, he had not thought about it, nor did he wish to try\u2026</p><br/><p>Time continued to pass by. When Zhou Weiqing initially arrived, it was still morning. Currently, the sky had turned dark.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s rosy face had turned a little paler, but the determination in his eyes never wavered.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the scroll-making process had already arrived at the final stage. The Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body continued to revolve without being consumed much. Even though not much was consumed, he felt like his Soul Energy was being depleted. The consumption of Spiritual Energy was giving him a splitting headache. If he had not been tested over 10 times by the Immortal Deity Technique, his willpower would not have been strong enough for him to last this long.</p><br/><p>The process of creating a God Tier Master Level Consolidated Scroll could be paused, but it must never be interrupted. Otherwise, all of the efforts would be in vain. This was also one of the reasons why making a God Tier Master Level Consolidated Scroll required the strength of a Heavenly King Master.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

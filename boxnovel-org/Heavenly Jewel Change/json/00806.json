The ancestry of its Evil Attribute was still able to make the other four Great Saint Lands feel dread and fear. It had never crossed their minds that the Demonic Emperor Wu Yueyun would pass on his Heavenly Demon Sect to a junior like Zhou Weiqing. In their minds, this was completely impossible.</p><br/><p>Everyone once again focused their gaze on Zhou Weiqing. Fen Tian remarked with a tone full of doubt, \u201cPeerless Sect. This is my first time hearing this name. What does this boy have to his name that enables him to become a Saint Land Lord? Brother Long, I think the real master of the Peerless Sect thing should be nobody else but you. How could you allow your disciple to make a fool of himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya swept a cold glance at Fen Tian, \u201cMy disciple? Making a fool of himself? Be careful not to bite your own tongue while you\u2019re talking, Fen Tian. You were still in your mother\u2019s womb when I ran the world, you know. What\u2019s wrong with my disciple becoming a Saint Land Lord? Not only did he become a Saint Land Lord, he\u2019ll become the best Saint Land Lord in the entire world. Just you wait and see. The truth will be revealed through the battles later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just that one sentence \u2014 the best Saint Land Lord in the entire world \u2014 from Long Shiya seemed to have touched the nerves of the other four Saint Lands. The gazes that were trained on him turned hostile instantly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled, \u201cNow, the Peerless Sect is qualified to join the Grand Tournament, isn\u2019t it? If any one of you still find it unacceptable, I don\u2019t mind if you see us as the Heavenly Demon Sect. We merely changed our Sect Master after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian scoffed, \u201cThe Heavenly Demon Sect? Even the Heavenly Demon Sect is unqualified to join the Grand Tournament! Don\u2019t you know that the Heavenly Demon Sect has already been cut out from the list?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing continued smiling as he looked at Fen Tian, \u201cJust now Brother Gu said that the name \u2018Saint Land\u2019 is self-proclaimed by virtue of strength. It shouldn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the Peerless Sect or the Heavenly Demon Sect, why can\u2019t we become a Saint Land if our strength is mighty enough? I\u2019ve no objections if the Hell Lord Fen Tian wants to give us some pointers. In any case, there are many members of the Blood Red Hell who have really gone to hell with my help.\u201d</p><br/><p>A chilling look that could kill flashed across Fen Tian\u2019s eyes. However, instead of stepping forward to lash out against Zhou Weiqing, he turned to the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue Ao\u2019tian and said in a deep voice, \u201cBrother Snow, the Grand Tournament is held at your Heavenly Snow Mountain this time. You\u2019re the master of the Heavenly Snow Mountain so naturally, you\u2019re the chairman of the Grand Tournament as well. What are your thoughts on this matter? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s against the rule to have a Saint Land appearing out of nowhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could not help but be somewhat impressed after listening to Fen Tian\u2019s words. It seemed like the Blood Red Hell excelled not only in their strength but in terms of scheming and mind games too.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian cast a glance at Fen Tian before he replied, \u201cFen Tian, perhaps you still haven\u2019t fully got a grip on reality. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s my son-in-law. Didn\u2019t you hear him earlier? A Saint Land\u2019s existence completely lies in its strength. Since my son-in-law has already brought his people here, this shows the amount of confidence that he has in his sect. Brother Long has always been an elder brother whom I admire. With him and Sect Leader Wu here, I believe they\u2019re powerful enough to call themselves a Saint Land.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun from Love Valley frowned slightly as he chimed in, \u201cHeavenly Snow Mountain Lord, this does seem to be a little against the rule. What do you think, Brother Tianyang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang replied nonchalantly, \u201cAs long as their strength is mighty enough, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with having an extra Saint Land. Since the Blood Red Hell is the most upset with the Peerless Sect, why don\u2019t you send somebody from your sect to inspect their ability and see?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fentian narrowed his eyes as he snorted, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll send out a disciple. As long as there\u2019s a disciple who can defeat my follower, we from Blood Red Hell will also agree to them participating in the Grand Tournament this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, he waved his hand. A middle-aged man who was in his forties immediately walked out from behind him. This man was not too tall but he had long and slender arms. The bones on his hands appeared thick and big, and it gave off a ghastly feeling. His eyes that were slightly yellow exuded undisguised viciousness as he glared at the Peerless Sect.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue scoffed coldly. Just as he was about to take a step forward, he was immediately stopped by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand, \u201cDeputy Lord, the Blood Red Hell said that they want to test the true strength of our Peerless Sect\u2019s disciples. You\u2019re a top-level official so just take a break by the side. Ling Dang, have a go with this Blood Red Hell master. Remember to show some mercy, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>A person who was standing in the back and was dressed in a blue cape that covered the face instantly walked out after hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words. Judging by that delicate body figure, it was clearly a girl.</p><br/><p>She gracefully walked forward and did not exude any imposing manner from her body. However, she seemed to have already arrived at the center of the Summit Platform of the Heavenly Snow Mountain with just a single step.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell powerhouse sneered as he watched the blue-clad woman who was called Ling Dang by Zhou Weiqing, \u201cLook at that attire that fully conceals everything. You don\u2019t even dare to show your face? Oh, don\u2019t tell me this is an old witch who\u2019s so ugly that she can\u2019t even bear to show her face to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she had the body of a young lady, it was obvious that somebody who was able to come all the way here to this venue had to be of some age already. It was quite reasonable for that Blood Red Hell powerhouse to call her an old witch.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing almost burst out laughing the moment he heard the remark. He could not help but thought to himself, \u2018What an unlucky bastard this man from Blood Red Hell is!\u2019</p><br/><p>When Ling Dang heard the man\u2019s remark, her body trembled a little for a moment. It was apparent that her emotion had been strongly ruffled at that moment. She gradually lifted her head up. All that everyone could see other than the cloak that was covering her head was another blue mask underneath it that covered her entire face. It only exposed a pair of beautiful turquoise-colored eyes. However, her eyes were completely filled with a sense of chill at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start,\u201d Ling Dang\u2019s cold voice resonated in the air. Instead of giving a reply to her opponent\u2019s earlier remark, she directly lifted up her right hand.</p><br/><p>Her movement was not fast, and she had no intention of putting on her Consolidated Equipment. The palm that was stretched out was fair and slender, and her fingers that were as delicate as spring onions looked like they were carved from a flawless jade. Still without even a hint of an imposing manner, and there were no energy ripples from her, she thrust her hand out in front of her chest and charged towards the Blood Red Hell powerhouse.</p><br/><p>In truth, Fen Tian had his own reason sending out this man of his. This ferocious looking middle-aged man was actually in his eighties. Although he had not reached the Heavenly Emperor Tier yet, he at least possessed a cultivation base at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly King Tier. Previously, Fen Tian had already made his intentions very clear. He wanted to examine the Peerless Sect\u2019s disciples\u2019 strength on behalf of all the Saint Lands, or in another word, the underlying true force of the Peerless Sect. If the person who joined the fight from the Peerless Sect turned out to be either Long Shiya or Wu Yueyun, then the Peerless Sect would no doubt lose their prestige. At that time, Fen Tian would be able to drive them out of the Grand Tournament of Saint Land without any problem. On the other hand, if the Peerless Sect really did send their disciple out, he was certain that this Maximum Level Heavenly King-tier powerhouse from his Blood Red Hell would most certainly win the fight. A Maximum Level Heavenly King-tier powerhouse who possessed the Destruction Energy could still win the battle even if he came across a Heavenly Emperor-tier master. Fen Tian doubted they had any Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse left in their sect anyway.</p><br/><p>However, in many cases, a dream was always beautiful but reality often turned out very differently.</p><br/><p>When the Blood Red Hell man who was dressed in red saw Ling Dang thrusting a palm towards him, he did not lower his guard. Crimson flames erupted from his body instantly. A strong and destructive willpower filled with a calamitous aura could be felt. Instantly, his eight pieces of Consolidated Equipment sparkled with brilliance as they merged together to form a complete set and appeared on his body.</p><br/><p>Eight pieces of God Tier Master Consolidated Equipment Set \u2014 this could also be considered as a legendary armor set.</p><br/><p>However, while he was preparing his equipment set, the dark red flame around his body was suddenly put out under everybody\u2019s stunned gaze. In the next second, the red-clad man was suddenly sent flying backward with a wretched wail as he crashed into the rest of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Fen Tian was taken aback. He instinctively extended his right hand to catch that man. However, in the next moment, a loud explosion sounded followed by a mess of flesh and blood that suddenly appeared before his eyes.</p><br/><p>That Blood Red Hell powerhouse that Fen Tian had faith in had been blown into pieces in mid-air. He turned into fragments that scattered all around the place. Suddenly at this moment, another crimson red flame reappeared again. However, the one being destroyed was not Ling Dang from Peerless Sect but the man from the Blood Red Hell himself. Under the crimson flame, the mess of flesh and blood turned into flying ash as it scattered everywhere.</p><br/><p>The hand that Ling Dang thrust out made a grab in the air. The Nucleus Core of the Red Blood Hell powerhouse instantly flashed, and in a blink of an eye, vanished into thin air without a trace.</p><br/><p>From the beginning till the end, the entire process of the battle was just too fast. It was so fast that almost everybody could not make out what was happening.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Ling Dang strode back to the Peerless Sect side calmly and quietly when the battle was over. She returned to her standby position. The entire mountain top of Heavenly Snow Mountain became so quiet that even a pin drop could be heard.</p><br/><p>Even the two Shangguan brothers \u2014 Tianyang and Tianyue who had already known beforehand that the Peerless Sect had returned to this place and had known part of the Peerless Sect\u2019s true strength was completely taken aback with astonishment. On the other hand, the rest of the Saint Land Lords had all sorts of different expressions plastered on their faces.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun from Love Valley was completely astounded. Until this moment, he still could not believe the scene that had just unfolded in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>The astonished look on Xue Aotian was even more exaggerated than Shangguan Tianyang. This was because after Ling Dang had made her move, he had caught some of her energy fluctuations. He realized that if he had been the one to receive the blow earlier, he did not have the confidence that he would be able to fully retreat. As for Fen Tian, his eyes were entirely glazed with coldness. It was so cold that it was bloodcurdling. He stared coolly at Ling Dang, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that such an ace would be hidden in the Peerless Sect. May I ask who is this ace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian was not angered by the death of his disciple. He was so calm that even Zhou Weiqing could not help but lift his eyebrow slightly as he smiled, \u201cLing Dang\u2019s a member of my Peerless Sect. There\u2019s nothing else to say other than this. I wonder how did your inspection go, Hell Lord? My Peerless Sect is strong enough to enter the Grant Tournament of the Saint Lands now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian returned Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze. Zhou Weiqing suddenly realized that his gaze seemed to have become much darker than before. He could not help but be slightly stunned by the look that Fen Tian gave him. As quickly as it appeared, Fen Tian\u2019s gaze immediately returned to normal. To Zhou Weiqing\u2019s surprise, he actually nodded his head and said, \u201cSince you\u2019re strong enough, naturally you\u2019re eligible to join the Grant Tournament of the Saint Lands. We from the Blood Red Hell have no objection to that.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

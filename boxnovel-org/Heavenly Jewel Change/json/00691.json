Even though they were traveling in such a comfortable carriage, this would affect their cultivation and training. Zhou Weiqing was close to breaking through to 37-tier Saint Energy, therefore he would naturally not let go of this precious opportunity here.</p><br/><p>Under the protection of Er Chun and the others, apart from Ubataar City, they would travel straight to the center of the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. According to Er Chun, it would take 15 to 20 days to get to Heavenly City.</p><br/><p>He took really good care of Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er throughout the entire journey. He would feed them with delicious food from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er enjoyed the food and the beautiful scenery as they spent the rest of their time practicing. Traveling in the carriage was much more comfortable than traveling in the Neptune.</p><br/><p>In order to send them to their location in the fastest possible time, Er Chun and the rest barely had any time to rest because they were constantly on the road. Once in a while, they would stop at a checkpoint to change the horses.</p><br/><p>It did not affect Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er much. However, it was tiring for the Heavenly Jewel Masters who were protecting them. Thanks to their cultivation, they were able to hold up pretty well.</p><br/><p>Using just 14 days, they arrived at their destination. \u201cMaster, we\u2019re entering Heavenly City soon.\u201d Er Chun spoke from the outside of the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zhou Weiqing gave a short response as he flipped the curtain aside to look out of the window. He could see the skyline of the city. Compared to Zhongtian City, Heavenly City was much smaller let alone compare to the unique existence of the Heavenly Jewel Island. However, compared to most of the cities that he had been to, it could still be considered a big city, similar in structure to Fei Li City.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had been a little annoyed for the past few days. He could feel that his Saint Energy was on the verge of breaking through when he arrived at the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. But during his cultivation in the past few days, he felt as though he was stuck in a bottleneck as he did not manage a breakthrough. He started to miss the days when he was practicing the Immortal Deity Technique. Although it was hard, the speed of breaking through was fast.</p><br/><p>Still, he had been cultivating diligently even though there were no signs of a breakthrough yet. Most Importantly, there was no set cultivation method for this Saint Energy, so he had no idea how he could break through to the next level. All he could do was to continue cultivating. It was just the first tier of Saint Energy since he entered the Ninth Jewel, and yet, it was already so difficult to breakthrough. Naturally, his mind wandered toward the difficulty of forming a Saint Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>Although he was annoyed while he was troubled by it, there was nothing that he could do. Shangguan Bing\u2019er had comforted him a few times over this matter. After all, he was already at the Ninth Jewel. It was the same for any Jewel Master. The path of cultivating beyond this tier would definitely slow down eventually. Otherwise, why would the number of Ninth Jewel Heavenly Jewel Masters outnumber the Heavenly King Masters?</p><br/><p>Er Chun got closer on his horse and said to Zhou Weiqing, \u201cMaster, would you prefer to head directly to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace or would you prefer to rest somewhere else first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stared at him as he responded, \u201cWhy would we head to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace right now? It\u2019s not the time for the finals, wouldn\u2019t it be bad to enter so casually?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re a God Tier Master, why would you even join the Mysterious Heavenly Selection finals?\u2019 Er Chun thought to himself but he did not dare to contradict Zhou Weiqing. Since they had already arrived at Heavenly City, Er Chun was close to completing his mission, and with that, he nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Upon entering Heavenly City, they checked into a luxurious hotel. Er Chun did not dare to rest as he ordered his men to protect Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er in the hotel while he went to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>The luxurious room was quite spacious at 200 square meters. The amenities were sophisticated as well. Zhou Weiqing leaned on the soft leather couch while he was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked out the window. This place was a Human World after all. There weren\u2019t many places that were that different compared to the Boundless Mainlands.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er turned around and asked Zhou Weiqing, \u201cLittle Fatty, what do we do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the bright sunlight, she was bathed in a golden light. Zhou Weiqing could not help but be mesmerized by her as he gestured for her to come over.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er walked to the couch and fell into his arms. Zhou Weiqing spoke to her in a low voice. \u201cBing\u2019er, we\u2019ll have to be careful whenever we talk. I don\u2019t have any specific plans. For now, we\u2019ll just have to play it by ear. Our priority is to get into the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked at him doubtfully. \u201cIn that case, why did you reject Er Chun when he said he wanted to send us directly into the palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not valuable if it\u2019s free. We\u2019ll have to play hard to get so that people will respect us. Don\u2019t worry. Er Chun has already left to inform the palace of our arrival, hasn\u2019t he? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be people coming to see us soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er burst out laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re such a scammer.\u201d Shortly after, her smiling face tensed up a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, promise me. Don\u2019t risk your life doing anything dangerous, no matter what, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not reply her but just kissed her lips instead. On that cozy couch, he pulled her slender body deeper into his embrace.</p><br/><p>An hour later, Er Chun\u2019s voice came from the other side of the door. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>By that time, Zhou Weiqing had already taken a shower and changed into his clean clothes. At the moment, Shangguan Bing\u2019er was peeling fruits to feed him. \u201cCome in,\u201d he said slowly.</p><br/><p>Er Chun opened the door and walked into the room. However, he only took a step in and gestured invitingly with his hands as he stepped aside.</p><br/><p>Following his gesture, a tall old man walked in. The old man was more than two meters in height. Even though he looked old with his white hair, his posture was good and his back was straight. His muscles made his clothes looked tight. In fact, he looked energetic and did not seem any weaker than a younger person.</p><br/><p>He was wearing the blue robe of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, but Zhou Weiqing noticed there was a golden sun logo on the left side of his chest. It was clear that this man held a much higher position than Er Chun did in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Moreover, the power that he exuded was greater than Er Chun\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing remained seated on the couch, he did not have the intention of rising up to welcome them personally. The old man stared at him. His eyes were like two sharp swords piercing into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes as a repressive aura was locked onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body immediately.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing continued eating fruits like he was unaffected by the old man\u2019s aura. The aura seemed like it meant nothing to him at all.</p><br/><p>The old man ignored Zhou Weiqing and asked Er Chun, \u201cHmm, you\u2019re really got some capabilities. Er Chun, this is the God Tier Master that you told me about?\u201d His voice was deep and it had an intense vibration that echoed in one\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Elder. Master, let me introduce you to Elder Fei Lun. He\u2019s one of the 12 Elders of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. He\u2019s responsible for foreign affairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and pointed at the couch next to him. \u201cElder, please take a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Lun waved his hand while Er Chun backed off and closed the door. He then walked to the couch opposite of Zhou Weiqing and sat down. He had retracted his intense aura from before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, Er Chun told me that you\u2019re a God Tier Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded. He remained aloof while he proceeded to eat the fruits that Shangguan Bing\u2019er peeled for him.</p><br/><p>Fei Lun had anger in his eyes as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re only a young brat. Aren\u2019t you afraid of biting off more than you can chew?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing glared at him and grinned. \u201cAmbition and capability aren\u2019t determined by age. Even if I gave you a hundred years, you\u2019d have lived your life for naught if you\u2019ve got no ambitions.\u201d When he said the latter half of the sentence, he made a deliberate insinuation at the Elder.</p><br/><p>With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy cultivation, he could tell from the aura that Fei Lun released earlier that he was at the upper level of the Heavenly King Stage. However, it was still quite far off from the maximum level.</p><br/><p>Fei Lun looked even angrier after listening to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words. Regardless, he was an Elder of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, not someone whose status could be compared to that of Er Chun. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know the penalty of deceiving the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Of course, if you can prove that you\u2019re a God Tier Master, let alone me, the Supreme Elders, heck, even the Palace Master will welcome you with open arms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled lightly. \u201cWith that said. Elder, are you\u2019re here to test if I\u2019m really a God Tier Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Lun nodded, he had no interest in beating around the bush.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed out loud. \u201cYou want to do it here? It seems the Mysterious Heavenly Palace doesn\u2019t know the proper way of welcoming a guest, eh? So how do I prove myself? Will making a God Tier Master Level Consolidated Equipment Scroll be enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Fei Lun replied.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scoffed coldly and stood up. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, Elder Fei Lun you can leave now. We\u2019re not participating the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Selection Test anymore. Bing\u2019er, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei Lun was stunned that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attitude did not even change in the least. Hurriedly, he stood up and questioned them. \u201cWhat do you mean by this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scoffed once more in disdain. \u201cAs a Consolidating Equipment Master, making a Consolidated Equipment Scroll doesn\u2019t only require materials and papers, the environment is crucial too. The thicker the Atmospheric Energy of a place, the easier it is to make Consolidated Equipment Scroll. I believe that you should know of these requirements, right?\u201d He did not even bother to address him as Elder anymore.</p><br/><p>Fei Lun nodded instantly. Although he was not a Consolidating Equipment Master, he knew a thing or two about Consolidating Equipment Masters.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed coldly once more. \u201cElder, since you knew that, why would you ask me to make a God Tier Master Level Consolidated Equipment Scroll here? Is this the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s way of showing their sincerity? If I had enough materials to make a God Tier Master Level Consolidated Equipment Scroll, why would I have come to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Fei Lun was speechless as he frowned. \u201cYou should know that you don\u2019t have to go through any assessment to enter the Mysterious Heavenly Palace if you\u2019re really a God Tier Master. We\u2019ll treat you as our guest of honor and treat you with respect as well. That said, we\u2019ll still need you to prove that you\u2019re a God Tier Master no matter what.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

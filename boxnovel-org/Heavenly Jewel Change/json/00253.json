He had been completely mesmerized by her body, and so he didn\u2019t notice until now that Dongfang Hanyue was actually wearing this.</p><br/><p>He subconsciously reached out to stroke it\u2026 and instantly, he shivered as though he had been goosed. He hadn\u2019t been able to tell just by looking at it, but when he used his hand to touch it he discovered to his astonishment that within this diamond jewel there was an incomparably powerful ripple of Spatial Attribute energy.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing himself possessed Spatial Attribute energy and also had Saint Energy.\u00a0As a result, he had extremely keen senses with regards to any type of energy.\u00a0Although he didn\u2019t know how the metallic \u2018shell\u2019 of the necklace was created or how it had completely masked the Spatial Attribute energy inside, as soon as he touched it he instantly realized how marvelous it was.</p><br/><p><em>W-what was this?</em> Zhou Weiqing stared blankly, then stared greedily at the necklace. His hand, however, slowly dropped away from it and instead moved to rub Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s chest. Even when this lecher was thinking, his behavior never changed.</p><br/><p>He let out a soft sigh, then murmured softly to himself, \u201cUgh. You are the Xuantian Palace Master, while I have to go back to my world. There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll go with me. At least destiny brought us together for this one night. I should leave you something to remember me by. Who knows if we\u2019ll ever have the chance to meet again?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, his big hand ceased its naughty movements across Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s chest.\u00a0A thick surge of Saint Energy slowly emerged from his palm and entered her body, stealthily passing through her meridians and gathering within her Dantian.</p><br/><p>If anyone else did this, Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s massive store of Heavenly Energy would immediately reject it.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that at the very center of Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s chest, there was an absolutely enormous energy cluster.\u00a0This was probably her Heavenly Core Nucleus!</p><br/><p>However, this wasn\u2019t the right time to analyze the mysteries of her Heavenly Core Nucleus.\u00a0Besides, the Heavenly Core Nucleus was different from his own goal, which was to create a Saint Core Nucleus.\u00a0Thus, he simply guided his Saint Energy into Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>One of the unique things about Saint Energy was that it wouldn\u2019t be rejected by any other Attributes at all.\u00a0This was because pure Saint Energy contained no destructive potential at all.\u00a0Only when it was used in techniques and converted into other Attributes to unleash attacks would its powerful effect be made plain.</p><br/><p>As a result, when the Saint Energy entered Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s body, her own energies didn\u2019t reject it in the slightest.\u00a0In fact, her own energies actually parted way before the Saint Energy, allowing Zhou Weiqing to easily pour it all the way into her Dantian and then condense it.</p><br/><p>Given Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current cultivation level, he was now far better at pouring Saint Energy into another person than before.\u00a0In addition, he wasn\u2019t stingy at all when pouring it into Dongfang Hanyue.\u00a0He even activated his purest energies, the astral silver Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy slowly formed a small astral whirlpool within Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s Dantian, which quietly began to spin and take on a life of its own.\u00a0Although it wouldn\u2019t grow stronger the way Zhou Weiqing\u2019s energies would, this pure vortex of Saint Energy in her body would serve as an \u2018energy boost\u2019 for when she tried to break through to become a Heavenly God in the near future.\u00a0The formerly-impossible bottleneck would no longer be a problem.</p><br/><p>He maintained careful control over his Saint Energy as he formed the whirlpool.\u00a0By the time he finished, his forehead was matted with sweat.\u00a0This was his first time directly creating a whirlpool of Saint Energy for another person, especially with the most highly distilled and pure Saint Energy he had.\u00a0Although he didn\u2019t give her all of it, he still gave her an enormous amount.\u00a0He wouldn\u2019t be able to fully recover without at least two weeks of rest.</p><br/><p>After finishing his task, Zhou Weiqing revealed a hint of a smile.\u00a0\u201cYou are now my woman.\u00a0I\u2019ve done right by you.\u00a0I left you a little gift, so it wouldn\u2019t be too excessive if I took a souvenir of my own, right?\u201d\u00a0Of course, he was only talking to himself as Dongfang Hanyue was still sleeping soundly in his arms.</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he carefully removed the necklace from her neck, then hung it around his own.\u00a0A satisfied, guilt-free smile was on his face as he murmured, \u201cThere are some things in this world which you can find a second copy of, but my Saint Energy is absolutely unique.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he carefully lifted Dongfang Hanyue out of the crook of his arm, then gently placed her down on the blanket.</p><br/><p>He let out a long sigh, then dressed himself in fresh clothes.\u00a0He wanted to leave, but was still a bit reluctant to.\u00a0He returned to Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s side, giving her face a kiss and squeezing her softest parts a few times before turning and walking towards the sea.</p><br/><p>His dragon-tiger wings spread out as he suddenly unleashed the Dragon-Tiger Transformation.\u00a0With a gentle flap of his wings, he soared into the skies and began to fly out into the sea.</p><br/><p>Right after he flew away, the \u2018slumbering\u2019 Dongfang Hanyue slowly opened her eyes and looked up from the blanket.\u00a0An embarrassed, irritated look was on her face as she muttered to herself, \u201cThat bastard.\u00a0He just had to take advantage of me before leaving.\u00a0He really is a jerk.\u00a0A bastard.\u00a0A pervert.\u201d</p><br/><p>She rose to sit up, dressing herself while sitting on the blanket.\u00a0When she accidentally saw the spot of dark crimson color on the blanket, her cheeks instantly turned even more crimson.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, jerk\u2026 I don\u2019t regret it either.\u00a0Honestly.\u00a0I really don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0She could sense the astral whirlpool within her body.\u00a0Although it didn\u2019t contain a particularly large amount of energy, the energy it did contain was incredibly pure and seemed to transcend all other Attributes.\u00a0It was utterly beguiling.\u201d</p><br/><p>A spellbound look was in Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s beautiful eyes. As the Palace Master, she had always received the finest tutelage and was by nature a supremely clever person. However, she still couldn\u2019t resist falling for that bad, bad man.</p><br/><p>She simply continued to sit there, completely absorbed in her memories.</p><br/><p>The first time she saw him, she had been beguiled by his effortless self-confidence.\u00a0Even though he wasn\u2019t all that handsome, his talent, his self-confidence, and the focused look on his face when he created that God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll had left an extremely deep impression in her heart.</p><br/><p>During the many days that followed, he had displayed incredible abilities in many different areas.\u00a0Even though she herself was also acclaimed as a \u2018genius\u2019, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit ashamed of her inferiority.\u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for her father\u2019s legacy, she would probably be inferior to him in every way.</p><br/><p>Finally, there came the day when that bad man actually took advantage of her as they leapt off the cliff.\u00a0At first, for a very brief instant, she really did want to kill him.\u00a0However, she just couldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0The excuse she gave was that she couldn\u2019t kill a genius like him\u2026\u00a0but was the answer really as simple as that?\u00a0The real answer was, he was the only man she had ever taken a liking to.</p><br/><p>Perhaps young maidens would care more about a man\u2019s physical appearance, but as the Xuantian Palace Lord, Dongfang Hanyue had seen far, far too many handsome men.\u00a0The only thing she truly cared about were inner qualities.\u00a0Although Zhou Weiqing had shown himself to be a pervert and a lecher, none of that was able to wipe away his absolutely astonishing talent.</p><br/><p>For a long period of time after that, she had completely ignored Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0It was partially because she was angry, but also because she felt a bit lost.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was when she took him into that separate Spatial region to spar with him that everything changed.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue never would\u2019ve imagined that she would end up losing a battle in what she believed to be the only area she surpassed Zhou Weiqing in.\u00a0She had already been able to sense a portion of the power within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Bloodline, and the final Devour Skill had caused her to feel a sense of fear.</p><br/><p>And so, she lost the bet.\u00a0Even after what had just happened last night, she still wasn\u2019t sure what she felt in her own heart.\u00a0She had still been telling herself that she didn\u2019t want to owe this fellow anything, and so she sacrificed her body to him.</p><br/><p>Now, however, she knew the truth.</p><br/><p>The moment she had first fallen for him was the moment when he had won their bet.\u00a0When Zhou Weiqing had gained victory, he had also won something in her heart.\u00a0However, what truly made her love him was his behavior when they had battled those two powerful Terror Sea Dragons.\u00a0At the most dangerous moment, he didn\u2019t hesitate at all to charge out and fight the second Terror Sea Dragon.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, you only needed a single moment to fall in love with someone.\u00a0That moment was the moment he had conquered her heart.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t always matter how a man normally behaved.\u00a0If he could rise up and step forward at critical life-and-death moments to sacrifice himself for his woman, that meant he was a responsible man who was worthy of that woman\u2019s love.</p><br/><p>In that moment, Dongfang Hanyue had cried behind her mask.\u00a0She finally knew her own heart.\u00a0She knew that she had fallen for this bad man, and there was no way out.</p><br/><p>Even after she saw him display a level of power that was beyond what she believed he possessed, and even after she realized why he had come to the Xuantian Continent, Dongfang Hanyue didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of anger towards him for his deceptions.\u00a0Instead, she had only fallen even more madly in love with him.</p><br/><p><em>He came here for the Spatial Teleportation Gem. There was no need for him to get involved at all. Even if he didn\u2019t flee, he could just stand there and watch.\u00a0</em>When Dongfang Hanyue was forced to the brink, she would\u2019ve had to use the Spatial Teleportation Gem and even would\u2019ve tried to rescue him.\u00a0That would\u2019ve been the perfect moment to seize the gem.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 he didn\u2019t do that.\u00a0He had chosen to do something incredibly stupid.\u00a0After they had arrived here, he had even told her everything.</p><br/><p>His actions definitely were not without risk. This was obvious from how that enormous thing he had summoned had instantly been destroyed. He had been gambling with his life! If the Terror Sea Dragon had attacked without pause, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

(2)</b></p><br/><p>Moving to the front, Zhan LingTian looked at Zhou Weiqing with furrowed brows, saying solemnly: \u201cZhou Weiqing, you are here for the Heavenly Jewel Tournament right? Since that is the case, why did you come to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily. \u201cDid you not hear my shout just now? I am here to look for Bing\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold light flashed in Zhan LingTian\u2019s eyes. \u201cJust for Miss Bing\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his cold and aloof look, Zhou Weiqing was somewhat unhappy. \u201cBro Zhan, what do you mean? It seems like who I am looking for is none of your business. I have earned the plaque to come to the Heavenly Jewel Island, and I do not need to report to you why I have come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhan LingTian took a deep breath, calming himself down. Fixing Zhou Weiqing with a fiery gaze, he said: \u201cZhou Weiqing, I challenge you. If you lose, you are not allowed to provoke First Young Miss any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Understanding dawned upon Zhou Weiqing. \u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhan LingTian said coldly: \u201cWhatever your relationship is with Second Young Miss and Third Young Miss, I do not care. However, First Young Miss is the heir to our Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, the next Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace Master. You will not be disrespectful to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, saying: \u201cEven if we discuss this matter, it should be the two Palace Masters discussing it with me. Can you make the decision for Xue\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, let me discuss with you then. Shall we discuss?!\u201d All of a sudden, a clear voice rang out, with a hint of anger.</p><br/><p>The air in front of Zhou Weiqing warped slightly, and the next instant, a figure appeared.</p><br/><p>The figure was none other than the father of the three Shangguan Sisters, the Second Palace Master of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, Shangguan Tianyue.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s expression was even uglier than Zhan LingTian. Looking at Zhou Weiqing as if he was some thief that had stolen his most precious possession.</p><br/><p>Seeing that it was his future father-in-law, Zhou Weiqing instantly turned honest and polite. He quickly bowed in greeting: \u201cGreetings, Father-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your father in law?!\u201d Shangguan Tianyue waved his sleeve, and Zhou Weiqing felt as if the air tightened around him, forcefully making him straighten his waist.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue said angrily: \u201cZhou Weiqing, you little brat. Let me ask you, how has my Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace treated you? How has my ZhongTian Empire treated you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Towards this father in law of his, naturally Zhou Weiqing could not treat him the same way as he did Zhan LingTian. Quickly, he said respectfully: \u201cBoth the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and ZhongTian Empire have treated me very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue said: \u201cYou also know that we have treated you well? Not speaking of how Fei\u2019er helped you trained those men of yours, even to the point of using our secret recipe and medicines to help them. Just the fact that we allowed you to bring away so many Jewel Masters, how much help is that to you? We even supported you financially in your efforts to revive your Empire\u2026 What about you? How have you repaid me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little bastard, not only did you take Bing\u2019er\u2019s virtue, and you even provoked Fei\u2019er\u2026 fine. Now, you won\u2019t even let Xue\u2019er go. You little playboy brat! I just want to smack you dead with a single slap.\u201d As he continued speaking, his anger grew, and a powerful aura burst forth from Shangguan Tianyue, causing the entire air around them to freeze.</p><br/><p>Of course, as the saying goes \u2018Don\u2019t wash one\u2019s dirty linen in public\u2019[1. The mandarin saying is family troubles should not be talked about in public]. Despite his anger, his voice could only be heard by Zhou Weiqing; even Zhan LingTian standing next to him could not hear anything else.</p><br/><p>Seeing Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s rage, with a sudden thud, Zhou Weiqing just knelt down on the ground, kowtowing to Shangguan Tianyue three times. \u201cFather in Law, I am wrong. I have no objections no matter how you wish to punish me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly getting three kowtows from this fellow, Shangguan Tianyue was also stunned. Originally, he had already resolved to teach this brat a lesson. However, now that he was honestly kneeling in front of him, ready to take the punishment, it actually caused him to feel like he couldn\u2019t take action.</p><br/><p>The reason why Zhou Weiqing acted like this was because he had suddenly thought things through. Simply put - if he had been in Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s shoes, having a youth steal all three of his daughters\u2019 hearts, he would probably be even angrier than Shangguan Tianyue. It was true that it was his fault for being such a playboy, so he had nothing else to say. Since it was his fault, he would accept the punishment.</p><br/><p>However, if it were Zhan LingTian who came pointing fingers, he would not be so polite; he had never been afraid of a fight. In his eyes, the difference was Zhan LingTian was just being envious and jealous, they were love rivals in this matter. Instead, Shangguan Tianyue was his future father in law, so Zhou Weiqing was extremely well behaved. No matter how Shangguan Tianyue dealt with him, as long as it did not cross the bottom line, he would take it. If he wanted to enjoy the marriage of these few girls, he had to pay the price first.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d Shangguan Tianyue said exasperatedly. Another flick of his sleeve, and the air around forced Zhou Weiqing up, not allowing him to kneel any longer.</p><br/><p>Looking at this Zhou Weiqing\u2019s honest, well behaved, earnest and flattering look, Shangguan Tianyue almost burst out laughing. He could not understand how such a brat like this could actually steal the hearts of his three precious daughters. Although Xue\u2019er did not admit it outright, as a father and a person who had experienced love before, how could he not see it?</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, let me ask you. If I force you to choose one of my three daughters, who would you choose?\u201d Shangguan Tianyue said solemnly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing asked tentatively: \u201cCan\u2019t I choose all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The flames of rage that had just subsided rose up once more.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cHeh heh, then I shall not choose at all. I\u2019ll find a chance to steal them all away in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be daydreaming. This is the Heavenly Jewel Island, where my Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace is. With just you alone, you think you can steal my little girls away?\u201d Shangguan Tianyue said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cOf course I am not able to do so currently, but that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t be able to do so in the future. Father in law, how about this, shall we place a bet? Within five years, if I am able to steal them away, you will no longer intervene in our matter, how about it? If I can do it, it will also prove my abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit, what do you take my daughters for? If you dare steal them, I\u2019ll destroy your Heavenly Bow Empire.\u201d Shangguan Tianyue wished he could just destroy this little brat with a single slap.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave an aggrieved look as he said: \u201cFather in Law, I am wrong. But\u2026 I can\u2019t control my heart like that! I will definitely treat them well. The relationship between me and Bing\u2019er, well, I don\u2019t need to speak more about that. For my sake, Fei\u2019er almost died, how could I abandon her? As for Xue\u2019er, you understand her the most. I was intimate with her unwittingly, and with her temper, she would never marry anyone else. Furthermore, she had made a bet to marry me. So, I really cannot let anyone go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The more Shangguan Tianyue heard, the angrier he got. Taking a step forward, he kicked Zhou Weiqing on the chest, sending him flying off the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard! Asshole!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was also rather depressed. Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s kick had not been light at all. Although he did not use any Heavenly Energy, it was still a kick from a Heavenly Emperor! That was a terrifying blow indeed!</p><br/><p>*Swoosh* The wings behind his back spread out instantly, stopping his fall in mid air. Looking at Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s rage, he dared not fly back too quickly.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a sudden spark of inspiration struck Zhou Weiqing. In the air, he said to Shangguan Tianyue: \u201cFather in law, please let me on the island first? I have a matter of utmost importance to report.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue was still on the edge, in the midst of his fit of anger. Glaring at Zhou Weiqing, he snarled: \u201cStop talking rubbish. Get lost now, otherwise I\u2019ll beat you up until you can\u2019t even take care of yourself. We\u2019ll see how you join the Heavenly Jewel Tournament then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a distressed expression as he said: \u201cFather in law, just let me say a few words. If you still want me to leave, I will do so without any other protest, and I will promise never to bother Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er again. What do you say? What I am about to say is regarding the rise or fall of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>For Shangguan Tianyue to appear here, it was truly because as a father, he could not take it, and he really wanted to teach Zhou Weiqing a lesson. Of course, he was still very satisfied with Zhou Weiqing as a son in law.</p><br/><p>Ever since the first time he had seen Zhou Weiqing, right up to this point, his feelings had undergone an unbelievable transformation. The news sources of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace were far beyond Zhou Weiqing\u2019s imagination. Furthermore, the Shangguan Sisters had pretty much each followed him all through his journey, accompanying him one after the other. As a result, Shangguan Tianyue could be said to be extremely familiar with all his experiences.</p><br/><p>What Zhou Weiqing had done in the north borders\u2026 even when the Shangguan brothers, Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue discussed it, they could only use the word \u2018miracle\u2019 to describe it. To form such an army troop by himself\u2026 one that actually had the power to turn the tides against a sure-loss scenario against the WanShou Empire. Of course, there was the support of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace which allowed it to happen, or even the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor\u2019s financial support. However, if it were anyone else, could they even duplicate the feat even if they were given all the same resources?</p><br/><p>Perhaps the bigger surprise for Shangguan Tianyue was that Zhou Weiqing had actually dared to charge up the Heavenly Snow Mountain for Tian\u2019er\u2019s sake\u2026 to cause trouble! And that Master of his, he had actually accompanied him along on such a crazy quest. The craziest thing was that they had succeeded! Besides feeling that it was inconceivable and beyond their comprehension, the Shangguan Brothers could only feel good about it. After all, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain had fought for such a long time. For the Heavenly Snow Mountain to suffer a loss, no matter how small, how could they not be happy?</p><br/><p>As such, even though Shangguan Tianyue was scolding Zhou Weiqing, wanting to teach him a lesson, deep in his heart he was still very satisfied with this son in law. Zhou Weiqing could truly live up to the saying \u2018A Dragon or Phoenix amongst men\u2019. However, he was afraid that in the future Fei\u2019er or Bing\u2019er would suffer in the future if they followed him, so he still wanted to teach him a lesson. As for Shangguan Xue\u2019er, it was true that in his heart, he was really unwilling to let her marry Zhou Weiqing. After all, Shangguan Xue\u2019er was the heir of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace!</p><br/><p>\u201cGet down here and speak.\u201d Shangguan Tianyue said coldly. At the same time, he waved his hands, motioning for the others to leave.</p><br/><p>Zhan LingTian hesitated a moment, but with the signal from Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes, he had no choice but to leave unwillingly.</p><br/><p>Towards Zhou Weiqing, Zhan LingTian actually had quite some understanding. In his eyes, Zhou Weiqing was unbelievably sneaky and cunning. Who knew if that fellow had some method to talk to and persuade Shangguan Tianyue. Alas, he did not have any choice, and he could not speak too much regarding it to Shangguan Tianyue, and could only turn and leave.</p><br/><p>Flapping his wings, Zhou Weiqing returned to the Heavenly Jewel Island in a flash, his face still with the aggrieved look.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

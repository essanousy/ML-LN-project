He did not expect someone as powerful as the Blackfield Dragon to be interested in such pedestrian gossip.</p><br/><p>Scratching his head, Zhou Weiqing laughed helplessly, \u201cSenior, you must be kidding. I am just in the Upper Zun Tier while Meng Xing is at the Emperor Tier. Why would she even give me any time of her day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. You don\u2019t need to continue feeding me lies. Even though your cultivation level only has Six Jewels, I can sense a dangerous presence from within you. This proves that your real power is more than you have displayed. Even though Meng Xing did not say much but she did mention that you\u2019re better her in terms of talent. I\u2019ve seen this girl grow before my eyes, and she has never spoken a good word about any man other than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was startled and replied, \u201cBut I already have a wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blackfiend Dragon huffed coldly, \u201cEasy, divorce her. Kid, I\u2019m telling you, if you dare to even let Meng Xing down. Hehe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the threat itself was not delivered in an overbearing manner, the threat from a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse still chilled Zhou Weiqing to his core. However, he still had a hard time understanding why this giant dragon suddenly decided to become a matchmaker.</p><br/><p>Divorce Shangguan Bing\u2019er for Meng Xing? That was such a ludicrous idea. In Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart, Shangguan Bing\u2019er enjoyed a position that was irreplaceable. Even if he had relationships of sorts with Tian\u2019er, Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and even the Little Witch, he would not give his Bing\u2019er up for any one of them.</p><br/><p>Of course, he could not tell the Blackfiend Dragon that directly. He still wanted to live after all. Zhou Weiqing laughed helplessly and said, \u201cSenior, shouldn\u2019t we discuss this later? After all, marriage is not something that can be decided with just me alone. We still have to get Meng Xing\u2019s opinion. We can deal with that after we take down the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon grumbled with dissatisfaction, \u201cKid, don\u2019t think I can\u2019t see through your obvious attempt to stall. Fine, we\u2019ll deal with you two after we take care of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. After all, Meng Xing is already at a suitable age. For the sake of Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s future, it\u2019s time for her to find herself a man. And the man that I\u2019ve decided on is you. You have mastery over six Heavenly Jewels and thus, I\u2019m sure your progeny will be even more powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was speechless, he wanted to tell the Blackfiend Dragon that he had thought too far ahead.</p><br/><p>Blackfiend Dragon continued, \u201cKid, if you can win over Meng Xing\u2019s heart and get her to marry you, I promise to help you consolidate the Heavenly Core Nucleus and help you achieve the Heavenly King Tier in less than three years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing yelped in surprise, \u201cThere are shortcuts that can be taken for cultivation?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon chuckled, \u201cNothing is impossible. There are many things that you\u2019re not aware of in this world. We, of the Darkness type, have a unique secret technique that enables the inheritance of power. After we obtain the Nucleus Core of this Dreadfiend Sea Naga, its residual power after I have evolved can be used to increase your cultivation. Heavenly King Tier, kid. Think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>For any Jewel Master, the offer of cultivation to a Heavenly King Tier was indeed alluring, but the Blackfiend Dragon had set his sights on the wrong candidate. Zhou Weiqing had already reached the cultivation level of Nine Jewels and he had Saint Energy. He had no need for this aid. However, he did receive a lot of information from his conversation with the Blackfiend Dragon. Meng Xing probably had received a power inheritance from the Darkness type. That was why she was so powerful.</p><br/><p>While he was conversing with the Blackfiend Dragon, Zhou Weiqing suddenly shivered involuntarily from the cold. He subconsciously looked down and he was shocked by what he discovered.</p><br/><p>The sea underneath the Blackfiend Dragon or to be more accurate, the water within the area drawn out by the thirteen powerful elders from Mysterious Heavenly Palace had turned black. The sea was inky black as if light could not even penetrate through the surface of the water. A concentrated pool of Demonic Energy continuously surged up from it.</p><br/><p>The scales on the Blackfiend Dragon opened slightly as the concentrated Demonic Energy was siphoned into his body. Zhou Weiqing could tell the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s power was increasing crazily.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is the Ward of Darkness? Such powerful energy fluctuations.\u2019 Zhou Weiqing thought in shock. This ward was powerful enough to deal with a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, it showed how powerful the ward was. The Dreadfiend Sea Naga might be powerful but it was going to face the collective power of an entire mainland. It seemed like the chances of Mysterious Heavenly Palace defeating the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was pretty high!</p><br/><p>In reality, this was not the situation Zhou Weiqing wanted to see. If the Mysterious Heavenly Palace managed to win by a landslide, he probably would not have the chance to even see the Spatial Teleportation Stone.</p><br/><p>The best outcome for him was if both sides ended up wounded. Only under those circumstances would they use the Spatial Teleportation Stone and only then would he have the opportunity to use it.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s battle was crucial to both the Mysterious Heavenly Palace and Zhou Weiqing. He had already analyzed all the possible outcomes and had prepared accordingly.</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, even though the underlings of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace were completely rotten, the upper echelons had treated him well ever since his arrival. If possible, the best outcome would be for him to slip away with Shangguan Bing\u2019er and the Spatial Teleportation Stone without bringing harm to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>Of course, even though this was the ideal outcome, the chances of it happening was pretty low.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Energy coming from underneath them was getting stronger. One could see clearly the twelve pools of dark light were becoming more and more concentrated. However, the most shocking sight for Zhou Weiqing was, of the 13 people that had left, the only one not involved in the formation of the ward was not the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace but Meng Xing. She leaped back and forth from various positions as if she was commanding something.</p><br/><p>With a slight frown, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s facial expression did not twitch but internally, a curious idea was formed.</p><br/><p>The setting up of the Ward of Darkness took up two full hours. Finally, the twelve rays of lights gradually dimmed and the Demonic Energy underneath slowly dispersed.</p><br/><p>The sea returned to its dark blue color as if the great pool of Demonic Energy earlier was just a mirage.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing knew this did not mean that the Ward of Darkness had failed. If anything, this was a sign that it was successful. However, he had no idea what kind of methods these people employed to conceal the presence of the Ward of Darkness so perfectly. The reason he was certain the Ward of Darkness was completed was because the energy level within the Blackfiend Dragon did not decrease due to the change in the sea water underneath them.</p><br/><p>A shadowy figure dashed through the sky like a shooting star and in a flash, there was another individual standing in front of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>That person was Meng Xing. The other twelve people had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll ready.\u201d Meng Xing nodded at the Blackfiend Dragon.</p><br/><p>Blackfiend Dragon said, \u201cGet on. Weiqing, it\u2019s time for you to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a flash, Meng Xing landed on top of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s skull. There was a large horn protruding out of the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s head and Meng Xing was standing in front of this horn with her back against it. From the looks of things, she looked more like a dragon rider than a Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill not going to leave?\u201d When Meng Xing noticed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s startled eyes on her, she frowned involuntarily and berated him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing snapped out of it and in a flash, a pair of wings appeared on his back as he unleashed his Demonic Change. He flew from Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s back towards a distance far away.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s gaze followed him until he left the range of the Ward of Darkness, at which point, her gaze softened.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, if I remember correctly, human beings prefer gentler women. If you really like him, then be nicer to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing\u2019s face dropped. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Blackfiend Dragon chuckled. \u201cThis is most definitely not nonsense. Do you think I cannot discern your affection towards him? This is the first man that has managed to arouse your affection, and I bet there\u2019s more to it than just his natural talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>A blush appeared on Meng Xing\u2019s cheeks. Obviously, she was reminded of some unsavory memories. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face the Dreadfiend Sea Naga soon and you still have time to entertain frivolities like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Blackfiend Dragon sighed, \u201cSuch insolence. If we follow the bloodline, I am, after all, in the same generation as your uncle. When your father departed from this world, he left you in my care. Girl, you\u2019re not young anymore. Shouldn\u2019t uncle find you a good family to marry you off to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was startled but her gaze mellowed. \u201cUncle, you worry too much. He already has a lover and I can tell, he is deeply in love with his wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon said with authority, \u201cThen, we\u2019ll make him divorce her. If he dares to object, I will kill him. Or better yet, I can just kill the wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Meng Xing gasped and immediately tried to stop him, \u201cUncle, you mustn\u2019t do that. If he abandons his lawfully-wedded wife because of a threat, is it even possible for his love towards me be real? In fact, if you kill his wife, the chances of us getting together will be even lower.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon was silent.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing took a deep breath to calm her stormy emotions. \u201cUncle, let us be prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blackfiend Dragon suddenly added, \u201cHow about this? You marry him and become his second wife? Then again, aren\u2019t we being too kind to that kid?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

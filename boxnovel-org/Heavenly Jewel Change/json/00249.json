line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u00a0When Zhou Weiqing heard the Tenebrous Demon Dragon suddenly ask him if he had fallen for Dreamwake, his jaw dropped and his eyes popped out.\u00a0He never would\u2019ve imagined that a powerful figure like the Tenebrous Demon Dragon would actually be such a nosy busy-body.</p><br/><p>He scratched his head, then let out an awkward laugh.\u00a0\u201cSenior, don\u2019t make fun of me.\u00a0I\u2019m merely an upper level Zun Stage, while Dreamwake is a Heavenly Emperor.\u00a0How could she possibly take any interest in me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, enough.\u00a0Don\u2019t try to hide it from me.\u00a0Although you are only at the six-Jeweled cultivation level, this entire time I\u2019ve been able to sense a whiff of danger emanating from you.\u00a0That means that your actual, full power isn\u2019t as low as the level of power you are displaying.\u00a0Although Dreamwake didn\u2019t say too much about you, she did mention that you are even more talented than her.\u00a0And\u2026 I\u2019ve watched her ever since she was a little girl.\u00a0Aside from you, I\u2019ve never seen her take a second glance at any man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing blinked.\u00a0\u201cBut\u2026 I already have a wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon snorted coldly.\u00a0\u201cJust divorce her.\u00a0Let me tell you something, kid.\u00a0If you dare to mistreat that girl Dreamwake in any way\u2026 heh heh heh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the dragon didn\u2019t release its terrifying aura upon Zhou Weiqing, the mere fact that a Heavenly God powerhouse was threatening him was enough to cause his heart to turn clammy.\u00a0However, he really didn\u2019t understand why this great dragon had suddenly decided to play matchmaker.</p><br/><p>Divorce Shangguan Bing\u2019er for the sake of Dreamwake?\u00a0Impossible.\u00a0In Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart, Shangguan Bing\u2019er occupied a special position which was irreplaceable.\u00a0Even though he also loved Tian\u2019er, Xue\u2019er, and Fei\u2019er, and had a fling with Little Witch, there was no way he would abandon his Bing\u2019er for anyone.</p><br/><p>But of course, he wouldn\u2019t say that to the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.\u00a0That\u2019d be asking for trouble.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing said, a miserable smile on his face, \u201cSenior, all this is talk for later.\u00a0Marriage isn\u2019t something I can decide upon myself.\u00a0You should ask Dreamwake for her opinion as well, right?\u00a0Let\u2019s finish dealing with the Terror Sea Dragon first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon said rather unhappily, \u201cKid, are you seriously trying to gloss over this topic with me?\u00a0Fine, then.\u00a0I\u2019ll first deal with the Terror Sea Dragon, then deal with you.\u00a0That girl Dreamwake isn\u2019t getting any younger.\u00a0She needs to find a man, if only for the sake of Xuantian Palace\u2019s future.\u00a0I\u2019ve taken a liking to you.\u00a0You have six different Jewel Attributes, which means that the children you two have will be even more extraordinarily talented.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt completely speechless.\u00a0He really wanted to say to the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, \u201cYou might be planning things out a bit too far ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon continued, \u201cKid, if you can win Dreamwake\u2019s heart and take her as your bride, I guarantee that within three years, I\u2019ll ensure that you skyrocket to become a Heavenly King and Consolidate your Heavenly Core Nucleus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u00a0Zhou Weiqing was shocked.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s possible to \u2018help\u2019 someone else upgrade their cultivation level?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon let out a chortle.\u00a0\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u00a0There are many things in this world that you have no clue about.\u00a0The Tenebrous Bloodline has access to a unique, secret technique which allows for the transfer of power.\u00a0So long as we can acquire the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s Heavenly Core Nucleus, after I use it to evolve I\u2019ll use the remainder of the power within the core to help you upgrade.\u00a0It won\u2019t be too hard.\u00a0You\u2019ll be a Heavenly King, kid!\u00a0Spend some time and think carefully about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rising in cultivation to become a Heavenly King was an enormously alluring prospect for any Heavenly Jewel Master.\u00a0Alas, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon<strong>\u00a0</strong>had chosen the wrong person to make this pitch to.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing was already at the nine-Jeweled stage and had access to Saint Energy.\u00a0He didn\u2019t need this sort of help at all.\u00a0However, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s words had accidentally given Zhou Weiqing a great deal of information.\u00a0For example, he now knew that Dreamwake had probably received such an energy transfer thanks to the Tenebrous Lineage, which was why she had such enormous power.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing realized this, he immediately felt much better about himself.\u00a0If Dreamwake had purely relied upon her own innate talent to train to the Heavenly Emperor level at age twenty-nine, Zhou Weiqing would\u2019ve suffered a severe blow to his own self-confidence.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing knew that while this sort of external help could grant you tremendous power within a short period of time, the bottlenecks you later encountered would be far sturdier and tougher than those which normal cultivators had to face.\u00a0Although Dreamwake had become a Heavenly Emperor at a very young age, it would probably be incredibly hard for her to breakthrough to become a Heavenly God.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing continued to chat with the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, he suddenly felt his skin feeling a bit cold.\u00a0He glanced downwards unconsciously, only to be shocked by what he saw.</p><br/><p>The sea below the Tenebrous Demon Dragon within the region surrounded by the thirteen experts of Xuantian Palace had actually turned black as ink, making it impossible to see to the bottom.\u00a0The dense Tenebrous Attribute energy continued to rise upwards from the region.</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s scales rose upwards slightly as it began to absorb that dense Tenebrous Attribute energy into its body.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that the aura and might of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon was rising at a furious pace.</p><br/><p><em>So this was the Tenebrous Demon Sealing Formation?\u00a0What incredibly strong ripples it is generating!</em> Zhou Weiqing was secretly shocked by this. This grand formation was able to counter even Heavenly God powerhouses. Its might was unquestionable! The Terror Sea Dragon might be powerful, but it was facing the full might of a Great Saint Land. From what he was seeing, it seemed very possible that Xuantian Palace would succeed in slaying the Terror Sea Dragon!</p><br/><p>This was not, however, what Zhou Weiqing wanted to see.\u00a0If Xuantian Palace won a complete victory, he probably would stand no chance of even seeing the Spatial Teleportation Gem.</p><br/><p>To him, the ideal outcome was one where both sides were wounded.\u00a0Only then would there be a chance that the Spatial Teleportation Gem would be used.\u00a0Only then would he have a chance to acquire it.</p><br/><p>This was an incredibly important battle for Xuantian Palace, and the same was true for Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0He had already made a full analysis of all potential outcomes, and had fully prepared for all of them.</p><br/><p>On the whole\u2026 although Xuantian Palace\u2019s lower-level cultivators were very corrupt and decadent, Zhou Weiqing could tell that the high-level members were all quite decent.\u00a0If at all possible, he would prefer to take away the Spatial Teleportation Gem without causing Xuantian Palace any harm.\u00a0He would slip away with Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>But of course, that was just an ideal outcome.\u00a0Actually achieving it wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous energy below was growing stronger and stronger.\u00a0He was now able to clearly see that the twelve distant streams of black light had grown increasingly dense.\u00a0What surprised Zhou Weiqing the most was that the only person of the thirteen who hadn\u2019t entered the Tenebrous Demon Sealing Formation was Dreamwake, rather than the Xuantian Palace Lord.\u00a0She flew from one position to another, seemingly giving orders to do something.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing frowned slightly.\u00a0He didn\u2019t reveal any traces of an expression on his face, but a few strange ideas were beginning to come to mind.</p><br/><p>It took them two full hours to completely set up the Tenebrous Demon Sealing Formation.\u00a0Finally, those twelve pillars of black light began to slowly vanish, while the Tenebrous energies below began to dissipate as well.\u00a0The sea returned to its normal deep blue color, as though the enormous power which had circulated through it earlier had never been there.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that the Tenebrous Demon Sealing Formation hadn\u2019t failed; rather, it had been completed.\u00a0However, he didn\u2019t know what technique they had used to retract and mask the formation\u2019s aura so perfectly.\u00a0The only reason why he was able to sense the formation was complete was because the Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s aura didn\u2019t weaken despite the water below it having gone back to \u2018normal\u2019.</p><br/><p>A shooting star seemed to streak out of the seas, dazzling Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0In the next instant, a second person was atop the dragon.\u00a0It was Dreamwake.\u00a0The other twelve had already disappeared from the surface of the seas.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur preparations are complete.\u201d\u00a0Dreamwake nodded at the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon said, \u201cGo ahead.\u00a0Weiqing, you can step back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dreamwake flashed forwards to land atop the Tenebrous Demon Dragon\u2019s head.\u00a0The Tenebrous Demon Dragon had a single thick and sturdy horn on its head, and Dreamwake was standing right in front of him, her back leaning against it.\u00a0Her heroic, bold posture wasn\u2019t that of a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master\u2019s at all.\u00a0This was clearly the posture of a dragonrider!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you beat it yet?\u201d\u00a0Dreamwake couldn\u2019t help but frown when she saw Zhou Weiqing staring dazedly at her, and so she barked out at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0Zhou Weiqing nodded, his body flickering as he unleashed the Demonic Change State.\u00a0He flapped the two wings which appeared on his back, then flew off the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Dreamwake watched as he flew out of the reach of the Tenebrous Demon Sealing Formation.\u00a0Only then did her face turn soft.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle lass\u2026 if memory serves, humans tend to prefer gentler women.\u00a0If you really like him, be a bit nicer to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dreamwake\u2019s face sank.\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell are you babbling about?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon chortled. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2018babbling\u2019 about anything. Do you really think I can\u2019t tell that you rather like him? This is the first man that you\u2019ve liked. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just because of his talent and his abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dreamwake\u2019s face turned slightly pink.\u00a0Clearly, she had thought of some unspeakable memories.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re about to deal with the Terror Sea Dragon.\u00a0You actually are in the mood to speak of such nonsense?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon let out a sigh. \u201cYou cheeky, impudent girl. From a bloodlines standpoint, I should be considered your uncle and senior. When your father departed from this world, he asked me to take good care of you. You aren\u2019t getting any younger. Am I, your uncle, not supposed to help you find a good husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dreamwake blinked, her gaze becoming much gentler than before.\u00a0\u201cUncle, stop wasting your time worrying over this.\u00a0He already has someone he loves.\u00a0I can tell that his feelings towards his wife are genuine and deep.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon said in an absolutely dominating manner, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have him divorce her.\u00a0If he dares to disobey, I\u2019ll kill him.\u00a0Or, I\u2019ll just kill his little wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d\u00a0Dreamwake was shocked, and she hurriedly spoke out to object.\u00a0\u201cUncle, you absolutely cannot do this.\u00a0If he\u2019s the type of person who would be willing to abandon his own wife, do you think his feelings towards me could possibly be genuine?\u00a0In fact, if you kill his wife, it\u2019ll be even less likely that we can be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon fell silent.\u00a0Dreamwake took a deep breath, calming her stirred emotions.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s make our preparations, Uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon suddenly suggested, \u201cHow about\u2026 you marry him as well? I just feel that this is letting the kid off too easy.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

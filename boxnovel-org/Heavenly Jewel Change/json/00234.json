Little Fatty\u2019s Power (2)</strong></p><br/><p>It must be remembered that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Flying Lightning God was now on a completely different level compared to the past.\u00a0As his Heavenly Energy had been transformed into Saint Energy, all of his techniques were activated via Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>The nucleus of every single Lightning Pearl was filled with dim, silvery-white light.\u00a0When the thousands of Lightning Pearls exploded at the same time, they instantly tore the very air itself apart.\u00a0Within that area of hundreds of meters, an enormous black hole appeared.\u00a0Dimensional space itself had been obliterated by those thousands of exploding Lightning Pearls!</p><br/><p>Right!\u00a0Zhou Weiqing had sensed someone following him and Bing\u2019er early on.\u00a0In fact, he had sensed this person as soon as he had left Heavenly Jewel Island.\u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he had fused his Saint Energy and his Ice Cold Perception together, he never would\u2019ve been able to discover those two hidden, faint auras.\u00a0These two auras had followed from behind ever since he left Zhongtian City, and the faint murderous feelings emanating from them made Zhou Weiqing certain that they were not coming with good intentions.\u00a0Thus, he had lured them here and then suddenly attacked.</p><br/><p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing attacked, Shangguan Bing\u2019er had drawn the Ghost Demon Horse into her ring.\u00a0A pair of enormous wings appeared behind her back, and with a flick of her wings she instantly vanished.\u00a0That way, she wouldn\u2019t be hit by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s terrifying Flying Lightning God technique.</p><br/><p>Two haggard-looking figures were blasted out of the area where the Flying Lightning God had just exploded.\u00a0They immediately unleashed an awesome aura of destruction, preventing more of the terrifying explosive power from hitting them.</p><br/><p>Their bodies were emanating red-colored Heavenly Energy with the aura of the Destruction-attribute.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t need to ask who they were; he knew they had to be powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell.\u00a0He never would\u2019ve thought that during the entire half year he had spent at Heavenly Jewel Island, the Blood Red Hell had kept people stationed at Zhongtian City the entire time.\u00a0Without question, their goal was to kill him.\u00a0And\u2026 Zhou Weiqing was able to sense their levels.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Kings!\u00a0These two people secretly following him were Heavenly King powerhouses.</p><br/><p>Indeed. Even the powerful Dan Dun Battle Team of the Blood Red Hell with its two promising young eight-Jeweled Destruction-attribute powerhouses had been defeated by Zhou Weiqing. \u00a0If they wanted to be certain of killing him, their best chance lay in sending Heavenly King powerhouses.</p><br/><p>Previously, Zhou Weiqing had only sensed that the people following him from behind were not weak.\u00a0He never would\u2019ve imagined that the two were actually Heavenly Kings!\u00a0Although they were only low level Heavenly Kings, they remained Heavenly King powerhouses!\u00a0As he laughed bitterly to himself, he continued to press the assault.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Kings possessed the ability to fly.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t very realistic for him to try and escape them, as that would only result in death.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing was different from the past!\u00a0Although his set of Consolidated Equipment wasn\u2019t complete, as a nine-Jeweled expert he was no longer the same Zhou Little Fatty who had been completely unable to resist Heavenly Kings at all.</p><br/><p>The Hate Ground No Handle equipment instantly appeared on his body. As the Flying Lightning God exploded, Zhou Weiqing didn\u2019t pause at all in immediately charging towards one of the two Heavenly Kings of the Blood Red Hell.</p><br/><p>It had to be said that the two Heavenly King powerhouses looked to be in a sorry state.\u00a0Holes had been blasted into their clothes by that terrifying explosion!\u00a0Zhou Weiqing had simply moved too fast and had given them no warning at all, while the Flying Lightning God had been far more powerful than they had imagined.\u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Heavenly King powerhouses were able to vaguely sense danger, causing them to immediately unleash their own Consolidated Equipment, they probably would\u2019ve immediately suffered severe injuries.</p><br/><p>Even so, their situation was still grim.\u00a0That explosive Lightning-attribute energy was causing wild havoc within their bodies, and the powerful numbing sensation caused their movements to be slowed.\u00a0What astonished them the most was that their Destruction-attribute energy was actually unable to withstand the surging Lightning energy.\u00a0How could they not be stunned by this?</p><br/><p>The twisting light almost instantly shone upon one of the Heavenly King powerhouses.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Blink skill was unleashed in a seamless, perfect fashion.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King powerhouse felt his entire body tense up as though everything around him seemed to slow down, while Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual Legendary Hammers came smashing down directly at his head.</p><br/><p>Absolute Delay! Now that it was being used by Saint Energy, it was even more powerful than Zhou Weiqing could imagine. Even a Heavenly King powerhouse had no immunity whatsoever against his Absolute Delay. The Heavenly King powerhouse was only able to struggle to lift up his arms, using the longsword in his hand to block against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual Hammers.</p><br/><p>Alas, right at this moment, he saw Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes shoot out twin beams of purple-red light.\u00a0The strange thing was, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual Legendary Hammers had also instantly turned purple-red in color!</p><br/><p>This had all happened without any warning. A beam of purple-red light suddenly shot out of the Crying-face Hammer in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s left hand, shining down upon the Heavenly King. Under the effects of Absolute Delay, the Heavenly King had no chance to dodge at all. His Consolidated Equipment suddenly and silently vanished, and so he now had nothing he could use against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual Hammers. Faced with tremendous danger, all he could do was to cross his arms and sluggishly attempt to defend against the oncoming strike.</p><br/><p>BOOM!\u00a0He let out a miserable scream as his arms were instantly torn apart into bloody bits of flesh by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual Hammers.\u00a0He still only had five pieces of the Hate Earth No Handle, which meant that they only multiplied his power by thirty-two times, but it must be remembered that Zhou Weiqing was now at the nine-Jeweled level.\u00a0In other words, it was a nine-Jeweled level of power which was multiplied.\u00a0This was thirty-two times the power of a nine-Jeweled Strength-type Physical Jewel, not the original six-Jeweled level.\u00a0What did this mean?\u00a0It meant that even a Heavenly King powerhouse who had lost his equipment and had to face this head-on would suffer miserably!</p><br/><p>The Dual Hammers had destroyed his arms, then delivered a vicious blow to the Heavenly King\u2019s chest.\u00a0His body was smashed into the ground, caving in the dirt beneath him.\u00a0The Heavenly King spat out a mouthful of blood.\u00a0Although he was still alive for now thanks to his mighty power, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strike had thoroughly and heavily wounded him.</p><br/><p>Even Zhou Weiqing himself was stunned by this, to say nothing of this Heavenly King.\u00a0He never would\u2019ve imagined that a Heavenly King powerhouse would crumple like paper before his strikes.\u00a0Even if his attack was very powerful and very sudden, his opponent was still a Heavenly King!\u00a0How was it that his foe had folded so easily before his strikes?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a terrifying ripple of power coming from behind him caused him to feel a sense of shock.\u00a0Not hesitating at all, Zhou Weiqing spun in midair as he spun his Dual Hammers, a dense stream of silver light that forming a \u2018shield\u2019 behind him.</p><br/><p>A loud explosion rang out.\u00a0The sudden attack had actually been blocked by his shield of silver light!\u00a0The powerful stab had sent sparks flying everywhere, but it was unable to breach the shield which Zhou Weiqing had Consolidated using Spatial Rend technique.\u00a0The attacker was the second Heavenly King powerhouse!</p><br/><p>When the second Heavenly King had seen as his comrade was heavily injured by a single blow from Zhou Weiqing, he had immediately felt a sense of amazement.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t even able to see or understand how Zhou Weiqing had done this!</p><br/><p>Two streaks of azure light suddenly shot out from the skies above, sweeping downwards.\u00a0It was a pair of enormous wings, and it was like an azure tornado had suddenly swept across the Heavenly King.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lifted up his Dual Hammers, shooting out yet another streak of purple-red light.\u00a0Just now, he had used the same beam of light to dispose of the first Heavenly King.\u00a0He was going to use the same technique again.\u00a0What was it?\u00a0It was the Dragon Silencing Seal, which had been used without first accumulating power at all!</p><br/><p>The dazzling purple-red light flashed and then vanished almost instantly. The Heavenly King had just lifted up his longstaff to block the descending attack from Shangguan Bing\u2019er, but all of a sudden he realized that his Consolidated Equipment had melted away.</p><br/><p>However, he still had a few pieces of equipment left which he had used before the purple-red light had arrived.\u00a0An enormous illusion of a turtle instantly formed behind him, glowing with thick red light that was intermixed with terrifying Destruction-attribute energy which formed a barrier of light which knocked away the attack from Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>However, in the next moment his technique vanished alongside the rest of his Consolidated Equipment.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual Hammers had instantly appeared before him as well!</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King finally understood why his comrade had been heavily wounded by Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0This youth who they were targeting was able to instantly employ techniques without needing to build up power first.\u00a0Worse, his techniques were vastly more powerful than they had imagined.\u00a0Nine-Jeweled?\u00a0How could he be nine-Jeweled?!\u00a0Wasn\u2019t this target supposed to be just six-Jeweled?</p><br/><p>Alas, there was no time for him to ponder these questions.\u00a0In fact, he was given no chance to do anything at all.\u00a0His entire body stiffened as countless streams of light simultaneously shot down upon him, and in that instant he discovered that they had transformed into a powerful binding force which immediately began to crush away at every single part of his body.\u00a0He was a Heavenly King powerhouse, but he was actually unable to unleash any attacks at all!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er was able to see everything perfectly.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual Legendary Hammers had been used in conjunction with the Fetters of Wind, Absolute Delay, and Touch of Darkness.\u00a0These techniques fell upon the Heavenly King in succession, causing it so that even the arms he wanted to use to defend against Zhou Weiqing immediately froze in position.</p><br/><p>However, Heavenly King powerhouses were still Heavenly King powerhouses.\u00a0The Heavenly King\u2019s movements had been completely restricted and the Dual Legendary Hammers were crashing down towards his head, but Zhou Weiqing suddenly saw the man\u2019s eyes become filled with a berserk aura of Destruction-energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d He once more used his Blink skill, no longer caring about attacking this opponent. Zhou Weiqing instantly reappeared next to Shangguan Bing\u2019er. He pulled her into his arms, then unfurled the wings of his Dragon-Tiger Transformation behind him to completely protect Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Just as he finished doing this, a surge of power filled with madness and Destruction-attribute energy suddenly exploded behind him.\u00a0The Heavenly King from the Blood Red Hell instantly transformed to become a terrifying blood red color, then exploded in terrifying fashion.\u00a0A ball of red fire exploded forth from his Dantian, then flew straight towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>He had actually managed to break free from the bindings of the Dragon Silencing Seal. This was because he had actually chosen to self-detonate, blowing up his Heavenly Core Nucleus! This was definitely the most powerful strike a Heavenly King powerhouse could unleash, and the aura of this strike was such that there was no way Zhou Weiqing could flee from it with Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King of the Blood Red Hell who had chosen to self-detonate his Core Nucleus had an insane look in his eyes.\u00a0He had no choice but to do this.\u00a0His comrade was clearly incapable of fighting any further, while he himself was unable to block Zhou Weiqing\u2019s bizarre attacks.\u00a0Rather than let Zhou Weiqing kill him, he would rather fight to the very end.\u00a0The Blood Red Hell had a secret technique that could allow someone to survive even a self-detonation of a Heavenly Core Nucleus, but it would take him ten years in order to slowly rebuild his body again.\u00a0This was an agonizing price to pay, but it was much better than being killed.</p><br/><p>When Heavenly Jewel Masters fought, they would generally try to end the battles quickly even if they were stronger than their foes.\u00a0Unless you were significantly more powerful, if your foe managed to seize the initiative with his techniques he could end up killing you in a short period of time.\u00a0Thus, he chose to immediately use a suicide attack to try and kill his foe.</p><br/><p>His flaming red Heavenly Core Nucleus smashed directly into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back, causing terrifying Destruction flames to instantly erupt and cover both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er, who was protected within his twin wings.</p><br/><p>As for the Heavenly King of the Blood Red Hell, he collapsed to the ground, his entire body covered with countless bleeding wounds. The giant bloody hole in his Dantian was the most terrifying of all. All he was able to do was to just barely use the final scraps of his Heavenly Energy to try and seal his blood vessels. \u00a0At the Heavenly King level, if you didn\u2019t instantly die then you could have a chance to survive even if you lost all of your blood.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 his movements suddenly froze as a golden light appeared before him, filled with an aura of sharpness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

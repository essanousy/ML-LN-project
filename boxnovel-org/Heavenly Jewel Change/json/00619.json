Sensing the terrifying bloodline aura within him, a flash of surprise flickered across Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>This Dragon-Tiger Transformation, even the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord had never seen or heard of before. It could be said to be one of a kind in the entire Mainland. Although Shangguan Tianyue had heard Xue\u2019er speak of it, it was an entirely different matter to look upon it with his own eyes, to feel it with his senses\u2026 only then did he truly sense how miraculous it was. He couldn\u2019t help but nod to himself inwardly. This little brat\u2019s power\u2026 one definitely could not judge him with ordinary logic.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. We are alone now. Speak then. If you aren\u2019t able to satisfy me, I\u2019ll kick you down again.\u201d Shangguan Tianyue crossed his arms, looking at Zhou Weiqing with a bleak face.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned, moving forward a few steps, a fawning look upon his face.</p><br/><p>Looking at him like that, Shangguan Tianyue couldn\u2019t help but chuckle to himself inwardly, thinking: This little brat, why does he not have the proper look of the powerhouse that he is\u2026 Still, this is also a good psychology\u2026 at least he doesn\u2019t have the overbearing arrogance that most young talents have. No wonder he is able to accomplish so many impressive things.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you need to get so close to me. Hurry up and speak.\u201d Shangguan Tianyue furrowed his brow and said unhappily, despite his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing lowered his voice dramatically as he said: \u201cFather in law, this is a matter of critical importance, no one else can hear it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue glared at him exasperatedly before he waved his hands. Instantly, a faint milky white shield of light enclosed the two of them.</p><br/><p>This was naturally Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s terrifying Heavenly Emperor stage Heavenly Energy. With this layer of Heavenly Energy covering them, even if the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord was outside, he would not be able to hear what they were speaking of inside.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhou Weiqing speak, still in the low tone: \u201cFather in Law, I know that I am wrong to want to marry all three of your daughters, I indeed have a heart that loves too much, and it is my fault. However, it is true that for Bing\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Xue\u2019er, following me is absolutely the right choice\u2026 the best choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, as long as you agree to our marriage, I have confidence that not long in the future, all three of them sisters will definitely reach the Heavenly God Stage. Isn\u2019t that a matter that would truly determine the future of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue looked at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s confident expression and couldn\u2019t help but be stunned slightly. \u201cHmph, even if you say Heavenly God Stage, does it really mean Heavenly God Stage? Anyone can make empty promises. Nonsense\u2026 nonsense\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said in surprise: \u201cWhat do you mean empty promises\u2026 Father in Law, didn\u2019t Xue\u2019er inform you about the Saint Energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s turn to be surprised. \u201cSaint Energy? What Saint Energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing fell silent. If one examined him closely and knew him well, they would be able to see within his eyes \u2026 a hint that he had been greatly moved.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue actually didn\u2019t know about the Saint Energy\u2026 what did that prove? Shangguan Xue\u2019er had not even told her father about the Saint Energy that they had. As the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace heir, even when she had returned home, she had kept his secret even from those closest to her. How could Zhou Weiqing not be touched\u2026 be moved?!</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue looked at Zhou Weiqing, puzzled. \u201cSpeak then! What is this Saint Energy you speak of? How come Xue\u2019er never spoke of it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath, calming his agitated emotions. Originally, in his heart, Shangguan Bing\u2019er was the most important, followed by Shangguan Fei\u2019er1, while his feelings for Shangguan Xue\u2019er was perhaps relatively more surface or lighter. However, at this moment, he had already set his resolve that no matter what, he would definitely marry all three Shangguan Sisters, and he would never forgive himself if he had to give up on any one.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing set his resolve to do something, he would definitely give it his all. Furthermore, at such a time, it was when his mind was clearest and at its peak.</p><br/><p>Taking another deep breath, he cleared his mind and ensured all his lines of thoughts. At last, Zhou Weiqing said solemnly: \u201cFather in Law, have you heard about the miracles of the four Saint Attributes gathered together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes flickered. \u201cTime, Spirit, Divine and the original Demonic Attribute\u2026 all four Saint Attributes gathered together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: \u201cExactly. There are legends which say that when the four Saint Attributes gather together, one can breakthrough past the Heavenly God Tier, the restriction of the twelve Jewels of the Heavenly Jewel Change, to gain the thirteenth Personal Jewel. This is the Legendary Heavenly Change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s heart was sent in turmoil by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, but he nodded calmly and said: \u201cI have heard that legend. Continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cAs you know, my Elemental Jewels consist of six Attributes. Amongst them, there is the Time Attribute and the Demonic Attribute\u2026 two Saint Attributes. My Demonic Attribute can be said to be the only original-Awakened Demonic Attribute in the world today, at least currently one of a kind. As for the Heavenly Snow Mountain Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger direct descendents, they have the Spirit and Divine Attributes. That is to say, when I am \u2026 ahem\u2026 cultivating together with one of the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers, we would have gathered the four Saint Attributes together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s brow began to twitch, and the light in his eyes began to fluctuate. He nodded and said: \u201cYou are referring to Tian\u2019er right? I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: \u201cYes, it is Tian\u2019er. After countless experiments, we have begun to have a feel for the true cultivation technique of the four Saint Attributes together\u2026 and from there, we have formed a strange new energy\u2026 a whole new one that does not belong to the knowledge of any Heavenly Jewel Master. We call it the Saint Energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pausing, Zhou Weiqing finally continued. \u201c\u2026 It is difficult for me to describe it with words alone, and perhaps just by saying it you might not understand. Let me show you my Saint Energy and once you feel it, you will understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing lifted his right hand, moving it before Shangguan Tianyue. A silvery white light flashed in his eyes, and instantly, that right hand turned the similar silver-white colour.</p><br/><p>The faint glow of light surrounded his palm, moving gently and rhythmically. As soon as the light appeared, the powerful Heavenly Energy shield that Shangguan Tianyue had surrounded them with began to shake violently.</p><br/><p>As the owner of the Heavenly Energy, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s sensation was the deepest. He was shocked to discover that his own Heavenly Energy had began to produce\u2026 an emotion akin to fear?! Was it actually afraid of the faint silvery white light in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands?</p><br/><p>How was this possible? As a Heavenly Emperor, his Heavenly Energy had already reached the Heavenly Dao stage, and more so, was already at the later stage. Even his elder brother Shangguan Tianyang, or even the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, though their cultivation levels were higher than him, just using a bit of energy reverberations, they would never be able to cause his Heavenly Energy to show such a strange fear. This was something impossible as far as he knew.</p><br/><p>Yet, Zhou Weiqing had done just that. Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s heart could be said to be surging with turbulent thoughts and emotions. Slowly lifting his hand, he grasped onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand, his powerful spiritual energy gathering to sense the energy on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>As soon as he did so, Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s eyes were instantly filled with shock.</p><br/><p>When he extended his spiritual energy to sense, he naturally needed to infuse some of his Heavenly Energy to increase his senses. However, as soon as he did so, Shangguan Tianyue felt his Heavenly Energy was like ice water which had entered lava, disappearing in an instant.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the energy in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palm seemed as boundless and infinite, not belonging to any type of attribute, instantly causing his spiritual energy to shrivel in moments.</p><br/><p>As such, his hand could only stay on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palm for a split second, before he let go immediately, subconsciously taking a step back.</p><br/><p>Standing there, Shangguan Tianyue closed his eyes, his full concentration on what he had felt in that instant, and the changes in energy.</p><br/><p>Boundless\u2026 infinite\u2026 with no attributes, yet seemingly encompassing all attributes. Saint Energy\u2026 this was the Saint Energy that was created from the gathering of the four Saint Attributes?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing withdrew his right hand and his Saint Energy before saying solemnly: \u201cFather in Law, Tian\u2019er and I have only just begun cultivating this Saint Energy. It can be said that we have barely scratched the surface on the intricacies of the four Saint Attributes and this Saint Energy. However, I truly believe that with this Saint Energy, we can perform countless miracles in the future. As for the interflow of this Saint Energy, it requires \u2026 intimate relations between man and women to undergo. Through this method, we can transfer Saint Energy. That is to say, my future wives will all gain the benefit of the Saint Energy, which is boundless and inexhaustible. Currently, what we know of the Saint Energy is its greatest strength is in creation. You should have heard about the strange Hell\u2019s Angel phenomenon that appeared at our Crescent City, causing countless destruction right. In truth, that Skill was unleashed by myself and Tian\u2019er, using this very Saint Energy. As long as you are willing to marry Bing\u2019er, Fei\u2019er and Xue\u2019er to me, I can guarantee that with the help of Saint Energy, they will definitely reach the Heavenly God Stage. When that happens, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace can truly become the First Great Saint Lands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue furrowed his brow, an uncertain light in his eyes. If one were to say that he was not drawn in or attracted by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, that would definitely be impossible. After feeling the Saint Energy and its terrifying strength by himself, he knew deep within himself how scary it truly was. If what Zhou Weiqing said was true, the future that lay in the Saint Energy was infinite. With this unique energy, it should not be too difficult to break through to the Heavenly God Stage. However, if he had to give up all three daughters for that, especially Shangguan Xue\u2019er, to marry Zhou Weiqing, he still did not feel too willing.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d Shangguan Tianyue waved his hands once more. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing felt himself covered with a hazy white. In the next instant, he could sense that he had left their original position.</p><br/><p>It did not take long, and by the time the surroundings cleared up in his eyes, Zhou Weiqing discovered that he was in a clean stone room. Clearly, they had entered the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s voice traveled out. \u201cWait here.\u201d As soon as he said that, his presence vanished instantly.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing understood that Shangguan Tianyue must have gone to look for Shangguan Tianyang. Such a serious matter of major importance, the two brothers definitely had to discuss in detail before making their decision, and Shangguan Tianyue alone could not do so.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was not urgent at all. Previously, when he had spoken those words, he had already thought things through. The story about needing intimate relations between man and woman to transfer the Saint Energy, naturally that part was made up by him. However, everything else was true, and with the sheer power of the Saint Energy, he knew that Shangguan Tianyue would definitely believe him. After all, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er had always cultivated in paired cultivation.</p>\n</div>"}

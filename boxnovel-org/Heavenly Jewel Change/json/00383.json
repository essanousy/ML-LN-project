They were clearly still rather wary of Zhou Weiqing, but Wei Feng waved them away. He knew that if Zhou Weiqing wanted to harm in, he could have done so earlier. Furthermore, Wei Feng was extremely confident that he would still be of great use.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Wei Feng returned to Xiong Guangming\u2019s tent.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing turned to him and said: \u201cVice Commander Wei, please inform me, what do you think the three greatest difficulties our Ruffian Battalion is facing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Wei Feng said: \u201cThe first problem is food. As you have already seen, Commander Zhou, this is the far north, and very few vegetation can survive in the extreme climate here. Furthermore, this isn\u2019t even the coldest season yet. Those northern army bastards will only send us some of the lowest quality food, and at quantities that aren\u2019t even close to being sufficient. Every day, our brothers have to go hungry, otherwise our combat capabilities would be at least increased by another thirty percent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn\u2026 what else?\u201d Zhou Weiqing said, a thoughtful look on his face.</p><br/><p>Wei Feng continued: \u201cThe second problem is naturally our equipment. I\u2019m not just talking about weapons and armour, but even some of the simpler tools for survival. We pretty much lack all sorts of resources, equipment, strategic materials and tools, all of which are highly important. In truth, every year we are sent several hundred men to fill our numbers and replace losses, but as you can see, our overall number maintains at around a thousand. We currently have one thousand two hundred men. I have been here for ten years, and I have seen too many brothers die. Not on the battlefield, but from cold, starvation or sickness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe third problem we have is our Jewel Masters\u2019 Consolidated Equipment and Stored Skills. In terms of overall power, I dare say that our Ruffian Battalion is definitely the strongest Battalion in the entire ZhongTian Empire, as amongst us, we number three hundred and sixty two Physical Jewel Masters and forty nine Elemental Jewel Masters. As for the rest, they all have some form of Heavenly Energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d It was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s turn to be shocked. Although he had high expectations of the Ruffian Battalion, he had not even dreamed that they would be so strong, with so much potential.</p><br/><p>A bitter look crossed Wei Feng\u2019s face as he said: \u201cThat is the law of nature, only the strong survive and the weak perish. So many years have passed, and well, none of the people sent here are any kindhearted souls. Without power, who could survive causing trouble in the army, to actually be sent to the Ruffian Battalion? Furthermore, it is so tough to survive here, and anyone weaker has likely died, and only the strong remain. However, out of so many Jewel Masters, the number who have complete Stored Skills or Consolidated Equipment are few and far between. Of the over three hundred Physical Jewel Masters, all their Consolidated Equipment added together still numbers less than two hundred\u2026 a body full of Heavenly Energy but unable to use it to their full potential. That is also the reason why when Commander Zhou said you were a Consolidating equipment Master, everyone\u2019s gaze turned so heated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded slightly and said: \u201cI understand. Vice Commander Wei, tell me more about the current situation of the Ruffian Battalion then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng started momentarily, then said: \u201cDidn\u2019t I just say already?! Everyone is just here to pass the time and wait for death. After all, we have nowhere left to go, not even back to the Empire. In front of us are wolves, behind us are tigers\u2026 for us to be able to survive, it is already considered a miracle. What sort of current situation is there? We can just barely survive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled passively and said: \u201cIt looks like Vice Commander Wei still does not treat me as one of your own. In truth, there are some things that just cannot be hidden. Let me ask you a question, since our Ruffian Battalion is so close to the north border\u2026 When the WanShou Empire army attacks, how can our Ruffian Battalion possibly survive? In terms of strength, I dare say that the WanShou Empire can overrun our Ruffian Battalion in seconds. Furthermore, with just these tents\u2026 when the true winter comes and the bitter cold hits, without enough food\u2026 even Physical Jewel Masters will not be able to survive, let alone the ordinary soldiers\u2026 So\u2026 If I have not guessed wrongly, the Ruffian Battalion definitely has some other secrets\u2026 perhaps\u2026 a hidden base of safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, Wei Feng\u2019s face changed, and he looked at Zhou Weiqing with a powerful killing intent.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing ignored it, as if he could not sense the killing intent. Smiling, he said: \u201cIf I can think of it, I\u2019m sure the northern army command can easily think of it too. Yet, why haven\u2019t they done anything about it, allow you all to stay here? From that, I can say that the Ruffian Battalion still has some use to the northern army command. Vice Commander Wei\u2026 I haven\u2019t gotten anything wrong yet right\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng took several deep breaths before finally calming himself down. If not for the fact he knew he was no match to Zhou Weiqing, he would have taken action already.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of that\u2026 you actually guessed all of it?\u201d Wei Feng said solemnly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at him closely, then said: \u201cMore accurately, it was my judgement. To be honest, it wasn\u2019t even hard to think of all that\u2026 as long as anyone came here to look for themselves, it isn\u2019t a stretch of imagination to guess all of it. After all, no matter the terrible conditions\u2026 you all are still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne more thing. You must remember, I am not your enemy. Since I have been sent to the Ruffian Battalion, then I will definitely let our Ruffian Battalion grow strong. In truth, this place is not bad, at least no one will be here to order us around or restrict us. Vice Commander Wei, let us be frank and above-board with each other. The three problems that you mentioned, I will definitely solve them in three months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng laughed coldly: \u201cIt is hard for me to believe that what you say isn\u2019t just some empty big talk. Those three problems have plagued us for more than ten years, do you think it can be solved just so easily just because you say so? Especially so for the lack of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls\u2026 that is at least a thousand Scrolls\u2026 even if you are a Consolidating Equipment Master, with just you alone, how can you possibly create a thousand Consolidating Equipment Scrolls in three months?! Let alone, the sheer cost of the materials, that is an insane amount in the first place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled passively and said: \u201cSince I dare to say it, I will definitely do it. In any case, I am already the temporary Battalion Commander for three months, and if I can\u2019t do as I say, I will get lost. What do you have to lose? In any case, you do not have to tell me all the secrets of the Ruffian Battalion now; if in three months you all think that I am worthy of continuing as Battalion Commander, it is not too late to tell me then. However, I have one thing I must tell you in advance. I am not here just to lead you all, but to command you all. I can give you a great life, a wonderful life, with money, women, power. However, you all must submit to me. In this world, in order to gain something, there is always a price. If in the future you all gain everything from me, and do not wish to pay the cost, then I will wipe you all out from the face of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou are threatening me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: \u201cThat is not a threat, just a fact. Alright, earlier, the twenty sets of the personal guard\u2019s equipment, you arrange for them to be given out. As for horses, how much food do we have left in the camp?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng look at Zhou Weiqing deeply before saying: \u201cWe still have some rations left, Battalion Commander do you wish to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cIt is not only for me. From now on, increase the rations for our brothers. I will deal with the lack of food first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng said: \u201cIt is not only the lack of food, the pressing problem now would be the Sixteenth Regiment. If they come looking for trouble, I\u2019m afraid Battalion Commander Zhou will have to handle it personally. As for the two \u2018guesses\u2019 or judgements you mentioned earlier, it is no problem telling you actually. The real reason why we have always been able to survive is because we have burrowed many tunnels across these hills. At the border, there are several of our scouts lining the place, and as soon as the WanShou Empire army shows any sign of movement, we will all move out into the tunnels, to ensure they will not find us. As for the value we hold to the northern army command, that is exactly this information. At first notice, we will send note of any such movement to the northern command as well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled as he inclined his head in agreement, saying: \u201cPretty close to what I had guessed. Alright, for the Sixteenth Regiment, I will handle it, you do not need to worry. These few days, make sure everyone is well fed. Also, I need you to choose a hundred of our most elite warriors, including all the Company Leaders. Three days later, I will have a plan of action\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng\u2019s heart gripped tightly involuntarily, and he said: \u201cBattalion Commander Zhou, I need to remind you that our brothers\u2019 lives are the most valuable thing in my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked him in the eye unwaveringly and said: \u201cI\u2019m more afraid of death than any of you. Before we head off, there are two things to do. First of all, I want to change the name of our First Unique Battalion\u2026 Ruffian Battalion just sounds so terrible. Secondly, I want to set a few rules for our Battalion. Tomorrow morning, you gather the troops to hear me out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng said passively: \u201cCommander Zhou, gathering the troops is not such an easy task. You should know that those that are sent here, and remain her, are mostly the unruly sort, old and wily soldiers in their own right. It isn\u2019t so easy to command these fellows.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: \u201cThat is simple. You tell everyone, whoever reports on time tomorrow will be given a gold coin. It will be given out there and then, no owing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Reporting to a gathering\u2026 they will also get money?\u201d Wei Feng started.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: \u201cI will teach you how to be a true scoundrel, a real ruffian or rogue. I am not here to teach you all how to be \u2018good\u2019 people, after all, I have never thought of myself as a good person either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng laughed. \u201cCommander Zhou, I am finding myself more and more interested in you. Very well, we\u2019ll see then. I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Feng left the tent, and Shangguan Fei\u2019er walked over to Zhou Weiqing, saying curiously. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a mere gathering, why do you need to give them money? If they don\u2019t listen, just beat them up until they do\u2026 I can help you do that, I\u2019ll be happy to do something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: \u201cIf they are ordinary soldiers, your method is definitely the right one. However, this is the Ruffian Battalion, a bunch of scoundrels and rogues, even if you use your method to force them one time, they will not be willing, or genuinely convinced, and worse yet, will harbour evil thoughts. To such people, luring them with the promise of profit is far superior than any other method. As long as I gather them into a group that is bound together by a large profit, where everyone in the group will gain so much that they cannot resist\u2026 only then can they truly be mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said, confused: \u201cSuch an army\u2026 can it really fight on the battlefield? If everything depends on profit, if they meet a powerful enemy, wouldn\u2019t they run even before they fought?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

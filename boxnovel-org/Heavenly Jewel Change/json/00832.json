What\u2019s the point bearing the title of being the most powerful person in the world? From today onwards, Heavenly Snow Mountain has ceased to exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Shangguan Tianyang stared straight into Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s eyes, \u201cBrother Xue, I\u2019m deeply sorry about the catastrophe that fell upon the Heavenly Snow Mountain, but regardless if it were to be you or the Heavenly Snow Mountain, this is a sacrifice that you had to pay for the sake of the mainland\u2019s survival. Before I came here for the Grand Tournament, I\u2019ve received news that the Dandun Empire has launched an attack on the Zhongtian Empire. It\u2019s entirely conceivable that if the battle here fails, the entire mainland will plunge into misery and suffering. Brother Xue, as long as you\u2019re willing to, we from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace can you half of the area on Heavenly Jewel Island to you so that you can rebuild your glory. At the same time, I give you my word that we, the Zhongtian Empire, will sponsor all the food the Wan Shou Empire requires during the winter months from this day on. However, you\u2019d naturally have to give the order to control the population of your country, Brother Xue.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s words, Xue Ao\u2019tian could not help but be touched by his gesture, \u201cTianyang, are you really serious? I don\u2019t need the Heavenly Jewel Island but if you can help solve the famine of the Wan Shou Empire, you can count on us to do our part in fighting against the Dandun Empire. Ao\u2019ying, Yingbing, both of you, go now! Pick ten of the most elite soldiers and go forth to assist the Zhongtian Empire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Xue Ao\u2019ying and Gu Yingbing replied respectfully as they turned to leave. Before they left, Gu Yingbing deliberately cast a look onto Zhou Weiqing who was still levitating in the distant sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Shangguan Tianyang hurriedly said, \u201cYou can\u2019t just go off like that! Tianyue, you go with them. Escort the Tiger and Lion King to the frontier. I\u2019ll skip the formality of showering you with thanks. However, Brother Xue, with all the members of the Peerless Sect present here as my witness, I\u2019m sure all of you have heard me earlier. I\u2019ll definitely honor my words!\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile which was hard to come by appeared on Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s face, as he took the initiative and extended his right hand to Shangguan Tianyang. With a laugh, the latter stretched out his right hand before extending a firm handshake to Xue Ao\u2019tian.</p><br/><p>Both the lords of two great Saint Lands who had been fighting against each other for their entire lives had finally reconciled under such a circumstance, to solve the misery and suffering in the northern regions of the mainland.</p><br/><p>After repeatedly forewarning her daughters to be careful, Shangguan Tianyue hastily left the scene with Xue Ao\u2019ying and Gu Yingbing. In truth, from his point of view, he was actually not willing to leave at such a time. This battle had yet to end and what was more important was whether or not Zhou Weiqing would be able to defeat Fen Tian. However, he also understood fairly well that neither Shangguan Tianyang nor Xue Ao\u2019tian was entirely certain regarding the ultimate outcome of this battle. Finding a reason to let the three of them go at once was to hold on to whatever kindling they could for the survival of their own Saint Land.</p><br/><p>Just as Shangguan Tianyue left, a platinum-colored light suddenly spread out from Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complete! The Heavenly God Tier! They\u2019re both Heavenly Gods now!\u201d Shangguan Tianyang almost cheered with joy.</p><br/><p>In truth, both he and Xue Ao\u2019tian did not have high expectations in this battle at all. After all, the gap between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian was just too huge. Not only that, Fen Tian had used such a long period of time to accumulate his strength and one could easily imagine the immense magnitude of his boost in power would be. However, things appeared to be very different now.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er actually achieved a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Tier with Zhou Weiqing. In fact, both of them possessed Saint Energy as their power! To top it all off, it was Creation Saint Energy! With the two of them joining forces, they stood a greater chance of winning against Fen Tian now.</p><br/><p>Slowly opening his eyes, Zhou Weiqing breathed in the thrill of having a completely different type of Saint Energy in his body, along with the breakthrough that he had just undergone. A smile slowly crept up on his face.</p><br/><p>At this moment, regardless if it was him or Tian\u2019er, both of them felt like they had been washed off from all the bad, leaving only the good behind. Both of their dispositions had also changed dramatically.</p><br/><p>Originally, there was still a hint of evil in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body but right now, he seemed to be a noble person with the utmost integrity in this world. Easygoing, warm, righteous, kind, and all sorts of positive traits could easily be found in him now.</p><br/><p>It was the same for Tian\u2019er as well. The only thing was that the Saint Energy ripple in her body was much weaker than that of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>A breakthrough with Saint Energy was always different from the Heavenly Energy. With the help of Galaxia Feedback Energy, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er harmonized with each other perfectly and achieved a breakthrough to become Heavenly Gods in the end. Within just a short period of time, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was immediately raised to the Middle-Level of the Heavenly God Tier while Tian\u2019er\u2019s was at the Lower-Level of the Heavenly God Tier. At any rate, Zhou Weiqing was the person who first initiated breakthrough but the person who benefited the most from it was none other than Tian\u2019er. Within a short duration, she had made a huge leap in crossing several bottlenecks.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, the big surprise has yet to come,\u201d said Long Shiya triumphantly to Shangguan Tianyang and Xue Ao\u2019tian. Seeing his beloved disciple becoming a Heavenly God and with a strength that far exceeded himself, one could easily imagine the swelling excitement and joy that Six Ultimate Heavenly God felt.</p><br/><p>Xue Aot\u2019ian and Shangguan Tianyang did not even attempt to hide the envy that they felt towards Long Shiya. After glaring at him fiercely, they turned their gaze towards Zhou Weiqing and waited for the miracle that Long Shiya had just mentioned.</p><br/><p>Right now, the biggest emotion they felt was regret. When they first came across, or rather, got to know Zhou Weiqing, they certainly had the opportunity to take him into their own Saint Land but unfortunately, they did not show enough sincerity toward him at that time.</p><br/><p>When Long Shiya was speaking, Zhou Weiqing already gradually lifted his right hand until it was fully over his head. What followed next was a loud dragon\u2019s roar that erupted from his hand.</p><br/><p>A turquoise light instantly surged and without warning, it transformed into a gigantic Jade Dragon in mid-air as it circled above Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The white golden light that was spreading in the air suddenly converged and rushed into the body of the Jade Dragon in a frenzied manner, dyeing its entire body in white and gold. After the gigantic dragon had completed its ninth circle in the air, it charged straight down all the way into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>At this moment, in order not to affect Tian\u2019er, Zhou Weiqing released her hand for a short while. With a white flash, he entered the gigantic dragon\u2019s body and an intense platinum-colored light erupted from Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What\u2019s that?\u201d Stunned, Xue Ao\u2019tian asked.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, tremors could be heard in Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s voice, \u201cT-That\u2019s the e-eleventh piece of his legendary armor s-set! H-He actually has the e-eleventh piece of the legendary armor set? H-How is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang was clear that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eleventh piece was totally different from the eleventh piece of his Boundless Infinitum Set\u2019s. Only a Heavenly God can make full use of the power of the armor set. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing himself was not an ordinary Heavenly God! He was a Heavenly God who possessed Saint Energy. Even if Shangguan Tianyang managed to achieve a breakthrough and become a Heavenly God, he would still be unable to compete with the power of this legendary armor set. At this moment, the Boundless Infinitum Set that was once ranked as the best legendary armor set had now completely been taken over.</p><br/><p>It was also at this time that the purplish-black ball of light on the other side started to show signs of change.</p><br/><p>Layers of the purplish-black light started to cluster up toward the middle and the originally huge ball of light gradually shrunk. The image of the huge crab in the air slowly disappeared without warning.</p><br/><p>However, an apocalyptic force soared up to the sky and forcefully bulldozed away the surrounding platinum light. The tyrannical Destruction Energy erupted in a force that was so devastating to everyone present.</p><br/><p>As the Demon God disappeared, the Destruction God vanished without a trace as well. Once again, Fen Tian\u2019s figure appeared right in front of everyone\u2019s eyes but now, he was no longer the same as he was before.</p><br/><p>The legendary armor set on his body had turned into a peculiar dark purplish color. His arms had become exceptionally thick and four jointed long legs seemed to have grown from both sides of his back respectively, making him look like he had just grown eight crab legs out of thin air.</p><br/><p>What was most terrifying was the weapon in Fen Tian\u2019s hand \u2014 a heavy sword. Yes, it was a heavy sword, but not Fen Tian\u2019s heavy sword per se. Instead, it was the heavy sword of the Destruction God that spanned a length that was more than a thousand meters.</p><br/><p>The better question was, what kind of visual image would it be, to be seeing a man who was barely two meters tall, holding a thousand meter-long heavy sword that was dazzling with a purplish light?</p><br/><p>There seemed to be a black hole. No, more accurately, a purple hole behind Fen Tian. The periphery of the circle was dark purple, while the center was dyed a strange dark green. The light was constantly pulsing time and again on it. With each pulse, layers of distorted ray would form all around it as they would madly devour every type of attribute energy in the air. Even the platinum-colored Saint Energy seemed to have its golden light partially ripped apart and devoured, while its white light was repelled instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing!\u201d Like the sound of thunder, Fen Tian\u2019s voice rumbled in the air. Two intense dark purplish rays spewed out from his eyes. In a flash, the Destruction Sword on his hand was raised up high and slammed down again, forming a bright dazzling slice in the air as it charged towards Zhou Weiqing, who was still hovering in mid-air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh \u2014\u201d A loud scream reverberated from the sky. A peculiar golden light crashed onto Fen Tian with a speed that was indiscernible by the naked eye. Right now, even with Fen Tian\u2019s cultivation base, his body was still stunned for a moment and the speed that the Destruction Sword was heaving down seemed to have slowed down as well.</p><br/><p>This golden light was actually shot from Tian\u2019er\u2019s forehead. Even Fen Tian would be affected by her, as she possessed the Spirit Attribute, had her Saint Energy condensed and had also managed to acquire her Saint God Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>As she pointed her God Spirit Staff up high towards the sky, an intense platinum-colored light transformed into a light shield before it came into contact with Fen Tian\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>A thunderous rumble resonated in the air as creation clashed head-on with destruction.</p><br/><p>The platinum-colored light shone all over the place as the shield shattered into pieces. Still, the Destruction Sword managed to be blocked and did not land on Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er took a great stride and in a flash, she was already a hundred meters away in front of Zhou Weiqing. Both of her eyes were fixed on Fen Tian who was still in the distance as circles of white golden halos radiated from her body.</p><br/><p>The God Spirit Staff drew a circle in the air and slowly, the Astral Divine Territory began to take shape without so much as a sound. Within a second, thousands and thousands of splendid white golden stars burst out and dashed towards Fen Tian\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian growled deeply. At once, the space behind him suddenly turned a purplish-black color as the bloodcurdling Destruction Energy transformed into a layer of light, spreading out to its surroundings. All of the white golden stars that burst out from the Astral Divine Territory a hundred meters ahead of him had turned into waves and vanished without a trace. Once more, the Destruction Sword in his hand slashed again and again. However, his target this time was Tian\u2019er instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine, Seal!\u201d Tian\u2019er shouted in her charming voice. All of a sudden, the Astral Divine Territory in the sky suddenly transformed into a gigantic Seraphic Blazeangel levitating in the air. In an extremely short period of time, both of its hands weaved a mysterious sign and in just a flash, that sign was shot directly at the Destruction Sword.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

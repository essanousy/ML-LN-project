I can\u2019t believe Tianyue would actually make that choice,\u201d Shangguan Tianyang muttered while sighing softly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t hide it from Uncle Tianyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang shook his head and said, \u201cIt has nothing to do with hiding it anymore. Even though you have planned this out, I could see, in the battle just now, Tianyue did lose. Even if he had used his legendary armor set as soon as the battle started, he couldn\u2019t have beaten you within the span of lighting one incense. Weiqing, you\u2019re much stronger than how I imagined you to be. From here on out, you will surely gain a position of power on this mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er stood on the side, watching them with confusion. She whispered to Zhou Weiqing, \u201cHow am I not understanding what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, \u201cI will explain it to you when we get back. Uncle, since you can tell our battle was genuine, don\u2019t eat your words!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang smiled wryly, \u201cAn effective threat. Rather than let you kidnap three of my dear nieces, I will agree to your proposals. However, remember what you said before. No matter who the first child will be born to, he must become the heir to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Looks like I am going to be busy for the next few decades.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed, \u201cNo problem, uncle. You\u2019re a very capable man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang said in a more serious tone, \u201cSo that\u2019s that, I will arrange the necessary. However, you must handle your own things as soon as possible. Within the past year when you\u2019re gone, the mainland had changed quite a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face changed, \u201cOur Heavenly Bow Empire\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang waved his hand, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The Heavenly Bow Empire is still doing fine. Everything is normal, and it was developing well. Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er aren\u2019t here because they went to help out with the Heavenly Bow Empire for their upcoming battles. As of now, most of the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s land had been recovered. Its army was still confronting with the armies of the Kalise Empire and Bai Da Empire. They haven\u2019t been able to launch the attack, they could be waiting for your return before proceeding.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Shangguan Tianyang said that, Zhou Weiqing sighed in relief, \u201cSo when you said the mainland had changed quite a bit, what do you mean? Could it be that the Wan Shou Empire is going to make a move?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang sighed and explained, \u201cIf it\u2019s the Wan Shou Empire, I wouldn\u2019t be worried. Even though they are powerful, we are fighting them with the help of the Fei Li Empire and Bao Po Empire, so it was not easy to invade our land. The real problem lies within the mainland itself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDandun Empire made another move?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang nodded, \u201cNot just a move, a large move. The Geritimo Empire had been completely wiped out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhou Weiqing was shocked to hear the news. Even though parts of the Geritimo Empire had already been invaded by the Dandun Empire before he left, through mediation from the Zhongtian Empire, the Dandun Empire had not made any move since. However, the apparent destruction of the Geritimo Empire had proved that the Dandun Empire no longer care about the Zhongtian Empire\u2019s opinion, it could even be said that it had made an enemy out of the Zhongtian Empire.</p><br/><p>After all, the Geritimo Empire was one of the larger empires on the Boundless Mainland, its imperial power would not be weaker than the Fei Li Empire. Being destroyed by the Dandun Empire in such a short time, it could be said that the Dandun Empire was strong enough to threaten the Zhongtian Empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas the Bai Da Empire involved in this?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked the question he was most worried about.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, not only that, the whole thing had already been clarified,\u201d Shangguan Tianyang looked worried. \u201cThe moment the Geritimo Empire was lost, the Bai Da Empire announced that they would be changing their name to the Bai Da Kingdom and that they would become the Dandun Empire\u2019s vassal state. The two empires had officially formed an alliance. Including the Geritimo Empire\u2019s lands, they had already surpassed the Zhongtian Empire in total area. As of now, they are invading the smaller countries between the Dandun Empire and Zhongtian Empire without mercy, their area had been getting larger and larger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing listened in on the report with his jaw dropped. He did not think such a huge change would happen within a year. The Dandun Empire could be said to be on the rise. With its overpowering strength, it forcibly united the whole Southern areas of the mainland.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Zhongtian Empire not doing anything to counteract this?\u201d Zhou Weiqing said in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang smiled wryly, \u201cMost of our military forces are on the northern border. Even if we could move them, we could barely manage to protect ourselves, so we couldn\u2019t help the smaller countries. My worries right now is that after the Dandun Empire had finished uniting the South, they would attack us with the help of the Wan Shou Empire. If that is the case, I\u2019m afraid that even the Zhongtian Empire would be in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he did not reveal was that if it weren\u2019t for the tension on the mainland, he might not have agreed to Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s marriage so soon, he might not even have agreed to it at all. However, in this critical time, the Zhongtian Empire needed the Heavenly Bow Empire which was getting stronger to keep the Dandun Empire in check. If they had lost this ally, the Zhongtian Empire would really be surrounded by enemies.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s brows furrowed and he said, \u201cIt looks like I really need to get back to the Heavenly Bow Empire as soon as I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang responded, \u201cWeiqing, on the matter of manpower, we the Zhongtian Empire are also having difficulties so we can\u2019t help you much. However, don\u2019t fret on the supplies, I will ask Tianxing to send them over without stopping. I do wish you will be ready for battles soon. The reason for my request is because it would help in saving your family. At the same time, we need you to be prepared to act in the Southwestern areas. If there are any conditions you would like to request for, please do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had a long thought before shaking his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got no conditions I would like fulfilled, but I would like Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, and Bing\u2019er to stay with me. I would only be at ease if they could be by my side. Also, if I had utilized my power as a Heavenly King tier master, I\u2019ll need your help in dealing with the other mainland Heavenly Jewel Masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang nodded and said, \u201cNo problem, I will deal with them, naturally. After all, with such destructive energy appearing in Blood Red Hell, it might possibly be related to the Nether Realm, so don\u2019t you worry about what the public would think. However, be wary, because the Blood Red Hell might also send strong people after you. I wouldn\u2019t be able to help in that regard as well, as more than half of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s powerhouses had been sent to the southern border to fight against the Dandun Empire, that is our main battlefield, we can\u2019t move from there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled slightly, saying, \u201cAs long as I can use my full strength, I am confident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang said, \u201cAt this point, I can\u2019t afford not to let you fight with your full strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll take our leave from the island. The sooner we return, the better for us who are handling these things. Don\u2019t worry, we will definitely launch an attack against the Kalise and Bai Da Allied Forces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang smiled, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be so soon, you\u2019ve only got here, might as well let Bing\u2019er and Tianyue have a few more days of reunion before leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m afraid my father-in-law is not in the shape to care for his daughters. It\u2019s better that I leave soon, or else my mother-in-law would kick my door down if it means she could give me a beating. I was the villain after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard his words, Shangguan Tianyang chortled as well, \u201cYou aren\u2019t completely villainous, aren\u2019t you? Witnessing the couple reconcile, I feel like I\u2019ve set down a burden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said with a smile, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll take our leave.\u201d It can be said that he was eager to go home. With his country under siege, the Heavenly Bow Imperial Army was going to recover their lands, his feeling was a complicated one. However, no matter what, it was of utmost importance for him to save his family.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing\u2019er hands, bid farewell to Shangguan Tianyang, and left the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. Zhou Weiqing did not act courteous, he brought Shangguan Bing\u2019er and leaped directly into the sky, flying toward his home country on the southwest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, did you plan that out with my dad?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er was not stupid, after listening to Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s discussion, she could guess what happened.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing giggled and said, \u201cI think it counts? It\u2019s just that the plan got a little derailed by some changes. But don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m your husband, how would I really hurt your father? Yes, he was hurt, but it was more because of himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing met with Shangguan Tianyue, they had silently exchanged a few words secretly, it was just that no one else had noticed.</p><br/><p>This stratagem of self-injury was the result of the father-son-in-law duo.</p><br/><p>Of course, Shangguan Tianyue knew about Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s intention, but more than that, he cared about Zhou Weiqing. First and foremost, he was also a father. Xue\u2019er\u2019s inheritance of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and her becoming of the future Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace Master placed her as one of the most important people in the world. However, Shangguan Tianyue understood what the most important thing for a woman is.</p><br/><p>That was why, even if his brother might get upset at him, Shangguan Tianyue still informed Zhou Weiqing of Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s intention.</p><br/><p>Whatever that happened after had already been part of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s plan. However, Shangguan Tianyue did not expect Zhou Weiqing had already cultivated enough power to duel with him.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, when they had just started, Shangguan Tianyue had wanted to let Zhou Weiqing have the upper hand. However, as Zhou Weiqing showed his might, Shangguan Tianyue had to defend with his full strength. Having lost the upper hand, and not having a chance to use his Consolidated Equipment, he had lost to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Looking at him, it was definitely no act, even his tears were falling down.</p><br/><p>How could Zhou Weiqing possibly dare to let him kneel and kowtow towards himself! He quickly knelt down first, grabbing hold of Duan Tianlang\u2019s waist, preventing him from kneeling down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Uncle, please don\u2019t do that, I would not be able to take it! I\u2019ll show it to you\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing said hurriedly.</p><br/><p>By this point, he could no longer care about conning Duan Tianlang, even feeling ashamed about wanting to do so. He could clearly tell that this Senior Uncle in front of him truly wanted the \u2018Hate Ground no Set\u2019 design so much that he was even willing to give his life for it, truly showing how much Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were to him. Towards powerhouses like him, sometimes their fame, reputation and face was even more important their lives, yet he was willing to kneel and kowtow to a junior like him. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heartstrings had indeed been tugged. Asking himself inwardly, he knew that he might not have such a stubborn love towards something.</p><br/><p>With that sense of respect, he agreed to show the legendary set design.</p><br/><p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, Duan Tianlang did not reveal any sense of delight. Instead, his body seemed to waver, his eyes rolling as he entered a trancelike state.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya instantly saw that something was wrong, and in a flash he appeared behind Duan Tianlang\u2019s back, pressing his palms to his back, a serious look on his face. An overwhelming Heavenly Energy was drawn in from all sides, surging into Duan Tianlang as Long Shiya slapped out with his palms consecutively, striking over a hundred palms onto Duan Tianlang\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>These few years, because Duan Tianlang did not feel like there was anything left to live for, he had not controlled or taken care of his body, and his life force was almost empty. This was also the reason why his Long Shiya had taken so long to return; when he had found Duan Tianlang, he was on the verge of dying, and he had used his powerful Heavenly Energy to renourish Duan Tianlang\u2019s body, dragging him back from the verge of death before bringing him back here. Of course, it was also because of the \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 set, otherwise Duan Tianlang might not have accepted Long Shiya\u2019s aid. Sometimes, living a long time may not be something to be happy about. Previously, after he had helped Long Shiya complete the entire set of \u2018Hate Sky no Handle, he no longer had any goals or targets to live for. In terms of creativity and design, he knew inwardly that he could not surpass his forefathers, and the only thing he could still think of was the \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhou Weiqing had experienced a Heavenly Emperor\u2019s power first hand, and as Long Shiya manipulated the Heavenly Energy, he felt as if the entire atmosphere was like a massive Devour Whirlwind, with Long Shiya as the center, everything surging towards him. Yet, this was not Devouring, but some sort of draw or attraction, as if in that instant the entire world was in his grasp.</p><br/><p>The hazed eyes of Duan Tianlang seemed to slowly recover as light began to return to them, and a faint white light rose from his skin. He slowly drew a deep breath, as long as whale whistling, drawing the immense Heavenly Energy that Long Shiya had drawn in into his own body before expelling his breath. Zhou Weiqing could faintly see that the breath he expelled out was a greyish colour.</p><br/><p>With a new lease of life breathed into Duan Tianlang, Long Shiya slowly put his hands down. \u201cOld friend, don\u2019t scare me like that. I spent so much effort to drag you back from the verge of death earlier, if you were to die now, could you be satisfied? The \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 design you\u2019ve always hoped for is now in front of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang looked at Long Shiya, however his eyes did not have gratitude but a mild chagrin. \u201cIt\u2019s all you old thing, if you didn\u2019t drag me back from the brink, would I know about the \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set? Perhaps, I would already be reunited with your sister in law. Now, I\u2019ll have to stay alive a few more years at least. Don\u2019t worry, I will take care now. As long as I don\u2019t want to die, even if hell tries to reach up and grab me, it won\u2019t be that easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took out the stack of designs and brought it in front of Duan Tianlang respectfully. He trusted Long Shiya, and also believed that the story he had told was indeed true. However, he did not take out all the designs, just nine of the pieces. He might respect Duan Tianlang and trust in his teacher, but without Huyan Aobo\u2019s agreement he would not show everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Uncle, this is nine out of ten pieces of the entire \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set design. I\u2019m sorry, as I have not gotten permission from my Legacy of Strength teacher, I cannot let you see them all now. Once I meet up with Master Huyan again and get his permission, I will pass you the last design piece to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang nodded silently, his hands trembling as he took the nine design sheets from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands, his eyes reddening.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many years has it been\u2026 more than a thousand years\u2026Hate Sky no Handle\u2026 Hate Ground no Handle\u2026 finally they reunite. Thank you Weiqing, you have truly fully fulfilled this last wish of your Senior Uncle. I am already so old, but I have gathered much over all these long years. The materials required for the \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Set is not that much different from that of the \u2018Hate Sky no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set, and I will try to complete this set for you. I only hope that the heavens grant this old man enough time to succeed\u2026 once I can see you wear the full set of the \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019, then I can truly die in peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed. This meant he would have a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master by his side specially helping him to create his Legendary Set!</p><br/><p>Before Long Shiya could even remind him, Zhou Weiqing had knelt down on the ground with a soft thud, kowtowing three times towards Duan Tianlang, who smiled faintly as he accepted the obeisance.</p><br/><p>\u201cChild, I accept your obeisance not because of your thanks. The Legacy of Strength has been split apart for far too long, and as the Sixty First Sect Leader of the main branch Legacy of Strength, I ask that you return to the main branch, to reunite both branches and form a whole and complete Legacy of Strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOei, oei, Old Duan, one must be honest and virtuous.\u201d Upon hearing his words, Long Shiya immediately exclaimed anxiously. To him, Zhou Weiqing was even more important than a wife, and he was afraid that his precious disciple was about to be snatched away from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang gave a soft smile and said: \u201cAlright, Fatty Long, don\u2019t give me that. Would I really steal your disciple? However, you also have to admit that Weiqing is part of my Legacy of Strength right? Although I am not taking him as an official disciple, I will still pass down all my knowledge as a Consolidating Equipment Master. Whether or not he has the time and energy to learn it, that will be his business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya stared at him with jaw agape before saying: \u201cOld Duan, when have you become so shameless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang laughed heartily, carefully keeping the designs in his hands. \u201cWhat do you mean shameless? I am teaching him everything I know, whether or not he chooses to master it is his business, how is it shameless? I can\u2019t be bothered about you old thing. Okay, Weiqing, come help your Senior Uncle find a place to rest. I must take a bath and burn incense in preparation first before I take a good look at the brilliance of the \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019.\u201d As he spoke up to that point, his eyes gleamed with a brilliance, the sudden burst of aura no lesser than Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing quickly pulled his Single-Horned Ghost Demon Horse from the side, letting Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang mount it. Although Long Shiya was extremely large, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Ghost Demon Horse was truly a magnificent steed, and had no problems carrying both of them. He himself followed by the side of his Ghost Demon Horse, circulating his Heavenly Energy as they headed towards the direction the Peerless Battalion had left.</p><br/><p>Due to the speed of the horse carts with all their gear, the Peerless Battalion was travelling at a much slower pace. Before long, Zhou Weiqing and his two teachers had caught up with the main group. Naturally, at that point, someone let him have a Ghost Demon Horse to mount on as well; as the Battalion Commander, it wouldn\u2019t do for Zhou Weiqing to be running all the way along.</p><br/><p>As for Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang, they naturally drew many curious gazes. Riding on the Ghost Demon Horse, Long Shiya appeared drowsy and about to fall asleep, while Duan Tianlang looked to be deep in thought, neither of them seeming to care about anything happening around them.</p><br/><p>It did not take the entire troop long to reach close to the front of the northern army encampment. Of course, with so many gathered at once, they were stopped by the patrols, and Zhou Weiqing took out the plaque that Shen Ji had given him to get the patrolling soldiers to report back. In a jiffy, a group of riders could be seen coming from the Seventh Legion.</p><br/><p>At this point, the Peerless Battalion soldiers had already kept all their titanium alloy mail, and were only dressed in their army uniforms. Zhou Weiqing did not want to reveal all his secrets so easily, especially such expensive equipment\u2026 even in the entire ZhongTian Empire, not a single army unit could be as well geared as the Peerless Battalion.</p><br/><p>The one in front of the incoming riders was familiar to him, though her facial expression was not kind. It was the Regiment Commander Shen Bu, with her sister Shen Yi by her side. For the two sisters to see Zhou Weiqing, how could their expressions be nice. If not for Shen Ji giving them strict orders, they probably wished they could beat Zhou Weiqing up.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh, isn\u2019t this Regiment Commander Shen Bu? How do you do, how do you do, how could I trouble you to come all the way to receive us?\u201d Seeing Shen Bu, Zhou Weiqing felt rather amused, knowing that the enmity between them would not be so easily resolved.</p><br/><p>Shen Bu dismounted, heading towards Zhou Weiqing as she said coldly: \u201cI have orders from Seventh Legion, Legion Commander Shen Ji to receive Battalion Commander Zhou. He has given the order that your First Special Battalion will camp right beside my Sixteenth Regiment. The space has already been cleared for you, and you all can head there to set up your camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave her a salute with palm in hand and said: \u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although his words were of thanks, his expression was rather indifferent. Shen Bu already knew that they had changed names to the Peerless Battalion, yet she had emphasized the old name of First Special Battalion, clearly mocking them about still being the Ruffian Battalion, and Zhou Weiqing did not see the need to give her a good expression in return.</p><br/><p>Shen Bu turned her horse around and said: \u201cAlright, then follow me. Battalion Commander Zhou, I do need to remind you that this is the main northern army encampment. Please keep your soldiers in check, otherwise the military criminal code will still have to come in effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cDo not worry about that Regiment Commander Shen Bu, as long as the female soldiers from your Sixteenth Regiment do not come looking for men here, our Peerless Battalion soldiers will behave themselves!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was not soft, and laughter instantly erupted around him. These ruffian soldiers of the Peerless Battalion had camped in the north, climbing their way through the threat of death, and they would not be afraid of anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Shen Yi was about to have a fit of anger, but she was quickly restrained by Shen Bu, who turned to glare coldly at Zhou Weiqing before mounting up and heading towards the main camp.</p><br/><p>The Peerless Battalion was situated right between the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Regiments, and it was clear that the area had been specially cleared out for them. However, though the area had been cleared out, there was still much rubbish there. Although there was no smell due to the bitter winter cold, it was still an uncomfortable thing to look at.</p><br/><p>Shen Bu acted like she did not see all the rubbish, saying impassively to Zhou Weiqing: \u201cPlease camp here Battalion Zhou, I will be heading off then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was still smiling as he said: \u201cAlright then, Regiment Commander Shen Bu, I shall not send you off then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Bu ignored him, leading Shen Yi and her personal guards to turn and leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, what do we do?\u201d Wei Feng sidled closer to Zhou Weiqing and asked.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said calmly: \u201cDo you still need to ask? This is an army camp, not a rubbish dump. Whoever these belong to, just throw it back to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master Joins! (2)</p><br/><p>He paused for a moment, then raised his voice, saying: \u201cNow, I will proclaim a new rule. Everyone listen carefully. From now on, without my orders, no one is allowed to leave our Peerless Battalion camp site, otherwise they will be punished accordingly. However, if anyone comes to our territory to cause trouble, no matter who it is, just beat them up. If you lose, you will be throwing our Peerless Battalion faces, and you better just go look for Trainer Shangguan to receive your punishment. Alright, now, go set up camp, and once it\u2019s done we shall drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once they heard about drinking, cheers erupted, and the fatigue fled from the entire Peerless Battalion as everyone quickly burst into motion to clear the camp and started pitching tents. As for the rubbish, once they had collected it, they were not biased at all, throwing half each to the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Regiment.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya looked on with a strange expression on his face before he turned to Zhou Weiqing and said: \u201cLittle Fatty, your army troop is allowed to drink wine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cHeh heh, my Peerless Battalion is very different from any ordinary army troop, and the way we control and teach them is very different as well. Master, let me first arrange for the two best tents for you and Senior Uncle to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya grinned as well and said: \u201cLet Old Duan rest, why would Your Father, I, need to rest! I also want to go drink! Oh right, arrange for someone to get me a set of army uniform as well, otherwise I might stand out too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, that isn\u2019t too good right?\u201d Zhou Weiqing said in surprise.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya smiled and said: \u201cNo problem, do I still care about such trivial things? Drinking with some soldiers, isn\u2019t that quite an interesting experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya\u2019s size was impressive indeed, and even the largest sized army uniform was still tight on him, and the length of the sleeves and trousers had to be cut slightly to fit him.</p><br/><p>Fine wine was perhaps one of the greatest attraction to these Peerless Battalion soldiers, who had not tasted wine in so many years, and in their fervor the camp was quickly settled in about an hour. Soon after, jars of fine wine was cracked open, and the strong fragrance of wine spread through the entire Peerless Battalion.</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing had indeed prepared a large quantity of wine, he still gave the order that one jar was to be shared between three to four people, with an equal sharing, and nobody was to drink too much. After all, after so many years of not drinking, it would not do if anyone got alcohol poisoning.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, let\u2019s go drink as well!\u201d Zhou Weiqing quickly turned to Shangguan Fei\u2019er, who wasn\u2019t far off from him.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er rolled her eyes and said: \u201cWhy must I drink with you?\u201d Although she said that, she still walked to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side. The soldiers nearby who witnessed this hid their smiles; in their eyes their Battalion Commander and Head Drill Master (Mistress) was already a matching pair.</p><br/><p>As Shangguan Fei\u2019er walked up to him, Zhou Weiqing boldly grabbed her hands and dragged her into his tent.</p><br/><p>The tent was as simply decorated as previously, and there were four simple meat dishes on the table. Zhou Weiqing pulled her along to the table to take a seat, but still did not let go of her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er could clearly feel her face burning as she struggled slightly, trying to draw back her hand.</p><br/><p>However, in terms of strength, she was naturally not Zhou Weiqing\u2019s match, and she was unable to do so.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not make a sound, just staring at her directly, his expression a mixture of dazed wonder and befuddlement as his heated gaze fixed on her, causing her to be in a fluster.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 are you thinking of Bing\u2019er when you look at me?\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er lowered her head, not willing to look at him directly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily, but after a while he nodded slightly. \u201cA little, I miss Bing\u2019er.\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er was his first and greatest love, her gentle demure bearing always soothing to him.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s eyes dulled slightly, though her lowered head would not allow Zhou Weiqing to see this.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er, let\u2019s not run away from the truth anymore. I like you a lot, and have long since fallen in love with you.\u201d Right at that moment, the startling words rang out in Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh?\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er lifted up her head in surprise.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked deeply in her eyes. \u201cLiking someone is a slight love, love is a deep liking. At that time, when I was in severe danger, you endured all that pain and suffering and yet was unwilling to let go of me, no matter whether or not it meant your death. In that instant, I fell for you with all my heart. I know that I am an asshole, falling for so many, but if I give up on you, I know I will not be happy for the rest of my life. I will not allow such a thing to happen. Fei\u2019er, I love you, and I will always be like now, holding on to you and not letting you escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not expect that Zhou Weiqing would profess his love at such a moment, and she did not have any preparation in her heart at all. Looking at him, the normally eccentric Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace was suddenly just like any ordinary girl, her heart racing as she bit lightly on her lower lip.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 you already have Bing\u2019er. If it were any other person, I would beat her away\u2026 but definitely not Bing\u2019er. We have lost her for so many years, and we finally found her\u2026 how could I possibly steal her man?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed and gave a bitter smile. \u201cIn truth, I have a bigger headache than you\u2026 that is the price of being a person with so many loves. However, no matter what, I will not let go of any of you so easily, definitely not; otherwise I will regret it for life. I know, I am very greedy, but no matter what, no matter how you all look at me for that, even if I have to bind you to me, I won\u2019t let any of you leave\u2026 I am originally a rogue, a scoundrel, so no matter how shameless I have to be, you all won\u2019t get rid of me so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing tugged on her hand suddenly, enveloping her in his embrace tightly, his emotions in flux as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er, do you know? When I saw you die right in front of my eyes, in that moment my heart almost died at the same time. If that time I had not been able to revive you, I would have followed you into death. Please do not leave me\u2026 truly\u2026 I do love Bing\u2019er deeply, perhaps the most, but I do love you the same. All the difficulties, the responsibilities, please let me shoulder them all. As long as you do not leave me\u2026 okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er could clearly sense the heat emanating from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, and more so, the fiery hot core within his heart. She was unable to speak\u2026 although logic told her that if the two of them were to try to be together, they would have to face untold difficulties and trials, but at this moment, she truly could not bring herself to refuse him. After all, in her heart, he had already imprinted himself deeply, almost irreplaceably.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er nodded slightly, her beautiful countenance as red as a fresh apple, as if able to squeeze the juice from it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was unable to hold back any further, and his hot lips sought her quivering red luscious ones in a deep kiss.</p><br/><p>These few months, he had been in deep closed door cultivation, training with all his might in the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, his heart had not been at peace, constantly thinking about him and Shangguan Fei\u2019er. The worries that she had\u2026 naturally he had thought of them as well. He had also tried his best to make himself forget her; after all nothing had actually happened yet between the two of them. However, Zhou Weiqing found that he could not do it. Shangguan Fei\u2019er being willing to die for his sake\u2026 that image had been seared into his mind and heart, so very vivid. Ever since that time, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s position in his heart was no lesser than Bing\u2019er or Tian\u2019er any longer, how could he give her up easily?</p><br/><p>Finally, Zhou Weiqing had set his resolve\u2026 he would rather have more loves than to be disloyal to his loves and his heart. Even if others would call him a scoundrel, shameless\u2026 he would not give up his loves so easily. As such, this scene in front of them had played out due to that decision.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s lips started trembling, but that was quickly replaced by the heat. The Little Demon Girl was after all the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and once she slowly unlocked her heart under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s onslaught, she began to reciprocate crazily. Hadn\u2019t she also been repressing herself all these while? Once the shackles in her heart were unlocked, her suppressed emotions and feelings burst forth, perhaps even greater than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands had somehow wandered into her clothing, feeling the soft smooth skin and its slight trembling, it was as if a demon had taken over his heart.</p><br/><p>Outside, cheers, laughter and the sound of talking could be heard, but in the tent, it was just the silence of springtime spreading.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing had carried Shangguan Fei\u2019er and was headed to the bed, all of a sudden, a cold humph rang out.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s senses were extremely acute, and even in such a state immersed in his emotions, that was still true. That abrupt cold humph was just too sudden, as if an explosion in his ears, and both he and Shangguan Fei\u2019er felt as if they were suddenly jolted awake, shuddering.</p><br/><p>Only then did Shangguan Fei\u2019er realised that her hands were also in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s shirt, stroking his chest, while Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands were even more shameless, holding her by her buttocks, almost slipping into her pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Zhou Weiqing shouted angrily. For someone to be interrupted at such a moment, who could be in a good mood?</p><br/><p>There was no response\u2026 no sound at all. Both of them stayed in the same position, their Heavenly Energy released as the probed the area for any sign of anything. Zhou Weiqing even unleashed the Touch of Darkness, increasing his senses, spreading out to its maximum forty yard radius. No matter how strong an enemy was, as long as he was in the area, he should technically be discovered by Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Yet, to their surprise, despite all their efforts, they could not sense anyone in the vicinity.</p><br/><p>The two shared a glance, seeing the shock in each other\u2019s eyes, and naturally knew that the other had also not found any trace of anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Did I imagine things?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er rolled her eyes at him and said exasperatedly: \u201cDo you think we both imagine the same thing at once? There has to be someone\u2026 could it be your teacher? Otherwise, how could we not find someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt the warmth in his hands and grinned, boldly stroking some more as he said: \u201cWho cares about him, let\u2019s continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue your head!\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s face was totally red. Previously, she had been lost in her emotions, but now that she had calmed down, with Zhou Weiqing stroking her buttocks, how could a young virgin lass like her take it? The hand on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest pushed outwards, and her supple body slid out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s evil grasp.</p>\n</div>"}

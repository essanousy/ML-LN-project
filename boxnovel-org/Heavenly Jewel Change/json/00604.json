Currently, her eyes were filled with deep respect. \u201cTian\u2019er is just too strong. After you fell asleep on the city walls, she returned here and began healing the wounded soldiers. At least thirty critically wounded on the verge of death were dragged back by her. Everyone is now calling her Goddess of Life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Tian\u2019er fainted in his arms, Zhou Weiqing felt a twinge of pain in his heart, but also filled with love. To Shangguan Xue\u2019er he said: \u201cHurry, call a doctor here.\u201d As he said that, he quickly carried Tian\u2019er back to his room.</p><br/><p>He could sense that Tian\u2019er was currently extremely weak and exhausted, almost frail to the point that she couldn\u2019t even accept external energy. As such, he dared not even infuse his own Heavenly Energy within her to aid her.</p><br/><p>In a matter of moments, Shangguan Xue\u2019er had led a doctor into the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander.\u201d The doctor was about to salute to Zhou Weiqing, who quickly stopped him and dragged him to the bedside. \u201cQuick, have a look at her. Do you have any medicine to help relieve her current exhausted and frail status?\u201d As long as Tian\u2019er was able to recover a little, Zhou Weiqing would be able to use his Heavenly Energy to help her.</p><br/><p>The doctor saw that Zhou Weiqing was in such an agitated state that his eyes were red, and he dared not say anything else, quickly bending over Tian\u2019er to check on her.</p><br/><p>It took more than fifteen minutes before the doctor completed his examination, and Zhou Weiqing asked urgently: \u201cHow is it? Is it serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor quickly replied: \u201cCommander, please do not worry, Lady Tian\u2019er is not in serious condition, just that she is too exhausted both physically and in terms of Heavenly Energy. It is not suitable for her to use any medicines now, just let her have a good rest. When she wakes up, let her have some simple foods that can be easily digested. Her physical condition is good, so a few days of rest should bring her back up to top condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, Zhou Weiqing heaved a sigh of relief, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. Indeed! Tian\u2019er is of the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline, how could she be in trouble? I was just too worried\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 but\u2026\u201d The doctor clearly hesitated for a moment, looking at Zhou Weiqing, then at Tian\u2019er, as if swallowing back the words he was about to speak.</p><br/><p>At the side, Shangguan Xue\u2019er said: \u201cBut what? Is Tian\u2019er all right? Is there anything wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Reluctantly, the doctor looked at Zhou Weiqing once more before saying: \u201cI am also not too sure, but from Lady Tian\u2019er\u2019s pulse and meridians, it seems like she is expecting. However, though the signal from the meridians seems to have a strong life force, but it isn\u2019t obvious. I am not very sure at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Expec\u2026Expecting?!\u201d Zhou Weiqing was so shocked that he couldn\u2019t even speak clearly. Indeed, the doctor\u2019s words were truly stunning, leaving him standing there stupidly, his body trembling as his entire mind went blank.</p><br/><p>It was not just him, even Shangguan Xue\u2019er at the side was so stunned that she couldn\u2019t speak. This little brat was just too \u2018powerful\u2019, expecting\u2026? Pregnant?!</p><br/><p>It took a few moments for Zhou Weiqing to regain his senses, and abruptly he grabbed hold of the doctor. \u201cYou\u2026 did you see correctly?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor was given a terrible fright, but seeing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s anxious and urgent eyes, he quickly said: \u201cWhat I sensed from her pulse and meridian should not be wrong, just that the life force beating was very different from any other normal pregnant women. Perhaps it is because Lady Tian\u2019er is a Heavenly Jewel Master, and her physique is very unique as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing let go of him, saying almost in a muttering tone: \u201cAlright, you can leave first. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor quickly rushed out of the room, and Zhou Weiqing slowly turned around to look at Shangguan Xue\u2019er with a strange look on his face. Slowly, he said: \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m going to be a father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er glared at him exasperatedly and said: \u201cPregnant before marriage, you rotten scoundrel. How can Tian\u2019er face the world like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, she quickly discovered that Zhou Weiqing was not even listening to her. Just as she was starting to get worried about him, this fellow suddenly jumped up high, almost knocking into the ceiling of the room as he burst forth in excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWahahaha. I\u2019m going to be a father! I\u2019m going to be a father! Hahaha, our Zhou Family has descendents at last!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOeii! Quiet! Are you trying to disturb Tian\u2019er?!\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er hissed exasperatedly.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhou Weiqing shut up instantly, clutching his mouth at once as he looked at Shangguan Xue\u2019er, nodding. \u201cSorry, let me go out and be excited for a bit, I\u2019ll be back in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, this fellow disappeared in a flash. Shangguan Xue\u2019er could hear his excited voice ringing from outside. \u201cWahahaha, I\u2019m going to be a father! I\u2019m going to be a father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his wild howls from outside, Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s gaze turned slightly vacant. \u201cAre men so happy about becoming fathers\u2026? What if\u2026\u201d As she thought up to that point, her face turned red, and she quickly slapped herself lightly. \u201cWhat am I thinking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her gaze turned to Tian\u2019er, sleeping peacefully in the bed. Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not realise that her eyes were now filled with envy.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er slept for an entire day and night before she finally woke up. When she opened her eyes, she saw Shangguan Xue\u2019er, lying at the side of her bed asleep.</p><br/><p>Seeing the exhausted features of the sleeping Shangguan Xue\u2019er, Tian\u2019er felt a warmth in her heart. Having gone through so much together, the enmity which the two girls had between them at the start had mostly diminished, and they held a new appreciation for each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er, Xue\u2019er\u2026\u201d Tian\u2019er shook Shangguan Xue\u2019er lightly, waking her up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Tian\u2019er, you\u2019re awake? Don\u2019t move.\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er was startled out of her sleep, and as soon as she saw Tian\u2019er was seated up, she quickly supported her back to lie down again.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er looked at her curiously. \u201cXue\u2019er, what are you doing? I\u2019m not tired anymore. You should take the bed and sleep\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er shook her head repeatedly, saying: \u201cHow can I do that, you are the patient now, so you must rest well. Otherwise, that bad fellow will have a heartache.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er giggled, saying: \u201cWhat so bad about him? Is what he said really right, women only like bad boys? You obviously have feelings for him, and you can\u2019t let him go, but you just aren\u2019t willing to admit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er blushed faintly and she said: \u201cWho said I have feelings for him. You wait here, don\u2019t move, I\u2019ll go call that fellow. He went to make soup for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Tian\u2019er started momentarily. Just at that moment, the door opened, and Zhou Weiqing entered, carrying a pot with his bare hands, as if not caring about the heat. Seeing that Tian\u2019er had awoken on the bed, he was delighted, instantly putting the pot aside and moving to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDearest, you are awake! Quick, lie down properly, I\u2019ll feed you some soup to restore your body. You women, at such a critical time, we cannot be careless at all! You must drink well, eat well, and rest well, don\u2019t get all exhausted like last time. It\u2019s all my fault, how could I let you follow me on the battlefield at such a key period? Ahhh, it\u2019s all my fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er stared at Zhou Weiqing with jaw agape. \u201cOei, what are you going on nattering about? Like an old woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the side, Shangguan Xue\u2019er burst into giggles, saying: \u201cThis is called being overly concerned. Who asked you to no longer be representing one person, but two people now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean not a single person, but two people! What are you two talking about?\u201d Tian\u2019er looked at both Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Zhou Weiqing with great puzzlement.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked deeply into Tian\u2019er\u2019s eyes and said: \u201cDear, you already have it1.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I have it?\u201d Tian\u2019er stared at him puzzled. All of a sudden, she realised something, and her eyes widened abruptly, filled with shock and disbelief as her lips trembled. \u201cWhat\u2026 what did you say? I\u2026 I\u2019m expecting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing held onto Tian\u2019er\u2019s hand and said: \u201cYou have the fruit of our love! We are going to be mother and father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er held her mouth, a small voice escaping: \u201cThis, this is impossible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing started. \u201cWhy is it impossible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er stared at him with wide eyes, before looking back down at her flat stomach. \u201cOur Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline has always not been very fertile. Father has many other women, other concubines, though Mother is his only wife. However, not a single one of them has had a child so far. We\u2026 we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cHeh heh, that is no problem, this big bro\u2019s capabilities are just too strong! Furthermore, you are fresh and fertile, heh, when the conditions are ripe, success will automatically come! Come, be good, I\u2019ll feed you the soup.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing opened the lid of the pot, ladling out a full bowl of delicious smelling soup. Taking a spoon of it, he blew lightly on it for awhile before carefully bringing it to Tian\u2019er\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Only when she had finished the bowl of soup did Tian\u2019er break out of her reverie. She held onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands, saying: \u201cLittle Fatty, I\u2026 I need to go home. Can you come to my house when you finish up here? Our Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline is very different from humans, so only Father can confirm whether or not I really\u2026 really am pregnant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, sure, whatever you say.\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s expression was totally that of a loving father, the love in his heart for Tian\u2019er was unconcealed.</p><br/><p>Seeing his dazed and silly look, Tian\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but burst out in giggles, blushing deeply as she said: \u201cDon\u2019t be too anxious. I am fine. Even if I really am pregnant, it will be a long time before I can give birth. Our Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline usually have a gestational cycle of five to ten years. Furthermore, although we are not very fertile, once we have a child, there should not be any problems due to our strong bloodlines. Our bloodline powers will act to protect their legacy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFive to ten years?! So long?!\u201d Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er nodded and said: \u201cWe are not truly human after all. Although, I do not know whether our child will be born like you or like me, a little tiger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: \u201cNo problems, no problems, as long as it is ours, no matter what I will love!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er looked at him exasperatedly and said: \u201cAlright, go handle your business. Such a huge battle was just finished, and there are many things for you to settle. I am totally fine, and Xue\u2019er is here to accompany me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cWhat can be more important than my precious wife?! Alright, since you are alright\u2026 when things are settled here, I will also rush to bring you back to my father-in-law to let him see you. Xue\u2019er, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to take care of Tian\u2019er for a while, there are indeed quite a lot of things for me to settle.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

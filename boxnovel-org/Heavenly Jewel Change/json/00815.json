However, there was a condition that mentioned that the Lord of the Saint Land must not fail. Once he did, it would be equivalent to the disqualification of that Saint Land. Therefore, the Lord of the Saint Lands would usually choose to fight in the last battle to be the one to determine their victory. Nobody expected Zhou Weiqing to fight when the tables were turned to the advantage of the Peerless Sect.</p><br/><p>Did they really not have anyone else like Tian Yu claimed? However, the lady wearing the hood who killed the Heavenly King from the Blood Red Hell was at least a powerhouse with the cultivation base of a Heavenly Emperor. In terms of power, she might even be on par with Wu Yunyue\u2026 So why did they let Zhou Weiqing fight instead of her?</p><br/><p>Everyone was confused by the odd strategy that Zhou Weiqing was using. Xue Ao\u2019Tian then said in his deep voice, \u201cThere really is such a rule in the tournament, but are you sure you want to fight? As soon as you lose, your Peerless Sect will no longer be able to join the rest of the Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing naturally lifted his hand, held Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s slender waist and said, \u201cYes. I\u2019m sure. I want to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er moved her waist away slightly and avoided Zhou Weiqing\u2019s beastly hand. She rolled her eyes at him without saying anything and walked straight back to the Peerless Sect\u2019s corner. Zhou Weiqing retrieved his hand awkwardly and coughed twice before saying to Tian Yu, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yu instantly became more anxious when Shangguan Xue\u2019er was replaced by Zhou Weiqing. No matter how young Zhou Weiqing was, he was the Lord of a Saint Land, unmatched by those in his generation. Besides, judging from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s clash with Fen Tian earlier, his ability was definitely not weak. Under such conditions, Tian Yu did not have the confidence to win at all. Fen Tian would definitely not fight at a time like that. He was slightly shocked but his shock returned to normal when he saw Zhou Weiqing\u2019s odd battle strategy.</p><br/><p>Whether it was Fen Tian or the rest of those who were present, most of them had the same thought \u2013 the Peerless Sect lacked support. It seemed like the Peerless Sect had an advantage during the beginning of the tournament as they had the best score. However, Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue did not actually defeat that many opponents. Likewise, Long Shiya, who was at the Heavenly God Tier, only fought Shen Mo before ending the battle. He did not manage to show much of his abilities. Meanwhile, there were no other powerhouses amongst the ranks of the Peerless Sect. Zhou Weiqing may have great abilities, but was it possible that he was more powerful than his mentor? Moreover, him fighting so early in the battle would give many opportunities for the other Saint Lands to test the water. Seeing as he was about to do battle in the fourth round on his own, how many rounds would he be able to last regardless of how powerful his ability was?</p><br/><p>Tian Yu moved in a flash and appeared tens of meters above the sky. A dark glow shot out from his back as two gigantic, black Destruction Energy Wings opened in the air. The black wings were so clear that those present could even see each individual feather. However, the feathers were consolidated with the dense Destructive Energy. He flapped his wings hard and they supported his body all the way. Almost instantly, he was thousands of meters above the ground.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s movement was obviously much slower than Tian Yu\u2019s. However, he immediately disappeared from where he was the moment he took a step. What he just did made everyone\u2019s pupils shrink a little. Although it was not Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first time using Blink after mastering the Spatial Laws, it was still impressive to many.</p><br/><p>Tian Yu had been locking his thoughts on Zhou Weiqing and he reacted quickly. As soon as Zhou Weiqing disappeared, the wings on his back wrapped around each other and rotated his body in mid-air. With the gigantic, black wings made of energy protecting his body, Destructive Energy exploded in the air and swept through at least a hundred square meters of space. Although the area of effect was limited, the area was filled with a powerful Destructive Storm. Tian Yu thought to himself, \u2018Even if Zhou Weiqing was even more powerful than he was, he would still not dare to appear within his Destructive Storm. Otherwise, he would certainly have the confidence to kill Zhou Weiqing.\u2019 Therefore, he put on his legendary set as soon as he released the Destructive Storm.</p><br/><p>However, many things would not change following what a person wanted. Often, the impact was the greatest if something that was clearly impossible, became possible. Zhou Weiqing appeared at the next second when the Destructive Storm was formed. To top it off, he appeared right in the midst of the Destructive Storm and stood before Tian Yu, which was the area where the Destructive Storm was the most powerful and concentrated.</p><br/><p>The moment when Zhou Weiqing appeared, there was a layer of golden starlight, shining all over his body. An explosive crash happened when the golden starlight appeared within the Destructive Storm. However, it did not affect Zhou Weiqing\u2019s movement at all. A simple punch was pummelled right onto Tian Yu\u2019s chest; it was an extremely simple one.</p><br/><p>Going by Tian Yu\u2019s initial speculation, Zhou Weiqing might have mastered Spatial Law but he would have to appear outside the Destructive Storm so that Tian Yu could come up with a way to fight him. It might not work, but it was worth a try. However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s appearance was just too odd. He appeared right before Tian Yu while the Destructive Storm that he was proud of did nothing to affect Zhou Weiqing\u2019s movement at all. That was the scariest part of all.</p><br/><p>As everything happened so quickly, the only thing that Tian Yu could do was to protect himself as quickly as he could. At that moment, he had yet to completely put on his legendary set and his weapons had yet to appear. Sensing danger upon himself, Tian Yu made the decision which he thought was the best choice right away. As a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse himself, he had also fought hundreds of battles. He immediately figured that Zhou Weiqing must have some borrowed ability due to his courage of appearing in the Destructive Storm. Therefore, he did not dodge Zhou Weiqing\u2019s punch but chopped both sides of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck with his hands.</p><br/><p>Attack the enemy to save yourself. It was something that would result in harm to both sides. At that moment, at least Tian Yu had almost finished putting on his armor while Zhou Weiqing did not even have any consolidated equipment on him. Tian Yu thought that he had the upper hand. However, fear crawled into Tian Yu eyes at the very next second when he noticed that Zhou Weiqing did not dodge at all. Yes, Zhou Weiqing did not dodge his attack. A punch was getting closer to Tian Yu instead.</p><br/><p>Slam \u2014</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s punch hit Tian Yu\u2019s chest while the latter\u2019s hands karate-chopped both sides of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck almost immediately. Everyone who was watching from beneath was stunned; the two people fighting in the sky did not look like they were participating in the Grand Tournament of the Saint Lands. Instead, their fight seemed to resembled how children would fight. However, the results stunned them even more.</p><br/><p>Bang \u2014</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s punch that hit Tian Yu\u2019s chest did not throw him away. Instead, it stuck onto his body while the legendary set that Tian Yu had just put on was instantly smashed to pieces. An intense bang was heard; even the black wings on his back had disappeared. Both his palms that chopped both sides of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck had only created two weak patting noises\u2026 and that was the end of it.</p><br/><p>A spurt was heard, and a sharp claw appeared out of Tian Yu\u2019s back as it spewed glowing blood. The sharp claw vanished right after it appeared as Tian Yu\u2019s body fell from the sky \u2013 just like that. The sharp claw was actually Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand, and nobody could identify when his palm had turned into a sharp claw. As he clenched them tightly, there was a faint glowing ball shining from within.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly Core Nucleus \u2013 that was indeed Tian Yu\u2019s Heavenly Core Nucleus. Zhou Weiqing had ripped his chest open and dug out Tian Yu\u2019s Heavenly Core Nucleus. The injury that Tian Yu had sustained was fatal. However, even if he did not perish, the Heavenly Core Nucleus that was taken away by Zhou Weiqing had already rendered him useless.</p><br/><p>Tian Yu\u2019s body crashed right before Fen Tian, as his face turned red while his body shuddered. People who knew him well would know that this was Fen Tian in a state of rage. Aside from the battle which saw one of them surrendering, this was definitely the quickest battle of all. It only took three seconds for Tian Yu to fly up to the sky for Zhou Weiqing to kill him \u2013 those three seconds had taken the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse\u2019s life away. Even his Heavenly Core Nucleus was ripped out.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing who was in mid-air shook his neck and grinned. It seemed like nothing happened to him but a devilish expression was plastered on his face. What kind of defensive ability did he possess? Although Tian Yu did not have any weapons at that time, he was an actual Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse after all! To attack the enemy that attacks you \u2013 he was naturally using everything he had. The neck was much more vulnerable than the chest was in a human body as it was not protected by any bones whatsoever. However, Zhou Weiqing was completely fine; he was not injured at all from the full-force attack of a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, and this was without the protection of a legendary set. It was unbelievable for him to possess such a powerful body.</p><br/><p>In reality, those people who were shocked had no idea that Zhou Weiqing had Saint Energy that could destroy the Destruction Attribute which played the most important role aside from his overbearing self-defense abilities. When the Destruction Attribute meets Saint Energy, it was like snow meeting fire. The creation of Saint Energy alone was completely different from the destructive characteristics of the Destruction Attribute. Meanwhile, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was purer and more concentrated than Tian Yu\u2019s. As such, with the protection of Saint Energy and his Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation, his defensive abilities were terrifying. Anyone present would pale in comparison.</p><br/><p>It was wrong to think that Zhou Weiqing did nothing at all. He had actually released the Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation when he used the Spatial Law. The effect was even more noticeable when the Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation was complete. Nobody could tell from the outside at all \u2013 only the devilish expression was obvious. He did not release his wings at all, so it seemed like he was defending the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse\u2019s attack with his very own flesh.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Almost instantaneously, the Blood Red Hell powerhouses felt as if they were facing six Heavenly Emperors at once.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">A massive explosion. Five figures flew in all directions. Long Shiya had used his own strength to send the five Blood Red Hell powerhouses flying back, while he remained standing in his original position leisurely. Of course, the six illusory figures vanished as well, \u2018sacrificed\u2019 to accomplish this major victory.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Pursing his lips, Long Shiya did not chase forward. \u201cWhat bullshit Destruction Attribute, it isn\u2019t much after all.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThat\u2019s not possible!\u201d As Meng Gui was sent flying back, he couldn\u2019t help but cry out in shock. Out of the six illusory figures that Long Shiya had summoned, two of them were used to take care of him, the Light and Water Attribute figures. Their powerful offensive strength seemed no lesser than Long Shiya himself, able to deal a single strike of his full power. As such, even though Meng Gui had attacked with his full power, boosted by the Destruction Attribute as he was, he had still been sent flying back, his vital energy and blood roiling within his body. More importantly, Meng Gui was not able to understand as Long Shiya\u2019s attacks seemed to contain a strange energy and aura which was actually able to scatter his own Destruction Attribute, not allowing it to come into full effect.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Long Shiya laughed heartily, saying: \u201cLittle Meng Gui, in this world, there is no such thing as impossible. It is merely you being short sighted. What bullshit is this Destruction Attribute; in front of the Saint Attributes, it is still nothing.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In truth, to be able to accept such a blow, it was not fully dependent on his own strength. Long Shiya was indeed of higher cultivation level, and his power was definitely considerable, especially with his six Attributes fusion, he did not really need to be too afraid of the Destruction Attribute. After all, once he fused his own six natural elemental attributes, even the four Saint Attributes could not suppress him. Moreover, Zhou Weiqing had infused his body with the true Astral Saint Energy. With its support, one could just imagine the sheer power that Long Shiya had just unleashed. In front of the Saint Energy, how could the Destruction Attribute release its full power?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p>As such, even though the exchange was over in a split second, Long Shiya had been able to resolve the situation of being surrounded. </p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Meng Gui\u2019s plan had not been a bad one. Alas, he was facing up against Zhou Weiqing, this young but cunning fellow, and there was too much of a gap between them. After all, Zhou Weiqing had been playing around with such plots and schemes for such a long time.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">All of this was fully under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s calculations. Meng Gui could have never imagined that two hours ago, Zhou Weiqing had already arrived, fully scouting out the place. With the power of his Astral Saint Core Nucleus, even a Heavenly Emperor like Meng Gui was unable to detect his presence.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After gaining full knowledge of his enemies position and plans, how could Zhou Weiqing leave them with the slightest chance?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Just as Meng Gui exclaimed out in surprise, out of the four Heavenly Kings who had been sent flying, another vanished once more.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The situation here was just too strange. All the other three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings\u2019 expressions changed once more. They no longer cared about attacking Long Shiya, gathering together instantly, back to back, scanning the surroundings warily.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Long Shiya flew in mid air, arms crossed, eyes filled with pride. That pride was not targeted at himself, but his precious disciple.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In just a short period of time, the one who had silently finished off three Heavenly Kings\u2026 without question, it was Zhou Weiqing!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Although Zhou Weiqing was only at the Heavenly King stage, with his Astral Saint Core Nucleus and his massive number of boosts, he could even clash against a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. Originally, when he had defeated his father-in-law in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, although that was with some trickeries, most of the entire process was actually real. These Heavenly Kings were facing immense pressure from Long Shiya and were thus quite preoccupied, and thus his ambushes were easily successful.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Rays of dark gold light lit up in the darkness, and in the glow of the dark gold, a figure appeared slowly in the dark, wings spread behind his back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">With no more chances left to sneak attack, Zhou Weiqing did not attempt to hide himself any longer, revealing his presence at once.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Currently, his entire body was covered with a powerful looking armour, even his legs. It was his \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Before coming here today, he had already finished Consolidating the last few pieces of his \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 Legendary Set, successfully reaching nine pieces, with just a single piece left to complete the entire Set.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When he released the \u2018Hate Ground no Handle\u2019 set, the light around his body seemed to warp, a terrifying energy reverberation swirling through the air. The only thing he lacked now was a helmet.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Around his Dual Legendary Hammers, the dark gold light flickered, the \u2018crying-face\u2019 and \u2018smiling-face\u2019 symbols shimmering as they exchanged places at lightning speed. The strangest thing was that his chest area was actually glowing, the light brightening and darkening in a rhythmic pulse, as if it was displaying his heartbeat for all to see.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cWho are you?!\u201d Meng Gui exclaimed in shock and anger. He could not tell what Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation level was, but looking at this seemingly young man in front of him nearly fully fitted out in a Legendary Set, it looked like his cultivation was not that far from Long Shiya! More importantly, that soundless and stirless attacks were just too terrifying. Just that ability to remain hidden, even the strongest assassin in the world could not compare to him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing whirled the Dual Legendary Hammers in his hands, each drawing a dazzling triangle in the air. The two triangles superimposed on each other, forming the\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. At the same time, his ten Heavenly Jewels appeared into the formation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Although the\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was slightly different from the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation, the important essentials were similar. In a single glance, anyone could see that his connection with Long Shiya was definitely close.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cThis is my precious disciple. Well, how is it, I bet you never imagined this right. A Heavenly King before the age of twenty three. Does your Blood Red Hell have anyone like this? Hahahaha.\u201d Even at this point, Long Shiya did not forget to brag about his precious disciple. In truth, if it was anyone else who had a disciple like Zhou Weiqing, who wouldn\u2019t be proud and brag about it?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cYou are Zhou Weiqing?!\u201d Meng Gui stared at Zhou Weiqing with a surprised and doubtful look. He had heard this name many times, mostly regarding his display in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Originally, Zhou Weiqing had been at a mere three-Jeweled stage when he first defeated Shen Little Demon, who had been at the six-Jeweled stage at that time, even leading the Fei Li Empire into gaining their first championship of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. More so, one year ago, he had once again joined the Heavenly Jewel Tournament and defeated the brothers Tian Feng and Tian Ma. It had to be known, in the Blood Red Hell, even though Meng Gui was a Heavenly Emperor, his actual status was still lower than the two brothers. They were after all the future heirs to the Blood Red Hell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Meng Gui also knew the reason why the Heavenly Bow Empire could even have a chance of revival was all because of this young man. However, he had never dreamed that in just a year, the originally seven-Jeweled Zhou Weiqing would actually appear in front of him as a Heavenly King. Such a cultivation speed, wasn\u2019t it just too terrifying? Even though the current Blood Red Hell could be considered experts in grooming powerhouses, they could not possibly bring up a Heavenly King in such a short period of time!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The brilliant light in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes flickered as he looked coldly at those powerhouses in front of him. Currently, he had entered a different state. The casual beautiful feeling he had when returning with Shangguan Bing\u2019er had vanished, replaced with a billowing monstrous demonic aura. His entire body was filled with a demonic look.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">It was no wonder he was acting like this. These Blood Red Hell powerhouses in front of him wanted to deal with his home, his family! When he had first reached the palace and saw it covered with the Fate Denying Seal, his heart was aching so much that he almost couldn\u2019t breathe. It was these bastards from the Bai Da Empire, Kalise Empire\u2026 they had invaded and destroyed his homeland, leaving his father with no choice but to use this near-suicidal method to protect the last Royal Family bloodlines. As such, against these enemies, how could he possibly show any mercy?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The first three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings had already been drained dry to death earlier. He had even Devoured the Heavenly God Tier Terror Sea Dragon previously, and he would naturally help himself easily on these mere Heavenly Kings. With the Astral Saint Core Nucleus, his Devour Skill had reached another level totally. Let alone Heavenly Kings, even if he was fighting against a Heavenly Emperor, he could still affect him to a certain degree with the Devour Skill.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In truth, when Zhou Weiqing had completed his Astral Saint Core Nucleus, he had already become an existence that could challenge the heavens. The greatest mistake of the Blood Red Hell was that they shouldn\u2019t have given him the time and chance to grow at all. When he was below the Heavenly King stage, although Zhou Weiqing was still disgustingly monstrous, he was just much stronger than those of the same level, but there was still a limit. Alas, once he had broken through to the Heavenly King stage, fully grasping the Heavenly Dao Energy, even a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse would find it difficult to actually kill him off.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">After a short period of shock, Meng Gui slowly calmed down. Although he did not know what methods Zhou Weiqing had used to ambush his subordinates, when he saw that Zhou Weiqing was still at the Heavenly King stage, he gave a secret sigh of relief. If there were two Heavenly Emperors here, they would definitely have no chance at all. However, since Zhou Weiqing was only a Heavenly King, it would be a relatively easier problem to solve.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cSo what if both of you master and disciple have six Attributes? We have four people here. Even if the three of them can\u2019t defeat you two, they can still hold you off for a short time. If you know what\u2019s best for you, you better retreat now. Otherwise, this Fate Denying Seal will just take me a second to destroy. Once that happens, there won\u2019t be anyone left alive inside.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">When Meng Gui spoke those words, he had joined up with his other three companions. Destroying was always easier than creating, and what he said was indeed true. As long as he was given some time, and he was willing to pay the price, he could easily destroy the Fate Denying Seal below them now. After which, any simple Skill of his would be able to wipe out all those within the Seal. After all, being in the Fate Denying Seal for so long, those inside would be extremely weak. This was especially so far Zhou Weiqing\u2019s father, Admiral Zhou. It was close to certain that if the Seal was broken, he would instantly lose his life. After all, the Seal was built upon and dependant on his life force to maintain.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Zhou Weiqing walked slowly to the front in midair, as if there were actual steps in the air. His face looked calm, but every step he took caused the grey swirls of air around his body to thicken. The powerful demonic aura around him caused even the Blood Red Hell members\u2019 Destructive Attribute aura to tremble.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">How could this be possible? He is just a Heavenly King, why is his aura so terrifying?\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Including Meng Gui, this was the current thought in all of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cMaster, leave these guys to me.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said passively. However, his words were resolute. At this moment, his emotions had reached a unique state. There were only the enemies in his eyes, and he needed to vent. Indeed, the flames burning in his heart needed a place to vent out!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">\u201cLittle Fatty, don\u2019t be rash.\u201d Long Shiya said solemnly.\u00a0</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

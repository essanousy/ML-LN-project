It was once used by the Elven Empress after he had accidentally aroused the Sword of the Demon God. However, compared to that point in time, the energy released by the Goddess of Nature now was many times stronger.</p><br/><p>With the Goddess of Nature as the center, a massive, crystal clear, dark green ball appeared in the air and rapidly grew in size. It was the same as the dark red ball of light made by the two dragons on the other side. One was red, while the other was green and both were clearly visible in the sky.</p><br/><p>The terrifying energy fluctuation crushed the Destruction Divine Territory so much that the battle between the Destruction God and the Demon God elsewhere had slowed down.</p><br/><p>The two huge balls of light swelled to almost a kilometer thick in a blink of an eye. The red and the green was an awful combination of colors if anything at all. Nevertheless, it was dazzling.</p><br/><p>Because of their enormous size, they could be seen even from the ground. A huge sigil appeared on each of the balls as they expanded in size.</p><br/><p>What appeared on the dark red ball of light was a golden and glittering dragon-shaped pattern. It did not seem like a large dragon. Instead, it seemed more like endless, wriggling, golden blood vessels.</p><br/><p>The dark green ball of light was different. It also had a pattern but it clearly looked more textured. It was like jade, with leaf-like vein patterns on it. It had a thick Life Aura that constantly dispersed the surrounding Destruction Energy.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>It was not the dragons and the elves that clashed first, but the Demon God and the Destruction God instead.</p><br/><p>The Demon God swung his right leg. The Destruction God clasped his palms together. There was a thunderous roar and both of them retreated, turning into two streams of light that flashed into the distance. They were different from the people on the ground. This violent energy colliding in mid-air will definitely affect those below them.</p><br/><p>There was no need for them to wait for the moment of the collision. The energy fluctuations itself were already enough to overwhelm the rest.</p><br/><p>It was at this time that the red and the green balls of light moved, carrying with them dazzling trails of fire, as they streamed like comets and crashed into one another.</p><br/><p>The movements of the powerhouses battling on the ground on both sides also slowed down considerably. The scene in the sky was so shocking that everyone threw all their Heavenly Energy into their defenses.</p><br/><p>The worst ones were the two brothers \u2013 Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs the moons and stars rotate \u2014 Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation!,\u201d Shangguan Tianyang shouted. All the powerhouses from the Heavenly Expanse Palace then used their full power.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation suddenly changed. A huge white whirlpool emerged in the sky. The terrifying energy fluctuation caused the Heavenly Snow Mountain to be covered with a layer of white luster.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, following a huge force that came rushing out, two figures shot out like meteors rising to the sky.</p><br/><p>The couple, Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyun, had been hard-pressed by the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation. Although they had always been in a defensive stance, they had been consuming their Heavenly Energy. While the consumption was not that significant, the possibility of them being able to escape had now become smaller, after some time.</p><br/><p>Just moments ago, the originally moderate Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation suddenly started attacking wildly. It forced the couple to go all out to deal with it. Huang Xingyun was enraged. The couple broke forth with maximum effort, trying to take advantage of this opportunity to escape.</p><br/><p>It was also at this time when the pressure on them by the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation had suddenly dropped. Immediately after that, they were flung towards the sky.</p><br/><p>The feeling of suddenly breaking free was incomparably comfortable. At that moment, Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyun were as happy as birds breaking free from their cages.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems like there isn\u2019t enough energy to sustain the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation. Now, let\u2019s see how I\u2019m going to kill you. I\u2019ve already escaped. I\u2019m now free to act!\u2019</p><br/><p>Just as Huang Xingyun and his wife were overjoyed, preparing to show off their might and slaughter the Heavenly Expanse Palace, they suddenly discovered the tragedy that they were in.</p><br/><p>In order to break away from the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation, they made it a point to go higher as they were flung up high into the air. Their attention at that time was still on the whirlpool of the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation below them. When they realized that something was wrong, they looked up and saw the green and red light balls that had almost blanketed the whole sky.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing who had transformed into the Demon God trembled a little in the distance, and whispered in his heart, \u2018Who has been cursing me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s mouth twitched as he laughed loudly. Beside him, Shangguan Tianyang then thought to himself, \u2018Sigh. He had been around that fool, Zhou Weiqing, for too long\u2026 I\u2019ve been infected.\u2019</p><br/><p>It is not known what kind of reaction he would have if he knew that both his teacher and Shangguan Tianyang would push the blame to him every time they did something mischievous.</p><br/><p>The red and the green lights finally collided with one another and burst into an incomparably terrifying radiance. It was so terrifying that the energy fluctuations burst out in all directions at the same time.</p><br/><p>The green ball showed its superiority when it collided. It only flashed and moved up a little, so that the aftermath of the collision did not smash into the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p><br/><p>However, that slight move upward was not something fortunate for the now fast-approaching Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyun.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s ability to seize opportunities was indeed excellent. When their bodies reached the highest point, and the red and green balls collided, the couple were also right in the middle of the collision.</p><br/><p>There was an incomparable roar that could even be heard from the entire Heavenly Expanse Mainland. A huge black hole appeared at the center of the collision in the sky. The diameter of the black hole was about ten kilometers wide, wildly absorbing all the violent energy.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun and his wife were like two small birds flying up before they were smashed down by a palm. The speed at which they were slammed down at was ten times faster compared to when they were flying upward. The two already spat out volumes of blood before they could even scream.</p><br/><p>Although they were Upper-Level Heavenly God-tier powerhouses, they had expanded a lot of Heavenly Energy in the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation. On top of that, the powerhouses clashing in the sky were much more powerful than they were. They had even conserved their energy for that opportune moment. At the center of the collision, how violent would the energy be? Even the Destruction God and the Demon God had escaped, so the couple took a direct hit. It would be rather peculiar indeed if they were able to escape unscathed.</p><br/><p>The white whirlpool from the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation was like a large mouth that was mocking them as it swallowed them whole once again. This time, the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation was totally unrestrained. Even if the attack was weak, it still had the power of 108 Heavenly King-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>If Huang Xingyun and his wife had remained in the formation earlier, they would have endured it for a long time but now, having just been heavily mauled, how long could they hold out for?</p><br/><p>As Huang Xingyun and his wife fell, two huge figures also flew out at the same time. It was Hui Yao and Duo Si. But they had not flown out very far before the two green lights shot out, which then engulfed them and pulled them back.</p><br/><p>The Goddess of Nature\u2019s form reappeared in the sky. The huge black hole that was slowly closing above her head seemed to have no effect on her.</p><br/><p>A glittering green glow surrounded the Elven Empress, making her look even more sacred. Eleven Elven Elders also appeared by her side, out of thin air. They jointly created a Divine Territory and isolated the black hole in the sky.</p><br/><p>The two dragons were still struggling but their strength had dropped. The Goddess of Nature had pulled them back with the dark green light from her staff. Obviously, the dragons had lost the ability to resist her. The battle between the two dragons and the Elf Tribe had come to its end.</p><br/><p>Not much time had passed since the start of the war. However, the battle was extremely fierce. The balance between both sides constantly changed. At one moment, the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley held the advantage. At the next moment, they suffered three defeats out of the five battlefields.</p><br/><p>If only Shen Mo had lost to Long Shiya, the overall situation would not be greatly affected. However, at this time, the dragons had lost to the elves and the elves were now free to reverse the situation. On top of that, Huang Xingyun and his wife, both Heavenly God-tier powerhouses, were trapped in the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Great Formation. It was clear that the winners of the battle were already determined.</p><br/><p>When Fen Tian and Zhou Weiqing retreated from each other, Zhou Weiqing was still filled with hope. Fen Tian <sup>1 </sup>did not expect Hui Yao and Duo Si to be able to defeat the Elven Empress. He had only hoped that both sides would suffer losses. For him, the biggest threat was the elves. This was because their appearance was a factor that was totally unknown to him.</p><br/><p>While he was retreating, Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyun were thrown into the air. Even if Fen Tian wanted to rescue them, he would not be able to do so. Besides, he was also not a selfless person. With such a terrifying collision, he would also suffer if he were to get really close to it.</p><br/><p>As the situation took a turn for the worse, Fen Tian\u2019s eyes immediately seemed to look gloomier than it was before.</p><br/><p>The outcome of two out of the five battlefields had already been decided. For him, there was neither suspense nor dawn for him.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress stretched out her right hand. She then flew far away into the distance with the escort of the Elven Elders. Although the two dragons had been stopped, it was not easy to completely control them. Therefore, she was unable to intervene in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s battle for the time being, but it was clear that it was only a matter of time.</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"ef428512-69d8-4df9-442f-ab165e2fd4c5\">My apologies guys.

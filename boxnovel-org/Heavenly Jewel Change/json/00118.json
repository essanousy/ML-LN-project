From Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s angle, that rascals smile looked so crafty and sinister.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs long as you can confirm they exist, then all is good. We will definitely not leave this place empty handed.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at him in surprise. \u201cEven I have no certain way of finding them, and you think you can?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: \u201cAs long as they exist, then I definitely can.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked at him with disbelief. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you, let\u2019s bet again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing gave a humph and said: \u201cYou do not honour your bets, I won\u2019t bet with you again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shangguan Fei\u2019er said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t dare to bet, that means you can\u2019t do it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing glanced at her pert bottom before saying: \u201cPay up your debts, then I\u2019ll bet with you again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shangguan Fei\u2019er pursed her lips, her face reddening slightly, saying in a low tone that only Zhou Weiqing could hear: \u201cDon\u2019t dream about it, there\u2019s so many people here. How about, we bet first, and I\u2019ll pay you back tonight\u2026 okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how Zhou Weiqing looked at it, he could not see any hint of sincerity in her words. However, he was a man, and would not really dispute over such things with her. Laughing heartily, he said: \u201cAlright, what do you want to bet this time?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shangguan Fei\u2019er thought about it, then said: \u201cHow about the same as yesterday. If I lose, then you get ten more times. If you lose, we are even.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hearing her words, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s interest was sparked. That was because, since she had already spoken like that, it meant that she had really taken the bet to heart. That was to say\u2026 he actually had a chance to win those stakes. Heh heh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Not giving Shangguan Fei\u2019er any more time to think about it, Zhou Weiqing nodded immediately and said: \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll bet with you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shangguan Fei\u2019er smiled happily, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re bound to lose then! I want to see what kind of ability you have to actually look for those Ghost Demon Horses in this massive forest. That\u2019s like finding a needle in a haystack!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing smiled mysteriously, then said: \u201cYou just watch and see.\u201d As he said that, he tapped his chest lightly. The next moment, a silver light lit up, and the Silver Emperor flew out from his bosom, landing onto his shoulder. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Silver Emperor was after all extremely tough and powerful, with a high cultivation level. Although it had sustained a heavy injury yesterday, and had most of its Heavenly Energy drained by Zhou Weiqing, with a whole night of rest, it had somewhat recovered; at least able to fly normally. Of course, if it really wanted to fully recover, that would still take some time. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing stroked the Silver Emperor on the head and said: \u201cBring us to look for some Ghost Demon Horses, any ones closest to this location, but there must be at least twenty or more.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Silver Emperor\u2019s beautiful red little eyes blinked, as if deep in thought. After a minute, it nodded towards Zhou Weiqing, flapping its wings and flying off into a direction. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shangguan Fei\u2019er was staring at them with a dazed look, her mouth slightly open, looking unbelievably cute in her shock. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2019re cheating\u2026\u201d She said unwillingly. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing said easily: \u201cPlease may I know, dear Miss Shangguan, how have I cheated?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Shangguan Fei\u2019er had a resentful expression, her face slightly red, but she could not come up with any reason for him cheating. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Without the certainty of success, how could Zhou Weiqing possibly bet with Shangguan Fei\u2019er? The Silver Emperor\u2019s greatest skill was its speed in flying, and since it lived here, with its flying speed, it naturally flew around the entire forest to hunt for food. As such, it would likely be extremely familiar with most of the forest. As long as this Ghost Demon Forest still had Ghost Demon Horses staying within, it would have seen them. With it leading the way, would it be difficult to hunt them down?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soon after, the fact was proven that the Silver Emperor was indeed reliable. Although it twisted and turned throughout the trip, it took only two hours before the entire party spotted their target. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A small stream about three metres wide that passed through the forest. Ahead, beyond the stream, a herd of strong and robust horses were either drinking from the stream, or grazing on the green grass beside the stream. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Looking at these huge horses from the distance, the entire partys\u2019 eyes were wide and fixated. Without Shangguan Fei\u2019er prompting them, they immediately knew that these had to be the Ghost Demon Horses. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was definitely quite a large herd. Besides a few shorter and smaller young ones, the rest were all fully grown adults. All of them were black in colour, and as compared to ordinary horses, they were more than half a metre taller, their entire body more than two metres tall, with almost five metres in length. They were stout and robust as well, as they could clearly see the powerful muscles on all four limbs. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst all the land based walking animals, horses\u2019 muscles lines were considered one of the most beautiful to humans, let alone these grand horses amongst all horses. All along their muscled bodies, there was a layer of thick scales protecting them. The sunlight shone down through the trees, landing on their bodies, but did not reflect at all, giving them the sensation that these scales were indeed powerful. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once in a while, one of these Ghost Demon Horses would turn their heads, and they could clearly see that their eyes were bloodshot. Due to the fact that the scales covered all the way to their heads, they looked extremely fierce and terrifying, definitely living up to their name. Just their looks and aura alone would definitely scare off any ordinary horse. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The herd consisted of almost forty of these Ghost Demon Horses, and the herd leader stood there proudly. It was not grazing or drinking, instead standing there like a king or emperor, keeping watch over its people. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This Ghost Demon Horse Leader was even larger, more muscular and robust than the other Ghost Demon Horses. More importantly, it was the only one which had a small, half chi long horn on top of its head, and the glitter of its eyes had a hue of gold mixed within the red, and its scales were clearly thicker than the others as well. It was without a doubt that this was the leader of the herd. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they were slightly closer to the Ghost Demon Horses, Zhou Weiqing and the rest stopped down to prepare to launch a sneak attack. Lin TianAo said softly to Zhou Weiqing: \u201cWhat is the plan? These Ghost Demon Horses are at very minimum Lower Level Zun Stage or higher, and worse so, they are all adept at running. Defeating them alone might not be too easy, but capturing them all would be extremely tough.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing also had his brow furrowed while he was also thinking through the same problem. On the first look, he had already taken a fancy to the horned Ghost Demon Horse leader, but he knew that it was definitely not easy to capture these Ghost Demon Horses. After all, the huge forest was extremely open on all sides, and these Ghost Demon Horses lived here and were all extremely familiar with the roads. As soon as they spooked and ran in all directions, they would not be able to capture many. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just as Zhou Weiqing was trying to figure out a plan to capture as many Ghost Demon Horses as possible without compromising their safety, the leading Silver Emperor flew back to land on his shoulder, turning its little red eyes to look at Zhou Weiqing in puzzlement. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a powerful, high staged Heavenly Beast, the Silver Emperor was extremely intelligent, otherwise Zhou Weiqing wouldn\u2019t have been able to communicate with it previously to lead them here. Though they were all Heavenly Beasts, Da Huang and Er Huang were obviously not as intelligent as them, perhaps because of their age or maybe because the Silver Emperor\u2019s food was the brains of other animals, Heavenly Beasts and humans. Of course, after enslaving it, Zhou Weiqing would not allow it to eat other humans. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Little Red Bean? I warn you, don\u2019t kill these Ghost Demon Horses, I want to capture them for our mounts. Sigh, so troublesome, how do we ensure we can capture them without injuring them, or ourselves?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of a sudden, he felt a movement on his shoulder, and Zhou Weiqing was surprised to see that the Silver Emperor, which he had named Little Red Bean, had hung its head down to touch his shoulder. He was given a fright, thinking that Little Red Bean\u2019s injuries had been reopened, quickly grabbing it to examine it. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha, it is looking down on you!\u201d Originally, Shangguan Fei\u2019er had been feeling rather depressed for losing the bet again, but seeing Little Red Dot\u2019s actions, she couldn\u2019t help but let loose a peal of laughter. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLooking down on me?\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked at her curiously. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Right at that moment, Little Red Dot wriggled out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands, flying out swiftly into mid air, its wings spreading out, hovering right there before letting loose a shrill cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Silver Emperor might be extremely tiny, but its cry was not to be underestimated, extremely loud and shrill, the powerful piercing powerful causing even Zhou Weiqing and the party to feel their hearts shudder. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the Ghost Demon Horses which had been leisurely grazing heard the cry, and they were immediately sent into a disorderly frenzy. The few young Ghost Demon Horses immediately fell onto the ground, almost paralyzed, while the adult Ghost Demon Horses raised their heads, their red eyes filled with fear and panic. Although they were still quite far from them, Zhou Weiqing and the rest could still clearly see that amongst these powerful Ghost Demon Horses, besides the horned Leader, all the others were trembling violently, as if they did not even have the energy to run. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Horned Ghost Demon Horse displayed the power of a leader then, raising its head and giving forth a series of low cries. Standing right in front, the black fur at the back of its neck raised up, while it pawed the ground with its right front hoof. It was clear that although it was not as affected as its other herd members, it was still extremely uneasy. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? This is possible?\u201d Zhou Weiqing muttered to himself in shock. Previously, he had not believed Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s words, but now he had no choice but to believe it. It was clear that Little Red Dot had been speechlessly hanging its head earlier, looking down upon him. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heavenly Beasts were much clearly about ranking of bloodlines, and a Upper Stage Heavenly Beast was able to put a lot of pressure on a Lower Staged Heavenly Beast, with only a few exceptions. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although the Silver Emperor Little Red Dot was not yet at the Heavenly King Stage, but to these Ghost Demon Horses, its cultivation level and bloodline was already much higher. Furthermore, in the Heavenly Beast world, the Silver Emperors were notorious devils, even Heavenly Beasts of the same stage would not dare to take them on easily. As such, its powerful cry caused much more violent pressure. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, if it really wanted to kill these Ghost Demon Horses, even the one with the single horn, it would have been extremely easy. After all, it was a lot higher level, and though the protective scales of the Ghost Demon Horses had a great defense, they would be like paper in front of the Silver Emperor\u2019s powerful Skills. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet me try.\u201d Seeing the performance of the Silver Emperor, Zhou Weiqing immediately thought of the scene where he and Shangguan Bing\u2019er had ran afoul of the Forest Direwolves many years back. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Taking a large step forward, as his body was in motion, a cold, evil, overbearing aura burst forth from his body. At the same time, the muscles of his body bulged out, the black tiger tattoos wriggling all over the skin not covered by his clothes. Especially so for the large \u2018King\u2019 word on his forehead, as well as the change to his right foot. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Controllable Demonic Change State had been activated. </span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

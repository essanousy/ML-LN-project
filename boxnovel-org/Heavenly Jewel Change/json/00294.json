He did not hide his massive hatred towards him at all, \u201cYou brat! You foiled my plans again. From the looks of it, I should kill you as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cCome at me then!\u201d His voice sounded neutral, but he had a very antagonistic look in his eyes.\u00a0</p><br/><p>However, this time, Fen Tian ignored him. Instead, he turned to Xue AoTian, who was standing next to him, \u201cBrother Xue, I mean what I say. As long as you are willing to seal the Heavenly Snow Mountain, I can also promise you that I will not harm the Wan Shou Empire. In the future, we can even become allies - I am even willing to share the Destruction Attribute with you. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian looked at him and said with a calm look on his face, \u201cFen Tian, have you exhausted all your ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian sighed and replied, \u201cFrom the looks of it, my guess is right. I\u2019m afraid that both you and Shangguan Tianyang were in cahoots with that little fellow from the start.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Xue AoTian said indifferently, \u201cHe is my son-in-law and I have only one daughter. You\u2019re telling me that you want to kill him. What do you think I will do? Moreover, ever since I have established the Heavenly Snow Mountain, I never had the habit of obeying someone else\u2019s wishes against my will, even if you\u2019re a Max Level Heavenly God. The Heavenly Snow Mountain can be destroyed, but there will never be a Heavenly Snow Mountain with no dignity or pride.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Fen Tian suddenly smiled. This time, his smile looked rather strange. The dark purple flames around his body did not become more powerful. From the looks of it, he had no intention to attack yet.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u00a0\u201cSince that is the case, I guess I have to put more pressure on you. Brother Xue, sometimes, when you are destined to be defeated, why don\u2019t you choose to back off instead? Brother Huang, show them what you\u2019ve got. Everyone has already found out about our alliance, so what is the point of hiding it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun, who had been leading the Passion Valley\u2019s powerhouses, had been standing there in silence. The moment he heard Fen Tian\u2019s words, he furrowed his brows. He brought his wife, Yun Ruoyu, with him and slowly walked towards Fen Tian, before standing next to him.</p><br/><p>Both Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian were not stupid - the lineup of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain in the Grand Tournament, coupled with their constant forfeiting of the battles, together with the fact that the Peerless Sect had been constantly targeting the participants of the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell, had made the two sets of alliances too apparent.\u00a0</p><br/><p>After the Huang couple had walked out, the Passion Valley powerhouses had also walked over to gather with the members of the Blood Red Hell. The same shade of black light was emitted from their bodies - it was the Destruction Attribute.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun looked at Xue AoTian and Shangguan Tianyang and said in a deep voice, \u201cI\u2019m very curious and I want to know - how did you find out about the alliance between the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell? I would think that we had put up a really good and convincing act.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Xue AoTian managed to maintain his composure, Shangguan Tianyang looked extremely furious at this moment. After all, throughout all these years, the Passion Valley had always been a solid ally of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. He could completely see Huang Xingyun and his subordinates dealing them a fatal blow at the end of the Grand Tournament, in the event that they were to fall out with the Blood Red Hell, and that if at that point they still could not see through the pretense put up by the Passion Valley.</p><br/><p>\u00a0\u201cBrother Huang, why? Was our many years of alliance that fragile?\u201d asked Shangguan Tianyang, who could no longer hold back.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun replied indifferently, \u201cOur so-called alliance was simply the Passion Valley giving support to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and being your servants. We only fought against the Heavenly Snow Mountain together because it was in both our interests. Shangguan Tianyang, don\u2019t you know that in this world, people will always fight for their own interests, and no alliance is forever? The Destruction Attribute is able to increase our power, and we no longer have to be subdued by you - it even allowed my Amber Empire to be allocated a part of the ZhongTian Empire\u2019s vast land. I have no reason to reject the alliance with the Blood Red Hell. Right now, within the Mainland, we are already in possession of the Dan Dun Empire and Bai Da Empire. Originally, the lands of the Geritimo Empire and the Amber Empire had already taken up a third or more of the Mainland. After the Grand Tournament ends, without the support from all the other Saint Lands, the entire Mainland will be ruled by us. This is the most important thing to me.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u00a0\u201cThis will only benefit a small proportion of people. Shangguan Tianyang, do you dare to say that if someone were to offer you the Destruction Attribute to help you make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage, and allow the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace to rule over the entire Mainland, you will not be tempted? Even though we are now enemies on different sides, we still have the same human nature.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Shangguan Tianyang could retort, Zhou Weiqing had interrupted, \u201cI\u2019ve always been curious about one thing - I\u2019m sure the Destruction Attribute came from a particular source. What are the motives behind the fellow who gave you the Destruction Attribute to enhance your power? You are right, people will always fight for their own interests, but there is no such thing as a free lunch. By receiving the Destruction Attribute, I\u2019m sure you must have sacrificed something in return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun replied Zhou Weiqing coldly, \u201cWhat we sacrificed were the lives of the people from the other countries. There are already way too many people on the Mainland. Our master needed the huge amount of resentment qi that was given out at the time of their deaths.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Zhou Weiqing cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun replied in a casual tone, \u201cThis is nothing, and I have nothing to hide from all of you either. If you do not obey, every single one of you will die here today. We Heavenly Jewel Masters are quite exalted, the deaths of those commoners are no different from the death of ants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s face looked so gloomy to the point where it seemed as though he was about to cry, \u201cHence, you joined forces to destroy the Geritimo Empire? Causing hundreds of thousands of people to lose their lives, as well as the people of the Geritimo Empire to plunge into misery and suffering?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun replied indifferently, \u201cThis is only the start. After all, we cannot kill too many people in a single place, or else that area would become a death zone, which is not advantageous to us, when we rule over them in the future. On the other hand, your ZhongTian Empire is different - you have a vast territory with abundant resources, as well as a huge population.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026\u2026you are a madman.\u201d Shangguan Tianyang could no longer hold back and condemned him. Even though Huang Xingyun did not spell out his intentions explicitly, but everyone knew what he meant.</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun smiled. It was a calm smile. If Fen Tian was described as ruthless, then Huang Xingyun would be described as evil.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang narrowed his eyes, \u201cHuang Xingyun, perhaps what you said was right. I might have caved in in the face of such a strong temptation. However, we are different. That is because I am a human, and not a beast. I have my own morals, and you no longer have yours. In my eyes, the filthiest Heavenly Beast is still a hundred times purer than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0\u201cAre you trying to provoke me?\u201d Huang Xingyun\u2019s face fell. However, he did not take any action. \u201cI have already told you everything that you wanted to know, but you have not answered my question. The Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell are like darkness and light; one was in the open, the other was hidden in the shadows. I was very sure that we had hid it very well, so how did you find out?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang inhaled deeply in a bid to calm the rage in his heart. He looked towards Zhou Weiqing and said, \u201cYou have to ask him instead. When Weiqing told me about the possible alliance between the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell, I could not bring myself to believe his words. However, upon your arrival on the Heavenly Snow Mountain and based on your performance, I believe what he said. I had never expected that after all these years, I was not able to see who you truly are. You had truly concealed your true nature very well.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun seemed to be completely unaffected by Shangguan Tianyang\u2019s mockery. He looked towards Zhou Weiqing in a perplexed manner, \u201cAnd how did you find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied plainly, \u201cDo you remember? About half a year ago, you had sent someone to the Sidhe\u2019s sealed grounds, in an attempt to abduct the Sidhe Princess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Xingyun\u2019s facial expression changed. Even though he tried his best to conceal his emotions, he could not completely hide the shock deep within his eyes. \u201cI definitely do not know what you are talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed grimly, \u201cDo you really not know what I\u2019m talking about? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been plotting to restrain the Sidhe for a long time now. Or else, the powerhouse that you sent to the sealed grounds could not have entered with just a few special treasures. Unfortunately, his luck was not too good - he ran into me, who had arrived there on the same day. Additionally, he even tried to make me the scapegoat. When I had caught up with him, I realized that he was using the Time Attribute, and in the final moments before his death, when I had cornered him into panic, he activated the Destruction Attribute. I do not have to elaborate much about how uncommon it is for cultivators to possess the Time Attribute - apart from the Passion Valley and I, I have never heard of anyone else who possessed the Time Attribute. Furthermore, how was it possible for me not to be suspicious after encountering an individual who possessed both the Time and Destruction Attribute at the same time? As the saying goes - it\u2019s better to be safe and sorry by believing in the worst case scenario. I had never expected that the righteous Passion Valley had actually caved in to the temptation created by the Destruction Attribute. You should know that ultimately, the Destruction Attribute will lead to self-destruction - be it you or your master. Even if you rule over the entire world, it is a fate you cannot escape.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Fen Tian, are you shameless? This is the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands. How dare you take action and defy the justice of the tournament? It\u2019s a shame how you\u2019re even a popular person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian was initially raging and was on the brink of blowing up. The Blood Red Hell powerhouses behind him were ready to fight with full force. However, Zhou Weiqing blew him off just as he landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I said about surrendering just then?\u201d Fen Tian shouted angrily.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said, \u201cYes I did! However, my Deputy Sect Master might not have heard it. Both Heavenly Emperors fought as intensely as they would if they were fighting with all their might \u2013 who would have noticed you screaming down there? If I let you send your rescue team up, who can tell if you\u2019ll decide to take revenge and attack our Deputy Sect Master instead? How was it wrong of me to stop you? After all, it\u2019s the people from Blood Red Hell who are lousy.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing spoke up to this point, he looked around at the powerhouses from other Saint Lands and continued like nothing was wrong, \u201cEveryone, are the lives in the Blood Red Hell so precious? People from Love Valley perished earlier as well, and what did Valley Lord Huang say? Absolutely nothing. What makes all of you think that nobody from the Blood Red Hell should die? Besides, which Grand Tournament of Saint Lands in the past ever had a zero-death record? Isn\u2019t this normal? If you can, you Blood Red Hell people can send somebody more powerful to kill our Deputy Sect Master in fair combat. Then I, as the Sect Master, will not utter a word.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian had never wanted to kill someone so badly, whether it was before or after he possessed the Destruction Attribute. He really wanted to attack Zhou Weiqing and the Peerless Sect right now, ignoring everyone else in the crowd. Even destroying Zhou Weiqing into a million pieces would not be able to make him feel better! This kid was too irritating; he distorted the truth and pretended everything he said was right.</p><br/><p>However, Fen Tian simply could not do that right now. He had yet to accomplish his plan so it was not the time to take action just yet. Besides, regardless if it were the people of Heavenly Expanse Palace or Heavenly Snow Mountain, all of them looked at him in an unfriendly manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Zhou Weiqing, Wu Yunyue \u2013 both of you, wait for me.\u201d Fen Tian swung his hand hard as he groaned in rage and gotten his underlings to retreat. He then backed off and returned to his initial place. Naturally, there were people from the Blood Red Hell who went forward to pick up the bodies scattered on the ground. At the same time, he nodded to the short old man who had been standing next to him. The old man walked out slowly and into the ring without saying anything as he waited for the next Blood Red Hell battle.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue had defeated a couple of people consecutively, including killing two Heavenly Emperors. Suddenly, Peerless Sect had the upper hand. However, Zhou Weiqing then made a decision that confused everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll concede the next battle. The Deputy Sect Master has already won a couple of battles consecutively; he has done enough. Please go back and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Wu Yunyue could not understand why Zhou Weiqing did that, so he spoke to him telepathically, \u201cWeiqing, I can still fight. Let me kill one more Blood Red Hell bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and looked at him calmly. An invisible might in his eyes flashed. Wu Yunyue took a deep breath and returned to his team after glaring at the Blood Red Hell\u2019s corner reluctantly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had his own plans. Although Wu Yunyue had much of his strength recovered from the help of Zhou Weiqing, it was not the right time to fight yet. He did not hope for the Demonic Emperor to drain his strength. Besides, he did that for another purpose. Perhaps Xue Ao\u2019tian did not see through what Zhou Weiqing\u2019s intuition of doing this was, but Shangguan Tianyang managed to figure something out. It was simple; he could tell from the sequence. The order would be Love Valley, Blood Red Hell, and finally, Peerless Sect. That would mean that Love Valley would be fighting Blood Red Hell next, and the winner would be fighting Peerless Sect next. If that happened, it would be more difficult for Blood Red Hell to kill or injure the people from Heavenly Snow Mountain or Heavenly Expanse Palace. This kid was too cunning and far too smart.</p><br/><p>The second person that Zhou Weiqing sent out had shocked everyone. Long Shiya walked out and stood in the ring with his round body. Nobody would have expected that Zhou Weiqing would send Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor out after the Demonic Emperor. Without a doubt, he certainly did that just to foil the other Saint Lands\u2019 plan, especially Blood Red Hell\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing returned to his side with no change in his expression. Shangguan Bing\u2019er had even gotten him a chair to sit down on. Zhou Weiqing sat down majestically while laughing secretly and thought, \u2018Didn\u2019t all of you see the existence of the Demonic Emperor and my master? Alright then, I\u2019ll let all of you think that the Peerless Sect had already exposed all our cards. I\u2019d like to see how you\u2019re going to handle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tournament went on. Zhou Weiqing had gotten Wu Yunyue to quit the tournament which was equivalent to Peerless Sect surrendering. Therefore, the next battle would take place between the second Heavenly King-tier powerhouses of Heavenly Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain. The two who were sent into the ring were supposed to be sacrifices but nobody expected this to happen. There was an intense spark in their eyes as the two Heavenly king-tier powerhouses looked at each other.</p><br/><p>It was a battle between Heavenly Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain. Although those were just two Heavenly King-tier powerhouses, it was an exciting battle. On the contrary, the battle seemed to be the one that lasted the longest from the beginning. In the end, the Heavenly Expanse Palace\u2019s Heavenly King-tier powerhouse defeated the opponent with his Consolidated Equipment but suffered minor injuries.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyang announced that they would give up on the next battle immediately. The rounds had then passed since the tournament began. Apart from the Peerless Sect who already had one person disqualified, the other four Saint Lands had already disqualified two people and had sent their third participant out.</p><br/><p>When Shangguan Tianyang announced that the Heavenly King-tier powerhouse was surrendering, Fen Tian\u2019s pupils clearly shrunk. Although Heavenly Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain had disqualified two people, they were scheduled to fight toward the end of the battles. Furthermore, none of their members were injured, while Blood Red Hell already had two of their Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses killed. Fen Tian seemed to sense something.</p><br/><p>It was Love Valley versus Blood Red Hell in the third round, where both parties sent out Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses. Without a shadow of a doubt, the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse managed to force his opponent to surrender in a short period of time. There were no casualties in this round at all. However, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse would be facing Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya next.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse who had just won the battle looked questionably at Fen Tian with his head slightly tilted as he landed on the ground. Fen Tian nodded slightly at him, insinuating a hint. If they were comparing their body weight instead of their abilities, Long Shiya would definitely be at the top of the ranks, amongst all the powerhouses in the Five Saint Lands. He seemed to be putting on weight lately; his rosy skin exuded a healthy glow. He put both his hands on his back, he was not rushing at all.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell powerhouse snapped out of his thoughts and said to Long Shiya with a lowered voice, Brother Long, please.\u201d He took the lead and levitated as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya smiled a little and moved his plump body slightly. At the very next second, he was already in the sky. There was a faint six-colored glow surrounding his body, and likewise, a faint series of shadows trailed behind him as he flew into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Xue Ao\u2019tian who had been watching the battles in silence could not help but reveal his doubts when he saw Long Shiya flying into the sky. Rising shock quickly filled his eyes. Zhou Weiqing then said softly to Wu Yunyue who was next to him, \u201cFather-in-law, do you know the person that Blood Red Hell sent? It seems like Fen Tian relies strongly on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue nodded lightly, \u201cThis person is called Shen Mo. He\u2019s the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Deputy Hell Lord. His position is just one rank lower than Fen Tian\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Shen Mo?\u2019 Zhou Weiqing instantly thought of the Shen Little Demon that he defeated more than once, upon hearing his name. Judging from the name itself, it seemed like Little Demon Shen was related to Shen Mo. \u2018Blood Red Hell\u2019s Deputy Hell Lord, huh?\u2019 It seemed like Fen Tian could not wait any longer! Shen Mo flew thousands of meters up into the sky. He was not in a hurry to attack Long Shiya. Instead, he waited for Long Shiya to fly slowly and stopped in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Long, it\u2019s been a long time since we last met. How have you been?\u201d Although Shen Mo was Blood Red Hell\u2019s Deputy Hell Lord, he was much older than Fen Tian. He was one of the seniors in Blood Red Hell. However, he had the same seniority as Long Shiya and was only a few years younger than he was.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya smiled faintly and said, \u201cNot bad. I\u2019ve gotten myself a good disciple recently; my mood has been great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Mo then replied, \u201cIf he\u2019s really a good disciple, he wouldn\u2019t have pulled you into this whirlpool of a mess. There\u2019s no chance for all of you, so please give up. It\u2019s been many years since Brother Long had been stuck at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier. If Brother Long is willing to join me at the Blood Red Hell, perhaps I can think of a way to help you break through the very last step.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya was known by many for a long time now. Most importantly, he had always been a free cultivator or Shen Mo would not have said so much to him. Although the condition that Shen Mo asked for was simple, he knew very well how intense the temptation to break through to the Heavenly God Tier was, especially for a Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivator who had plateaued for a long time now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know of a way to help me achieve this?\u201d Long Shiya said in shock.</p><br/><p>Shen Mo nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m at least eighty percent sure. Brother Long, perhaps such an opportunity isn\u2019t much for you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya chuckled. His smile and his plump body made him look content and at peace \u2013 he did not look like a powerhouse of a generation at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Blood Red Hell people have been having so much fun all these years\u2026 Perhaps it\u2019s caused by the Destruction Energy? I guess the breakthrough you mentioned is coming from that as well?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

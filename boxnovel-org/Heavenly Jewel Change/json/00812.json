Brother Long, you\u2019ve been cultivating all your life. Don\u2019t you want to break through to the Heavenly God Tier to see what it\u2019s like to be another level higher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya scoffed, \u201cYou\u2019re just saying it \u2013 who doesn\u2019t know how to make empty promises? Haven\u2019t you been stuck at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier for many years already as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Mo laughed out loud, nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, perhaps it\u2019ll be rather difficult to convince you with empty promises, Brother Long. I shall prove it to you with the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>The aura on Shen Mo grew more powerful as he spoke, and a dense black glow then shot up from his body. Suddenly, the entire sky became dark, especially the wide area behind Shen Mo. A gigantic purplish-black shadow appeared slowly, looking like an enormous head with a huge mouth capable of engulfing everything. Darkness, destruction, fear and other many negative emotions exploded at that moment. Even the people atop the Heavenly Snow Mountain felt that the gigantic mouth wanted to engulf it in its entirety.</p><br/><p>The people who were present were powerhouses that were above the Heavenly King-tier. All of them could adjust the Atmospheric Energy for their personal use and they could sense it at its deepest. They soon realized that all sorts of attribute elements in the air broke when the sky turned dark and was absorbed ferociously by the endless black shadow. There was a layer made of an odd black color that appeared around Shen Mo\u2019s entire body. His eyes had turned dark purple and instead of calling him a human, perhaps it would be more apt to say that he looked more like the devil. Almost everyone present was affected by the terrifying aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Divine Territory?\u201d Countless exclamations broke out on top of Heavenly Snow Mountain. Everyone knew what that was about, naturally, they recognized the ability Shen Mo was using.</p><br/><p>Aside from a Divine Territory, what other ability could be this powerful? Xue Ao\u2019tian, Shangguan Tianyang, Tianyue and the rest turned serious. They knew very well what a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse could do. Even ten Heavenly Emperors combined could not fight a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. Besides, the existence of a Heavenly God would mean that his parents would benefit from his ability. Otherwise, Xue Ao\u2019tian would not be capable of bringing the Heavenly Snow Mountain to such a high position on the mainland with his powerful cultivation base.</p><br/><p>The Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain was the one and only Heavenly God-tier powerhouse in the world and was ranked No.1 throughout his generation. His position became unstable when Shen Mo showcased his Destructive Divine Territory. Most importantly, everybody present was smart. Naturally, they would wonder \u2014 even the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Deputy Hell Lord was already at the Heavenly God Tier. How could Fen Tian, who was the Hell Lord, not be a Heavenly God?</p><br/><p>The release of the Destructive Divine Territory, as well as the conversation between Shen Mo and Long Shiya would mean that he was trying to make Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor succumb to him without having to put up a fight. The Blood Red Hell\u2019s true color had finally been revealed at that very moment. Shen Mo\u2019s eyes that had turned a dark purple were glaring ferociously at his opponent. As his opponent, Long Shiya was deeply affected by his Destructive Divine Territory. Although Shen Mo did not take action, the terrifying Destructive Thoughts that came from the Destructive Divine Territory seemed like it was going to break his body apart. The six-colored glow around his body was continuously diminishing, seeming like it was going to collapse anytime.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya chuckled and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that you\u2019ve already broken through the Heavenly Emperor Tier. The Destructive Divine Territory\u2026 Such a great feeling to be able to destroy the heavens and earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Mo then said with his deep voice, \u201cBrother Long, this will be your last chance. If you\u2019re willing, especially with your intelligence and foundation, you\u2019ll be even more powerful than I am in the future. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Shiya maintained the smile on his face. Despite having to face the overbearing suppression of the Destructive Divine Territory, he seemed not the least bit pressured. \u201cI\u2019ve never expected you, Shen Mo, to show me such a majestic thing. Since you\u2019ve shown me something, I shall show you something in return.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Long Shiya\u2019s face disappeared suddenly as he spoke. He pointed to the sky with his left hand and the ground with his right hand. Both his hands started moving at the same time, and his six-colored glow that was growing weak from the Destructive Divine Territory\u2019s suppression increased in power ferociously out of the blue. Then, two hexagrams appeared \u2014 one above his head, the other beneath his feet.</p><br/><p>The dazzling six-colored glow burst out suddenly and shot into the sky. They forcefully broke open the Destruction Energy and a large area of darkness in the sky was illuminated by the rays of the six-colored glow. The sun shone from the sky onto the top of the six-colored glow, forming a big cloud illuminated by the six-colored glow in the sky. The Destructive Divine Territory could not destroy the cloud of light that was consolidated by the six attributes. A plump shadow appeared behind Long Shiya, the gigantic shadow being hundreds of feet tall. It was the enlarged version of himself.</p><br/><p>Everyone atop the Heavenly Snow Mountain was shocked to see that happening before their eyes. Xue Ao\u2019tian mumbled, \u201cHe did it! He has really done it! Six Ultimate Divine Territory, he has broken through to the Heavenly God Tier now.\u201d Disappointment flashed across Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s face. If they were to ask who amongst them knew Long Shiya best, it was not Zhou Weiqing, but Xue Ao\u2019tian. He had fought with Long Shiya many a time, and Xue Ao\u2019tian knew very well that he was nothing like Long Shiya when their talents were compared. Even if he possessed the Saint Attribute, his talents paled in comparison to Long Shiya\u2019s. The reason why he managed to break through to the Heavenly God Tier was because he had the Saint Land\u2019s support as the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Meanwhile, Long Shiya achieved what he had today all with his own abilities.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya had broken through the level of Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor to achieve the level of a Six Ultimate Heavenly God. Xue Ao\u2019tian knew that he might not be able to fight Long Shiya any longer if it was based purely on their individual abilities. Shock then overcame Fen Tian. He had never thought that Long Shiya would be able to break through to the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>What did it mean when a Saint Land had a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse? It was clear with only one look at the Heavenly Snow Mountain. At that moment, nobody was questioning the Peerless Sect\u2019s position as a Saint Land any longer. Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya and the Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor-tier Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue \u2013 both of them were enough to support the powerful Saint Land. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing did not lose to Fen Tian when he was fighting the latter earlier. Even if Fen Tian held back, what Zhou Weiqing did was rather stunning.</p><br/><p>Initially, Shen Mo was a little shocked when he saw Long Shiya releasing the Divine Territory but he managed to react swiftly. His expression dimmed as an intense will to kill exploded from within his body. The petrifying Destructive Thoughts that were released from the Destructive Divine Territory dashed towards the Six Ultimate Divine Territory that Long Shiya released ferociously.</p><br/><p>The characteristic of the Destructive Divine Territory was destruction \u2013 pure destruction, while Long Shiya\u2019s Six Ultimate Divine Territory\u2019s characteristic was balanced. With the harmony between the six attributes, a system created from the Six Ultimate Divine Territory containing a little bit of Saint Energy aura was formed. No matter how much Destructive Energy was attacking it externally, it could not be destroyed \u2013 only neutralized and absorbed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations Brother Long, I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019ve already achieved the Heavenly God Tier. It seems like you are not taking my suggestion into consideration anymore.\u201d Shen Mo said in a cunning manner.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya pouted and said in disdain, \u201cYou only figured it out now? What an idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty Long, since you\u2019re asking for death, I shall fulfill your wish.\u201d Shen Mo had a sinister look in his eyes, as he slapped Long Shiya with his palm in the air. At the same time, dark purple light flowed around his body. A ten-piece legendary set was put on his body, and dark purple battle axes appeared in both his hands. The demonic shadow behind him opened its mouth as a deafening shriek was heard. All of the Destructive Energy expanded and dashed towards Long Shiya\u2019s Six Ultimate Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>The Hiltless Heavenly Purging Set appeared on Long Shiya\u2019s body, while the Silver Octagon Plum Blossom Hammers appeared on both sides of his body. The shadow that was a hundred feet tall behind him moved; the plump shadow then collided with the gigantic black mouth.</p><br/><p>Crack \u2014</p><br/><p>The sky seemed to break open from their collision. The shadow that Long Shiya created was torn by the gigantic mouth ruthlessly, but it took a hard blow from the shadow\u2019s hammer.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the black light and the six-colored glow in the sky vibrated intensely. The two Divine Territories were fighting head-on. Long Shiya and Shen Mo did not just watch without doing anything. The two of them began to battle despite being hundreds of meters away from each other. Shen Mo threw the battle hammers in his hands, and a black Light Blade dashed towards Long Shiya following the trail of the crack in the skies. Long Shiya separated his hammers, and a gigantic black hole that was more than a hundred meters in diameter appeared between them. A loud bang then ensued.</p><br/><p>It was a whole new experience in comparison to the battle between a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse and a cultivator on the Heavenly Emperor Tier earlier. However, the powerhouses on top of the Heavenly Snow Mountain felt a catastrophic energy wave from the two simple collisions.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the both of them controlled themselves as they ascended higher into the sky in unison during the battle, lest the impact from their collisions landed on the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Otherwise, the powerhouses from the Five Saint Lands would be forced to take action.</p><br/><p>The gigantic black hole had separated Long Shiya and Shen Mo temporarily. Although they were both Heavenly God-tier powerhouses, they did not dare to be absorbed into the black hole.</p><br/><p>With a powerful enemy close by, it would be difficult for any of them to escape. Long Shiya backed off and quickly entered the hundred foot shadow that he created from his Divine Territory. Suddenly, the shadow became clearer as it materialized. The six-colored glow was shining brightly as if it was borrowing the light from the sun. The glows were flowing, and massive Destruction Energy was broken down. Within a second, the tables were turned on the Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the Destruction Attribute was completely different from the Saint Energy\u2019s Creation Attribute. Shen Mo\u2019s Destructive Divine Territory was more powerful than most Divine Territories as he had already achieved the Heavenly God Tier. Fortunately, there was a certain amount of Saint Energy in Long Shiya\u2019s Six Ultimate Divine Territory. Otherwise, under the onslaught of the Destructive Divine Territory, he would be at the losing end despite having the six attributes in his pocket. However, he did not consolidate a Saint Nucleus Core after all. Although the Saint Nucleus Core that Zhou Weiqing embedded into his body was pure, the integration of it with his personal cultivation base was limited to the Six Ultimate Divine Territory\u2019s Saint Energy aura.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

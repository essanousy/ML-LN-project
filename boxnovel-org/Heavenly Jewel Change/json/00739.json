Finally, the two of them launched the Neptune Shuttle and headed straight into the deep sea.</p><br/><p>In the entire year that Zhou Weiqing was living in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, he managed to gain himself a lot of benefits. Not only did he manage to complete his mission, his cultivation base had made considerable progress as well. His Saint Energy had been elevated to the 38th-tier, leaving him a step closer to solidifying his Saint Nucleus Core. Zhou Weiqing could faintly feel that if he succeeded in solidifying his Saint Nucleus Core, his cultivation base would most likely take another substantial leap. By then, he would be able to fight against a Heavenly Emperor-tier master, or maybe, even a Heavenly God-tier master.</p><br/><p>The Neptune Shuttle was extremely fast. Under the guidance of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy, it sped in the sea like a flash of lightning. At this rate, Zhou Weiqing predicted that he would be able to return to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace with Bing\u2019er in two months time at most.</p><br/><p>Soon, a day had gone by. The Neptune Shuttle that they drove had now entered the deep sea.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing continued to infuse his Saint Energy into the Neptune Shuttle, some changes suddenly took place in the sea in front of them. Because he was using his Saint Energy to run the shuttle, his perception was extremely keen. The shuttle was like an extension of his body. Right now, the shuttle seemed to have crashed into a huge invisible net. The strong force of restraint immediately slowed down their speed.</p><br/><p>There seemed to be no changes on the outside and the sea water still remained as clear as before but the force of restraint was awfully strong. Gradually, the Neptune Shuttle came to a halt.</p><br/><p>SH*T!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing secretly cried in his heart. He blasted more Saint Energy out and in that instance, a blinding silverish white light exploded from the shuttle. Instead of moving forward, it pierced through the water upwards and in a \u201cwhoosh\u201d, it suddenly stumbled out from the water.</p><br/><p>As soon as they charged upward, a horrendously big mouth unexpectedly clamped shut at the place they were just at a moment earlier. If they had even been a second slower, they would have most likely been swallowed by that horrendously big mouth.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er had already leaped out of the Neptune Shuttle before quickly putting it away into the Sumeru Ring. They were both hovering in the air at the moment.</p><br/><p>Both of them instantly flapped open their wings at the same time, climbing higher into the air as they stared at the spot below.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a huge vortex with at least a kilometer wide diameter suddenly appeared on the surface of the sea. It was also at this time that a deep, grievous voice sounded from below the vortex.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it! It\u2019s actually you people! Boy, let\u2019s see who is going to save you now!\u201d</p><br/><p>A ferocious and gigantic head emerged slowly from the center of the vortex. It was none other than the Dreadfiend Sea Naga that Zhou Weiqing and Dongfang Hanyue had brutally injured last time.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing laid eyes on it, he was taken aback. He thought to himself, \u2018How clingy can this guy be? I\u2019m already driving the Neptune Shuttle so fast and he still manages to stop me in time. What\u2019s with my luck\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>If the conditions were similar to when he traveled from the Boundless Mainland to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, Zhou Weiqing would never forget this little detail and he would most likely take a longer detour. However, since he was accompanied by two giant dragons right now, he did not bother trying to avoid anything on the way back. Still, it came as quite a shock to him that he would come across the Dreadfiend Sea Naga midway.</p><br/><p>It had only been a few days but it seemed like this fellow had not only fully restored his health, he also appeared much larger than he was before. Apart from that, his cultivation base also seemed to have increased substantially.</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhou Weiqing was the fool right here. Had he not driven the Neptune Shuttle, no matter how powerful the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was, it would not have been able to discover them in such a vast open sea. The Neptune Shuttle was made from the Nucleus Core from the father of two Dreadfiend Sea Nagas. The aura that the shuttle released was too familiar to the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. How could he possibly not notice them?</p><br/><p>Having felt such a familiar aura all of a sudden, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga would naturally rush over immediately. As for the increase in his cultivation base, it was not that he had gotten a blessing in disguise during the battle. What happened was, even though his brother had self-detonated in the previous battle, he did not blow himself into pieces. Because of that, part of his Nucleus Core remained intact as it fell into the sea. So, how could the Dreadfiend Sea Naga before them not be able to find it?</p><br/><p>It was all thanks to his brother\u2019s remaining Nucleus Core that he could restore his body in such a short time. It had also helped in improving his cultivation base greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like lady luck is on our side,\u201d Zhou Weiqing told Bing\u2019er who was by his side. He completely ignored the Dreadfiend Sea Naga below. Instead, he led her as they continued flying in the sky, trying to put some distance between them and the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.</p><br/><p>Right now, Bing\u2019er was a little bit nervous. After all, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was a Heavenly God-tier master, the overlord of the ocean. Not only that, it had quite a ferocious appearance as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the Dreadfiend Sea Naga?\u201d She asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head as he replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, relax! I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga did not even feel the slightest bit of anxiety as he watched them soar higher and higher in the sky. Without warning, his gigantic body thrust upwards from the sea surface. Even though it had no wings, it was able to fly with the help of its tyrannical cultivation base.</p><br/><p>When he was in the sea, his perception ability was mightily potent. He had long noticed that Dongfang Hanyue was not by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side. Instead, there\u2019s a human beside him that had a far weaker cultivation base. For this reason, he did not feel anxious at all.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga hated Zhou Weiqing to the core. He would never stop until he could torture Zhou Weiqing to death. He also wanted the torturing process to be lengthy as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er were flying at full speed. In just a short while, they had managed to travel a kilometer away. Still, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was hard on their heels. Right now, the sky had completely turned azure blue. The water element in it was slowly turning richer and more intense. The restraining power was constantly increasing as well as it slowed down Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er\u2019s flying speed.</p><br/><p>All of this was because the Dreadfiend Sea Naga wanted to scare them and raise their fear bit by bit. Zhou Weiqing was all alone now. Even though previously Zhou Weiqing suddenly exploded and launched a fearsome attack on it, who did you think the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was? How could he not notice that it was just a fleeting explosive ability? This time he had come prepared. He was absolutely confident that he would be able to crush Zhou Weiqing to death easily this time.</p><br/><p>The sinister energy ripple continued to fluctuate in the air. At this time, even Zhou Weiqing started to feel uneasy. The reason why he felt unease was not because he was worried that he would not be able to flee from the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Instead, he was anxious that he might not be able to kill the Dreadfiend Sea Naga off completely later.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, you won\u2019t stand a chance today! I\u2019ll skin you alive and make you suffer inch by inch! Oh yeah! The energy in your body seems to be quite special and it might be a little useful to me. I guess I\u2019ll just devour all of them! You don\u2019t even have to bother trying to resist me\u201d</p><br/><p>The pressure brought by the water element in the air increased dramatically. The disconcerting energy ripple suddenly amplified as it increased its pressure. It made it impossible for Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er to continue soaring up the sky with their flying ability.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s body that had lengthened to 100 meters long was now hovering in mid-air. It was completely unnecessary for his body to be immersed in the sea when dealing with Zhou Weiqing alone. Furthermore, this was just above the sea after all. The Water element in the air was still as intense as usual.</p><br/><p>Staring at the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, Zhou Weiqing suddenly burst out laughing, \u201cHey big guy! Don\u2019t think that you\u2019ve already won the battle. The game has only just begun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er were no match for the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Considering the dangers in the ocean, he usually would not choose to use such a direct route to travel back to the Boundless Mainland. However, he had his options, of course. Compared to when he was in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, he was a lot more confident than before. After all, he was still unsure whether his summoning would be successful or not when he was in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. However, he no longer had to worry about that any longer.</p><br/><p>Two rays of red light blasted out from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest almost at the same time. One headed to the sky while another headed to the sea. Before the formidable Dreadfiend Sea Naga could figure out what had just happened, the sky and the sea started to change color concurrently.</p><br/><p>Before the Dreadfiend Sea Naga appeared, Hui Yao had already spoken to Zhou Weiqing. How could the two gigantic dragons not notice the Heavenly God-tier powerhouse\u2019s aura? Zhou Weiqing luring the Dreadfiend Sea Naga up to the sky was actually carried out under Hui Yao\u2019s instruction as well. If the sea naga was in the sea, even though they could easily beat him, they could not completely stop him from escaping. After all, the geographical position was obviously on his side. However, the situation was completely different now that he had come up to the sky. Although they were still above the sea, the sky was the domain of the Dragon Emperor Bloodline. How could they possibly let the Dreadfiend Sea Naga run rampant?</p><br/><p>When the disturbing red light blossomed, it blotted up the sky and covered up the earth. The Dreadfiend Sea Naga suddenly panicked. He immediately tried to plunge down towards the big sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back!\u201d Duo Si\u2019s disdainful voice resonated all of a sudden. In a violent rumble, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s body was thrown back up violently.</p><br/><p>When the red lights appeared, a warm gush of energy had already shrouded Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er in it. The next moment, their bodies were lifted up high in the sky. They could no longer clearly see whatever was happening below them. All that they could see was an endless shade of red.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er could faintly feel the potent energy ripples that were being shadowed by the red ray. However, it was merely a surge as they were barely affected by the ripples from where they were at.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that a battle among three gigantic dragons would be a remarkably thrilling one. However, in order to ensure Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er\u2019s safety and to prevent the Dreadfiend Sea Naga from resorting to desperate measures when he was pushed to the brink, Hui Yao did not allow them to watch the battle.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, ten minutes had gone past. The surging red cloud slowly died down and all of a sudden, the red lights converged as everything below re-appeared before Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga that was originally brutal and insolent suddenly lost all of his Heavenly God-tier aura. Although his body was monstrous, he still paled significantly in comparison to Hui Yao.</p><br/><p>At this time, Hui Yao\u2019s two front claws were latched on to his neck and spine respectively as he lifted the Dreadfiend Sea Naga high up in the air. His body had shortened by a third now. The tail on the lower half of his body had completely disappeared and there were also traces of violent burning. The ferocious-looking spikes on his entire body were flattened almost by two-thirds. In front of the two Dragon Emperor\u2019s descendant, along with the fact that they were in the sky, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga stood no chance at all.</p><br/><p>The sea naga was not yet dead. It was merely restricted by Hui Yao\u2019s insolent dragon force. Right now, his eyes no longer had any viciousness in them. Instead, they were filled with intense fear.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing spread his hands out, \u201cSee? I told you earlier that I have the Dragon Emperor Bloodline but you didn\u2019t believe me! You can\u2019t possibly escape now, you know. This time, although we\u2019ve taken the Spatial Teleportation Stone from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, we helped them to solve their trouble as well. Hmm, not bad! Sir Hui Yao, just kill this fellow off and save him from creating nuisance in the sea in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao chuckled, \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry to kill him off yet. He is still of some use to us!\u201d Although they were all dragons, there were actually multiple dragon clans. On top of that, Hui Yao who was the descendant of the almighty, prestigious Dragon Emperor had repeatedly owed his life to Zhou Weiqing. He had always wanted to repay his kindness and now was just the perfect time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still some use? Could it be that you want him to carry us back to the Boundless Mainland, Sir?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao shook his head, \u201cHow\u2019s that possible? Just because he looks slouchy with his head hanging down, he\u2019ll be completely different the moment he\u2019s released back into the sea. One of the natural ability of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga is to absorb energy from the sea to restore his own health. Although his injury is quite heavy now, as long as he enters the sea, he can flee immediately using his secret technique. It won\u2019t be long before he returns to a lively state. For this reason, we can never let it touch sea water again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga who was in Hui Yao\u2019s clutch had a look of desperation and despair in his eyes as he listened to Hui Yao\u2019s words. Right now, under Hui Yao\u2019s grip, he could not even detonate his Nucleus Core even if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>Unconvinced, Zhou Weiqing asked, \u201cThen, what do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Yao let out a chuckle, \u201cYou brat! Sometimes you\u2019re smart but sometimes you can be so obtuse. It\u2019s not easy to get such a good target you know. Or could it be that your Demonic Devour is only there for decoration purposes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he heard that, Zhou Weiqing was taken completely by surprise. Demonic Devour. Could it be that the reason why Hui Yao kept the Dreadfiend Sea Naga alive was to let him devour it?</p><br/><p>That time, when they were in the Luster Spatial Realm, he did indeed devour Hui Yao and Duo Si\u2019s dragon energy but that was only a partial devour that was under the control of the two giant dragons. Hui Yao had said that he would need several years to restore himself after Zhou Weiqing had devoured his energy. However, now that he thought about it, it must have been a joke so that he would feel relieved while he set off to look for the Spatial Teleportation Stone.</p><br/><p>It was exactly because he had devoured their energy before that Zhou Weiqing was even more aware of the atrocity of the gigantic dragons\u2019 Heavenly Energy. That was by no means a small amount of energy. Moreover, if he were to devour the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s Heavenly Energy, he did not need to think twice like before. Instead, he could directly devour his ultimate source of energy. How ghastly would a Heavenly God-tier Heavenly Beast\u2019s entire Heavenly Energy along with its ultimate source of energy be? Even Zhou Weiqing found it to be somewhat difficult to imagine.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao nodded his head at him, \u201cStop standing there blankly and get started right away! I\u2019ve sensed your body and it seems like your cultivation base has increased again. Your body has also become much tougher now. There shouldn\u2019t be any problem for you to devour this Dreadfiend Sea Naga. If you find the energy to be too much for you, you can share a little of it with your little girlfriend there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was not a pretentious person so he did not try to disguise the excitement in his heart. After giving Hui Yao a deep bow, he immediately went in front of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga in a flash.</p><br/><p>When the Dreadfiend Sea Naga saw Zhou Weiqing approaching him, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s eyes instantly lit up with hatred again. Ever since he came across this man, he had always been accompanied by back luck. What was he going to do now?</p><br/><p>Before the Dreadfiend Sea Naga could think about it any further, a sharp pain suddenly could be felt on his neck. The bloodcurdling coercion force left him with no opportunity to even resist.</p><br/><p>In order to ensure Zhou Weiqing\u2019s safety and prevent the sea naga from acting defiantly, Duo Si had also flown close and clutched onto his body from the other side, firmly holding it in the sky.</p><br/><p>In that situation, let alone the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, even his elder brother and possibly his father would be helpless under the clutches of two Heavenly God-tier gigantic dragons at the same time. After all, this was the powerful suppression of the Dragon Emperor\u2019s two descendants.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing flew non stop to the front of the Dreadfiend Sea Naga before coming to a halt. At the same time, he motioned for Bing\u2019er to hover by his side. Once his body could no longer receive the energy, he would transform the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s Heavenly Energy into Saint Energy before infusing it into Bing\u2019er\u2019s body, dividing some of the energy and giving it to her.</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base had been elevated to the Ninth Jewel, his trip to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland could be considered as extremely dangerous. Be it infiltrating the Mysterious Heavenly Palace or facing the Dreadfiend Sea Naga later on, the powerhouses that he encountered all had the strength to put him to death.</p><br/><p>Now that he was going back to the Boundless Mainland, the situation in the Boundless Mainland was much more complicated than the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. Even though the powerhouses that Zhou Weiqing faced at one time in the Boundless Mainland were not as many or concentrated as it was in the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, in truth, there were more powerhouses in the Boundless Mainland compared to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. Not only that, there were still the owners of the Destruction Energy and only God knew where they were now. Not to mention the possible crisis that the unknown Netherworld would bring to the world.</p><br/><p>For this reason, what he needed now was to strengthen his own power. With such a good opportunity presented in front of him, he would naturally not let it slip away. There was nobody else in this world who had such opportunities.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Devour technique was the only one in the entire Boundless Mainland. Coupled with the assistance from these two dragons, even the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord would not be able to encounter such thing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing directly stepped on the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s gigantic head. Reaching out with his hands, he grabbed onto the two sharp spikes on the sea naga\u2019s head that had not been destroyed yet.</p><br/><p>Earlier, the spikes could shoot devastating jets of the water element. However, at this moment, it was unfortunate that they had become inanimate objects under Hui Yao and Duo Si\u2019s pressure.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing first calmed his mind down. At the same time, he mobilized the Saint Energy inside his body to make the process more harmonious.</p><br/><p>He was not in rush to cast the Devour technique just yet. After all, the energy that he was about to devour was just too tremendous. If he was a little careless, there could be adverse effects instead. Zhou Weiqing was a smart person. He would never make such a careless mistake.</p><br/><p>After 15 minutes, he had already adjusted his physical condition to the best state and maintained his body in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation. The silver light on his body loomed distinctively on his skin\u2019s surface and the Saint Energy aura that was filled with a sense of creativity was unleashed from his body.</p><br/><p>The feeling that the energy radiated was not too strong but it did have a kind of fair and mild but awe-inspiring power. As the energy was running, even the Dreadfiend Sea Naga that was about to be devoured did not feel any threat from them at all. He did not understand what Zhou Weiqing was trying to do. However, in the next moment, he started becoming extremely restless.</p><br/><p>The soft silverish white light suddenly changed color as a faint virtual image gradually rose up behind Zhou Weiqing. It was the Demon God\u2019s Mirror Illusion.</p><br/><p>Both of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands had turned pure grey. Intense grey rays were circulating in the air. The strong evil aura gave off a bloodcurdling sense of pressure. Without warning, a terrifying suction force immediately appeared on both his hands. The formidable suction energy directly siphoned the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s pure Heavenly Energy from his body into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s own body.</p><br/><p>Being able to reach the Heavenly God-tier meant that all of the Heavenly Energy in its body was at its most concentrated and purest state. The Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s entire body was like a huge block of solid energy. Under the support of the Saint Energy\u2019s Ninth Jewel cultivation base, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s devouring speed was extremely fast but the Heavenly Energy in the sea naga\u2019s body was so tremendously huge that it felt like the energy was flowing out very slowly.</p><br/><p>Just as the gigantic dragon Hui Yao had said, the current state of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was far from being comparable to how it was before. Even though he had managed to raise his cultivation base up to the Ninth Jewel after devouring the Heavenly Energy from the two dragons, that was merely a direct boost to his energy. At that time, he had already reached the limit that his body could bear.</p><br/><p>Along with the completion of his Immortal Deity Technique, his body was now filled with the Saint Energy that could recirculate on its own. In that one year after devouring the energy, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was constantly improved by the Saint Energy. During this process of improvement, his body had become more and more refined. The impurities in his body were constantly being dispelled by the Saint Energy through respiration. One could say that right now, the scent of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was so pure that it could even be compared to a baby. Not only that, his body\u2019s toughness had become so high that even many Heavenly King and Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses were no match for him.</p><br/><p>This was also one of the reasons why when he first encountered the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s attack, he did not suffer much from any serious injuries.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, the continuous improvement of his body also heavily affected his meridians. The meridians that he possessed had already reached a level where it could completely sustain solid energy.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy was the most powerful attribute and it could even create heaven and earth. How could its effect be compared to other ordinary energies? On top of that, Zhou Weiqing himself also possessed the fusion between the Dark Demon God Tiger and Dragon Emperor bloodlines. Before this, he had just recently been baptized by the Demon God Energy. It elevated his Saint Energy to another level.</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, one could say that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was constantly being improved secretly every day. His body\u2019s physical strength was so strong that he had reached a level that he himself did not know of.</p><br/><p>Two waves of Heavenly Energy poured out from his palms into his body. However, this time, Zhou Weiqing did not feel the kind of unbearable feelings he had when he devoured Hui Yao\u2019s energy that time.</p><br/><p>After the pure Heavenly Energy flooded into his body, it was instantly disintegrated by his 36 major Death Acupuncture Points Chi current. After the energy was disintegrated, the 36 major Death Acupuncture Points turned into 36 funnels as it rapidly completed its filtration and conversion process.</p><br/><p>This was the advantage of raising his cultivation base. When Zhou Weiqing was devouring Hui Yao\u2019s energy, there was only one slightly large whirlpool that carried out the conversion process. However, this time, although the whirlpools that the 36 Death Acupuncture Points formed were not as enormous as that one last time, the number of whirlpools were far greater and the conversion speed was, without a doubt, very alarming.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the galaxy-like Saint Energy that was accumulated in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dantian also began to move rapidly. With no sense of humility, they took the Saint Energy that was obtained from the devouring process for themselves. To his surprise, the galaxy-like Saint Energy also started to run on its own as it formed the 37th whirlpool in his Dantian.</p><br/><p>However, this ultra Saint Energy whirlpool was not merely absorbing the energy. Instead, it began to carry out a secondary filtration as well.</p><br/><p>That was right, a secondary filtration. Once again, it filtered and concentrated the Saint Energy that was already filtered before this. Droplets of Saint Energy that was as dazzling as the galaxy oozed out from the bottom of the whirlpool before it merged into the whirlpool again.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Energy of a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse was indeed pure and concentrated. However, after undergoing the double refinement process by the Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, the volume became much smaller.</p><br/><p>This felt wonderful to Zhou Weiqing. He could literally feel his strength constantly being elevated with every passing second.</p><br/><p>Not only that, this kind of elevation was completely without any side effects. It was totally different from Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s infusion-like cultivation base elevation method.</p><br/><p>This was all thanks to the Saint Energy! Had it not been for the existence of the Saint Energy, even supposing Zhou Weiqing managed to devour the Heavenly God-tier\u2019s Heavenly Energy and managed to raise his cultivation base, there would still be a certain degree of adverse effects on his body. In fact, the effects on Dongfang Hanyue was actually considered mild.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy was the ultimate source of energy for the Heaven and Earth. One could say that all of the attributes were derived from the Saint Energy. For this reason, after the external energies went through the purification process, no impurities would be left in them at all. Moreover, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body had been purified by the Saint Energy for so long that he was now like a gigantic Saint Energy furnace. Under such circumstances, it would naturally not cause him any problems.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao had actually been observing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s condition. With his cultivation base, he could naturally feel the changes in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. In fact, he was quite taken aback by it. After all, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current speed of devouring the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s Heavenly Energy was much, much faster than the speed he used last time. Yet, after the huge pure Heavenly Energy entered his body, the amount that was converted into Saint Energy was almost next to nothing. What a terrible amount of energy he needed to do just that. How did he manage to condense the energy to such a level?</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current cultivation base was still far from being worthy in Hui Yao\u2019s eyes, something did cross Hui Yao\u2019s mind. If Zhou Weiqing managed to reach the Heavenly God Tier later, how strong would he be at that time? Maybe even ten Heavenly God-tier powerhouses of the same level could not defeat him even if they were to go at him at the same time.</p><br/><p>Indeed, this was a fact. To put it simply, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was at the Ninth Jewel right now. However, if there were ten other people whose cultivation base was also in the Ninth Jewel, were to have a go at him, there was nothing much that they could do to him. Even a Heavenly King-tier powerhouse would probably be unable to win against the current him as well. After he possessed the Demon God\u2019s Possession technique, it made him so strong that he could even challenge a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse now.</p><br/><p>Along with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s constant devouring, the grey virtual image behind him gradually turned more solid. Even though there was no face yet on the grey virtual image, with its gradual solidification, the aura that it was emitting was so formidable that even the two gigantic dragons started to feel a sense of inexplicable pressure.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao and Duo Si exchanged a look. They could clearly see the astonishment in each other\u2019s eyes. After all, it had only been one year since they last parted ways with Zhou Weiqing. Yet, in this one year, his strength made a substantial leap again. Especially the grey aura that he was emitting right now! That kind of coercive pressure was not something that was easily possessed even by a Heavenly God-tier master. Even though Zhou Weiqing only mobilized a small part of the grey aura and could not even operate it directly yet, just by having that sense of coercion itself was more than enough to show what kind of level he would attain in the future.</p><br/><p>The devouring process continued on as Zhou Weiqing carefully controlled the Saint Energy in his body. That comfortable feeling of ceaseless elevation made him thrilled with excitement. However, this was a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse that he was devouring, how could he possibly dare to let his guard down?</p><br/><p>As he continued to devour, he slowly distributed the Saint Energy Galaxia from the 37th whirlpool to the other 36 whirlpools, maintaining a state of equilibrium among all the 37 whirlpools in his body. The Saint Energy that was produced by all the 36 major Death Acupuncture Points was just enough for the 37th whirlpool to refine.</p><br/><p>Under Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga continued to tremble uncontrollably. The moment Zhou Weiqing started his devouring process, terror could be seen in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018What f*cking power is this? How can he pull my Heavenly Energy out of my body?\u2019 The sea naga thought to himself. Even for a Heavenly God-tier master, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s devouring speed was extremely speedy. Although the Dreadfiend Sea Naga could absorb the Water element from the atmosphere to restore his body, his restoring speed could not match up to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s devouring speed at all.</p><br/><p>The silverish white light around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body started becoming stronger. After the grey virtual image behind him started to get clearer, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga fell into a state of unconsciousness. Faced with the Demon God\u2019s pressure force, it left him with no opportunity to resist at all. Moreover, the Heavenly Energy in his body was steadily decreasing. It was obvious that his puissant life was slowly deteriorating in this process.</p><br/><p>In truth, the Demon Devour was not just devouring its target\u2019s Heavenly Energy. Instead, it would take the opportunity to devour its target\u2019s vitality too. In fact, it was able to devour all kinds of energy out there.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhou Weiqing did not have to hold himself back in the devouring process. In this case, there was only one outcome awaiting the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. And that was being devoured until it died.</p><br/><p>Day gradually turned into night. And night slowly returned to day again.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s devouring process was still going on.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga indeed lived up to its status as a Heavenly God-tier master. Adding on to the fact that he had once devoured his brother\u2019s partial Nucleus Core and transformed it into his own energy, the Heavenly Energy that he possessed in his body was remarkably huge.</p><br/><p>Time continued to go on. Soon, three days had gone by.</p><br/><p>During these three days, nothing disturbed Zhou Weiqing at all. With the two huge Heavenly God-tier gigantic dragons watching over him, even the weather was under their control.</p><br/><p>Bing\u2019er had also been nervously watching from the side. Even though she could not devour the energy directly, the powerful Saint Energy that was emitting from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body through the devouring process turned out to be beneficial for her too. She did not even have to control anything and her body\u2019s Saint Energy was already operating on its own. Not only that, the speed of her cultivation base was much quicker than her usual cultivation speed. This was also the reason why she could maintain the Wings of the Wind God while she hovered in mid-air all this while without feeling exhausted at all.</p><br/><p>Three days and another three days. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s devouring process had been going on for a total of nine days now.</p><br/><p>When the ninth day arrived, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s body had completely lost its luster. The Heavenly Energy in his body was almost cleaned out by Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>The Zhou Weiqing right now had a complete 180-degree change from how he was nine days ago. Bing\u2019er who had been watching from the side could see the changes most clearly. She was surprised to find that her Little Fatty somehow seemed more handsome now. His originally bronze skin had turned quite fair while emitting a faint luster. There seemed to be a faint light flowing under his skin. Even though he was in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation state, his skin no longer had the tiger tattoo.</p><br/><p>The most significant change was none other than the virtual image behind him and the Saint Energy around his body.</p><br/><p>His Saint Energy had completely transformed into the Saint Energy Galaxia. It had turned into strips of light that circled his body. Right now, Zhou Weiqing was like the center of a galaxy. Everything revolves around his body with him in the center.</p><br/><p>The grey virtual image behind his body had gradually converged in silence. Instead of vanishing entirely, it appeared on top of the sky. Its body was 1000 feet tall.</p><br/><p>Even though Hui Yao and Duo Si could not sense any hostility at all, they could still feel a powerful pressure emitting out of the huge virtual image. It was a good thing that they and Zhou Weiqing were standing on the same side. For this reason, the huge virtual image did not show any kind of aggression towards them. However, they could not help but wonder if they would be affected had they not been friends.</p><br/><p>All this while, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes were closed. However, the Saint Energy Galaxia on his body was gradually turning brighter and brighter. One could faintly see that right in the center of his chest, there was a star cluster that was moving in a spiral and it was responding and coordinating with the galaxy belt around his body. Accompanied by his breathing, his entire body exuded a faint looming light.</p><br/><p>At this time, Bing\u2019er did not even dare to breathe out loud. Even though she was unclear what level Zhou Weiqing was at now, she could vaguely feel that he had reached an incredibly critical moment.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s Heavenly Energy had almost been completely emptied by him. At this moment, the energy that Zhou Weiqing was absorbing was none other than the ultimate source of energy in its Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, today would be the last day of devouring for Zhou Weiqing. It was also the most important day for him.</p><br/><p>Along with the rise of his own cultivation base, his body continued to improve. After a total of nine days of devouring, his body did not feel bloated at all until yesterday.</p><br/><p>From what Bing\u2019er could see, the Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body had completely transformed into the Saint Energy Galaxia. When all of his Saint Energy had completed the transformation process, he could feel that the energy in his body was completely filled up.</p><br/><p>After he started to feel bloated, the first thing that underwent changes was the 37th whirlpool.</p><br/><p>This whirlpool no longer continued its process of energy conversion because this process was no longer needed. The 36 Death Acupuncture Points could also convert the Saint Energy that he devoured into the Saint Energy Galaxia.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The First and Third Grand Elder instantly summoned up a Barrier of Destruction Attribute energies to defend against Long Shiya\u2019s attack. Behind them, the other Blood Red Hell powerhouses also moved swiftly, gathering behind the two Grand Elders as they released their Consolidated Equipment.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At this moment, the true power of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was put on display. The Ten Thousand Quiescence Godslaying Arrows of his, even if the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord was facing it, he had to be extremely careful, lest he get struck by the multitude of arrows. Currently, although the attacks were rather spread out, the destructive power was far beyond the expectations of the First and Third Grand Elders.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Destruction Barrier that the First and Third Grand Elders had erected was now riddled with holes from the attack. Although both of them were not injured, they had been forced down from flight back to the ground, totally losing any chance of saving the Second Grand Elder.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Not only that, since the Destruction Barrier was pierced through and broken, the other Blood Red Hell powerhouses at the back were in trouble. The first to bear the brunt of attacks were naturally those who had been struck and inflicted with the Dragon Silencing Seal. They were not even able to unleash their Consolidated Equipment, so how could they possibly defend themselves against Long Shiya\u2019s powerful attacks? Those who had been struck by the six coloured light arrows had their entire bodies warped into six lights, before vaporizing and scattering into the air.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It was not just them, even the others did not have it easy. At least over a dozen of the other powerhouses were struck, and despite their defenses, blood spurted from their mouths as they sustained severe injuries. Even the four Heavenly King powerhouses were no exception. After all, it was the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor\u2019s strongest attack, how could it be so easily withstood?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To withstand the Second and Fourth Grand Elders\u2019 attacks, executing a full out attack to slaughter the Fourth Grand Elder, then launching this unbelievably powerful attack right after\u2026 amongst all the Heavenly Emperors, perhaps only the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was able to accomplish it.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Energies filled with destructive aura swirled around. After that blow, Long Shiya gave a muffled grunt as he suffered the backlash, spurting out a mouthful of blood. After all, no matter how powerful he was, he was a single person clashing against so many powerhouses. Even if it were the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord here instead of him, he might not fare that much better.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The First and Third Grand Elder shouted out loud, warping into two rays of blood coloured light that soared into the air. They truly hated Long Shiya to the core, and this was the perfect opportunity where the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had overextended himself on offense, and was off balance without being able to recover in time, and was even injured. As long as they could seize this chance to finish off Long Shiya, they had absolute confidence in killing off Zhou Weiqing and the others as well.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A terrifying dark red light shot forth into the skies, filled with an overbearing Destruction aura, almost instantaneously covering an area more than several tens of thousands of square metres. In the entire area, the short tree stumps that remained after the Stars Trees were chopped down, along with all the uncut Stars Trees were actually vaporized at once, and the earth actually collapsed and sank in several dozen metres, as all of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses launched their attacks as once.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In this moment, the power of the Blood Red Hell showed itself. Although these Heavenly King powerhouses and Zong Stage powerhouses would not pose any threat at all to the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor individually, but they all had the Destruction Attribute. As they poured out their Heavenly Energy as one into the Destruction Barrier, not only did they mend the Destruction Barrier, they greatly boosted it once more, allowing the First and Third Grand Elder to wield the terrifying amounts of Destruction energies against Long Shiya.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Originally, when the Heavenly Demon Sect had been attacked by the Blood Red Hell, their strength was extremely powerful. However, they had been greatly disadvantaged by this exact same Destruction Attribute energies, and the ability of it to merge and stack together, forming a tyrannical power that could not be resisted. The two Low Level Heavenly Emperor Vice Sect Masters self-detonated in that battle, and it was only their sacrifice that allowed Wu Yunyue to escape with a small portion of the survivors. At that time, the Blood Red Hell First Grand Elder had not even joined the battle, and only the Second, Third and Fourth Grand Elders had taken action. The only reason the First Grand Elder would appear here now was because of Long Shiya and his reputation. At this point, they were going all out, and even one as powerful as the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor found himself shocked at the terrifying aura pressure he was facing.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At this point, Wu Yunyue and the six Heavenly Demon Sect Heavenly Kings had reached Long Shiya\u2019s side. However, the eight of them had different attributes, and they were unable to merge and stack their powers together. All they could do was to bring forth their most powerful defensive Skills individually to receive the incoming attacks from the First and Third Grand Elders.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">*Booom*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The skies darkened. Indeed, the entire skies turned black in the moment of the collision of both forces.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Naturally, that was not nightfall.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A massive black hole with a thousand metre diameter appeared out of nowhere, hovering in the skies. In the vicinity of the black hole, all of the atmospheric energies were being drawn in instantly, forcing both parties to be separated.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Far off in the distance, more than half of the Heavenly Bow Empire\u2019s walls actually collapsed in that moment. This was only the result of the energy reverberations. Luckily, after receiving the letter of challenge, Zhou Weiqing had given the order for the troops and citizens to move to the other side. Otherwise, who knew how many lives the energy fluctuations alone would have taken.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Once again, the First and Third Grand Elders were forced back onto the ground, the blood-red coloured light ball of Destruction energies clearly much dimmer now. The black hole created from the collision of both forces was just too terrifying, and even the energies of the Heavenly Emperors were being sucked in. No one dared to actually approach and touch it.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Although the Blood Red Hell powerhouses\u2019 attacks had been stopped successfully, the situation for the Heavenly Bow Empire side was dire indeed.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Including the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue, all eight of them spurted blood from their mouths, the fresh blood vaporizing into mist as the eight of them were sent flying back.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Long Shiya\u2019s injuries worsened, and his face turned pale with an ugly expression. He had not imagined that these Blood Red Hell powerhouses would actually be able to work together with such symmetry, unifying their powers in such a perfect merge. Even with the aid of the Demonic Emperor and his Heavenly Kings, they had not been able to withstand the attack, being put at a severe disadvantage.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Worse still, the Destruction energies had forcefully charged into their bodies, and they needed to expend a large amount of Heavenly Energy to withstand it, preventing themselves from being affected.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After the entire series of events and clashes, the Blood Red Hell had definitely suffered severe losses. The Fourth Grand Elder had perished in battle, and in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands, the Second Grand Elder was not far from death as well. Furthermore, several Heavenly Kings had been critically wounded, and a large amount of the Zong Stage powerhouses had been slaughtered. It could be said that their total fighting capabilities had been halved at least.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, the Heavenly Bow Empire side was also in deep trouble of their own. Although none of them had died, Long Shiya was now critically injured. At the same time, Wu Yunyue was also greatly injured; in the first place, his previous injuries had not fully recovered. As such, the two Max Level Heavenly Emperors did not retain much of their usual combat strength. The six Heavenly Kings had also taken different levels of injuries, and added on to the fact that the remaining Blood Red Hell powerhouses could actually join forces in such unison to launch their attacks, everything considered the Blood Red Hell side was still the one with the advantage. However, to be able to draw things so close from their original position of great weakness, the Heavenly Bow Empire side could already be extremely proud.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Alas, that pride was of no use at this current point. This was after all a fight to the death, and there would only be one end result for the loser.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue had a solemn, tense expression on his face. Although he did not wish to admit it, he was clear that the situation in front of them was akin to the original tight spot the Heavenly Demon Sect had been in when they had been attacked by the Blood Red Hell.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Blood Red Hell\u2019s Destruction Attribute was indeed overbearing and tyrannical. If it were in a one versus one fight, he was confident that with his Demonic Change State, he could still handle it. The Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s Core Elemental Attributes were the Demonic Attribute, Darkness Attribute and Life Attributes, three mighty Elemental Attributes. As the Sect Master, he had all three of them. In terms of power, even if Wu Yunyue could not compare to the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, only a fine line divided their power levels. That was the reason why the Heavenly Demon Sect was still able to survive all these years despite being suppressed by the other four Great Saint Lands.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, the problem was that they were no longer facing their enemies in single combat. They had already fully fallen out with the Blood Red Hell, so how could they possibly give them any other chances? Currently, both he and Long Shiya were severely injured, especially himself with fresh injuries added to his old ones, while Long Shiya had gotten injured several times over the course of this short but ferocious battle. At this level of fighting, it would not be realistic to place any hopes on the six Heavenly Kings they had brought along.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Blood Red Hell First and Third Grand Elders were no simple fellows. With the support of so many powerhouses, and the ability to merge and stack of the Destruction Attribute, their combat prowess was just too terrifying. Wu Yunyue dared to venture a guess that even if it were the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord facing up against these Blood Red Hell powerhouses on his own, it would still be tough for him.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This was a difference in level and state of the Attributes themselves. After all, the Destruction Attribute was definitely comparable to any Saint Attribute, perhaps even at a higher level. More importantly, there were actually so many people in the Blood Red Hell who had this Attribute, and it was the fusion merger and stacking prowess of this Destruction Attribute energies that was the truly fatal combination.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A savage light crossed Wu Yunyue\u2019s face. With the situation they were in currently, it would be extremely difficult to escape once more. Furthermore, as the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Demon Sect, he had his own pride and dignity! To be forced to flee like a coward again and again, this was a humiliation he was unable to take again. He had already set his resolve that even if he had to self-detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus, he would not back down today. He would fight these Blood Red Hell foes to the death, to take as many of them along with him.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In stark contrast to him, Long Shiya\u2019s expression was totally different. Although his injuries were just as severe, this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was still smiling, an interestingly ruminating and savoring smile. Perhaps Wu Yunyue might feel some regret over following Zhou Weiqing\u2019s plan today which had led to their current situation, but Long Shiya would not. That was because he understood his precious disciple too well. Without an eighty percent certainty or higher, he would not act rashly. This fight today, it was planned and calculated after questioning about all of the possible powerhouses that would come today from Wu Yunyue. How could he possibly make a fatal mistake like this so easily?\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">No matter the Heavenly Demon Sect or the Heavenly Bow Empire side, all of them had neglected one small detail. That was, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s true power. All of them were still underestimating this precious disciple of his.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In any ordinary circumstance, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s defensive capabilities were comparable to a High Level Heavenly Emperor, while his offensive capabilities could possibly equal a Mid Level Heavenly Emperor. However, all of those estimates was not considering the fact after he had activated the Astral Clouds. Once he had successfully done so, then Long Shiya was certain that he would become the most powerful person on their side. Indeed, even more powerful than Long Shiya himself.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Blood Red Hell First and Third Grand Elders were currently focusing all their attentions on the two Heavenly Emperors once more, and they were fully negligent about how Zhou Weiqing had actually managed to block the Second Grand Elder\u2019s full out attack without death or injury!</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

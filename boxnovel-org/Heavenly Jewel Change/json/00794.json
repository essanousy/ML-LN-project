Zhou Weiqing, who was watching by the side, instantly clenched his fists as he resisted the urge to rush forward and stop his Junior Master.</p><br/><p>The Aqua Tide that was sprayed with Duan Tianlang\u2019s blood immediately flared with turquoise light as it gradually started to swirl again. However, it looked like it was about to break at any moment with the cracks that appeared as it continued to pick up speed.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, Zhou Weiqing could see a smile breaking out on Duan Tianlang\u2019s face. That was right, a smile. A faint smile. It looked like he was satisfied with the current outcome.</p><br/><p>With trembling hands, Duan Tianlang took out a small turquoise bottle and opened its lid. Three drops of brightly colored blood that was filled with rich vitality flew out all at once as it fell into the Aqua Tide. That was the Elven Queen\u2019s Blood that Zhou Weiqing had brought back with him.</p><br/><p>With the infusion of the Elven Queen\u2019s blood, the cracks that were multiplying on the Aqua Tide immediately halted. In the next instant, the entire room turned completely turquoise in color. As if it had been injected with hot boiling oil, the pure energy from all kinds of attributes that were originally fluctuating inside the Aqua Tide suddenly hissed loudly before a fierce turquoise light burst up into the sky like a gigantic dragon. It smashed the ceiling as it broke out of the house.</p><br/><p>Almost instantaneously, Zhou Weiqing removed his Divine Thought. He could clearly sense that this ray of light was not something his Divine Thought could block. In the event of a collision, his Divine Thought might be smashed apart. One could easily imagine how formidable the power of this Consolidating Ink was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, stop it! It\u2019s trying to get away!\u201d Duan Tianlang shouted out at the top of his voice. At the same time, his Aqua Tide lost all luster as it slammed down to the ground with a deafening thud.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing reacted very quickly. The moment he heard his Junior Master\u2019s words, he instantly rushed out from the house without wasting even a second.</p><br/><p>When the turquoise light soared up to the sky, Zhou Weiqing could feel a sudden burst of powerful breath that was comparable to one from an individual on the Heavenly God Tier that erupted from the turquoise light. The moment the turquoise light soared up to the sky, it began to absorb all sorts of attributes\u2019 energy ripples from the air in a frenzy. It was almost like a huge devouring vortex that was even more devastating than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Demon Devour. None of the energy attributes in the air seemed to have any resistance towards it at all.</p><br/><p>In just a flash, Zhou Weiqing was already outside of the house. He was completely taken aback when he saw that ray of turquoise light. That light had completely evolved into a gigantic dragon that was 100 meters long, and it was climbing up the sky as it bared its fangs fiercely.</p><br/><p>However, it was completely different from the gigantic dragon that Zhou Weiqing had previously seen. This turquoise-colored dragon was completely crystal clear like it was carved out of a jade sculpture. Its body constantly ejected circles of turquoise lights that were absorbing various energy attributes to strengthen its body. It had nine claws under its abdomen and a pair of horns on its head. Every time it moved, a series of cracks could be seen appearing in the surrounding space. It seemed like this dragon was even more fearsome than the Dreadfiend Sea Naga that Zhou Weiqing had previously faced.</p><br/><p>With a cold snort, Zhou Weiqing lifted up his right hand and a bright stream of galaxy-like rays exploded out of his body. At that moment, the entire sky in the Heavenly Bow City turned dark and scattered stars instantly appeared out of thin air. Within seconds, all of the energy attributes were separated and isolated.</p><br/><p>What cultivation base was he at now? The Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier. Moreover, he even shared a life with the Elven Queen. His power was extremely strong. He would lose to the Mountain Lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain. His Saint Energy had already been purified to a nearly white gold level. Although it was still not on par with the Creation Saint Energy, it was constantly getting closer to it. One could say that this Saint Energy that he possessed was the purest Saint Energy that could be found in this world. It was even more powerful than the Elven Queen\u2019s Life Saint Energy. This was also one of the main reasons why even the Elven Queen was a little afraid of Zhou Weiqing and was willing to let her Elf Tribe remain in seclusion.</p><br/><p>The sky suddenly darkened as each and every one of the energy attributes suddenly vanished without a trace. The Jade Dragon appeared to be stunned for a moment before it immediately became panic-stricken. At once, its huge body wobbled in the air. Instantly, a silverish light flashed across. A layer of rich silverish light erupted from its body and enveloped its entire body. In an instant, an enormous black hole appeared out of thin air right before it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to escape?\u201d Without a doubt, this Jade Dragon was feeling threatened, and it was now trying to tear space apart to escape using the Spatial Attribute; part of the attributes that he possessed.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing would not let it off so easily. With his current cultivation base, he already understood how this Jade Dragon suddenly materialized after a short moment of being surprised.</p><br/><p>The valuable treasures became its body and the Elven Queen\u2019s blood became its life. One could say that this dragon was an ominous presence that was a combination of all the Atmospheric Energy. If it was allowed to absorb the Atmospheric Energy as freely as it liked, it would most likely form a brain of its own within a certain period of time. At that time, no one would be able to subdue it any longer. How dire would it be having a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse that possessed all the attributes in this world? It could even cultivate Saint Energy on its own and leave this world as it pleased.</p><br/><p>Not all Consolidating Inks for the eleventh piece of a legendary armor set would have such a problem. However, almost all of the Consolidating Ink of the eleventh piece of legendary armor sets would gain a spirit due to the fusion of countless valuable treasures.</p><br/><p>Although Duan Tianlang knew about the Consolidating Ink crafting method, he had zero experience in this. Even the Strength Legacy\u2019s founders did not have any ancient books or records that passed on this knowledge. If it was the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s Heavenly Jewel Island that was making a Consolidating Ink of this level, they would definitely lay down a large array of guards as a lookout. It was apparent that Duan Tianlang did not know that such a situation would occur. If it was not for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s powerful cultivation base, all of the efforts that he had exerted earlier would be in vain.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was feeling intensely excited instead of feeling angry. Just the Consolidating Ink itself was already this formidable. How would the Consolidated Equipment Scroll be like later? This was not something that could be easily speculated just by using imagination alone. Anyway, what was more urgent now was to subdue this Jade Dragon and start making the Consolidated Equipment Scroll.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a step forward in the air. Before the Jade Dragon could enter the black hole, he quickly appeared before it and lifted his right hand. At once, the black hole behind the dragon was instantly wiped off by a layer of golden light that exuded from his palm. It was as if it did not appear at all. Forming a fist with his left palm, he smashed it directly on the Jade Dragon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Only Zhou Weiqing had the guts to do something like that. If it was some other Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, the first thing that he would worry about was whether he would be sucked in by the black hole or not. However, Zhou Weiqing was not afraid of this at all. After all, he was able to use Spatial Travel. Moreover, he had also mastered the Galaxia Saint Energy. Due to this reason, the black hole was not a problem at all for him.</p><br/><p>With a muffled thud, the Jade Dragon was sent flying by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s fist. Its gigantic body tumbled a few times in the sky. After all, it only had its life and spirit given to him moments ago, and it did not know how to utilize it in a battle yet. Although it had a huge body full of energy, it could only use it to perform some simple things based on his instinct.</p><br/><p>Even a real Heavenly God-tier powerhouse might not necessarily be able to win against Zhou Weiqing, let alone this faux Heavenly God.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing pointed his right hand towards the sky as his eyes suddenly lit up. All of the stars in the sky gleamed in a dazzle and it was as bright as his eyes. Hundred of stars shone down and formed a huge cage that was made out of hundreds of light beams. It trapped the Jade Dragon within it. No matter how it struggled to try to break open the cage, it still could not break free.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was hovering empty-handed in mid-air and his eyes were shining brightly. Like a God that descended from Heaven, his body was surrounded by the galaxy belt that turned into a circle of light around him. The dazzling light was glowing with an incomparably powerful aura. The Astral Divine Territory \u2014 this was part of the powerful ability that Zhou Weiqing managed to master. Although he was still at the Heavenly Emperor Tier, he had already reached and mastered the Divine Territory. Moreover, his Divine Territory could be considered superior to all the Divine Territories in this world. This was because he had his Saint Energy as a foundation, the Saint Energy that could be used to create the world.</p><br/><p>By this time, the people of Heavenly Bow City had already discovered the changes in the air. When they saw Zhou Weiqing and the imprisoned Jade Dragon in the sky, the commoners were completely shaken to their core. With a series of thuds were heard, each and every one of them kneeled down on the ground as they paid homage to the both of them.</p><br/><p>It was also at this time that a crisp whistle resonated in the Heavenly Bow City. Even within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory, the loud and crisp whistle could ignite a violent energy ripple. Six-colored lights shot up into the sky at once. To his surprise, the powerful beams literally ripped apart a small area of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory, as it shot all the way up to the atmosphere. Soon after, a figure appeared out of nowhere and walked out of the six-colored lights.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha ha ha! You bastard! I finally made a breakthrough after working hard for so long!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at that round figure, was that not Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya?</p><br/><p>All this while, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had been using the Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing had transfused into his body to seek a breakthrough. He had stagnated at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier for too many years, just a stone throw away from his final breakthrough. Even though it was only a stone throw away, he could finally close the distance all thanks to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>Just a moment ago, he felt the Jade Dragon\u2019s Heavenly God-tier energy ripple. Coupled with the Saint Energy in his body that happened to coincide with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Astral Divine Territory\u2019s aura, lady luck was finally on his side. His strength had also reached a fully baked state. Now that all of the conditions had been met, he was finally able to break through. Within seconds, he had already become a Heavenly God.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya was not a person who hid his emotions. Moreover, breaking through to the Heavenly God Tier was a lifelong dream of his, just like how making the eleventh piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set was the lifelong dream of Duan Tianlang. One could easily imagine the sense of joy that was bursting out of his heart right now. In the midst of his frenzied laughter, his gaze landed on the Jade Dragon that was imprisoned in mid-air.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on your remarkable feat, Teacher!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The only Ancient Tree of Life that had gone through two evolutions had only appeared twice in the ancient times. These two times when the Ancient Tree of Life went through two evolutions made the Elf Tribe the ruler of the entire mainland. One could imagine how great the benefit of the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution was to the Elf Tribe.</p><br/><p>The Ancient Tree of Life before them was one that was in the process of evolving for the second time. The humans were now in power. Even if the Ancient Tree of Life managed to complete its evolution, it was impossible for the Elf Tribe to defeat the humans and dominate the mainland once again. However, with the second evolution of the Ancient Tree of Life, at least they did not have to hide in this Sealed Land and could walk out of here with dignity. They would not have to fear the dwindling population in the tribe anymore.</p><br/><p>This was historically meaningful to the Elf Tribe! Even an old fellow who had lived for more than 1,000 years old would cheer for this.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like there\u2019s no need for us to be worried about our safety anymore.\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er who was with the Seraphic Blazeangel mumbled. She was the most knowledgeable when it came to the Elf Tribe\u2019s legacy. She was surprised to witness the second evolution of the elves\u2019 Ancient Tree of Life. Apart from being surprised, she was even more impressed. There was no doubt the Elf Tribe had no need to hide anymore, and they would definitely walk out of this land after the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution.</p><br/><p>The five women appeared on the ground as the glow faded. Shangguan Xue\u2019er walked to the Elf Tribe Elders after nodding to the four women. She said to the First Elder of the Elf Tribe, \u201cI think it has been proven that we\u2019ve no evil intentions. The second evolution means that Your Majesty, The Queen, is also evolving. Instead of saying the Elven Queen is in danger, it\u2019s safe to say that the Elven Queen\u2019s current condition is better than when she left. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Elder of the Elf Tribe had gotten his emotion under control. He nodded as he listened to what Shangguan Xue\u2019er was saying. \u201cYes, yes. Since the Ancient Tree of Life has evolved, the Queen isn\u2019t in any danger. I would like to apologize for my reckless behavior earlier. Please stay for now. Perhaps all of you will be the Elf Tribe\u2019s guests of honor when the Queen returns.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like the First Elder had figured out that the evolution of the Ancient Tree of Life was related to Zhou Weiqing. Otherwise, why would it evolve when Zhou Weiqing had only gone out for a day while the queen had been at the Heavenly God Tier for hundreds of years yet nothing had happened? However, no matter what and no matter how, it was an immeasurably fortunate incident for the Elf Tribe! There was nothing for them to worry about.</p><br/><p>Even if the Elven Queen really died, as soon as the second evolution was complete, the Ancient Tree of Life would automatically elect a new Elven Queen. The Elf Tribe\u2019s Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution continued as the process would not be completed overnight. The Elf Tribe\u2019s elders had no idea how long it would take for the process to be completed. The only thing that they could do was wait, and they waited in excitement and joy.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhou Weiqing stood guard on the other side of the Elven Queen in silence. Time continued passing by. Although Zhou Weiqing had been releasing his Saint Energy with the help of the Nebula Divine Territory, it was getting more and more difficult for him. Fortunately, there were changes in the Elven Queen after he inserted a certain amount of Saint Energy. There was a mysterious wave of energy that her body quietly emitted. She was absorbing the external Life Energy without being affected by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Nebula Divine Territory. Ever since then, her desire for Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy had lowered considerably, and it allowed Zhou Weiqing to continue holding on.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s intention was purely to rescue the Elven Queen. Later, he thought he might as well cultivate. Ever since he had broken through to the Heavenly King Tier, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base had improved by leaps and bounds like it was sitting in a rocket. Within a couple of months, he had arrived at the Upper Level of Heavenly Emperor Tier. Although he had completed another round of evolution on his body, and the upgrade was not disadvantageous to his body, he would only be able to utilize the power when he had completely integrated the powerful abilities. Zhou Weiqing still had many things that he had to do so he took the advantage to cultivate.</p><br/><p>The continuous release and absorption of Saint Energy allowed Zhou Weiqing to feel the changes in Saint Energy and the help that the Nebula Divine Territory provided to him. It gave him great benefits in terms upgrading his cultivation base and gave him a greater understanding of nature as well.</p><br/><p>It was under such circumstances that Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen managed to form a kind of circulation cycle between the both of them. He had begun cultivating and did not notice that the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core that was on his chest was now connected to the Life Core that was on the Elven Queen\u2019s chest. As time went by and the cycle became more frequent, the emerald-like energy glow that was connected to each other had materialized without them knowing.</p><br/><p>The Life Energy that the Elven Queen had been releasing was cleansing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, and it removed the remaining impurities in his body. It could be said that the purity of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was inching closer toward that of the Elven Queen. With that, it could be considered that what he had sacrificed was given back to him.</p><br/><p>As a faint glow sparkled, Zhou Weiqing revealed a joyous smile on his face. He had no idea how long had passed but he could clearly sense the Elven Queen\u2019s heartbeat was getting stronger. He could even feel that the Elven Queen was regaining her consciousness. Zhou Weiqing had no idea how he could feel it so clearly. He felt that his heartbeat was in-sync with the rhythm of the Elven Queen\u2019s heartbeat.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes slowly, the Saint Energy stopped releasing on its own accord. At the same time, the Elven Queen opened her eyes slowly in confusion. The both of them woke up at the same time, and they looked into each other\u2019s eyes. The Elven Queen was stunned when she looked at Zhou Weiqing and felt the tremendous change in her body. Zhou Weiqing could also feel the intense emotional change that she was experiencing.</p><br/><p>There were feelings of confusion and shyness but the feelings of joy and excitement were more prominent in her emotions. He even sensed Life Core Evolution in the Elven Queen\u2019s consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s happening? How do I know what she\u2019s thinking about?\u2019 Zhou Weiqing looked at the Elven Queen in shock. A hint of happiness slowly appeared in the Elven Queen\u2019s eyes as she looked at him.</p><br/><p>She was stunned like Zhou Weiqing. However, the way the Elven Queen looked at him was odd because she could also hear Zhou Weiqing\u2019s thoughts. The only thought that Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen had at the moment was, \u2018This is impossible.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, the truth was right before their eyes. It only took Zhou Weiqing a short while to snap out of his shock. He thought that this should not have happened, and he wanted to kiss the Elven Queen just to experiment.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Elven Queen blushed as she looked up at Zhou Weiqing. She did not have any intention to reject him so she slowly stood up and walked towards him. Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel the shyness and her desire and passion towards him.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s not rejecting me, why?\u2019 He thought to himself.</p><br/><p>In the next second, the Elven Queen appeared before him. She lifted her head and extended her fair hands. She then wrapped her arms around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck. With her cold, moist and delicate lips that were filled with Life Energy, she kissed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Bam \u2014</p><br/><p>The same sense of shock appeared in their heads at the same time. At that moment, they felt an intense jolt in their hearts and a feeling like they were both merged into a single entity. It made them feel like they had the ability to control each other.</p><br/><p>The kiss was long. From the outside, one could see clearly that a rich golden glow had enveloped the both of them. A materialized glow came out of the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core and the Life Core on their chests, and it connected the both of them together. Without knowing how long had passed, Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen opened their eyes at the same time in confusion. They looked into each others\u2019 eyes as they let go of their lips. They had a hint of surprise, joy and mostly disbelief in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d They said at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go first.\u201d They said at the same time again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d They were still talking at the same time. They were stunned that they said the same thing at the same time three times consecutively. They were speechless as they hugged each other. Both Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen could not imagine that such a thing was happening to them as they looked at each other. Zhou Weiqing swore that even though he was always promiscuous and sleazy, he had never had any dirty thoughts towards the Elven Queen that was currently in his arms!</p><br/><p>Ever since he had sex with Dongfang Hanyue on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland, he had decided to behave himself so that he would not disappoint his wives. Most importantly, he was afraid that he would lose them due to his womanizing behavior. However, what was happening now was beyond his understanding.</p><br/><p>A while later, the Elven Queen snapped out of it. Just like how there were no dirty thoughts in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head, there were none in hers as well. She had no idea what a relationship between a man and woman was because her heart was pure without any impurities. She only felt shyness as she looked at Zhou Weiqing who was standing before her.</p><br/><p>She mumbled as she thought to herself shyly, \u201cCould, could this be a spiritual connection, Life Sharing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could not help but ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s a spiritual connection, Life Sharing?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He made a prompt decision as he slammed his palm violently against the little princess\u2019 back. It sent her flying towards the Elven Queen. He, on the other hand, turned on his heels and fled.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to escape? Go to hell.\u201d Zhou Weiqing declared icily. A wave of white-gold light came flashing down from the sky. However, before the man in black could even scream, his entire body vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. He disappeared. He was turned into ashes and vanished into the sky.</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing dealt with the man in black, his body descended instantly, falling to the ground. At the same time, blood came spurting out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>However, no one noticed as he made his descent, his eyes were filled with delight and a hint of craftiness.</p><br/><p>The man in black slapped the Elven Princess hard across the air. The Elven Queen hurriedly rushed towards her daughter. To a mother, as long as there was a chance for her child\u2019s survival, she would save her without any hesitation!</p><br/><p>Just then, a miracle happened. When the Elven Princess was sent flying, she flew at a pretty fast speed. However, that only happened for a moment. The speed immediately went back to normal as she stopped flying and descended slowly.</p><br/><p>What was the Elven Queen\u2019s cultivation base? Naturally, she quickly gathered her energy to catch the little princess and scoop her into her arms.</p><br/><p>Once the little princess entered her arms, the Elven Queen felt as if something was not right. Her body still contained a strong attractive force. She showed her own mother no courtesy either as she absorbed the Elven Queen\u2019s Natural Attribute Energy rapidly. The most mystifying part was as she absorbed the energy, she grew larger and large. Even though she was growing very slowly, the young lady, who had been around five to six years of age, had suddenly grown to the size of a seven to eight-year-old child.</p><br/><p>What was the meaning of this? The Elven Queen could not understand what had happened to her daughter. However, she could sense her daughter\u2019s life force very clearly, and it was even more vigorous than before. As a cultivator on the Heavenly God Tier, how could she not see that her daughter was safe and sound? Furthermore, the reason why her daughter was able to survive was undoubtedly due to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s slap.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah! Zhou Weiqing, is he alright?\u2019</p><br/><p>Only at this moment, the Elven Queen remembered a certain sad person. When she turned around to look at the sky, that person\u2019s shadow was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>A wave of emotion that the Elven Queen had never felt before appeared in her heart. She felt a powerful sense of remorse erupting from her being. \u2018Why did I not trust him! It was him. It must have been him. He saved my daughter and yet I\u2019ve injured him heavily.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen immediately released her Natural Divine Territory without any hesitation because she could sense everything within her Natural Divine Territory. At the same time, releasing her Natural Divine Territory would also allow her to quickly absorb the Atmospheric Energy so that she could replenish the energy that was absorbed by her child.</p><br/><p>At this moment, silver starlight from the Elven Princess\u2019 body began to slowly enter her body. She stopped absorbing the Elven Queen\u2019s Heavenly Energy and fell into a deep slumber. The Elven Queen glanced at her daughter. Even though she aged a few years, she was even more beautiful. Now, the Elven Queen had all sorts of mixed feelings in her heart.</p><br/><p>With a flash, she arrived on the ground and appeared in front of the man.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current state could not be simply described as \u2018a sorry figure\u2019. His legendary armor set had vanished completely. His clothes were torn and tattered due to being scraped by tree branches and stones during his descent. His entire body was flung onto the ground, and he lay on the ground spread eagle with his body slightly twisted.</p><br/><p>If anyone else saw this, they would have considered this a comical sight. But in the Elven Queen\u2019s eyes, this made her feel even greater remorse. Not only had she injured him heavily, he had used his final ounce of strength to help her kill the enemy. She could not even break his fall, causing him to fall down on the ground. \u2018Zhou Weiqing, you cannot die! Otherwise, I won\u2019t stop blaming myself for the rest of my life.\u2019</p><br/><p>As she was mulling over her thoughts, a flash of light appeared in the Elven Queen\u2019s hand, and a large leaf appeared out of thin air. She placed her daughter on the leaf. Soon after, the leaf began to roll up and wrap the Elven Princess within it. With a flash of green light, it disappeared into thin air.</p><br/><p>After the Elven Queen hid her daughter away safely, she carefully pulled Zhou Weiqing out of the man-shaped hole in the ground.</p><br/><p>No one would dare flatter Zhou Weiqing in his current predicament. Most of the skin on his body was exposed, and his aura was severely weakened. It was difficult to even sense any fluctuations from his body.</p><br/><p>Given these conditions, the Elven Queen had long forgotten about the differences between men and women. She extended her hands towards Zhou Weiqing, tracing it along his body to check on him. She noticed a lot of damages all over his veins but his flesh and bones were not heavily injured. The heaviest injury was at his shoulders.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen carefully flipped Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body over as her face trembled slightly.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face was as white as a sheet of paper, his breath was coming out in wisps, and the Saint Energy in his body was a mess. His right shoulder was completely swollen. It had swelled to at least one time its original size. One could even see the damaged blood vessels very clearly beneath his skin. His right shoulder was dark purple in color, and his bones could not be seen at all.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen\u2019s voice trembled as she muttered, \u201cI\u2026 I really didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s all my fault. I should\u2019ve trusted you. I\u2026\u201d Her heart was certainly in a mess.</p><br/><p>She carefully tore off Zhou Weiqing\u2019s clothes. After that, she pressed her hands on his shoulders as she tried using energy from the water element to heal him. Waves of life force poured out from the Elven Queen\u2019s hand like a stream into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Elven Queen no longer looked like the powerful leader of a tribe. Instead, she looked more like the girl next door.</p><br/><p>Since she was young, she had always held a well-loved and respected position in the eyes of her people. She had never had contact with any males from the Elf Tribe, let alone coming in contact with a man!</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strong muscles and his thick, musky male scent assaulted the Heavenly God Elven Queen\u2019s heart. A single thought appeared in her heart, \u2018So, this is how a man looks like.\u2019</p><br/><p>At first, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body seemed to reject the water element that the Elven Queen had poured into his body. Even though there was not a lot of Saint Energy left in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, it was still Saint Energy. Once the water element entered Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, his Saint Energy began swallowing it up immediately. Hs life force reacted in the same way. Her attempts at healing him were useless.</p><br/><p>\u2018What should I do?\u2019 The Elven Queen did not dare to move Zhou Weiqing. If he was an ordinary person, he would have shown signs of improvement under the powerful healing from her cultivation base. However, Zhou Weiqing possessed Saint Energy, and this was a mysterious energy that not even the Elven Queen, a formidable cultivator, could understand. She did not know what else to do. She could only stay by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side as she carefully and continuously released Natural Energy into his body. Nobody knew if this would help strengthen his Saint Energy. That would be a pretty good outcome as well.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen knew very clearly that it was difficult to injure a Heavenly Jewel Master when he had cultivated to a certain level because his body\u2019s resistance would become stronger and could not be easily harmed. However, the more powerful it is, the more difficult it would be to heal the body once it was afflicted with an injury. Even a small wound would cause a huge problem because a powerful Heavenly Jewel Master\u2019s Heavenly Energy was just as powerful. Once the body is damaged, it would cause problems in the Heavenly Energy\u2019s limitations. It would result in a counter charge between the Heavenly Energy and its user.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen\u2019s fair forehead began to break out in beads of sweat. She never thought that the day would come when she would owe a human such a huge debt.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s condition seemed worse than she had imagined. His aura was growing weaker and weaker, and the circulation of Saint Energy in his body was slowing down. It seemed like he would stop breathing at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018What should I do, what should I do!\u2019</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen was currently in a state of panic. If Zhou Weiqing died here\u2026 Forget about the repercussions, her own heart would not be able to accept this. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s injury was caused by her slap. This was unacceptable to the kind-hearted Elven Queen. If Zhou Weiqing died, this would forever be a nightmare to her.</p><br/><p>Actually, this was the measure of her lack of understanding towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy. Even though Zhou Weiqing\u2019s aura was growing weaker, his body was still protecting itself. The reason why the Saint Energy\u2019s circulation had slowed down was merely due to the healing process. Zhou Weiqing, whose body contained Saint Energy, would not die as long as he could still breathe. He could recuperate through self-restoration. The time frame might be lengthy based on the severity of the wound.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s injuries were indeed heavy since he gathered all his power to kill the man in black. Moreover, he suffered a heavy attack from the Elven Queen. Due to that, very little Saint Energy was left in his body, and it stalled the healing process for his injuries by a large degree. Otherwise, a short period of time would have been enough to lighten his injuries.</p><br/><p>Saint Energy was an energy of creation, and it placed the safety of its host at the utmost importance. It would never counter charge against its host. Hence, Zhou Weiqing was very safe. He would need at most two to three days\u2019 to recuperate.</p><br/><p>However, even though Zhou Weiqing could wait, the Elven Queen could not! Her heart throbbed in agony as if it was thrown into a pan and broiled.</p><br/><p>She lifted her head to the skies. It was slowly getting darker, and everything was quiet. It was as if the battle did not take place.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen looked at Zhou Weiqing as a complicated look slowly filled her gaze. She clutched her chest with her right hand many times before she relaxed it again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe saved my daughter. If it was not for him, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything under that man\u2019s threats. However, I\u2019ve hurt him, and his life is in danger. How can I think of my own matters so selfishly?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen grumbled under her breath, and her gaze suddenly filled with resolve. She took a deep breath and slowly pulled off her lapel.</p><br/><p>More specifically, the top half of her clothes disappeared on its own. The Elf Tribe were the sons and daughters of Nature. Even at the Elven Queen\u2019s level, her clothes were completely constructed with the power of Natural Energy.</p><br/><p>As her snowy-white flesh was slowly unveiled, one could see that there was not a single flaw on her skin. It was absolutely delicate and tender. At this moment, she looked so pure and holy. A layer of faint, green light formed automatically around her body. This did not come from her. It was formed from the Natural Attribute elements in the air that sensed her aura.</p><br/><p>As she glanced at Zhou Weiqing, the Elven Queen forced herself to contain her shivers and nervousness. She gritted her teeth and raised her arms. Subsequently, her long skirt vanished as well.</p><br/><p>A pair of perfectly straight, slender and smooth long legs, like God\u2019s most beautifully crafted work of art, were displayed for all to see. Those long legs, perfectly round buttocks and wonderfully slender waist that could be held by a single hand, would drive any man insane.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen nibbled her lips with her ivory teeth before she took a deep breath. Her entire body gently rose into the air, and the green light around her slowly grew more vibrant. The brilliance from the green light made the Elven Queen\u2019s delicate body fairly discernible. She looked even more attractive.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen hovered directly above Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body as the green light around her body flickered. The vibrant green light whirled around the sky like a halo, swirling downwards and wrapping Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body within its brilliance.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the life energy surrounding Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body had grown to a terrifyingly tremendous level. It was so terrifying that even if Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was to amplify its absorption to the very maximum, it would never be able to absorb all of it.</p><br/><p>Soon after, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body slowly levitated above the ground. His already torn and tattered robes had turned into dust.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen looked at him. The resolve in her eyes slowly turned into gentleness. All complicated emotions seemed to have melted away, replaced by an indescribable sense of purity.</p><br/><p>Suspended in mid-air, she bent her legs upwards and pulled them towards her chest. This made her perky buttocks look even rounder. At the same time, she wrapped her arms around her thighs, lowered her head and pressed herself firmly against her thighs. Her entire body was curled into a ball.</p><br/><p>From behind, the Elven Queen\u2019s long green locks covered her delicate frame completely, especially the provocative parts from her waist down.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen released a dark green light from her body. At this very moment, she no longer looked like an elf but a bright and lustrous gemstone. A dense life force turned everything around her into the purest of substances, and a circle of green light slowly dispersed. It enveloped everything within a 100-meter radius of her in its bright radiance. The Elven Queen and Zhou Weiqing were at the core of this light.</p><br/><p>The large life energy turned everything around the light into a dark green color. Then a bizarre sight occurred. The Elven Queen, still curled into a ball that was completely green in color, suddenly began to shrink in mid-air. She started becoming smaller and smaller.</p><br/><p>In only ten breaths, she had turned into a dark green gemstone that was no bigger than a fist.</p><br/><p>A light flashed. The dark green gemstone dropped itself onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest as it slowly entered him.</p><br/><p>After that, Zhou Weiqing, who was rich in Saint Energy, turned into a resplendent dark green shade. The faint Saint Energy in his body seemed to have received a powerful jolt of stimulation. It began amplifying in madness. Then, the Saint energy stopped the absorption and suppression of the life force. Using the unwavering power of Life Energy, Saint Energy was temporarily pushed aside.</p><br/><p>Within the life energy also contained the dense fragrance of creation. However, instead of the creation of everything, it was the pure creation of life itself.</p><br/><p>During the continuous rise of the tremendous life energy, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body began to display sudden changes. First was the wound on his shoulders. The frightening swelling quickly subsided, and the veins in his body quickly reconnected at the peak of the powerful life energy. It became even more durable than before.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body already contained Nebula Saint Energy, and he already had the exceedingly powerful life energy. During the special usage of life energy, his already powerful life energy seemed to have increased by a few times.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing would be shocked if he was awake. He would never have thought that it was still possible for his body to evolve even further.</p><br/><p>Waves of Tiger tattoos and Dragon scale markings slowly began to appear beneath his skin. Due to that frightening usage of life energy, everything began to fuse together.</p><br/><p>Previously, when Zhou Weiqing went through a Dragon-Tiger Transformation, Dragon-shaped scales would appear on his body. His arms and right leg would go through the Demonic Change with his Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodlines.</p><br/><p>However, this time it was different. The Dragon scales still appeared. However, it seemed like the Dragon Emperor Bloodlines and Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodlines were properly merging under the power of the life energy. The Dragon scales slowly turned black in color. And on where it was black, a grey Tiger tattoo slowly appeared. Apart from that, a bizarre image seemed to appear out of thin air on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>It was a kind of divine beast. A fusion between a Dragon and Tiger. It had the head of a Dragon, the body of a Tiger, a Dragon\u2019s wings, a Dragon\u2019s claws and a scorpion\u2019s tail. It was as if a dragon and the Dark Demon God Tiger had merged together. Its color was the same as the color of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s skin. Its black body was covered with a Tiger tattoo, and it was filled with an icy, sinister energy.</p><br/><p>Whether it was the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodlines or the Dragon Emperor Bloodlines, these were the most powerful bloodlines around. Zhou Weiqing had allowed them to fuse before. But the two bloodlines had their own definite repellent natures. After that, following Zhou Weiqing\u2019s continuous rise in power, and the continued increase in Saint Energy\u2019s power, the repellent natures were not too apparent. Under the suppression of Saint Energy, the energy of the bloodlines would not snap at Zhou Weiqing or affect him in any way.</p><br/><p>However, the fusion was not complete. It could not completely display the true might of the Dragon and Tiger. Even more so after Zhou Weiqing had begun to slowly comprehend the Demon God\u2019s energy and was able to summon the Demon God\u2019s projection. His Dragon and Tiger could be considered to have a lesser value compared to the amplification for his body.</p><br/><p>Now, thanks to the peculiar Life Saint Energy filled with the creation of life that was provided by the Elven Queen, it provided the best catalyst for the fusion. Due to this, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dragon-Tiger bloodline was finally able to fuse perfectly together with his Demon Energy. It resulted in the current state of Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

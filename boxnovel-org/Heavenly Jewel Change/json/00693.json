Even if he was afraid of the two Heavenly God Tier powerhouses in the cottage, Zhou Weiqing had to summon the courage to enter anyway. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze met Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s as he squeezed her tiny hand and pulled her along. The wooden door was light and opened from a light touch.The room was illuminated brightly. Sunlight and the aroma of flowers entered the room through windows from all four directions.</p><br/><p>The first thing Zhou Weiqing noticed when entering the cottage was a table.The table was long, around 10 meters in length and stretched from one end of the room to the other. He could tell right away that the table was made from an entire slab of yellow rosewood. The yellow rosewood was also known as the Dalbergia. The wood had a unique fragrance that was beneficial towards the Consolidating Ink. It also increased the success rate of creating Consolidated Equipment Scrolls by 10%. The yellow rosewood was considered a precious material by Consolidated Equipment Masters.</p><br/><p>There were two individuals seated at the table, and their gazes were both on Zhou Weiqing. The one who was sitting on the left looked like he was in his eighties. He had silver hair and the wrinkles on his face could kill flies. His eyes were as clear as a baby\u2019s. So clear, it seemed like he could see through a person\u2019s soul. Zhou Weiqing felt an immense pressure just by meeting his gaze. Fortunately, he had recently raised his Spiritual Energy, so he could still maintain his composure.</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s appearance did not surprise Zhou Weiqing. Consolidated Equipment Masters worked hard their entire lives to get to where they were. It was normal to see Consolidated Equipment Masters who were advanced in age. Of course, there were some who managed to find treasures that helped them maintain a youthful look.</p><br/><p>However, the person who was sitting next to the old man surprised Zhou Weiqing. She was a woman who looked around 26 or 27 years old. Most importantly, Zhou Weiqing could sense that the woman was genuinely young. After all, a person\u2019s vitality could not be faked. It was obvious her youthful appearance did not come from any treasure.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing could not sense their cultivation levels at all. It proved that their cultivation levels were really high. The woman surprised him the most. He was sure that she was no more than 30 years old, but her cultivation was at least that of a Heavenly King Tier powerhouse. How did she manage to cultivate to the Heavenly King Stage at such a young age? No matter how many strange situations he had encountered, he had never met anyone who had managed to cultivate to the Heavenly King Stage before the age of 30.</p><br/><p>Leaving her cultivation aside, she possessed a unique charm. Zhou Weiqing had seen many beautiful women in his life. In fact, all of his lady friends were beautiful. However, the woman before him gave him a very different feeling. If he had to say who she resembled, he would say that the beautiful woman before him was a combination of Shangguan Xue\u2019er and Princess Cai Cai. She had Princess Cai Cai\u2019s honor and majestic presence combined together with Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s remarkable beauty. Shangguan Bing\u2019er was beautiful, but she seemed to lack the unique charm that this woman possessed.</p><br/><p>The woman had a frown on her face as she coughed lightly. It seemed like she did not like being stared at, and that was a cue for Zhou Weiqing to stop staring.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing let out an embarrassed smile. \u201cPardon my manners. My lady, you\u2019re just too beautiful.\u201d He did not hide his admiration towards her at all as he nodded. Shangguan Bing\u2019er, who was standing at his side, glared at him. She thought to herself that following him here was definitely the right decision. If she had not done so, Zhou Weiqing might bring a couple of ladies back with him from his trip to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>The woman replied in a dull manner. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not here just to compliment me. I agree with one thing that you\u2019ve said. Only a God Tier Master has the right to test another God Tier Master. With that being said, please demonstrate your skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled. \u201cAren\u2019t the both of you going to introduce yourselves? Isn\u2019t that a little rude?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man next to the woman smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the in Consolidated Domain for nearly 100 years, but I\u2019ve never heard of the Strength Legacy before. If you\u2019re capable, you will eventually know who we are. If you fail the test, then knowing who we are would be redundant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled. \u201cI remember telling Elder Fei Lun that age doesn\u2019t matter if you have a purpose in life. Even if you live to a hundred, your life would be empty if you don\u2019t have any ambition. Just because you\u2019ve not heard of it before, it doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s eyes widened a little, but his voice remained calm. \u201cYoung man, are you challenging me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed out loud and glared at him. \u201cSo what if I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since anyone dared to speak to me like that. If you are able to make a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll, whatever you\u2019ve just said will hold weight. Otherwise, you\u2019ll face the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had been observing the two individuals sitting in front of him. He had been using this method of aggravation to see if their temperaments would change.. There was no doubt that the both of them were the God Tier Masters of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. If he managed to get into the palace, these two would play an important role in his mission to obtain the Spatial Teleportation Stone. He noticed that the old man would occasionally look at the woman as he spoke. Zhou Weiqing was an astute person. He could tell that the woman was the leader among the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d That was all the woman said as she pointed to the Spatial Ring on the yellow rosewood table. Shangguan Bing\u2019er shut the door obediently. Although her cultivation was not as high was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, she had Saint Energy in her and had recently raised her Spirit Energy, so she was not too bothered by the faint power the duo in front of her emitted.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing picked up the Spatial Ring on the table and he sensed all of the items in there. His eyes lit up. The values of items in the ring could not be even be considered in terms of gold coins! He closed his eyes and fell into a trance as he stood there. There was a saying, an expert would prove himself just by raising one hand. The old man and woman revealed a look of surprise as soon as Zhou Weiqing closed his eyes. They could clearly sense that Zhou Weiqing had entered the Unity of Heaven and Man. At the moment, he was attuned to his surroundings.</p><br/><p>It sounded simple, but it was something that was difficult to achieve. In order to be a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse and a God Tier Master, one had to be able to enter the Unity of Heaven and Man. After all, there could not be any distractions in the process of creating a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll. Without the Unity of Heaven and Man, it was impossible to make a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll. That was one of the reasons why a God Tier Master had to at least be at the Heavenly King Stage.</p><br/><p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing walked in, the two powerhouses could clearly sense that he only had Fifth Jewel cultivation. That was the reason why they found it hard to believe that Zhou Weiqing was a God Tier Master. However, as soon as he entered the Unity of Heaven and Man mode, the expressions of the two God Tier Masters finally changed. A person who could enter the Unity of Heaven and Man with only Fifth Jewel was more than a genius. He could be considered a prodigy of his generation!</p><br/><p>A foot-wide crystal vat appeared before Zhou Weiqing. His shut eyes opened gradually. There were no impurities in his eyes, only boundless determination. At that moment, the other three people in the house had different opinions on Consolidated Equipment Masters. Shangguan Bing\u2019er was watching quietly from the side. Her reaction remained unchanged even after Zhou Weiqing had opened his eyes. Meanwhile, the two God Tier Masters were constricting their aura. They were trying to make themselves as inconsequential as specks of dust in the room. It was to minimize elements that could possibly affect Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>That was the tacit understanding among Consolidated Equipment Masters. However, only God Tier Masters would be able to constrict their aura to such a degree. What surprised them was that Shangguan Bing\u2019er constricted her aura as well when she felt them constricting their aura. Just like Zhou Weiqing, she could enter the Unity of Heaven and Man with ease.</p><br/><p>In reality, the Saint Energy was the reason why both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er managed to enter the Unity of Heaven and Man, even though it should only be possible for Heavenly King Stage powerhouses to enter it. As the most powerful attribute on heaven and earth, the Saint Energy in their bodies allowed them to attune themselves to all environments because their bodies had dominance over all environments and attributes.</p><br/><p>Although the two God Tier Masters were surprised, their faces remained inscrutable as they fixed their attention on Zhou Weiqing. Suddenly, Zhou Weiqing started moving. As he flipped his right hand over, three ingredients tumbled out of the Spatial Ring that he had picked up. The three ingredients were all plants. A red fruit, a thin black vine, and a strand of green plant.</p><br/><p>As soon as the three items appeared, Zhou Weiqing waved his left hand in the air. A silver glow flashed and transformed into a silver plate. It seemed like it was meant for the three items. However, as soon as the items landed on the plate, they melted immediately like snow. A layer of powder combined with juice was all that remained on the silver plate. The snow-like powder was so fine that it almost could not be seen with naked eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

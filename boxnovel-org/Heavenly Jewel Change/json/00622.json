This little son in law will not let you down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue gave another humph before saying: \u201cXue\u2019er, bring him around before chasing him off. I will not allow him to see Fei\u2019er or Bing\u2019er. When he gets the Heavenly Jewel Tournament Championship, then we can speak of it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that last line, Shangguan Tianyue stepped forward, as if walking into an illusory realm, disappearing from sight.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing bounced up to his feet, laughing heartily. Seizing the opportunity that Shangguan Xue\u2019er was still slightly stunned, he embraced her in his arms, twirling around in the air in a circle before letting her down.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er gave a startled cry. \u201cWhat are you doing? Father didn\u2019t even agree to anything yet, why are you so happy? Do you really think that this year\u2019s Heavenly Jewel Tournament is going to be easy? To gain that Championship? Furthermore, that Saint Core Nucleus is so far off in the future, who knows if it is even possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned, releasing the struggling Shangguan Xue\u2019er as he said: \u201cHeh heh, who said that Father in law did not agree to anything? What I told him was that only when a man and a woman goes through intimate relations can we transfer the Saint Energy. Heh heh, you know, Paired Cultivation. Since Father in Law is willing to allow me to help you three consolidate the Saint Core Nucleus, doesn\u2019t that mean he is already silently agreeing to us? Heh heh heh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only the did Shangguan Xue\u2019er understand. Instantly, her face turned beet red. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 you shameless\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing held on to her hands. \u201cIf I am not shameless enough, how can I gain all of you as my wives? Come, quick, give your husband a nice good kiss.\u201d As he said that, his face moved forward.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er quickly lifted a hand to press against his mouth. \u201cBehave yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not insist, just giving her soft smooth hand a quick kiss before letting her go. No one could blame him for being so excited, after all with the tacit approval of Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue, the greatest difficulty he had to face was already over. It could be said that since Shangguan Tianyue personally brought up those two \u2018conditions\u2019, the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace had pretty much officially confirmed him as the son in law\u2026 more so, the common one between all three Shangguan Sisters.</p><br/><p>In the entire Boundless Mainland, perhaps there was nothing more difficult to accomplish than this. For Zhou Weiqing to gain such approval, it was not just as simple as the existence of the Saint Energy, it was also the potential he had shown, all of his previous actions and accomplishments to gain their approval, and his wisdom and intelligence in persuasion\u2026 all of it added together in a package which sealed the deal.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er, since Father in Law has forbidden me to see Fei\u2019er and Bing\u2019er, I will head back to prepare first. Do not worry, this time in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, I will definitely seize the final championship once more.\u201d In that moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart was filled with fighting spirit, firm in his resolve to earn that right. No matter how strong his opponents were, he would charge ahead without any qualms.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he wanted to leave, Shangguan Xue\u2019er grabbed onto his hand instead. \u201cWhat is the rush? I have something to talk to you about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at the blushing beauty in front of him, and he couldn\u2019t help but want to move towards her once more. However, he was quickly stopped by Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s hand at his chest, now allowing him to move closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play around, I am serious. This year\u2019s Heavenly Jewel Tournament is not as easy as you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing those words, Zhou Weiqing immediately calmed down. He knew that Shangguan Xue\u2019er was about to reveal the situation behind this year\u2019s Heavenly Jewel Tournament.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis year\u2019s Heavenly Jewel Tournament can be said to very different from all the past years. There are two main reasons.\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er allowed Zhou Weiqing to hold her hands while she spoke seriously. \u201cThe first reason is actually because of the Fei Li Battle Team that you led the previous Heavenly Jewel Tournament, seizing the Championship from the hands of all the Great Saint Lands. It could be said to have caused all four Great Saint Lands to lose a lot of face\u2026 especially so for the Dan Dun Battle Team, who did not even make it to the top four. As such, this time, all four Great Saint Lands are definitely putting out their top teams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second reason is the Lustre Spatial Realm. There seems to be a strange change in the Lustre Spatial Realm, and the entire zone is filled with a violent, frantic unknown energy reverberation, causing it to be very unstable. Several times, there were signs that the entire Spatial Realm had splits and cracks in it, but it was suppressed by the many powerhouses of our Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2026 even so they were barely able to maintain the stability. As such, this year\u2019s top four battle teams will be given the responsibility to investigate the changes in the Lustre Spatial Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lustre Spatial Realm can be said to be the most important place in our entire Heavenly Jewel Island. Not only is there the majestic Dragons that you have seen previously, there are many other precious and rare Heavenly Beasts. Previously, the Lustre Spatial Realm that you experienced was actually only a portion of the entire realm. After all, our Heaven\u2019s Expanse palace needs to maintain the secrecy of the entire Lustre Spatial Realm, and we never open the entire thing to outsiders. However, this time will be different. In order to solve the sudden energy unrest that has appeared, we will actually be opening the entire Lustre Spatial Realm. Some of the rarer medicines, treasures, ores and even Heavenly Beasts will now be in front of everyone. Furthermore, in order to have the other Great Saint Lands place more importance in it, this time all that is gained from the Lustre Spatial Realm can be kept by the Battle Team. Our Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace will not restrict it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith those two reasons in mind, I\u2019m sure you can imagine what kind of battle team the Great Saint Lands will form, and the strength they will hold. Furthermore, this is not just restricted to our four Great Saint Lands\u2026 the news has been spread to all the Empires in the world. As such, this year\u2019s Heavenly Jewel Tournament can be said to be of unprecedented quality and power. To gain the championship in this current tournament, the difficulty level far outstrips any of the previous years. You must have the preparation in your heart regarding this. It will not be easy, even for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing finally understood the gravity of the situation, and he said: \u201cNo wonder even you three sisters will join the competition\u2026 so that is the true reason. The Lustre Spatial Realm has restricted entry to only those below thirty years of age\u2026 so even with your Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace will not have sufficient manpower to check it out fully. Did you all send anyone inside to investigate yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er gave a bitter smile and said: \u201cOf course we have. In that Spatial Realm, there are lots of strong and violent fire elemental attributes, causing the entire spatial realm to feel as if it was burning. Anyone below the six-Jeweled stage cannot even stay for long in there, let alone spending enough time to investigate the reasons. Father and Uncle do not allow us to enter on our own, as it is too risky. After all, even for our Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, there aren\u2019t that many people who are below thirty years old and above the six-Jeweled stage\u2026 and they are all the top elites. It is definitely safer to gather the strength of all four Great Saint Lands, and also with greater hopes of success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: \u201cI understand. This time, the other three Great Saint Lands\u2026 is there anyone special for me to look out for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er said: \u201cYes. Especially for you, you need to be careful of the Blood Red Hell. That Shen Little Demon which you severely injured last time is back again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that in this past three years, her cultivation level has already raised to the seven-Jeweled stage. However, in such a circumstance, in the Battle Team, she could not even make the position of Vice Leader. One can imagine how strong the Dan Dun Battle Team will be this year. However, even for us, we have not been able to gain news about the exact news about all their team members.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the Passion Valley, their strength is also not to be underestimated. The leaders this time are the heirs to the Passion Vallley, a couple who have been cultivating in \u2018Paired Cultivation\u2019 ever since the age of eighteen. Both of their cultivation levels are at least seven Jeweled or higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly\u2026 the Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2026 we are even less clear about their Battle Team. However, I am certain that they will not be weak at all. As such, no matter which Battle Team from a Great Saint Lands that you meet\u2026 it will not be an easy matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing grinned, saying: \u201cHeh, no problems. Let the storms blow even more violently, without pressure, how will I have the motivation? Furthermore, for the sake of my three beautiful wives, I will not sit back and lose!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er glared at him exasperatedly, saying: \u201cAt such a time, you can still be so cheeky. If you are to be eliminated, I\u2019ll see what you do then. Although Father has grudgingly accepted you, he will not change his words. If you really want to\u2026.. You better not lose this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing exerted force in a pull, holding Shangguan Xue\u2019er in his embrace once more. \u201cHow about giving me a small reward first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it, you better go now. Don\u2019t let Tian\u2019er wait so long that she is worried.\u201d Blushing, Shangguan Xue\u2019er slipped free of his embrace, tapping him lightly on the head. Next, she actually gave him a quick hug around the neck and kissed his lips.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had never imagined that Shangguan Xue\u2019er would take such intimate initiative towards him, and in that instant, he was stunned. At that moment, he suddenly saw a cunning look flash in \u2018Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s\u2019 eyes.</p><br/><p>Her lips parted, and \u2018Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019 flew back, giggling. \u201cBing\u2019er asked me to tell you that she is very very angry about your playboy actions. Since she is so angry\u2026 the repercussions will be very serious. Good luck to you! You have to think about how to solve it yourself. Heh heh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Fei\u2019er?\u201d At last, Zhou Weiqing figured out who she really was.</p><br/><p>The Shangguan Sisters just looked too alike. If one just used their eyes to see, even for someone as familiar with them like Zhou Weiqing and her father, they were still unable to differentiate them. Only with their different aura and temperament could they barely differentiate them.</p><br/><p>It was clear that Shangguan Fei\u2019er had been imitating Shangguan Xue\u2019er all that time. It was not just Zhou Weiqing, even Shangguan Tianyue had been fooled. Seeing Shangguan Fei\u2019er again after being apart for some time, one could imagine how agitated Zhou Weiqing was. In a flash, he chased after Shangguan Fei\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this place, you can\u2019t catch up with me. Hurry up and go back to prepare for the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. In the Tournament, I won\u2019t go easy!\u201d With a small laugh, Shangguan Fei\u2019er disappeared in white mist.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stood there, staring blankly at the empty air for a few moments, silent. Seeing Shangguan Fei\u2019er again, it could be said his heart was filled with many mixed feelings. In that moment, it was as if something was stuck in his throat. Although he was a bit of a playboy, his feelings for the three Shangguan Sisters were true and deep. Xue\u2019er, Fei\u2019er, Bing\u2019er, those three names kept spinning around in his mind.</p><br/><p>After standing around for almost fifteen minutes, Zhou Weiqing finally roused up. Unknowingly, his fists were now gripped rightly. Under his calm expression, it was as if a storm was broiling beneath.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for me.\u201d He muttered those three words, before turning around to leave as well.</p><br/><p>Behind another hidden patch of white mist, three young girls, with exactly the same features, stood silently behind a lit screen. One of them was already sobbing her heart out, being hugged by another of the girls with a cold expression. She was only remaining standing with that support. As for the last girl, she had her tongue stuck out, but the fire in her eyes were no less than Zhou Weiqing who had just left.</p><br/><p>\u201cFei\u2019er, why are you so mischievous. Bing\u2019er asked you to tell him that she did not blame him, and that she misses him so much. What did you say!\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er glared at Shangguan Fei\u2019er.</p>\n</div>"}

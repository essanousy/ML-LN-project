How do I deal with it?\u2019 When Zhou Weiqing saw the black-colored light mass growing bigger without any signs of stopping, a strong sense of crisis surged into his heart. He understood that if this thing crashed onto his body, he would immediately vanish from this world for all eternity no matter how strong his cultivation base was.</p><br/><p>He lifted his right leg and directly kicked that black-colored ball into the air. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right leg could no longer transform into the tailhook-like state anymore following the completion of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation. However, his terrifying energy had surpassed his energy previously.</p><br/><p>The simple movement of stomping his right foot resulted in an intense explosion in the air that was created by the terrifying energy. An orb of extremely condensed Saint Energy brutally slammed towards the black-colored Destruction Energy.</p><br/><p>The shield broke with the sound of a soft pop the moment this Saint Light ball came in contact with the dark green protective shield. After all, this was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s extremely condensed and compressed Saint Energy. The Saint Energy and the Destruction Energy were diametrically opposed, and both energies naturally restricted one another, making Zhou Weiqing\u2019s full force attack was also naturally unprecedented.</p><br/><p>The protective shield naturally broke when the black and white energy balls collided in the air. However, there was no thundering rumble to be heard, only a hissing sound akin to hot oil being poured on a snow mountain.</p><br/><p>The powerhouses\u2019 gazes were shocked as they watched the two energy balls merged into one. The color still remained black even after merging together. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy ball was completely destroyed by the Destruction Energy ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, your Saint Energy\u2019s still not pure enough to compete with my Ultimate Destruction Energy. Go to hell.\u201d Meanwhile, the black-colored light mass had already condensed into a ball with the diameter of about one meter. This was his ultimate energy. The amount of energy continued to lessen with usage, and it required a long time to replenish. That was why the Nether Lord was unwilling to use too much of this energy. If it was not because he had to deal with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy, he absolutely would not use his ultimate source of energy to launch an attack He had only used the ultimate source of energy in the past when he attacked the seal.</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord only initiated attacks on the Netherworld\u2019s Seal after he had accumulated a certain amount of Ultimate Destruction Energy. It was precisely this energy that was capable of splitting the Netherworld\u2019s seal and severely injuring the Dragon Emperor.</p><br/><p>The Destruction Energy Ball was floating in the air slowly when a streak of black-colored light directly shot out of the energy ball. It enshrouded the space around Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er. Every existing energy was completely cut off in a flash. Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er only felt cold throughout their entire bodies, and they were not attacked in this situation. However, Zhou Weiqing discovered that he had lost all contact with all energy attributes and even all the laws of the outside world. In other words, there was no way he could even attempt to escape by using the Spatial Law at this moment.</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord was experienced and vicious, he was not planning to give Zhou Weiqing any opportunity to escape since he had attacked with full force.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, everyone could sense that the surrounding temperature had increased abruptly, and the entire cavern had turned red. At this moment, even Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy and the Nether Lord\u2019s Destruction Energy could not conceal the red color glow in the cavern.</p><br/><p>\u201cNether Lord, the only ending for you is being sealed for eternity. I\u2019ve accompanied you over here for ten thousand years. Since that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll continue accompanying you for the remainder of eternity.\u201d</p><br/><p>An enormous ball of the red mass of light descended from the sky. Its enormous size was terrifying. The most crucial part of the situation was the fire element within the bright red ball that was even denser than lava by thousands of time. It was seared with unparalleled spirit and carried along the dedication of the soul as it descended from the sky. It slammed ferociously towards the Destruction light mass that was flying towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>The size difference between the Destruction Energy ball and this red-colored light mass was completely disproportionate. However, just as the two collide, the ball of Destruction Energy and the red glow from the mass of red light vanished simultaneously. Furthermore, it continued on its trajectory and ferociously crashed down on the Nether Lord\u2019s gigantic front claws.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst ancestor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Dragon Emperor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of people crying out loud in alarm echoed in unison and everyone\u2019s eyes reddened almost instantly.</p><br/><p>Yes, it was the Dragon Emperor who transformed into that enormous red mass of light that descended from the sky. The Dragon Clan\u2019s emperor, who possessed boundless prestige and experienced the many vicissitudes of life, sacrificed the final parts of his life in an attempt to guard the Dragon Clan\u2019s honor and the Boundless Mainland.</p><br/><p>His enormous body forcibly slammed into the Nether Lord\u2019s front claws, and he wrapped his body around that pair of gigantic front claws. Huge mouthfuls of dragon blood continuously gushed out from the Dragon Emperor\u2019s mouth and splashed on the seal on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d The Lord of Destruction\u2019s voice was filled with panic and hysteria. However, his voice rapidly turned weak rapidly, even his Destruction aura was weakened to a great extent at this moment.</p><br/><p>A green light descended from the sky, coming from the Life Energy of the Elven Empress. She was pouring almost all of her lifetime\u2019s worth of Life Energy into the Dragon Emperor\u2019s body at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, there\u2019s no need for that. Hold on to that useful energy of yours to help Zhou Weiqing to reform the seal.\u201d The Dragon Emperor\u2019s eyes were overflowing with mercy and a gentle glow. When he made the decision to act, he had already given up his life.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, when he was fatally wounded, it was the Life Energy that the Elven Empress released that pulled him back from the brink of death. However, how could he be willing to let the Nether Lord kill Zhou Weiqing at this moment? The Nether Lord knew that Zhou Weiqing was his biggest threat, and so did the Dragon Emperor.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor and the Nether Lord had been fighting each other all their lives. He was unwilling to lose this battle between him and the Nether Lord in the final moment.</p><br/><p>That was why he chose to die a hero. He used the final brilliance of his life to seal off the Nether Lord\u2019s escape path. That red-colored radiance was the Saint Fire produced by the Dragon Emperor by burning his Life Flames and the Dragon Clan\u2019s emperor bloodline. His Fire Attribute Energy was exceptionally tremendous. Even the Nether Lord\u2019s Ultimate Destruction Energy ball was completely annihilated in face of the Dragon Emperor\u2019s fatal blow. His pair of front claws were also temporarily sealed by the Dragon Emperor\u2019s enormous body.</p><br/><p>This was the Dragon Emperor\u2019s seal created by the Dragon Emperor by sacrificing his own life, meridians, bones, muscles and also everything else! Despite the Nether Lord being more powerful, the Dragon Emperor who was halfway through the Heavenly God Tier, still managed to temporarily seal it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, Dragon Emperor! You\u2026\u201d The Elven Empress had only spoken a few words before she started sobbing so hard that she could no longer speak. In order to seal the Nether Lord, the Dragon Emperor sacrificed his entire lifetime. It was thousands of years worth of desolation and loneliness that would be unbearable for ordinary humans.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor\u2019s gaze was gentle as he shook his head at the Elven Empress. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel sorry for me. I can now die without regrets since I was able to fight to the death here. We don\u2019t have much time. From now on, everyone must listen to my orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty Dragon Emperor.\u201d Everyone including Zhou Weiqing, Tian\u2019er, and the Elven Empress respectfully worshipped this senior that was filled with prestige. They awaited his orders. Meanwhile, the Dragon Emperor had already risen to an unparalleled position in everyone\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing admired very few people in his lifetime. There was his persistent father, his teacher, Long Shiya and his teacher\u2019s brother, Duan Tianlang. There were also those bold and unrestrained members of the Heavenly Bow Unit. However, at this very moment, he truly regarded the Dragon Emperor as his idol. He could say with absolute certainty that no matter how glorious he became in this lifetime, it would be impossible for him to compare to this respectable senior before his eyes.</p><br/><p>For the good of the entire world, the Dragon Emperor sacrificed his life that lasted for thousands of years. His life and the lives of those Divine Beasts that helped him to maintain the seal were the most respectable and admirable lives in this world! In order to guard the world, they sacrificed so much and for so long quietly yet no one was aware of that. At this moment, the Dragon Emperor even sacrificed his own life in order to complete the seal once again.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart was deeply moved. It was at this moment that he had completely forgotten about his fear of death. He secretly made up his mind that he would seal the Nether Lord today regardless, so that it could never escape from here.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor\u2019s gaze shifted to Hui Yao as Hui Yao and Duo Si\u2019s gigantic dragon eyes flowed with large drops of tears. There was no sorrow in their gazes, only endless pride. It was the Dragon Clan\u2019s pride. The Dragon Emperor set a good example for them. This was the supposed nobleness of the Dragon Clan that once dominated the entire world! The sorrow of their children\u2019s tragic deaths had faded a lot. Compared to the Dragon Emperor, what was the meaning of sorrow?</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst ancestor?\u201d Hui Yao\u2019s voiced quivered ever so slightly.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor\u2019s gaze gradually turned gold in color, \u201cMy child, there\u2019s no need to be sad. All living beings will die sooner or later anyway. This is the dictum of heaven and earth that no one can ever disobey. It\u2019s just the same for us who\u2019re blessed with such a long lifespan. I and my friends\u2019 lives are already nearing its end since the beginning. Even Phelia, who\u2019s the youngest among us, is already almost six thousand years old. What more could we ask for? The Dragon Clan\u2019s responsibility is entrusted to you after my death. If you\u2019re capable of completing the seal, you\u2019ll be able to leave this place alive. If that\u2019s the case, go and look for our clansmen in the world. I don\u2019t have any more responsibility to entrust to you. I can only hope that you\u2019ll lead our clansmen and ensure the continuity of our Dragon Clan\u2019s glory and honor. Do not let the fire of the Dragon Clan be extinguished, can you do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can. I\u2019ll use my life and everything else to guard the honor and future of the Dragon Clan. I vow to thee,\u201d Hui Yao solemnly swore an oath.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Emperor nodded satisfactorily at him, \u201cVery well. From now on, you\u2019re the new Emperor of the Dragon Clan.\u201d As he was saying that, two beams of golden light shot out of his enormous dragon eyes that had completely turned gold in color. It converged together in front of the Dragon Emperor\u2019s enormous head before he transformed into a golden-colored light mass that floated towards the area above Hui Yao\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Hui Yao lowered his head in great respect as he quietly waited for the ball of golden light to float to the top of his head.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

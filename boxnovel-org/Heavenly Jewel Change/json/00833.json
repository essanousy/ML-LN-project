The sign shattered noisily as well. The Seraphic Blazeangel flickered, and a gigantic platinum-colored longsword appeared in his grasp instantly. Once again, it slammed down at the Destruction Sword.</p><br/><p>Even though the angel sword was only a hundred meters long and paled significantly compared to the Destruction Sword, it actually managed to stop the gigantic Destruction Sword from slashing down again. Perhaps it was due to the sign earlier that somehow worked.</p><br/><p>Purple light darted past Fen Tian\u2019s eyes, and the eight long legs by his side began to quiver. Instantly and without any warning, eight purplish black lights shone upon the Destruction Sword. The layer of platinum-colored light from the shattered sign that engulfed the Destruction Sword immediately dissipated. Furthermore, the light on the Destruction Sword suddenly became twice as bright.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>The angel\u2019s sword shattered. Even the Seraphic Blazeangel was sliced into two halves in mid-air by the slash of the Destruction Sword. Its gigantic body did not disappear immediately. Instead, it was absorbed by the Destruction Sword. It was devoured and completely cleaned out by the Destruction Light with a speed that was visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s body shuddered violently. Blood drained from her face as she turned paled instantly. A streak of blood could be seen trickling down from the corner of her mouth.</p><br/><p>She had a high expectation of Fen Tian but somehow, the power that Fen Tian had just demonstrated was far stronger than she had expected. In fact, the current Tian\u2019er was far stronger than Zhou Weiqing who previously fought with Fen Tian. Despite the fact that she was a Heavenly God who possessed Saint Energy and the support of the Saint God Nucleus Core, she was already wounded two rounds into the match. The purity of Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Energy was a lot purer than Tian\u2019er who had already achieved the Heavenly God Tier.</p><br/><p>After the Destruction Sword destroyed the Seraphic Blazeangel, it paused briefly in the air before it accelerated and charged directly towards Tian\u2019er. Fen Tian\u2019s goal was very straightforward. Even if he could not inflict any damage on Zhou Weiqing now, he had to first put Tian\u2019er to death first. The compelling Saint Energy in Tian\u2019er could equally become a threat to him as well. If she was allowed to work side by side with Zhou Weiqing, it would be hard to tell who would emerge as the victor in the end.</p><br/><p>Even Shangguan Tianyang could clearly see that Zhou Weiqing was currently consolidating the eleventh piece of his legendary armor, Fen Tian naturally would be able to see that as well. Right now, only one word existed in his mind \u2014 destroy!</p><br/><p>Swoosh!</p><br/><p>A circle of platinum-colored light surged from Tian\u2019er\u2019s body. A Heavenly Skill Image of a miniature Tian\u2019er\u2019s gradually took form on her chest. That was the Saint God Nucleus Core. A beam of Saint Light blasted out from Tian\u2019er\u2019s chest. With a bang, it mightily lifted the Destruction Sword with all its force. At the same time, Tian\u2019er\u2019s face was completely pale as she spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>When Xue Ao\u2019tian, who was watching the battle from afar, saw his daughter was wounded, he immediately became worried and attempted to charge forward. However, he was grabbed by the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya before he had the chance to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go! This battle is no longer within range of our powers! If you go, you\u2019ll only be digging your own grave, and you might drag your daughter down along with you. It\u2019s going to be Weiqing\u2019s turn to launch an attack soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Destruction Sword was lifted once more. Fen Tian snorted coldly. In a blink of an eye, the eight long legs behind Fen Tian emitted a purplish-black light yet again. This time, it was not as simple as a straightforward blast. Instead, the purplish-black light was continuously infused into the Destruction Sword. Little by little, the thousand-meter long gigantic Destruction Sword became transparent. The energy ripple was so perturbing that multiple rifts began to appear in the Destruction Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er appeared to be so terribly small and weak in front of the Destruction Sword that was raised in the air. However, she did not even flinch or cower in the face of this. The Saint God Nucleus Core by her chest was unceasingly radiating ripples and ripples of intense platinum-colored halos. No matter what the outcome was, she was determined to withstand this blow. She would not allow Fen Tian to harm her man.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Thick, dark purple light expanded aggressively on the Destruction Sword like flames. The gigantic sword instantly doubled its width as inexhaustible bloodlust and destruction aura plunged down like a purplish-black mountain crumbling towards Tian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>A look of despair could be seen in Tian\u2019er\u2019s eyes. Fen Tian who had refined his Destruction Energy that had fused with the Destruction Attribute of so many of Blood Red Hell and Love Valley\u2019s followers had evidently become more powerful than before. His cultivation base had unquestionably gone beyond the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier. Even if he had not fully reached the Heavenly Change Tier yet, at the very least, he already had half his foot in.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er\u2019s Saint Energy was not as pure as his. Coupled with the fact that there was a huge gap between their cultivation bases, how was she supposed to withstand it under such circumstances?</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er knew that she might be able to help Weiqing block this blow but she might no longer be able to see her Little Fatty anymore.</p><br/><p>The gigantic sword plunged down from the sky as it brought along the destructive aura, bloodlust, and an infinite terror along with it. It was like the entire Boundless Mainland would also be sliced and destroyed by just this one slash.</p><br/><p>Despite that, a change could suddenly be seen in Fen Tian\u2019s eyes at this moment. Without any warning, a gray light materialized in front of his earth-shattering sword.</p><br/><p>Ding!</p><br/><p>A crisp sound resonated in the air. Even though it did not sound as horrifying as the previous rumble, with just this one loud and crisp ding, all of the powerhouses who were levitating in mid-air to watch the battle suddenly dropped toward the ground. They dropped for almost a thousand meters before they could carefully regain control of their bodies.</p><br/><p>It was a long gray sword that appeared to be much more slender compared to the Destruction Sword. It had a gray, crystal-like body with a dazzling gray light that radiated brightly from its body. The air around it was so sharp that it seemed even sharper than the Destruction Sword.</p><br/><p>The sword was not long. It looked like it was just about 1.5 meters long. Before such a gigantic sword like the Destruction Sword, it resembled a speck of dust. However, it was exactly this speck of dust that blocked the path of the Destruction Sword.</p><br/><p>The gray sword light shimmered, stretched out and became a thousand meters long before it obstructed the Destruction Sword abruptly. The two swords came to a halt in mid-air as they came in contact. Without warning, a gray figure materialized soundlessly in the air.</p><br/><p>A figure that was a hundred meters tall. Evil yet handsome. It was the Demon God.</p><br/><p>However, unlike the Demon God that Zhou Weiqing had summoned before, the current Demon God appeared more devilish. Furthermore, there was another figure that could be seen behind the Demon God. His hand was holding Tian\u2019er who had previously fallen into despair.</p><br/><p>This person was entirely enveloped in a white armor that could only be described to have absolute magnificence and dazzle. The entire armor set that was white in color appeared to be glittering and translucent. The armor seemed to be heavy as it covered his entire body. Apart from that, it seemed like a gigantic dragon was constantly swimming within the armor as ripples of platinum-colored light continuously radiated from it. A visible cluster of the nebula was spiraling continually at his back, and that was none other than the Astral Divine Territory. One could easily imagine just how powerful the armor set was with the Astral Divine Territory embedded in it.</p><br/><p>The arms on the armor set were notably thick, with two sledgehammers in both hands. The hammers were not particularly big. However, it was apparent that the two lights that emanated from them were projecting their images in the sky, creating two gigantic energy sledgehammers that were a hundred meters long. They looked like a Heavenly Skill Image but even Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Divine Territory could not seem to go near this pair of hammers.</p><br/><p>Right in the middle of the chest of the armor was a piece of crystal clear milky gemstone that was in the form of a human being. Upon closer inspection, was that not Zhou Weiqing who was sitting cross-legged over there?</p><br/><p>That was right, Zhou Weiqing had completed his consolidation. He had completed the last consolidation of his Ringless Ground Purging Set. The eleventh piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set was no longer gold in color but a white god set. It was a true god set. Although the Boundless Infinitum Set was made up of eleven pieces as well, it was significantly inferior compared to the Ringless Ground Purging Set.</p><br/><p>Not only did Zhou Weiqing summon the Demon God\u2019s Illusion, he actually managed to merge himself with it. It allowed the Demon God\u2019s illusion to bring into play a much greater power than before, to the point that even the Demon God\u2019s Sword was summoned. Just like how Fen Tian\u2019s power was magnified, similar changes could be seen in Zhou Weiqing as well.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the Demon God\u2019s body became incorporeal. In no time at all, the Demon God\u2019s sword expanded in the air and became a hundred meters long before it fell into the Demon God\u2019s hand. With a light flick of the long sword, he forcefully smacked the Destruction Sword away.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing who was still in mid-air was not standing around idly either. He threw his left hammer in the air as his right hammer swept across in front. The two hammers clashed together and a rich, intense platinum-colored Saint Energy blasted out in an instant. His Dual God Strength Hammers actually merged into one as it turned into a giant hammer with a long handle.</p><br/><p>This gigantic hammer with a long handle was three meters long. The huge hammerhead\u2019s width was almost a meter long. A gigantic dragon could be indistinctly seen hovering and spiraling above it as both the smiling and crying-face hammers sparkled harmoniously.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand held onto the gigantic hammer as his left hand held onto Tian\u2019er\u2019s hand. At this moment, Tian\u2019er felt like her spirit had merged into one with his.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to cross over my dead body first before he kills you!\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s voice resonated by Tian\u2019er\u2019s ears without a hint of hesitation. The next moment, he stepped into mid-air as well and stood side by side with the hundred-meter tall Demon God.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian did not continue to launch his attack. As he stared at Zhou Weiqing and the Demon God, his eyes instantly turned darker, \u201cThe eleventh piece of the legendary armor set. Zhou Weiqing, looks like you have plenty of trump cards up your sleeves, don\u2019t you? However, these are all useless! So what if you have the Demon God? Even if the real Demon God is here, I\u2019ll make him fall today!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Fen Tian said that, he waved his right hand. Without any warning, the thousand-meter long Destruction Sword suddenly shrank at a rapid pace and transformed into a four-foot-long sword in his hand.</p><br/><p>The Destruction Sword that became a four-foot sword turned into a deep, serene black color. Zhou Weiqing could not describe the feeling that the sword gave him at all. Additionally, Fen Tian\u2019s entire being was now shrouded in complete darkness, even his face could no longer be seen clearly.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Demon God suddenly made his move. He was an illusion that was summoned by Zhou Weiqing. That was why he immediately launched his attack without delay the instant he sensed that Zhou Weiqing was threatened.</p><br/><p>The Demon God\u2019s Sword sliced upwards on its own. Fen Tian\u2019s black figure materialized out of thin air on its path. Even Zhou Weiqing who had mastered Spatial Law did not know how Fen Tian managed to appear there so suddenly.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>This time, the situation took a turn.</p><br/><p>Ding!</p><br/><p>With a crisp sound, the Demon God\u2019s sword broke into two\u2026</p><br/><p>Under the aghast expressions of Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er, the powerful Demon God\u2019s sword actually broke into two.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Fen Tian enlarged in size and transformed into a gigantic mouth, completely shrouded in black, that devoured everything into nothingness. Without warning, it swallowed the Demon God along with its sword in just one mouth.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing immediately began to launch his attack. He lifted up the Dual God Strength Hammers with both of his hand as he charged towards with him without making any unnecessary moves.</p><br/><p>Slam!</p><br/><p>A dark shadow flew across and the Demon God instantly reappeared. However, it only appeared for barely a second before it vanished into a cloud of gray air.</p><br/><p>The dark shadow that was thrown across was none other than Fen Tian. He was looking at Zhou Weiqing with an astonished look. However, Zhou Weiqing could not see the look on his face because he was completely shrouded in black.</p><br/><p>The eleventh piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set did not only multiply Zhou Weiqing\u2019s power by two-fold. Instead, it gave him a ten-fold increase of his original power. In other words, the power that Zhou Weiqing possessed now was ten-thousand-fold compared to his original power with the help of the Ringless Ground Purging Set. This was the ten-thousand-fold power of a Heavenly God, to be exact!</p><br/><p>Any energy would start to have a certain degree of mutation the moment it reached its limit. Just as the saying went, all roads lead to Rome. Earlier, Zhou Weiqing swatted Fen Tian away with the help of his brute force. Although he was unable to inflict any injuries to Fen Tian, at the very least, he did not allow him to fully devour the Demon God\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>The Dual God Strength Hammers were waved again. In mid-air, a hundred-meter tall illusion of the gigantic hammer plunged down from the sky as it slammed its way towards Fen Tian.</p><br/><p>There was another flash of shadows, and Fen Tian disappeared again. All the same, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er vanished as well.</p><br/><p>A light reappeared. Without any warning, Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Sword reemerged right at the spot where Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er were standing barely a second ago. The two of them, on the other hand, reappeared at another side.</p><br/><p>The power that Zhou Weiqing used was the Spatial Law. As for the power that Fen Tian was using, well, he had no clue at all.</p><br/><p>The gigantic hammer did not come to a halt despite Fen Tian\u2019s disappearance. Instead, it crudely slammed down in mid-air. With a loud rumble, a black hole with a diameter of a thousand meters was slammed open by the hammer. The energy from the devour was so robust that it caused Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian\u2019s body to shake violently for a moment.</p><br/><p>The Dual God Strength Hammers moved again. In no time at all, the illusion of the gigantic hammer in the air suddenly went into a frenzy as it began to smash in all directions without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Whether it was Zhou Weiqing or Fen Tian, and regardless of how powerful their cultivation bases were, they were not real gods after all. They could not go near the black hole at all. Perhaps the black hole could not devour them, but it could still affect their strength greatly. At this moment, several dozens of gigantic black holes suddenly emerged in the sky as it blocked off all the routes of Fen Tian\u2019s attacks towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that this can stop me?\u201d Fen Tian\u2019s disdainful voice boomed in the air. His black figure expanded once again. With a swish, he enveloped a black hole and disappeared without a trace in just a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was struck dumb with astonishment. How was this possible? Has his Destruction Energy reached the point where it could even devour a black hole now? Even if he did not have the ultimate, purest form of Destruction Energy, it seemed like he was almost there.</p><br/><p>Although Zhou Weiqing was taken aback, he could not possibly just stay idle. When the other party was devouring the black hole, the Dual God Strength Hammers rumbled like lightning instantly.</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, the gigantic hammer along with the Ringless Ground Purging Set\u2019s terrifying energy burst out without warning and forcibly sent Fen Tian flying backward again.</p><br/><p>However, Fen Tian did not seem to mind this attack at all. In just a flash, he charged forward once more. This time, his body suddenly shrank and became extremely small. The effect of him devouring the black hole earlier immediately became apparent. A crack began to appear on the black holes that were originally protecting Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er. In just a short while, Fen Tian suddenly crawled out from that hole. The black shadow suddenly enlarged as the Destruction Sword slashed directly towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>None of his techniques could help him now. The Dual God Strength Hammers slammed forward again. This was the first time the two of them directly clashed in direct contact after they raised their cultivation bases.</p><br/><p>Wham!</p><br/><p>The entire sky went dark for a moment. Within seconds, a black figure flew backward and crashed into a black hole. What a sagacious man Zhou Weiqing was! Before he sent his hammer out, he had already worked out the position. Fen Tian was not a match for him when it came to the matter of brute strength.</p><br/><p>However, could the black hole inflict any harm on Fen Tian?</p><br/><p>Shattered. The thing that was shattered was the black hole instead. Fen Tian\u2019s body actually shattered the black hole before it turned into black spots and slowly dissipated in the air.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, even though Zhou Weiqing had managed to sent Fen Tian flying backward, he was not entirely free from complications. His body was densely covered in a layer of black light, his Ringless Ground Purging Set was shimmering brightly and intensely while its platinum-colored light was flickering in a frenzy. It was apparent that he did not have the upper hand in terms of attributes. His Saint Energy could barely suppress Fen Tian.</p><br/><p>As soon as Fen Tian shattered the black hole, his black figure flickered across again without the need to regain his bearings. This time, his momentum was even more powerful than before.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>The platinum-colored light on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body suddenly flared brightly as it forcefully melted the black light that covered his body. At the same time, his Dual God Strength Hammers was illuminated with the brilliance of a nebula as the spiraling nebula appeared directly at the hammerhead. As it turned out, he actually activated his Astral Divine Territory directly above it.</p><br/><p>All of the Heavenly God-tier powerhouses who were watching the battle were stunned with their mouths wide open. All of them possessed a Divine Territory as well so it was natural that they knew how a Divine Territory functioned. They also knew that Divine Territories were easier to control when it was bigger in size. Although there was a limit to how much it could grow, it would not cause any pressure on the body at all. However, it was a different story when the Divine Territory shrank. Shrinking a Divine Territory was like compressing it. They could not imagine how one could possibly shrink his Divine Territory to become as small as the size of one\u2019s hammer like what Zhou Weiqing was doing at the moment.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Tian\u2019er changed her position and stood at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back. Her entire being was pressed tightly against him with both her arms around his waist. She unreservedly infused all of her Saint Energy into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body and fully merged their Saint Energy into one.</p><br/><p>The sky suddenly dimmed without any warning. Just as quickly, a bright light shimmered and this time, Fen Tian was not sent flying. Instead, he was stuck firmly onto the hammerhead.</p><br/><p>The platinum-colored light of the Astral Divine Territory completely enveloped Fen Tian\u2019s black-colored body. Innumerable stars appeared beside him and began to collide uncontrollably with the Destruction Energy that radiated off his body. Every time there was a collision, it produced a tenacious energy ripple that was filled with the elements of destruction and creation. It could clearly be seen that both of the white and black colors coming out of Fen Tian and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s bodies were slowing down at a visible speed.</p><br/><p>Was it true that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy could not restrain Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Energy? Naturally, the answer was negative. The twins known as creation and destruction would always inhibit each other. After Zhou Weiqing had managed to raise his cultivation base to the Heavenly God Tier, the purity of his Saint Energy was not inferior to Fen Tian at all.</p><br/><p>He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for the window when Fen Tian let his guard down. The reason he allowed the Destruction Energy to attach itself to his body in the first collision was so that Fen Tian would let down his guard and opportunity would come in the next moment.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s combined Saint Energy might not be on par with Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Energy. However, at the very least, it could act as a firm restraint on Fen Tian in terms of their attributes. All of the weaknesses that he previously displayed had vanished without a sight. Even Tian\u2019er who was hugging Zhou Weiqing tightly could not help but let out a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Indeed, from the moment she resisted Fen Tian\u2019s attack, Zhou Weiqing had already laid his trap in place. The previous defeat when their attributes clashed was merely a facade.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian who was completely shrouded in black gradually exposed his original appearance. However, what took Zhou Weiqing by surprise was that he could not even see a hint of panic on Fen Tian\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s motive was relatively simple, that was to deplete. He was going to rely on his Saint Energy\u2019s Creation Attribute to deplete Fen Tian of his Destruction Attribute. He had full faith in his self-healing abilities. After all, with the presence of his Astral Divine Territory, and as long as the stars that were created during the genesis were still present in the sky, his Saint Energy would still continue to be replenished. On the contrary, Fen Tian no longer had any other powerhouse who possessed the Destruction Energy by his side anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that my current self can only devour the Destruction Attribute?\u201d Fen Tian sneered coldly. All of a sudden, the eight long legs behind him stretched outwards. Almost instantly, a black orb lit up at the tip of each leg. It was just like eight tiny black holes had materialized out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>Eight bright lights blasted forward and went straight to the crowd that was watching the battle.</p><br/><p>\u2018SH*T!\u2019 Zhou Weiqing yelled in his heart but everything was too late. The first victims were eight powerhouses from the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace. The eight Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s Heavenly Kings were directly hit by the eight black lights. In the next moment, they had already vanished on the spot before they could even let out a shrill cry. On the other side, the black light that was diminishing on Fen Tian\u2019s body suddenly turned brighter. What worried Zhou Weiqing the most right now was that the black lights on the eight long legs had begun to lit up again.</p><br/><p>However, this time, the eight lights did not hit the crowd. Instead, they were aimed towards the eight holes that had not completely vanished in the air yet. The eight holes all dimmed at once and at the next moment, Zhou Weiqing felt a Destruction Energy that was powerful beyond comparison erupting from Fen Tian\u2019s body. His Dual God Strength Hammers could no longer bind the Destruction Sword to it.</p><br/><p>With a loud rumble, Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er were sent flying away. The bloodcurdling Destruction Energy metamorphosed into a large devouring mouth and bit down brutally on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cUrghhh \u2014\u201d Zhou Weiqing spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. The atrocious Destruction Energy erupted completely from inside his body. Even the light from the Ringless Ground Purging Set on his body dimmed down.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it!\u2019</p><br/><p>It had never crossed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mind that Fen Tian\u2019s power could actually rise to such a level after he had borrowed his power from the Nether Lord.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian sneered. He did not rush forward to give chase to Zhou Weiqing. He merely lifted his right hand and raised the Destruction Sword. A strange voice that was neither male nor female could suddenly be heard coming from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lowly humans, how daring of you to want to destroy my plans?! You must be out of your mind! The war between mankind has already begun. What a lovely feeling this is, to listen to the sorrowful souls and this sense of foreboding evil. The current Fen Tian already possesses a third of my power. It\u2019s not something that all of you can defeat so easily! All of you will die. When I\u2019m released from my shackles and descend to Earth, that\u2019ll be the end for all you humans!\u201d</p><br/><p>A dark gloomy light soared up into the sky and spread outwards in a circular pattern. Within seconds, it had already reached a thousand meters in diameter. Right at the center of the dark light, a mass of dark green color that looked eerily like a gigantic eye <sup>1 </sup>appeared soundlessly.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a powerful suction energy that defied all expectation erupted from the dark gloomy hole that was a thousand meters wide in diameter. The suction energy was at least a hundred times stronger than that of a normal black hole. It did not matter if it was Zhou Weiqing who stood only a short distance away or the powerhouses of Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, Peerless Sect and Heavenly Snow Mountain who were all standing from afar watching the battle, all of them could no longer control their own bodies as they were tightly hauled by the perturbing devouring Destruction Energy. Their bodies were pulled closer and closer to it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er could barely stabilize their bodies. It was all that they could do to stabilize themselves. It was fundamentally impossible for them to escape this time.</p><br/><p>The Nether Lord. The voice just now had to belong to the Nether Lord. Just a third of his power and it was already this powerful. To what extent exactly was the power that the true Nether Lord possessed? It would definitely be the end of mankind if they allowed him to descend to Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cNether Lord, you\u2019ll never succeed!\u201d A cool and pleasant voice resonated at this moment. Immediately afterward, a turquoise light appeared in the void soundlessly right above Fen Tian, directly in the middle of the black hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cElven Queen? Oh, my bad, I should call you the Elven Empress now. Are you really trying to stop me all by yourself?\u201d Disdain could be heard in the Nether Lord\u2019s remark.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress did not speak a word at all as a faint turquoise light began to ooze out from her body. Despite the fact that she was situated right in the middle of the devouring black hole, the black hole did not affect her at all.</p><br/><p>One by one, she continuously made complicated hand signs in front of her chest. The turquoise light that was growing more intense as time went by, surged out from her in the form of a light halo. Her gaze, on the other hand, was trained on Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, I can only temporarily hold off Fen Tian. The only thing that can inflict real harm on him is your Saint Energy. We don\u2019t have many opportunities left so you\u2019ll have to launch your most powerful attack and destroy him completely. He\u2019s merely a projection of the Nether Lord so we must first kill him off. Otherwise, everyone present here will die and Fen Tian will be able to use our power to open up a passage for the Nether Lord. You only have thirty seconds!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress\u2019s voice was solemn with a hint of nervousness. This was the first time Zhou Weiqing had seen her in such a state since he met her, except for the time when the Elven Princess was abducted. One could easily imagine how terribly formidable the Fen Tian before them had become.</p><br/><p>Rays of turquoise light descended from the sky like drooping vines and enveloped Fen Tian entirely. Right at this moment, the black devouring hole in the sky had also come to a pause. It was as if all the Destruction Energy had been isolated by the Elven Empress.</p><br/><p>Those turquoise lights compressed inwardly and literally crushed Fen Tian. It prevented him from releasing his Destruction Energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cElven Empress, what you\u2019re doing now is like quenching thirst with poison. How long do you think you\u2019ll be able to hold me back like this? I\u2019m more interested in seeing how much vitality you\u2019re planning to burn this time!\u201d The Nether Lord\u2019s voice was still full of disdain. It was apparent he was not at all worried about the Elven Empress\u2019 actions.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress did not utter a sound. On the contrary, the turquoise light became even more intense to the point that Fen Tian who was trapped in the middle could no longer move.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Empress was still sharing the same life. For this reason, he knew that what the Nether Lord had said was correct. At this moment, the Elven Empress was burning her life to purify her Life Saint Energy to an appalling degree. It was only just enough to trap Fen Tian who could utilize the Nether Lord\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>In fact, the energy that the Elven Empress was using right now was not entirely her own. She was actually using the energy of the Elven Elders as well. Even a part of the Elf Tribe\u2019s Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s energy was being used by her right now. Even so, she could only last for 30 seconds.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing motioned for Tian\u2019er to release his body. As she did that, the Dual God Strength Hammers in his hands vanished without a trace. Thirty seconds. He only had thirty seconds. Right now, Fen Tian did not even have a corporeal form. It would be extremely difficult to launch a powerful attack within half a minute to kill him who possessed a third of the Nether Lord\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>The most difficult part lay with the fact that Fen Tian\u2019s Destruction Energy was currently so pure that it had reached a terrifying level. If Zhou Weiqing could not kill him off with a blow, he would be able to devour any energy from the air or even open a black hole to devour its energy and heal himself.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not have the slightest bit of confidence in his own Saint Energy. Thirty seconds was really too short. If he merely used the depletion method to attack him, he would never be able to kill Fen Tian off completely in such a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>Due to this reason, Zhou Weiqing did not even bother trying to deplete him any longer. He had another option, an option that he had never tried before. However, at this moment, all he could do was to take a gamble and bet to see if he could succeed.</p><br/><p>The gentle Saint Energy ripple slowly oozed out of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. The tiny figure in front of his chest followed suit as if its eyes were also open.</p><br/><p>The purest Saint Energy in the Saint God Nucleus Core surged out gently. Zhou Weiqing clasped both of his hands together and made a very strange gesture.</p><br/><p>His fingers were clasped together but the palms were not touching each other. A fist-sized distance was left in between the palms as both of the palms faced each other. Without warning, the Saint God Nucleus Core flew out from his chest and stopped right in between his palms. The radiant platinum-colored light suddenly shone brightly at once. The tiny Saint God Nucleus Core that was floating between Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palms had the same pose as Zhou Weiqing and looked rather peculiar.</p><br/><p>It also had its hands clasped together with its palms facing each other and a small space in between.</p><br/><p>The light on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s forehead lit up immediately. In that instance, both of his eyes suddenly turned gray before a huge Heavenly Skill Image gradually emerged at his back.</p><br/><p>When one reached the level of his cultivation base, the Heavenly Skill Projection that was cast would usually be of his own image. However, at this moment, the Heavenly Skill Projection that materialized behind Zhou Weiqing was not himself at all.</p><br/><p>It was a gigantic tiger that was entirely black in color \u2014 the Dark Demon God Tiger. Its stout tail was curved, the huge wide wings and the imposing manner were, without a doubt, much stronger than before.</p><br/><p>In fact, Zhou Weiqing had never once cast the Dark Demon God Tiger Heavenly Skill Projection ever since he became a Heavenly King. However, he had no choice but to launch it now in the face of such a critical situation.</p><br/><p>Other than its powerful and imposing manner, what made the Dark Demon God Tiger different than before was the rider on its back. It was a miniature version of Zhou Weiqing. If one was to look carefully, one would notice that the Saint God Nucleus Core that was originally between Zhou Weiqing\u2019s palms were no longer there. His God Saint Nucleus Core had actually merged with his own Dark Demon God Tiger Heavenly Skill Projection. What a strange situation this was!</p><br/><p>Nobody had any idea what Zhou Weiqing was going to do next. Even the Elven Empress who shared the same heart with him could not split part of her attention to sense it because she needed to devote all of her energy into sealing Fen Tian. At any rate, she had absolute confidence in Zhou Weiqing. That was a kind of faith that no words could describe.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian, who was unable to break free from the Elven Empress\u2019 restraint, decided to just hover in the air quietly as he silently watched Zhou Weiqing from a distance. He did not know why but there was an uneasy feeling eating its way to his heart right now. However, at this moment, the energy ripple that emanated out of Zhou Weiqing was not strong at all. After he had withdrawn his Dual God Strength Hammers, he even retracted his Astral Divine Territory.</p><br/><p>\u2018Under such circumstances, how can Zhou Weiqing possibly inflict any injury on me with his attack?\u2019 Fen Tian thought to himself.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian was certain that Zhou Weiqing would fail.</p><br/><p>The terrifying Destruction Energy continued to struggle against the Elven Empress\u2019 restraint. Perhaps only the Elven Empress alone was able to hold him off temporarily in such a state. However, such a restraint greatly depleted her energy as well even if she was the Elven Empress. Fen Tian was absolutely certain that as long as he could break off this restraint, she would be the first to bear the brunt. He would be able to slaughter the Elven Empress and devour her. At that time, Zhou Weiqing and his wife would be nothing compared to him. Even if he was left all alone, even if he had to pay such a hefty price to obtain this powerful strength, he believed that he would still be able to wipe off all the powerhouses that were before him. When that time came, he would still at least be an emissary in this world, even if he was only a stooge for the Nether Lord.</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes suddenly turned gray, huh? Does he intend to use the Demon God\u2019s energy?\u2019 Fen Tian thought to himself when he saw the changes in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the Dark Demon God Tiger and the Saint God Nucleus Core behind him seemed to be unable to withstand such a great deal of energy as they began to distort in an unreal pattern. At this time, a tiny black hole emerged between Zhou Weiqing\u2019s opposing palms.</p><br/><p>From the appearance itself, this black hole could only be described with one word \u2014 minuscule. Even though Zhou Weiqing\u2019s action was slowly becoming bigger, it was still quite limited. Even with Fen Tian\u2019s cultivation base, he could not sense the presence of any energy or aura coming from it at all. Such a tiny black hole did not even warrant an attack from Fen Tian. In his mind, he was sure that such an attack would automatically vanish the moment it came in contact with his body.</p><br/><p>This was his intuitive judgment on the energy but he did not understand why he was feeling particularly strange. Somehow, he had a gut feeling that this seemingly insignificant tiny ball of energy might pose a threat to him. However, he was not sure exactly where did this sense of threat come from.</p><br/><p>The tiny black hole gradually expanded as Zhou Weiqing slowly opened up his arms. His eyes were extremely focused because this attack would be his only chance. Due to this reason, he would never allow himself to make even the slightest mistake. At this moment, whether it was him, Fen Tian or even the Elven Empress, each of them had placed their bets. It\u2019s either succeed or die!</p><br/><p>As the black hole slowly became bigger, Fen Tian could finally see the uniqueness of this black hole. The surroundings of an ordinary black hole would usually be entirely dark or filled with devastating and destructive devouring energy. However, it was not the case for this black hole that Zhou Weiqing cast. Instead, around the black hole were circles of distorted bright light. That was exactly how the Heavenly Skill Projection\u2019s Heavenly Skill Image got distorted.</p><br/><p>The feeling of uneasiness suddenly became even more intense. Fen Tian struggled with all his might and the Destruction Energy in his body erupted all as he tried to drive the Elven Empress away.</p><br/><p>The Empress felt very pleased when she sensed Fen Tian\u2019s hysteria. It was apparent that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attack must be effective. Otherwise, why would Fen Tian suddenly go berserk? The fire of life continued to burn vigorously. It was so vigorous that one could even see the seemingly real turquoise flame flickering above the Elven Empress\u2019 head.</p><ol><li data-annotation-id=\"bcc248cf-79de-417e-70db-6329040bf58e\">Lol, Sauron cameo.</li></ol><br/>\n</div>"}

As he faced the two people that were advancing toward him, he took a few steps back as if he was afraid. He even noticed the smug look on Sang De\u2019s face. How could it be possible that they were more cunning than him, Little Fatty Zhou?</p><br/><p>In their delight, Sang De and his partner increased their speed and the might of their attacks as they charged toward Zhou Weiqing. At that moment, Zhou Weiqing seemingly was stumbling around in panic, flailing his right hand subconsciously. He tripped and raised his right foot which struck the ground heavily.</p><br/><p>The strange scene played out at that moment. Even Master Er Chun did not react at all.</p><br/><p>With two light thuds, amid a dazzling silverish light, Sang De and his partner\u2019s bodies were split into two. Their upper bodies stagnated and a smug and gruesome look remained on their faces from their impending win. Their lower bodies were still moving but their bodies were no longer whole.</p><br/><p>Blood and organs splattered everywhere. Sang De was momentarily confused. Why did it seem like Zhou Weiqing was getting taller while he was feeling weaker? Something did not feel right, and as he looked down subconsciously, he let out a tragic scream.</p><br/><p>The man that was sneaking up on Zhou Weiqing had it even worse than his friends. When Zhou Weiqing was pretending to stumble around and then tripped, he stomped his right leg on the ground to release a terrifying shockwave. Because that man kept close to the ground, the intense shockwave was instantly transferred into his body. All his bones and internal organs were instantly destroyed due to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s stomp, causing him to spew out blood violently.It was impossible for him to survive that attack.</p><br/><p>Instant kill! The three men who had the absolute upper hand were instantly killed by Zhou Weiqing in such a gruesome manner. The entire place was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Sang Tan who was sitting on the head seat was stunned into silence, while Er Chun\u2019s mouth was wide open in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my! How did this happen? They\u2019re all so easily defeated. Master Er Chun, you should\u2019ve been able to tell that they were no match for me. Why didn\u2019t you stop me!\u201d Zhou Weiqing screamed in panic. Shangguan Bing\u2019er had knitted her brows when she saw the gruesome scene on the stage. However, when she saw Zhou Weiqing putting on a show so flawlessly, she almost burst out laughing. What a mischievous guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing initially did not want to make a scene, but Sang De\u2019s sinister glare and Er Chun\u2019s dirty schemes had infuriated him. He was not one to suffer in silence. For them to scheme against him, how could they have a good outcome? Besides, he had follow up plans to deal with the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You killed them?\u201d Er Chun snapped out of his trance when he heard Zhou Weiqing\u2019s screams. The spectators exclaimed.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing maintained a look of innocence with fear on his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this would happen. Didn\u2019t you ask us to fight with everything we had? With your cultivation base, you should have been able to stop me!\u201d Although he did not say it directly, he was pushing all the responsibility to Er Chun.</p><br/><p>It was not easy for Sang Tan to find his breath but he remained silent. He had given Sang De everything he could get his hands on in Ubaatar City so that his son could join the ranks of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. He did not expect the plan that was bound to succeed smoothly would have such an unexpected change. His only son was now dead, and as he glared at Zhou Weiqing who was still on the stage, his eyes turned red.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, you deliberately came here to mess things up. This is a serious provocation against the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Men, lock him up!\u201d Er Chun was incensed. Although he had a high standing in Ubaatar City, the three men who died were no ordinary people, and he had accepted a large bribe from them.</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he showed no regard to everything else. He attempted to slap Zhou Weiqing. The temperature on the stage plummeted so suddenly that they could see ice fractals forming in the air.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stood still as Er Chun came at him. \u201cNice. What an impressive Mysterious Heavenly Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>A dark gold glow lit up as a loud thud was heard. Zhou Weiqing stood still without even moving his fingers as the Dual God Strength Hammers appeared in both of his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura?!\u201d Er Chun exclaimed. He recognized the weapons, so he stopped moving immediately. A Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura was rare both in the Boundless Mainland and in the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Er Chun had seen them many times during Heavenly Jewel competitions, and he knew that everyone who had a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Set. It had to be emphasized that those who used such sets were elites among the younger generation in the Five Great Saints Lands, carefully nurtured by each Saints Land. It was already difficult to obtain a regular Consolidated Equipment set for an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master, let alone a Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura.</p><br/><p>No matter how much Er Chun hated Zhou Weiqing, he immediately stopped and did not dare continue taking action when he saw the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s young age. Anyone on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland who possessed a Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aurat must surely have come from a powerful background. Even the Mysterious Heavenly Palace that represented the city did not have Consolidated Equipment of such caliber.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Er Chun scornfully. \u201cYou also know about the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura too? Then do you know what a Strength Legacy is?\u201d He was an expert in tricking people. There was a moment in the past where he tricked a Heavenly King into backing out of a fight. He was now much more powerful, and with great confidence, it was even easier for him to trick someone. Who on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland would know about the Strength Legacy?</p><br/><p>Er Chun shook his head subconsciously while Zhou Weiqing sneered \u201cYou don\u2019t even know about the Strength Legacy. It seems like us God Tier Masters are being forgotten by the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of his words were secondary. When Zhou Weiqing said \u2018God Tier,\u2019 even Sang Tan who was feeling the extreme hate from the loss of his son trembled from a cold chill. He got a hold of himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? You\u2019re a God Tier Master?\u201d Er Chun\u2019s eyes were filled with disbelief. As a Mysterious Heavenly Palace inner disciple and an Upper-Level Ninth Jewel Heavenly Zong Master, he knew a little about the God Tier Masters. He knew that a God Tier Master would need to be at the Lower Level Heavenly King stage. The young man standing in front of him only had a cultivation level at the Fifth Jewel, but he called himself a God Tier Master as though it was fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d Zhou Weiqing stood with his hands behind him. He deliberately painted himself as a person exuding an immortal air. \u201cI initially came out of seclusion in a bid to build a good relationship with the Mysterious Heavenly Palace so that we can help each other. I didn\u2019t expect to encounter your shameless schemes. I\u2019m not going to explain any further. Facts speak louder than words. Just watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing waved his left hand as he spoke and a Consolidated Equipment Paper appeared, floating before him. The soft paper was the best Consolidated Equipment Paper there was. Just one sheet alone was worth more than a hundred gold coins. The Mysterious Heavenly Mainland also used the same currency with the difference being the different images engraved on the gold coins.</p><br/><p>The soft Consolidated Equipment Paper came to a stop as it floated in front of Zhou Weiqing while he stood with his left hand at his back in a composed manner. The title of God Tier Master was just too amazing. Everyone had their eyes on him, waiting to see what he would do next. Suddenly, a silver light flashed on it, and the Consolidated Equipment Paper slightly shook without Zhou Weiqing doing anything. Another silver light flashed suddenly, and as soon as the glow faded, Zhou Weiqing waved his hand while the Consolidated Equipment Paper flew towards a Heavenly Jewel Master who was sitting below the stage.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Jewel Master grabbed the Consolidated Equipment Paper subconsciously. His eyes immediately widened in shock as he exclaimed, \u201cThis\u2026 This is a Consolidated Equipment Scroll. Heavens! It\u2019s a Master Level Consolidated Equipment Scroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like what Zhou Weiqing had said, facts speak louder than words. When the truth was presented so clearly, there was nothing that needed saying.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Jewel Master who grabbed the Consolidated Equipment Scroll looked at Zhou Weiqing passionately. Yes! He was a Heavenly Jewel Master, but all Heavenly Jewel Masters would have the same emotional reaction when they see a Consolidated Equipment Master. Moreover, the Consolidated Equipment Master who was standing before him was not just an ordinary one but a legendary God Tier Master from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland!</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Jewel Master did not doubt Zhou Weiqing\u2019s identity as a God Tier Master because he managed to summon a Master Level Consolidated Equipment Scroll with just a single wave of his hand. Aside from a God Tier Master, who else could have done so?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled indifferently and said to the Heavenly Jewel Master, \u201cThis Consolidated Equipment Scroll is yours. It doesn\u2019t mean much to me. However, I\u2019d like all the Heavenly Jewel Masters here to bear witness. I\u2019ve immersed myself in Consolidated Equipment Scrolls for the past 20 years. I spent all my energy in the production of this Consolidated Equipment Scroll. If we\u2019re here to talk about cultivation levels, I\u2019m nothing compared to Master Er Chun. If I don\u2019t get to the finals, please inform the Mysterious Heavenly Palace of what you\u2019ve seen today. I believe the Mysterious Heavenly Palace will give me the justice that I deserve.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment this was said, it was immediately met with approval from the Heavenly Jewel Masterst. They did not like Er Chun since the very beginning. Besides, Zhou Weiqing was a God Tier Master, and they were eager to get Zhou Weiqing\u2019s approval! It was a path that led to greatness for any Heavenly Jewel Master! Moreover, rules failed when violaters are legion. The Heavenly Jewel Masters present numbered more than a hundred. All of them had some background. No matter how obnoxious Er Chun was and even with the support of the mayor, Sang Tan, he would not dare to offend so many Heavenly Jewel Masters at the same time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

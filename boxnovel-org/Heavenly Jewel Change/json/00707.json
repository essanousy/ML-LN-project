It almost stirred the entire castle in an instant. Right now, a certain someone who was falling in mid-air came back to his senses and grabbed on tightly to the person next to him like a giant octopus.</p><br/><p>It had never crossed Meng Xing\u2019s mind that the confident and wise Great God Tier Master Zhou who looked calm in the banquet would react in such a way after leaping off the cliff with her.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s scream had already shocked her to the core. For this reason, when he suddenly turned around and hugged her tightly, she did not even have the time to stop him from doing that. Instantly, a strong manly scent inundated her olfactory senses. The warm and vigorous body was holding on to her tightly in his embrace. What caused her to be at her wit\u2019s end was this guy even had his legs up high, wrapped around her luscious ass. Right now, the two bodies were stuck so close to each other that there was not even a gap in between them.</p><br/><p>Even though Meng Xing had a high cultivation base, she almost could not control her own body and was on the verge of plummeting into the abyss directly.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d Embarrassed and shocked, she quickly tried to break away from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s bear hug. Yet, his embrace was very tight, and no matter how much she struggled, she still could not get away from his arms. On top of that, the speed of their fall was increasing drastically. It left her with no other choice but to use the airflow to carry their bodies\u2019 weight so that they would not crash directly to the bottom.</p><br/><p>\u2018It feels so good!\u2019 Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart was bursting with joy. As he held on tightly to Meng Xing, his face was also stuck against the soft and delicate face of the girl. Her body had a hint of fresh fragrance, and her petite body was extremely soft and fragrant. Hugging her was like hugging a lumpy, boneless lump of cotton. To top it off, it was a really tough cotton. Particularly the part where both of his legs were clinging tightly around her full, round, and perky ass. The surprisingly bouncy ass immediately turned him on. Zhou Weiqing could also vaguely feel a sense of energy in Meng Xing\u2019s body that seems to harmonize with his own energy.</p><br/><p>Surrounded by the chilly cold peaks, the light gradually turned darker and darker as their bodies fell. Meng Xing was dying to give this perverted guy a good slap in the face. However, she could clearly feel his heartbeat rising through his body as if he was truly afraid. Her heart softened as she sighed secretly. \u2018This guy is still at the Fifth Jewel level after all. Although he\u2019s talented in the consolidating aspect, his cultivation base is still only at the Zun Tier. I guess it\u2019s pretty normal for a person to be scared if they suddenly jump off a cliff. Since we are already in a situation like this, I might as well let it be for now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was extremely smart. He did not continue to do anything else that would arouse Meng Xing\u2019s suspicion. However, there was something in particular that was making her face red with embarrassment. She felt something hot and fiery on her abdomen twitching uncontrollably as they fell.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that she was already 29 years old, Zhou Weiqing was the first man that she had ever gotten physically close to since she was young.</p><br/><p>Within the time it took twenty breaths, the surrounding light became completely bleak. Zhou Weiqing could feel the falling speed was decreasing, and in the next moment, they had already landed on the ground with their feet.</p><br/><p>He had no idea why but the moment they touched the ground, a sense of chilliness enveloped his body. It was natural for the temperature here to be much colder than the temperature at the top but with his body physique, he should have not been affected by the temperature at all.</p><br/><p>Instinctively, Zhou Weiqing raised his head, and his eyes met with a pair of extremely peculiar gaze.</p><br/><p>The mouths on the four elders\u2019 faces opened so wide that they could practically fit a dragon egg inside. Even the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was staring at him as his body went stiff. Nie Han\u2019s face contorted strangely as he held in his laughter. Even then, he did not dare to laugh out loud. These people were now standing by his and Meng Xing\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Of course! A sturdy man clinging onto a beauty and in an octopus-like manner on top of that! One could easily imagine how strange the scene was. Not only that, the person that he was clinging to was none other than Meng Xing, the head of the three honored Great God Tier Masters of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhm\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing sounded out awkwardly. Slowly, he put his feet back on the ground as he slowly detached himself from Meng Xing. He could even feel that the moment he released his tight embrace, the pair of bouncy flesh on her chest slowly bounced back into their original fullness. Of course, there was another thing that bounced up as well\u2026 A specific small thing that tented up in the area around his crotch.</p><br/><p>He quickly held his breath with all his might so that his face would turn red at once. Usually, with his thick-skinned personality, he did not mind being glared at by others\u2026</p><br/><p>Standing on the spot, Meng Xing was in a daze. The color of her delicate face was oscillating between red and white. The woman who had always been elegant and noble was now breathing rapidly as if she would explode in anger at any second\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cY-YOU \u2013\u201d As she lifted up her right hand, a terrifying surge of Heavenly Energy exploded out of Meng Xing\u2019s body. The power suppression made Zhou Weiqing took a few steps backward before falling on his butt on the ground.</p><br/><p>How powerful! Although he was faking his reaction, he could still clearly sense her power at this moment. It was far more powerful than he had expected.</p><br/><p>If she really did give him a hard slap, as a Heavenly Jewel Master with a Fifth Jewel cultivation base which he was supposed to be, he would probably be smacked into pieces, and none of his bone fractures would remain.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease show mercy!\u201d the four elders hurriedly said as they stepped forward. Such a young God Tier Master like Zhou Weiqing was extremely rare on the mainland.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing looked unconcerned as he noticed a few odd things. Although the four elders were asking her to show mercy, they did not seem to have any intention to stop her judging from their actions. Even worse, even the Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was just standing there quietly.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, Meng Xing\u2019s hand that lifted high into the air trembled for a moment before she slowly lowered it down to her side again. The pair of beautiful eyes that were staring at Zhou Weiqing looked like they were about to spit fire out at him. With an angry snort, she turned and started to walk towards the dark ends of the valley.</p><br/><p>The Palace Master of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace only shook his head helplessly. To Zhou Weiqing\u2019s surprise, he actually turned around and followed her. It looked like he was trying to tell her something through a sound transmission.</p><br/><p>The four Supreme Elders also let out a collective sigh of relief. Looking back at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face that was filled with terror, they were at a loss whether to laugh or cry. As they each gave another sigh, they flicked their sleeves before they proceeded to follow the two in front.</p><br/><p>God Tier Master Nie Han was the only one who walked forward and helped him off the ground. With a low voice, he whispered, \u201cWeiqing! How bold are you? You actually dare to take advantage of Meng Xing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied awkwardly, \u201cI thought she was pulling me down to commit suicide! I\u2019ve never tried jumping off a cliff before! I was just a little scared!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chuckling, Nie Han gave him an understanding look. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that all Heavenly King Tier masters can fly? Alright, just follow me! Don\u2019t you provoke her again, alright? Otherwise, if she were to really explode in anger, even the Palace Master will not be able to save you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhou Weiqing nodded his head obediently. Oh well, he had already taken advantage of her anyway.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

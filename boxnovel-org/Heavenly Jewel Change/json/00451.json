She had started following secretly behind Shangguan Fei\u2019er and the main Peerless Battalion troop. However, before they had travelled far, she suddenly sensed a terrifying Heavenly Energy pressure from behind.</p><br/><p>As such, she had turned back stealthily, seeing Zhou Weiqing who had remained behind, as well as the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and his friend Duan Tianlang.</p><br/><p>Towards Duan Tianlang, she was unable to read into him. However, when Long Shiya started healing Duan Tianlang and dragging him back from verge of death, the sheer power he unleashed caused her to be in shock. She had never expected that such a powerhouse would be at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side. She could clearly tell that this fat middle aged man was at the same level as her father and big uncle\u2026 that was a Heavenly Emperor! Such a powerhouse\u2026 even in the entire Boundless Mainland, one could count the total number with their two hands. Seeing the respect Zhou Weiqing had for the fat man, it was clear their relationship was not simple.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er immediately decided that she would have to ask her sister about this, as Fei\u2019er would likely know who that was.</p><br/><p>As such, after the travel, she had sneaked into the army camp. Who knew that before she could even find Fei\u2019er and ask her about Long Shiya, she instead saw Zhou Weiqing and her sister being intimate, hearing the conversation between the two. The worst fear of Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s had been realised indeed.</p><br/><p>Looking on at them, she couldn\u2019t help but blush deeply as her heart raced, and she immediately gave a cold humph. At that moment, she suddenly felt a terrifying aura in the area, and she did not hesitate to flee the army camp immediately. That was the reason why Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not discover her.</p><br/><p>Where that pressure had come from, Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not know. She had been using the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace\u2019s secret arts to barely hide her presence, but she knew that if she continued staying there, the Heavenly Emperor powerhouse would definitely be able to detect her. Although she was confident in her own abilities, when it came to the level of Heavenly Emperor, she would not have the slightest chance.</p><br/><p>What do I do? All of a sudden, Shangguan Xue\u2019er felt at a loss. She was getting a headache from the relationship between Zhou Weiqing and her sisters. However, she could understand Fei\u2019er\u2019s feelings\u2026 for Zhou Weiqing to be able to depend on his own strength to develop and grow in the northern border to such a degree, with his own personal strength, he definitely had something that attracted her sister. Otherwise, with Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s character, how could she possibly let him take advantage of her so easily.</p><br/><p>This will not do\u2026 no matter what, I have to bring Second Sis back. This Zhou Little Fatty is Third Sis\u2019 man\u2026 how can I allow him and Second Sis to have intimate relations?</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er immediately set her resolve inwardly. However, she knew that she would not be able to continuously sneak in so easily, as that Heavenly Emperor powerhouse would eventually sense her. As such, she could only depend on regular channels to meet up with Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er.Hmph, Zhou Weiqing, you rotten egg! Having one of my sisters isn\u2019t enough for you, you dare to provoke my second sis as well! Also\u2026 there is still that little tigress of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, there is clearly something between them as well. This time, if you do not give an accounting, I will not let you go so easily.</p><br/><p>Lost in her thoughts, Shangguan Fei\u2019er subconsciously gripped her fists tightly, her heart filled with anger and detest for Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not know how much wine he had drank; all he remembered was many of his soldiers coming to toast him. By the time he woke up in the morning from the drunken stupor, the sun had already long risen and light had already flooded the tent, the comfortable warmth leaving him in a lazy languor.</p><br/><p>Hangovers were undoubtedly a painful experience for ordinary people, but for powerhouses like Zhou Weiqing, it was nothing. His physique was far beyond any ordinary person, and alcohol would not have any harmful effects on him.</p><br/><p>Stretching lazily, Zhou Weiqing clambered off his bed. Although he did not succeed in being intimate with Shangguan Fei\u2019er last night, the drink was still extremely comfortable. Shouting and cheering together with his men, that was indeed an enjoyable feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cReport! Battalion Commander, are you awake yet?\u201d An urgent voice abruptly came from outside his tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn? Come in.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said questioningly.</p><br/><p>The tent flap raised, and one of the Peerless Battalion soldiers entered. \u201cBattalion Commander, please hurry, something happened\u2026 Green Wolf is dying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d Only then did the lazy satisfied feeling that Zhou Weiqing was in evaporated. \u201cWhat happened?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The soldier replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the other Regiment soldiers. This morning, nobody knows why but the Sixteenth Regiment Regiment Commander Shen Bu personally led men over here\u2026 After that, a fight broke out, and Green Wolf was beaten up by two of the enemy Battalion Commanders working together\u2026 it looks like he won\u2019t last long. The brothers are all angry, and we are at a standoff with the Sixteenth Regiment men.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHMPH! They\u2019re asking for death!\u201d Zhou Weiqing howled in rage, charging out of the tent in a flash. He had spent so much time, effort and money in cultivating these Peerless Battalion warriors, and now that they had a modicum of success and were on the right path, such a thing had happened. Green Wolf had reached the Seven-Jeweled cultivation level, and amongst their Physical Jewel Masters, he was one of the top few. Even amongst all the Company Leaders, he was around the top few of the ranking.</p><br/><p>At time, Zhou Weiqing could be very generous, but there were some areas where he was definitely extremely stingy. In his eyes, each and every single person in the Peerless Battalion was extremely important to him, his brothers, and also his greatest hope for reviving his Heavenly Bow Empire. His protective instinct towards them was extremely strong, and hearing that one of his brothers had almost been killed, how could he not be anxious?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not even need to ask for directions, instantly sensing where there was a large gathering of people as he dashed towards that area. As he had expected, besides those Peerless Battalion soldiers who were still sleeping from the drinking last night, there were at least five hundred men gathered there, the tension in the atmosphere clear as both sides seemed ready to fight; Zhou Weiqing could sense that much even from such a distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Let me pass.\u201d Zhou Weiqing shouted out loud, instantly drawing the gazes from all those present. Immediately, the group parted, allowing him a passageway through.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing strode quickly through the ranks, reaching the front in a blink.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the sentiments of the Peerless Battalion soldiers were all roused up in anger, indignation, sheer rage\u2026 As soon as they saw Zhou Weiqing, an uproar rose up as they all started talking at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cBattalion Commander, you must help us get an accounting for this! Those Sixteenth Regiment fellows beat up many of our brothers just because they outnumbered them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Battalion Commander, give the order! Let\u2019s kill all these bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>These soldiers of the Peerless Battalion were after all originally ruffians and rogues, and fighting and creating disturbances was one of the most common things they did to be sent to the Ruffian Battalion. Just because their opponent\u2019s Regiment Commander had come didn\u2019t mean they would be afraid or step back\u2026 if not for Wei Feng and the other Company Leaders holding them back, perhaps they would have swarmed over the Sixteenth Regiment men by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone shut up! I will get an accounting for us all!\u201d Zhou Weiqing yelled angrily.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the soldiers of the Peerless Battalion fell into silence. In the entire Peerless Battalion, Zhou Weiqing had absolute authority. Not just because of the various \u2018profit\u2019 he brought to them, or the respect and love they had for him, but also because of his own sheer personal strength. In the battlefield, he was always in the thick of the fight, fighting the strongest of the enemies. Although the Peerless Battalion soldiers might not have the best characters, they were all truly respectful and held much admiration for this young Battalion Commander of theirs.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing moved to the front, and Wei Feng immediately stepped forward to receive him. He breathed a sigh of relief on seeing Zhou Weiqing, and said: \u201cBattalion Commander, you are finally here. If you had not come soon, things would have gone out of hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said solemnly: \u201cVice Commander Wei, what is going on?\u201d He turned to look at the Peerless Battalion soldiers, who still had the stink of alcohol about them, but each and every one of them were enraged. Most of them had their weapons out, looking as if they would attack at any moment if they did not get an answer.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Shen Bu\u2019s expression was extremely unfriendly as well. Behind her, all ten of the Battalion Commanders from the Sixteenth Regiment were here as well, the feathers in their caps showing their identity. Behind them, there were at least five hundred men, likely Shen Bu\u2019s personal guards and the elites of the Sixteenth Regiment.</p><br/><p>Wei Feng stepped closer to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s side and said in a low tone that only he could hear. \u201cLast night, we threw the rubbish back to the Sixteenth Regiment, and when they discovered in this morning, they came looking for trouble. At first, it was just those Heavy Cavalry soldiers who we took care off last time, and when after some heated words were exchanged, a fight broke out. Our brothers followed your orders; since others have come to our territory, they beat them up\u2026 and most of them were injured. Still, they still kept their reason about them and held back, and there should be no heavy injuries. After that, some of their Battalion Commanders brought men over to continue looking for trouble. Most of our brothers were still semi drunk from the night before, and once again a fight broke out. By the time I arrived, it was too late, and Green Wolf was already severely injured. I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing glanced to the side and saw Green Wolf, who lay there on the verge of death, barely gasping for breath from the caved in chest, blood welling out from all around the chest area.</p><br/><p>As that picture entered his sight, Zhou Weiqing felt a rush of hot blood gushing to his brain, and his breathing growing heavy with rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Weiqing, you better give me an accounting today, otherwise we will bring it up to the military court.\u201d As soon as Shen Bu saw that Zhou Weiqing had arrived, she immediately yelled at him in a rage.</p><br/><p>Wei Feng\u2019s words had been simple, but in truth, two entire Companies of Heavy Calvary soldiers had come from the Sixteenth Regiment earlier. Although they were not fully geared, they still thought highly of themselves and their fighting capabilities, and came looking for trouble just like that. Of course, they had not expected that all these Peerless Battalion soldiers had been drilled for months by Shangguan Fei\u2019er, and as the two sides clashed, it was definitely not them who suffered the disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Two entire Companies of Heavy Cavalry soldiers were all beaten back, with more than a third suffering from broken bones or fractures. Since when had the Sixteenth Regiment taken such a loss, and the Battalion Commanders sent word to Shen Bu before rushing down with their men. However, they had not taken the advantage at the same time, as the ruffians of the Peerless Battalion were just too savage\u2026 when they fought, it was as if they did not care for their lives. Although Green Wolf was mortally wounded, he had also broken both arms of the two Battalion Commanders he had been fighting. If not for the fact that the other Company Leaders of the Peerless Battalion had not come in time, perhaps the outcome of the fight would be very different.</p><br/><p>It had been the simultaneous arrival of Shen Bu and Wei Feng that had finally caused the fighting to halt and the situation to stabilize relatively into the current stalemate.</p>\n</div>"}

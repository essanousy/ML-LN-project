There was a hint of bitterness on his face, and his eyes looked unwilling; he knew he had lost. He had lost so badly that all hope was lost for him to recover.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya was right. He had lost all confidence, was careless, and had really underestimated the Six Ultimate Heavenly God.</p><br/><p>Although the Destruction Attribute was powerful, it did not represent everything. Long Shiya had already made a name for himself and also possessed six attributes. He would not have been easy to deal with.</p><br/><p>When the second battle between the two began, Long Shiya was at a disadvantage. However, this was part of his plan. Even the results of their first battle had already been foreseen by the Six Ultimate Heavenly God.</p><br/><p>Many powerhouses were present but there were not many that could compare with Long Shiya when it came to combat experience. The Six Ultimate Heavenly God did not come from any Saint Land. He arrived at this point with his own effort. The hardships he went through could only be imagined. It could be said that it was because he had survived countless life and death battles before he reached the Heavenly Emperor Tier. It was an achievement he obtained by crawling back from the brink of death numerous times. This was also one of the important reasons why Xue Ao\u2019tian had always admired Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Long Shiya\u2019s cultivation base was not the strongest. However, he would not make any mistakes on the battlefield. His sinister self-mocking nature was related to Zhou Weiqing. After spending a long time with his baby apprentice, he also learned something from Zhou Weiqing. For instance, layout.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya and Shen Mo were both powerhouses at the Heavenly God Tier. However, in comparison to Long Shiya, even though Shen Mo had the Destruction Attribute, his foundation was very poor. How long had Long Shiya been at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Emperor Tier? He had tempered his Divine Though to an incomparable purity long ago. On top of that, he needed to constantly control his various attributes in his battles. Although the first battle had not consumed a lot of his Divine Thought, it was far from being as powerful as it looked. Even his body swaying in the air was intentionally done to confuse Shen Mo.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya had understood for a long time. He knew that he would not be the one deciding the outcome of today\u2019s battle. However, he had set his own objective \u2013 he wanted to obtain a personal victory. This objective was set the moment Shen Mo appeared.</p><br/><p>Later, when he and Shen Mo returned to the camps of their respective sides to recuperate. Without even considering Long Shiya\u2019s recovery speed, Zhou Weiqing had secretly sent in a stream of Saint Energy into his teacher\u2019s body. This helped him recover his Divine Thought.</p><br/><p>That was the reason why Long Shiya went up to fight Shen Mo for the second time \u2013 his Divine Thought had already recovered completely. Even if he fought against Shen Mo doggedly, the chances of him winning were higher. However, if he did fight doggedly, exactly like he thought he would, both sides would suffer. Long Shiya was not afraid of this. However, the war was not his only battle! He had to keep his body strong so that he could help his apprentice.</p><br/><p>Hence, at the start of the second battle, Long Shiya performed as Shen Mo expected. He was actually saving his energy and waiting for an opportunity.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s engagement in a furious fight in the sky with Fen Tian had reignited the battle here, giving rise to the first opportunity. However, Shen Mo had not completely lowered his vigilance at that time. So, Long Shiya continued to wait patiently. It was his patience that eventually made Shen Mo less vigilant. When the second opportunity presented itself, Long Shiya acted.</p><br/><p>The small six-colored halo should not be underestimated. Long Shiya spared no effort in launching his best, and this could even be considered the most powerful attack he had ever used in his life.</p><br/><p>The six attributes formed two rings of light with different ratios. When they fused together, the power greatly surpassed the first level of the Heavenly God Tier. More importantly, Long Shiya had thrown in all the Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing gave him so that Shen Mo would not have a chance for a comeback.</p><br/><p>With the combined might of the Saint Energy and Six Ultimate Heavenly God, Shen Mo\u2019s Destruction Attribute was unable to fight back. The six-colored halo struck him in the middle of his chest, separating Shen Mo from his Heavenly God Tier Heavenly Core Nucleus. On top of that, it destroyed everything in his body and turned it into nothing.</p><br/><p>Puff!</p><br/><p>Shen Mo spewed black blood from his mouth. At the same time, a bloody beam of light struck out twice from his chest. The six-colored halo quickly supplanted the bloody beam of light, and the pitch black Heavenly Core Nucleus popped out right into Long Shiya\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Shen Mo\u2019s pupils gradually dilated. His entire body shook violently in the air before he fell to the ground. He did not even have the opportunity to blow himself up. However, no matter how unwilling he was, facts could not be changed. His corpse had turned into ash, disappearing before it even reached the ground. Without the defense of the Destruction Heavenly Core Nucleus, his body was prone to the six attribute attack.</p><br/><p>In the air, Long Shiya gasped as he took in large breaths. He had paid a tremendous price for his best attack. At the very least, for the time being, he was unable to use the strength of a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse.</p><br/><p>He then looked at the other side, at Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian\u2019s battle. At this point, their battle resembled a raging fire.</p><br/><p>It was indeed a confusing battle \u2013 each clash gave off a large distorted circle of light. The Demon God Zhou Weiqing transformed into obviously had the upper hand, especially in terms of power. He had completely suppressed the Destruction God. However, the Destruction God that Fen Tian transformed into was extremely tough. It continued to stand firm under the tyrannical attacks of the Demon God. The battle between the two had hit a thrilling climax.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya shook his head lightly and secretly sighed. He knew he was unable to intervene in a duel of this level. Even if he were to rush in, he would only cause trouble for Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>After adjusting himself a little, with the help of the Natural Divine Territory in the vicinity, he had recovered some Heavenly strength. He headed for the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain before charging down to join the battle between the two sides, where he could best make use of his ability.</p><br/><p>Following the end of Long Shiya\u2019s battle, it would seem as though the scales of victory were turning in favor of the Peerless Sect, the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and Heavenly Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Expanse Palace aside, the battle here had lasted the longest. However, when Long Shiya joined the battle, the situation changed once again.</p><br/><p>Although there were many powerhouses amongst the Red Blood Hell and Love Valley, there were now three Heavenly God powerhouses at the Peerless Sect and Heavenly Snow Mountain\u2019s side, such as Dongfang Hanyue \u2013 the killing machine. Although the offensive onslaught had slowed down, the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear would show results every time it was used.</p><br/><p>Xue Ao\u2019tian\u2019s strength and importance were mainly reflected in his assistance. After rushing into attacks in tandem with Dongfang Hanyue for a while, he began to calm down. The Heavenly Snow Mountain they were affiliated with had suffered damages too quickly. If they continued to fight the same way, there would not be many left in the Heavenly Snow Mountain even if they had won in the end.</p><br/><p>That was why Xue Ao\u2019tian changed his tactics to providing support instead. He used his powerful strength to continuously utilize each and every situation to support the powerhouses on his side. With his help, their ability to survive on the battlefield became stronger, regardless of whether it was the Heavenly Snow Mountain powerhouses or the Peerless Sect powerhouses.</p><br/><p>Aside from Dongfang Hanyue, the strongest on the battlefield that inflicted the most casualties were the three Shangguan sisters. The three sisters formed a triangular formation; Shangguan Xue\u2019er was at the main point while Shangguan Fei\u2019er and Shangguan Bing\u2019er guarded both sides to maximize the effect of Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s attacks. At least a dozen enemies perished in their hands. The remaining half of the Saint Nucleus Core resulted in them being completely unafraid of the enemies\u2019 Destruction Attribute.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Snow Mountain had lost about twenty men. As for the Peerless Sect, they had very few people left. Only the Heavenly Kings that were previously from the Heavenly Demon Sect King Tier succumbed to two fatalities and an injury. On the other hand, the number of Blood Red Hell and Love Valley powerhouses had dropped drastically to about three hundred people. If this continued, it would be really hard to determine the winner.</p><br/><p>The reason why the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect\u2019s losses were so minimal was thanks to the Blackfiend Dragon, along with Dongfang Hanyue. Although the Heavenly Snow Mountain had a large area at its summit, the area was still limited as a residential space. The Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s arrival would immediately occupy a large area. This made it impossible for the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley to unleash their full power. At the same time, the battles were only fought in a small area. Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s attacks with the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear was so powerful that when it struck, very few of the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley powerhouses would still dare to take her on.</p><br/><p>However, after fighting for a short duration of time, the entire Heavenly Snow Mountain had been reduced to two-thirds of its original height. This was because of the Heavenly King and Heavenly Emperor powerhouses. The destructive power from their clashes was too formidable.</p><br/><p>Although Xue Ao\u2019tian was distressed, there was nothing he could do.</p><br/><p>In the sky, the battle between the elves and the two huge dragons had also reached a critical juncture.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, they had sensed a crisis. The two dragons \u2013 the couple Hui Yao and Duo Si, suddenly began a seemingly suicidal attack.</p><br/><p>Their intense dark red flame turned nearly a third of the Natural Divine Territory into a shade of dark red. The two dragons roared and their huge bodies gathered with a huge dark red light forming around themselves. The Natural Divine Territory even expanded because of the sudden eruption.</p><br/><p>The Elven Empress\u2019s transformed goddess-like expression suddenly took a more serious look. She knew what the dragon couple was doing. She put both hands in front of her, circling her body, and the Natural Divine Territory then opened up like a mouth, spitting Hui Yao and Duo Si out. Immediately after that, the enormous amount of energy from the Natural Divine Territory that was full of life aura converged toward the goddess. This included the energy released by the twelve Elven Elders.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

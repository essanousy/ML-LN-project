Furthermore, with a Heavenly God Stage Sidhe Queen by his side, he had nothing to fear - safety-wise.\u00a0</p><br/><p>However, the situation before his eyes had left him entirely stunned. Apart from the fact that the Sidhe Queen was lying on top of him without any clothes, just his physical changes alone were enough to give him a big shock.</p><br/><p>Although it was indeed a huge battle, it seemed impossible for his cultivation base to make that big a leap within such a short period of time! This could only prove one thing - his body and cultivation base made great improvements because of the Sidhe Queen\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was not too bothered with advancing his cultivation base; by relying on the Saint Energy, he did not have much bottlenecks, so to speak.\u00a0As long as he continued cultivating or using the Astral Feedback to advance, it was only a matter of time before he entered the Heavenly God Stage. However, it was different when it came to the evolution of the body.</p><br/><p>He knew his own body best - naturally, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that his Dragon-Tiger Bloodline had completely entered a whole different level - not only did his Dragon Emperor Bloodline fuse thoroughly with his Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline, making them one whole entity, it also perfectly amalgamated some of the Demon God Energy that came from summoning the Demon God. This was no longer a simple Dragon-Tiger Transformation, but a\u00a0Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation.</p><br/><p>Such an evolution had caused Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body to enter directly into the Heavenly God Stage, and his bloodline was superior to all presently known ones within the Heavenly God Stage - one could imagine how powerful it was, not forgetting his High Level Heavenly Emperor Stage Saint Energy that allowed him to be able to match any Heavenly God Stage powerhouses in strength. Even though he had helped the Sidhe Tribe a great deal and even rescued the Sidhe Princess, it seemed that he had benefited a lot more from this whole episode in comparison.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Even though Zhou Weiqing was very confident of himself, he did not think that the Sidhe Queen would develop any amorous feelings for him because of his looks and ended up sleeping with him.\u00a0That was entirely impossible. However, what exactly did she do for him?</p><br/><p>After pondering for some time, Zhou Weiqing gradually calmed down. Squatting in front of the Sidhe Queen, he activated his will to scan her current physical condition.</p><br/><p>That scan was unimportant, but Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but gasp in horror. The Sidhe Queen had truly fallen into a coma, and it was due to her own weakness.\u00a0</p><br/><p>She did not suffer any injuries on her body, but the massive and almost boundless Life Energy that she once possessed had become very weak, and could be cut off at any moment.\u00a0</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing had immediately understood. He had always been an intelligent person - in a situation as such, how was it possible for him to be unable to piece everything together? Without a doubt, the Sidhe Queen must have used some sort of special secret technique to treat his injuries within the shortest possible time, resulting in her current weak physical condition.</p><br/><p>No wonder he made such a huge advancement. Seeing as it could render a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse such as the Sidhe Queen that weak, one was able to see how strong the secret technique was. Despite the fact that Zhou Weiqing was oblivious to the importance of the Sidhe Heart to the Sidhe Tribe, he could confirm that the Sidhe Queen must have used her most precious ability to save him.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Scratching his head, Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but feel a little embarrassed. Originally, he simply wanted to curry favor with her, but who knew that he went overboard to the extent that she repaid him much more than what he did for her. How would he still be able to request for her blood! He did not notice the small bottle in the Sidhe Queen\u2019s hand. If she did not vomit that mouthful of blood, the Sidhe Queen would not have become that weak.\u00a0</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was restored under the help of her Life Saint Energy, his Saint Energy automatically rejected her presence, forcing her out. Hence, the Sidhe Queen was unable to tolerate any longer. Additionally, she had already planned to gift Zhou Weiqing her blood. That mouthful of precious blood of the Sidhe Queen had immediately caused her to enter the weakest state she had ever been in.\u00a0</p><br/><p><em>No way, I definitely cannot return like this.</em> If he brought the Sidhe Queen back in her current condition, coupled with the fact that he was unaware of where she had hidden the Sidhe Princess, the sidhe would definitely fight him to the death.</p><br/><p><em>Alright, since you have given me your energy, let me give you some too.</em> Zhou Weiqing helplessly forced a smile. Of course, while he harbored certain naughty thoughts about removing his clothes and placing her on his lower body like before, they were nothing but thoughts that would not be put into action. Nobody would dare to say that they have zero evil thoughts from time to time.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Sitting cross-legged, Zhou Weiqing gently clapped his hands in the air. Two rays of light glistened at the same time - the mauve light transformed into Demonic Dragon Lady, and the black light transformed into Hell\u2019s Angel. They were Zhou Weiqing\u2019s two most frequently used abilities for the longest time. Zhou Weiqing required quite a bit of time to administer treatment for the Sidhe Queen, hence he needed guardians to keep watch out of fear of external disturbances. Based on his current cultivation base, the Demonic Dragon Lady and Hell\u2019s Angel that he summoned were definitely stronger than his living cultivation base.</p><br/><p>A ball of reddish golden light slowly lit up on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest - that was the light of the Astral Saint Core Nucleus. However, even though the light was reddish golden, the center of the Astral Saint Core Nucleus was presented in a purer shade of white gold.</p><br/><p>The only difference between now and the previous time, when he had to deliberately activate it, was that the sky had immediately darkened the moment the power of the Astral Saint Core Nucleus was emitted, causing specks of starlight to come into view. Dense Creation Energy filled the sky. The atmospheric energy within the air was almost immediately absorbed by those Creation Energy. Under the starlight, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body had also become permeable. His entire being had an increased sense of divinity. \u00a0</p><br/><p>To put it accurately, his summoning of the nebula had not reached the level of Celestial Territory yet, as he still did not have full control over it. Even so, its effects were already stronger than most Celestial Territories. This was the absolute advantage in terms of hierarchy. How many possessed the ability to be on the same level as Creation Energy?\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Astral Saint Core Nucleus on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest had suddenly become benign. Immediately after, a ray of light had already shot straight up into the sky - it was the Heavenly Core Nucleus of the man in black, who he killed earlier.\u00a0</p><br/><p>It was the Heavenly Core Nucleus of a High Level Heavenly Emperor, who happened to possess Saint Attribute - how could Zhou Weiqing bear to waste it?\u00a0</p><br/><p>Even though he was already extremely weak at that point in time, the first thing he did was to retain the Heavenly Core Nucleus, keeping it within his Astral Saint Core Nucleus.\u00a0He was preparing to absorb it using the Astral Feedback once he had recovered. Currently, he clearly did not plan to absorb it for himself.\u00a0</p><br/><p>The brilliant starlight had already feedbacked in the next moment. This time, Zhou Weiqing did not immerse himself within it. Instead, he extended his right hand and the starlight came together to form a beam of light. Following his lead, it gradually shone on the Sidhe Queen\u2019s chest. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s other hand lightly pressed against the air, and the gentle Nebula Saint Energy formed a vortex that was half a foot in diameter, spinning above the Sidhe Queen\u2019s chest, slowly absorbing the Astral Feedback Energy that appeared out of the blue. Thereafter, it was transformed into a gentle and pure Saint Energy that was channeled into the Sidhe Queen\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Even though the Sidhe Queen was not equipped with Saint Energy, her body was the purest thing that he had ever seen in his entire life. Her body had been refined by Nature Energy since she was a child. As she grew up in the baptism of the Nature Goddess, the Sidhe Queen had the purest body. Fortunately, Zhou Weiqing did not engage in any immoral acts against her, or else, if her purity was further tarnished in her current weak condition, the Sidhe Queen would truly perish and die.\u00a0</p><br/><p>The gentle Saint Energy, coupled with Creation aura slowly flowed into the Sidhe Queen\u2019s body, replenishing her weak Life Energy.</p><br/><p>Creation encompassed creation of life. Since the Sidhe Queen was able to rely on the Sidhe Heart to mobilize Life Creation Energy, her ability to accept the Saint Energy would be a lot higher than ordinary people. Furthermore, under the deliberate control of Zhou Weiqing, after the Saint Energy entered the Sidhe Queen\u2019s body, it would automatically be transformed into immense life aura, compensating for the massive loss.\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Astral Feedback Energy brought about by a High Level Heavenly Emperor was rather massive. However, to a Heavenly God such as the Sidhe Queen, it was still insufficient.\u00a0Very quickly, the Astral Feedback Energy was already nearly fully exhausted. However, this would not affect the treatment that Zhou Weiqing was currently administering for her.</p><br/><p>The reddish golden astral light with faint white gold in its center directly spurted from the Astral Saint Core Nucleus within Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest, filling up the area where the Astral Feedback Energy used to be. He was channeling his purest Saint Energy into the Sidhe Queen.</p><br/><p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing did not hold back in his attempt to treat the Sidhe Queen. Saint Energy was extremely beneficial to all living things. Even if Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy was unable to reach the level of the actual Creation Energy, it still came rather close to it. The Attribute of Saint Energy was all-inclusive, hence, it brought about great advantages for people of any type of Attributes. Even for ordinary humans who weren\u2019t Heavenly Jewel Masters, Saint Energy could bring about longevity.\u00a0</p><br/><p>As for cultivators, it had a much greater effect. In fact, the higher one\u2019s cultivation base was, the greater the benefits would be. To put it simply, after Zhou Weiqing injects a Max Level Heavenly Emperor with Saint Energy, the latter might be able to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage. Take the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor for example - he was in secluded meditation within the Heavenly Bow Empire. With the help of the Saint Energy of his precious disciple, the bottleneck that he had been facing for more than ten years started loosening up.\u00a0</p><br/><p>When cultivators reached the Heavenly God Stage, not only would they be able to comprehend heaven and earth, they would also be able to grasp them, becoming true masters within their Celestial Territory.</p><br/><p>The concrete details of the benefits that Heavenly God Stage powerhouses enjoyed upon receiving Saint Energy could not be easily described, as the benefits were all-rounded, including bringing about an incomparable advantage for Heavenly Gods when it came to comprehending more profound meanings beyond heaven and earth.\u00a0</p><br/>\n</div>"}

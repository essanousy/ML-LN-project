Yet, that certain somebody kept pushing with the topic with his own ideals, \u201cCreating a parallel realm of our own is pretty good. With just our family in it, we could live primitive lives. For instance, we could all be nude, use the sky as a blanket and the ground as our bed. Nobody would see us anyway. Let\u2019s all sleep together under one blanket. This is my dream!\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to his words, all five of them had different expressions on their faces. Speechless, Tian\u2019er said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how shameless some people can be!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er, on the other hand, was so embarrassed that she could not even utter a word. Little Witch was chuckling with her hand over her mouth by the side, while Shangguan Xue\u2019er, at the other side, glared at Zhou Weiqing fiercely.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was Shangguan Fei\u2019er who came up with a conclusion. After exchanging looks with the other four girls, she looked at Zhou Weiqing with a smile before saying, \u201cGet him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like that, the five women instantly turned into feline predators and leaped towards a certain somebody.</p><br/><p>That somebody\u2019s response was extremely simple. With his hands clasped above his head, he crouched down and balled up his body, showing a look of resignation as he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t hit my handsome face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps the powerful strength that Zhou Weiqing displayed was too surprising, as even Shangguan Xue\u2019er who was initially very worried had now felt at ease. No matter what, with Zhou Weiqing and their cultivation bases, even if they weren\u2019t able to get their hands on the Elven Queen\u2019s blood, they could at least still flee from the scene without complications. On top of that, Zhou Weiqing had agreed that he would not hurt any of the Elf Tribe\u2019s clansmen at all.</p><br/><p>As the six of them were laughing and having fun, a clear loud voice suddenly resonated in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you guys? Why haven\u2019t I seen you guys before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this voice, the six of them were in a state of shock. It was because they did not notice the arrival of whose voice it belonged to.</p><br/><p>Automatically, the six of them turned and looked towards the direction of the voice. On top of a big tree not far from them, sat a very clean-looking, fair little girl.</p><br/><p>The little girl appeared to be very young, about six to seven years old. Her pink face was flushed and dewy, looking entirely succulent. A curious look could be seen in her bright huge eyes. Long powder-blue hair cascaded behind her shoulders, with two pointy little ears protruding out from her hair.</p><br/><p>What struck them as most peculiar was the pair of transparent wings behind her back.</p><br/><p>Seeing her, let alone Zhou Weiqing\u2019s five women, even Zhou Weiqing himself had the urge to go up to her for a hug and a kiss. This little girl was simply just too cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this an Elf?\u201d Zhou Weiqing whispered as he asked Shangguan Xue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>The coldness on Xue\u2019er\u2019s face had already vanished without a trace. Right now, she was looking at the little girl with extreme gentleness in her eyes. Gently nodding her head, she replied, \u201cThe Elves are actually very kind. They\u2019re beautiful and they have a long lifespan too. She may look very young but she is most likely much older than us all. An Elf would only reach their adulthood when they hit 100 years old, which is equivalent to our 18 years of human age.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing an Elf for the first time, not to mention such a lovely one, made Zhou Weiqing much fonder toward this tribe even more. With a smile, he said to the little elf, \u201cHey little girl, we\u2019re Elves too!\u201d</p><br/><p>With her head tilted, she stared at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cYou\u2019re a liar! We Elves have wings! You don\u2019t have any!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cWho says that I don\u2019t have any? I just hide them away. See?\u201d As he spoke, he bent his body forward and at once, a huge pair of wings spread out behind him. It was the Dragon-Tiger Transformation\u2019s wings.</p><br/><p>The moment she saw the wings on his back, the little Elf gaped with her mouth wide, \u201cWhoa! Your wings are so huge! And it\u2019s even more beautiful than mine! What are those purple lines on them for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing took a few steps forward before quickly sitting on the tree branch in a flash. The little Elf was not afraid; she did not even flinch. Spreading his wings out in front of her, he said, \u201cGo on, touch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Curiously, the little Elf pinched his wings before turning her head again to look at his ears, \u201cBut you don\u2019t have any pointy ears!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled again. He squeezed his ears and pulled up his ears at once, making them sharp and pointy in an instant. With his abilities, it was easy for him to make physical changes in his body.</p><br/><p>The Elf stared blankly at him, \u201cAh, could it be that\u2026 Are you a mutated Elf? But, mummy told me there haven\u2019t been any mutated Elves for many years now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the tree, Shangguan Fei\u2019er had her arms over Tian\u2019er\u2019s shoulders as she whispered, \u201cThis bastard Little Fatty! Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s trying to go for this little girl now instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er burst out laughing in an instant, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d be that nasty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The five girls laughed out loud at once. Right at this time, they heard Zhou Weiqing who was sitting on the tree telling the little Elf, \u201cLittle girl, you\u2019re so beautiful! Will you marry my son later in the future? I\u2019ll give you some candies!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little Elf\u2019s eyes lit up at once, \u201cCandies? Human\u2019s candies? Oh yes, that\u2019s great!\u201d</p><br/><p>The five girls who were still laughing at him were immediately horrified by the turn of events. The three Shangguan sisters and Little Witch could not help but had their glances land on Tian\u2019er\u2019s tummy immediately.</p><br/><p>At a loss for expressing herself, Tian\u2019er shouted out angrily at Zhou Weiqing who was still sitting on the tree, \u201cYou bastard! We don\u2019t even know whether the baby is a boy or girl yet, alright? How can you get a girlfriend for him so fast? Do you want him to become like you in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cWell, this is what we mean by \u2018repairing the house before it rains\u2019. Isn\u2019t it extremely normal for a father to find a wife for his son? It isn\u2019t that hard for me to \u2018work\u2019 a little harder and get a few sons, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, he really liked this little girl in front of him. This little girl gave him a feeling of being completely at one with nature. Not only that, there seemed to be not even an ounce of negativity in her emotions. She was indeed a very pure little girl. Adding on to the fact that she was already so beautiful at such a young age, he was sure that she would definitely grow up to become a gorgeous beauty in the future. As the saying goes, \u2018it\u2019s better to keep the goods within the family\u2019. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to keep this particular \u2018goodie\u2019 for his son instead?</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was teasing the little girl with a delighted heart, all of a sudden, a strangely distorted halo appeared right above the little girl without warning.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, with a \u2018whoosh\u2019, the little girl was sucked into the distorted light \u2013 just like that.</p><br/><p>Everything happened in just a blink of an eye. Even Zhou Weiqing could not react in time as he had his guard down at that very moment.</p><br/><p>When the distorted halo appeared just now, he actually thought that this was the energy ripple that was being emitted out of the little girl herself. By the time it started to unleash its Suction Energy, it was already too late for him to do anything about it. All he could do was to just attach part of his Divine Thought onto her as she left.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d The five girls below whose motherly instincts were triggered and were just about to come up to the tree to have a chat with the little girl were stunned as well. Zhou Weiqing, on the hand, who was still on top of the tree immediately had a gloomy look on his face.</p><br/><p>The reason why he only had reacted now was because of the energy ripple earlier.</p><br/><p>The Elf Tribe was very good in Natural Element magic, Water, Fire, Earth, Wind, Light, and Darkness. These were all the elements that they mastered. However, the distorted halo was clearly from the Time Attribute. How could there be a Time Attribute energy in the Elven territory? On top of that, it had actually kidnapped the little girl. At the last moment when the little girl was being taken away, Zhou Weiqing could clearly see the look of horror on her face.</p><br/><p>Leaping down from the tree at once, he had a terribly horrified look on his face. After all, a person had just been kidnapped right in front of his watch. How could he not feel frustrated at all? Besides, he really did not wish for any danger to befall the girl at all.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to unleash his own power and search for the piece of his Divine Thought, the whole realm suddenly resonated with a crisp, loud sound of bell chimes.</p><br/><p>The silver bell-like chiming sound was very pleasant to the ears. However, at this moment, all of them could clearly feel that in this infinite realm, a violent natural element energy ripple suddenly erupted without warning. In the distance and in the vicinity, several hundreds of shadows rose to the sky at once. And, they only had one goal in mind: Zhou Weiqing and the gang.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-What has just happened?\u201d Xue\u2019er stared at Zhou Weiqing in shock.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied, \u201cThe little girl was kidnapped by a Time Attribute energy and it seems like the Elf Tribe had been alarmed now. Hold your horses, guys! Don\u2019t just fight back even if they appear to be hostile to us. Let\u2019s try to communicate with them first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as they were talking, hundreds of figures had descended from the sky while some of them still remained hovering in the air. The six of them were completely surrounded with no way of escape now.</p><br/><p>All these people were Elves. It was apparent that these Elves had a much larger body compared to that little Elf. Although they had a slightly smaller build compared to human beings, each of them was extremely good looking. The men were handsome and the women were beautiful. Unfortunately, right now, they were all completely filled with wrath. They looked like they could not wait to get their hands on Zhou Weiqing and his company to shred them alive.</p><br/><p>A male Elf who appeared to be much older glared at Zhou Weiqing and the girls with fury as he bawled, \u201cDespicable intruders! Hand Her Royal Highness Princess over now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer Royal Highness Princess?\u201d The moment they heard of such a title, the six of them immediately thought of the little girl that they had just met before. At once, horror dawned on their faces. They really meant no malice during this trip of theirs. It had never crossed their minds that the cute little girl just now was actually the Elven Princess. What upset them was the fact that they were now made into a scapegoat of the kidnapper who took the princess away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did not kidnap the Elven Princess. All six of us are here right before you. If it\u2019s really us who took her away, would we still be waiting for you to apprehend us right here?\u201d Zhou Weiqing tried his best to talk to them in a calmer tone.</p><br/><p>The male Elf fumed, \u201cYou intruders invaded our territory. So what good intentions could you possibly have coming here? Grab them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he finished his sentence, the several hundred Elves who were surrounding them immediately began to launch their attacks.</p><br/><p>Distinctly, multiple colors that represented the Natural Elements soared up into the air at once. The energy elements of nature instantly filled the entire atmosphere. From far, one could see a gigantic balloon-like halo forming right there. And now, Zhou Weiqing and the five girls were right in the middle of the colorful light orb.</p><br/><p>A powerful aura rose up at once, suppressing the six of them to the point that they started to feel difficulty in breathing.</p><br/><p>When the Elves had just arrived just now, Zhou Weiqing already did a quick scan on their cultivation bases and found that none of them had cultivation base of a Heavenly King Tier and above. Yet, the strength that had erupted when these Elves joined forces turned out to be surprisingly powerful. Even a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse\u2019s aura might not necessarily be stronger than theirs.</p><br/><p>They even went as far as to unite each of their attributes through the force of nature. Even if they were all of different attributes, they could still work seamlessly with each other. Perhaps it was only the Elf Tribe that could do such thing. Not only that, Zhou Weiqing could vaguely feel that this must have something to do with the Sealed Land of theirs. Over here, all Natural Elements were magnified and enhanced. The Elves themselves seemed to be part of the Natural Element, thus allowing them to be more powerful when they control the Natural Element.</p><br/><p>As instructed by Zhou Weiqing before, the five girls did not attack but remained quietly beside him. Though the suppressing force was tremendous, it was still not much of a threat to all of them who possessed the Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>The male Elf who gave the order just now was also taken aback by the sight. He was very clear of the strength of the pressure that his other Elves had released. At first, he thought that these young humans would instantly lose their resistance in the face of such a strong suppressing force. Yet, to his surprise, they did not seem to react to this at all. Were they really this powerful?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said in a grave voice, \u201cElven friends, please don\u2019t attack us. How about this? We\u2019ll follow you to meet the Elven Chief and explain the situation to you. It was true that we did come across Her Royal Highness Princess, but she seems to be taken away by some special Time attribute energy. You can\u2019t do anything to us but I\u2019m still willing to go back with you. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the reason why he explained so patiently was not because he was afraid of these Elves. Instead, he just did not want the kidnapper to get away so easily. On top of that, he also wanted to rescue the Elven Princess as soon as possible. Putting all other factors aside, based on his fondness towards the little girl alone, he really had to rescue her.</p><br/><p>The male Elf who was also the leader shouted in fury, \u201cLet us seal your cultivation base first then!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold glimpse flashed across Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes as he asked nonchalantly, \u201cDo you really think that I\u2019m afraid of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, a pure solid gold Nebula Saint Energy instantly erupted from his body, forming a solid gold light orb inside a gigantic colorful light orb. At the same time, the golden light orb emitted a dazzling brilliance. The Elves who surrounded Zhou Weiqing could all feel the Natural Elements in the air and instantly rushed toward the golden orb frenziedly. The Natural Elements that seemed to be a part of their body had instantly abandoned them.</p><br/><p>The golden color that was glittering with the nebula began to shine even more brightly under the enhancement of the Natural Elements. Though it did not give off any coercing pressure, the original encirclement of the Elf Tribe was instantly suppressed. Some of the Elves who had weaker cultivation base even fell from the air without warning.</p><br/><p>The pure golden light slowly spread out to become a gigantic cushion before they caught the fallen Elves from below.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly God-tier-like suppressing formation built by the several hundred Elves was instantly crushed by Zhou Weiqing in just a blink of an eye. Even though these Elves could not actually use their joint force to cast a Heavenly God-tier attack, but with the existence of the strong coercion force itself, even an ordinary Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse would be slightly suppressed.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, in terms of attributes, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy had completely suppressed them all at once. It was simply ridiculous to want Zhou Weiqing to bow down to them with just such small amount of Heavenly God-tier aura.</p><br/><p>Their formation scattered at once. A look of panic could be seen on most of the several thousands of Elves\u2019 faces. Although it was good enough that the Elves could control the energy of nature, they did not have actual combat experience at all since they lived in the Sealed Land since they were young. It was still relatively good if they were able to suppress their opponents but if the tables were turned for them to be victims of suppression instead, things would start to look meek for them.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing cast a cold glance at the Elves who were surrounding him; these people seemed to want to do it the hard way instead. To think that the Elf Tribe who claimed to be the most peaceful and freedom-loving tribe would turn out this far from their expectation. One could easily imagine how important power was in this world. As long as you had a strength that was majestic enough, only then would you be able to gain the right of having a voice in any part of this world.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not proceed to launch an attack. He had already promised Xue\u2019er that he would not harm any of them and he would definitely keep to his words. On top of that, he was a very smart person. If he hurt any of the Elf Tribe members, wouldn\u2019t that be akin to admitting that he kidnapped the Elven Princess? It was not that he feared the revenge from the Elves but it was just that he was not willing to be a cannon fodder for the person behind this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can bring me to meet your chief now, can\u2019t you?\u201d Zhou Weiqing had his eyes on the male Elf leader.</p><br/><p>The male Elf was staring at him with his mouth wide open. Till now, he still had not returned to his senses yet. In his eyes, Zhou Weiqing was only a human who was still in his twenties \u2013 this was why he decided to attack him before. The Elves were born with the ability to control nature and life; they were also endowed with a natural ability \u2014 the Qi Observation Technique that allowed them to see the true age of a person. There was no doubt that Zhou Weiqing and the girls were only in their twenties. For this reason, the male Elf thought that wanting to catch them would be a piece of cake Who knew that in the end, Zhou Weiqing was able to release such a horrifying power. For a moment, he fell into slight despair.</p><br/><p>At this moment, more Elves were making their way towards them. Though the elves\u2019 transparent wings did not allow them to fly too fast, the fact that they were able to fly alone already gave them a huge advantage over the humans.</p><br/><p>Moreover, most of the Elves were holding bows in their hands. Seeing them, Zhou Weiqing could not help but felt a sense of familiarity towards them. The only thing he did not know was if his Peerless Battalion were stronger than the Elves if they engaged in battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy patience is limited. It looks like I\u2019ll have to call the Elf chief on my own now, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Seeing the hesitant on the male Elf face who seemed like he did not know what to do now, Zhou Weiqing could not help but feel a little disappointed in the Elf Tribe. It appeared that they had been staying in this peaceful world for too long and had long forgotten their ability to fight.</p><br/><p>A faint light flashed across the sky. A faint deity light lit up on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face at once. With his hands clasped tightly in front of his chest, a glimpse flashed across his eyes as a brilliant galaxy belt soared up to the sky. A huge phantom image could be seen faintly forming from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>When this phantom image appeared, even Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy Galaxia that was originally pure gold in color was instantly dyed grey. The grey color dazzled and at once, the gigantic phantom behind him, more than a thousand feet high, emitted an incredibly tremendous pressure as it soared up straight to the sky, all the way up piercing through the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>When this tremendous pressure appeared, be it the Elves who were already present at the scene or those who were making their way there, all of them felt a sense of suffocation immediately. Fortunately, this tremendous pressure was projected up to the sky. Otherwise, if it was aimed at them, all of these Elves would have probably fallen from the sky, or worse, be directly crushed and destroyed by this bloodcurdling pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon God\u2019s aura?\u201d A woman voice of shock resonated in the air. At the next moment, a peculiar event suddenly took place. In all directions, numerous faint green lights rushed up all at once. Without warning, another phantom image that was also a thousand feet tall emerged out of nowhere in the sky.</p><br/><p>The phantom that appeared behind Zhou Weiqing was indeed the Demon God. However, this Demon God was no longer the same as the one that he used to summon.</p><br/><p>The first apparent change that could be seen was the clarity of the phantom image. The Demon God that was summoned with the help of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Nebula Saint Energy was wearing a black long robe that covered his entire body. His grey hair was so long that it was scattered all over the ground. A bright dazzling grey gem was embedded right in the middle of the chest of his robe. Not only that, this time, even his facial features could be seen clearly now.</p><br/><p>That was an extremely handsome facial feature. On his pale face was a pair of grey eyes. Still, there was a faint red bloody line that ran down from the middle of his forehead all the way down toward his brows. A devilish aura was constantly being exuded out of his gigantic body. On top of that, an atrocious energy ripple was emanating off his body continuously \u2013 an energy that could even make the Elf\u2019s Tribe Sealed Land shiver in fear.</p><br/><p>Right in front of the Demon God was another phantom image being solidified not far away. This image was much more superfine and gorgeous. It was an image of a woman in a long, green dress. Almost all of the accessories on her body was made from plants. A slender waist was exposed, attractively revealing her navel. The full mounds on her chest were overflowing with delight. The delicate skin was tinted with a healthy, fair color. Long azure-green hair hung loosely behind her back. Though it was not as exaggerated as the Demon God, with her thousand-feet tall height, her long hair was as dazzling as a turquoise waterfall.</p><br/><p>This woman also had extremely beautiful facial features. The pair of azure blue eyes were filled with an endless breath of life. Behind her were three pairs of transparent wings. An intense breath of life was constantly being emitted from her body, stopping the Demon God\u2019s evil breath from spreading to the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>What a powerful life energy; Zhou Weiqing was slightly taken aback. The next moment, a strange scene unfolded itself almost immediately. Zhou Weiqing waved his sleeve and under the shroud of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pure golden Galaxia Saint Energy, he and the five girls suddenly vanished into thin air without a trace. Just like that, they merged into the body of the gigantic Demon God.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, a humane smile suddenly appeared on the handsome Demon God\u2019s face, giving off a devilish vibe, along with his peculiar trait.</p><br/><p>A light gleamed in the woman with the long green dress\u2019s palm. Without warning, a scepter that was much taller than her body appeared in her palm as well. As she swung it around gently, all of the Elves that were on the ground were completely swept away, leaving her all alone at the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Nature Goddess?\u201d A chilly voice sounded from the Demon God. There was no weapon in his hand at all. From the beginning until this point now, he was completely empty-handed, yet, just from his crushing aura itself, it was apparent that the Demon God was having the upper hand now. After all, from the level of God itself, the Nature Goddess was far more inferior than the Demon God. But looking at this stalemate scene in front, there was one thing that was apparent. The summoner of the Nature Goddess was actually much stronger than the summoner of the Demon God.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, there\u2019s actually a human being who can summon the real Demon God and merge himself into it? This is definitely not something that the Heavenly Demon Sect that you humans created, could do. Hand me my daughter and I\u2019ll let you all go in one piece. Otherwise, this Sealed Land will become your place of burial!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, the Elven Queen was the one who summoned this Nature Goddess. Right at this moment, Zhou Weiqing who was controlling the Demon God phantom image was stunned with astonishment. After all, it was all thanks to his Saint Energy that he could summon the Demon God. It looked like the Elven Queen must have possessed a special ability for her to be able to summon the Nature Goddess. What a strong power this was! If the Nature Goddess was summoned based on only her cultivation base, she would most likely have a cultivation base that was much higher than the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord. Perhaps, she would almost be on par with Hui Yao\u2019s strength as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you for the last time. We didn\u2019t kidnap your daughter. We have no malicious intents toward the Elf Tribe at all. Otherwise, before you arrived just now, I could have wiped out this place completely just with my strength alone. I don\u2019t have to explain anything to you. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019d have to try harder if you really wanted to keep us here!\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of human emotions could be seen flashing across the Nature Goddess\u2019 face that was summoned by the Elven Queen. Creases crept up between her brows as the pair of azure blue eyes stared at the Demon God before her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you did indeed show mercy just now. However, if you plan to use my daughter to threaten me, then you had never been so wrong before. Do you really think that you could use the Demon God to threaten me? That\u2019s right, though the Demon God is much more superior than the Nature Goddess, I\u2019m afraid you haven\u2019t fully mastered the Demon God\u2019s ability yet. The more powerful the projection of the God is, the more strength is required to control it. Just by gaining the upper hand on the aura itself does not mean anything at all. After all, this is the Sealed Land of the Elf Tribe that is backed by an almost endless supply of the breath of life. When I say you\u2019re not allowed to leave, you will certainly not be able to leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Slightly gloomed, Zhou Weiqing asked, \u201cAre all Elves this rigid in personality?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen roared, \u201cHand over my daughter and stop everything that you\u2019re doing now. Or else, don\u2019t blame me for being merciless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing began to feel annoyed as well. Coldly, he replied, \u201cCome get me then. I really want to see how merciless you can be!\u201d Since things had become like this now, unless he could use his power to bend the other party to his will as it looked like they were unwilling to listen to his explanation at all. Even if he could not defeat the Elven Queen, he at least wanted to let him know that his strength was not something that she could destroy so easily.</p><br/><p>At once, the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land transformed its appearance immediately. A vibrant green world appeared behind the Nature Goddess while a greyish world brimming with an evil aura emerged behind the Demon God. Even the plants by his side were also blanketed with a faint devilish aura. In truth, Zhou Weiqing had already tried with all his might to control his power so as to minimize the impacts on the environment here. After all, he himself also liked this Elf\u2019s land a lot. He really did not want to annihilate it.</p><br/><p>The Nature Goddess slowly lifted up the scepter in her hand and at once, an intense green light of Life Energy poured towards the Demon God like a gush of a river, aiming to envelop him completely.</p><br/><p>Her purpose was very simple \u2014 to exhaust Zhou Weiqing\u2019s energy with the help of the tremendous Life Energy in the Elf\u2019s Tribe Sealed Land. In her opinion, as long as his energy was reduced to the state where it could no longer maintain the Demon God summoning, Zhou Weiqing would obviously lose this battle to her.</p><br/><p>The coldness in the Demon God\u2019s eyes turned a few shades chillier. A gray brilliance glimpsed across his grey eyes and at the very next moment, the long robe on his body swayed suddenly despite no wind present. Without warning, a grey light blade appeared out of nowhere in mid-air. Yet, all this while, the Demon God did not so much as lift a finger at all.</p><br/><p>A faint \u2018pop\u2019 sound could suddenly be heard resonating in the air. The green light belt suddenly flew all over the sky like small butterflies. The grey light blade stirred up a surprisingly long rainbow and earth-shattering demonic aura as it charged forward toward the Nature Goddess.</p><br/><p>When the look on her face dimmed a little, the Nature Goddess lifted up the scepter in her hand up high and faced the grey light blade directly head-on. With a crash, ripples of energy fluctuated and spread out in the air all at once. While the Nature Goddess slightly swayed, the Demon God still remained standing motionlessly.</p><br/><p>At this time, the Elven Queen who summoned the Nature Goddess was completely filled with bewilderment and shock. It had never crossed her mind that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength could reach such a surprising level. When she arrived, he was about to summon the Demon God, so he had yet to merge with the Demon God behind his back. Even an ordinary Elf possessed the Qi Observation Technique, so the royal Elf family\u2019s successor would definitely come to possess a much stronger Qi Observation Technique as well. With a glance, it was apparent to her that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was roughly about the same as the Heavenly Emperor Tier.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, such a cultivation base was considered as a top presence in the human world but in the Elf tribe, it was not even enough to stir a storm. The Elven Queen believed that he must have used a hidden technique to summon the Demon God\u2019s Illusion. Though this illusion was so clear to the point that it had shaken her to the core, it still did not mean that this Demon God had an actual combat strength. Just with this point alone, the Elven Queen was much stronger than all the other enemies Zhou Weiqing had faced before. For the reason that she was able to induce the Nature Goddess to emerge by using secret techniques, she had a more profound understanding of this technique compared to the rest of the people.</p><br/><p>However, watching such a scene before her, the Elven Queen noticed that her initial judgment seemed to have gone very wrong. Not only did this Demon God possess the ability to attack, its energy was actually derived from the true Demon God\u2019s immense power itself. How was a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse able to do that at all? This left her extremely puzzled. No wonder he dared to kidnap her daughter; his strength was this powerful after all.</p><br/><p>As the saying went, \u2018act first and talk later\u2019, the Elven Queen had completely thought that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s purpose was to kidnap her daughter first before laying out the conditions for her later.</p><br/><p>This was also the reason why Zhou Weiqing had to launch his attack despite his unwillingness to do so.</p><br/><p>The Nature Goddess scoffed coldly. Once again, she waved the scepter in her hand. The long slender scepter suddenly transformed into a long whip before it lashed out at the Demon God. The rich breath of life turned to become a long river in the air and countless of green light spots gushed forward towards the Demon God, along with the whip.</p><br/><p>At once, a strong binding force appeared around the Demon God.</p><br/><p>Another glimpse could be seen flashing in the Demon God\u2019s eyes. This time he finally moved. The gigantic body took a step forward in the sky. At the same time, his right hand grabbed onto the thin air and another peculiar scene unfolded itself. A layer of the grey air stream that brought about numerous dazzling nebulas materialized from the air. The moment the green binding light in the air came into contact with the grey nebulas, they dissipated easily in a blink of an eye. Some had even merged into the grey stream of air.</p><br/><p>A cold glare burst out without warning. A hint of anger appeared out of provocation and could be seen gleaming faintly in the Demon God\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Within seconds, in the void, a long sword suddenly slashed open the realm and revealed itself on top of the Demon God\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-The Demon God Sword?\u201d The Nature Goddess cried out loudly in surprise. A hint of panic could be heard in her cries.</p><br/><p>Just like the Nature Goddess\u2019 scepter, the Demon God Sword was the weapon of the Demon God. However, the latter was still far above the Nature Goddess when it came to hierarchy. The Nature Goddess that was summoned by the Elven Queen could be said as the enlarged version of her own power. Everything was under her own control.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, this was not the case for the Demon God. As one of the most powerful gods in the world, even his mere projection could not be entirely controlled even if it was summoned. For this reason, the anger that appeared in the Demon God\u2019s eyes was actually not the embodiment of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s emotions. Instead, it was the wrath of a superior that was being provoked by the small little Nature Goddess.</p><br/><p>As a result, the Demon God Sword appeared outside Zhou Weiqing\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zhou Weiqing was feeling equal in pain as well. This was because the Nebula Saint Energy in his body was being consumed at a terribly horrifying speed. It was a good thing the other five girls were by his side because other than Little Witch, the girls had already solidified their Saint Nucleus Core. Among them all, Tian\u2019er\u2019s was just as pure as his own Saint Nucleus Core. With their support, Zhou Weiqing could still withstand the consumption with all his might. At the same time, he was constantly using his Saint Energy to absorb the Nature Elements to replenish his own body as well.</p><br/><p>The Demon God Sword in the air was not very long; it was still slightly shorter than the Nature Goddess\u2019 scepter. Still, it did not descend and fall into the Demon God\u2019s hand. Instead, it kept hovering on top in mid-air.</p><br/><p>Be that as it may, as soon as the sword appeared, the whip that was transformed from the Nature God\u2019s scepter immediately cracked and broke into pieces. It then turned into innumerable spots of light in the sky before finally transforming back into a scepter and fell back into the hands of the Nature Goddess.</p><br/><p>The chilly devilish aura suddenly erupted in the air. At this moment, everything in the air and the ground had become a horribly fearsome grey. Right at this moment, even Zhou Weiqing could feel the bloodcurdling suppression aura being emitted by this grey sheen. Even he, the summoner, started to feel out of breath now.</p><br/><p>Now that the Demon God\u2019s Illusion was no longer under his control, he did not know what was going to happen next.</p><br/><p>Such an unforeseeable situation was still at least predictable but what left Zhou Weiqing speechless was the fact that although the Demon God\u2019s Illusion was launching the attack by itself, the energy that it was exhausting was actually from his own body.</p><br/><p>Still, this situation was not entirely unfavorable to Zhou Weiqing. He noticed very clearly that when the Demon God was absorbing his Nebula Saint Energy and transforming it into Evil Energy, it was also using his Nebula Saint energy to assimilate the surrounding energy. Without a doubt, such a peculiar operation of energy was even more effective than Zhou Weiqing\u2019s control of the Nebula Saint Energy now. Otherwise, with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current cultivation base, it was basically impossible to master the Demon God\u2019s weapon, even if he did possess the Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>What Zhou Weiqing could do now was to silently keep this trajectory in mind and also pray for the Elven Queen at the same time. He really did not have the intention to kill anybody who stepped foot here at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

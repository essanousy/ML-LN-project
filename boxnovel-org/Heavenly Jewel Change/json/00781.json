Meanwhile, the dazzling starry sky did not seem to have such limitation. How could it not shock him?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the end.\u201d Zhou Weiqing stepped out of thin air and swung his Dual God Strength Hammers that were in his hands. As he swung the dual hammers, two beams of starlight descended from the sky and coincidentally shone on the Dual God Strength Hammers. The dual hammers in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands shone like they were made of two stars. An intense and terrifying energy wave made the man in black shiver. He unleashed everything he had with his black sword. It turned into a black tornado as it attempted to defend against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing was a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, too. How could he, who possessed Nebula Saint Energy, give him any chance? This time, there was no loud \u2018bang\u2019. There was only a light \u2018ding\u2019. Something odd happened then. The distorted glow that surrounded the man in black\u2019s body disappeared completely. The black sword in his hand was crushed into countless pieces before it disappeared into thin air.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s motion did not seem quick but a beam of starlight would shine on him whenever he performed a simple action which gave him an extra boost in his Nebula Saint Energy. The Nebula glow on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest became extremely powerful. It was transforming into a whitish gold color from its initial reddish gold color.</p><br/><p>The black sword was crushed with a low bang. The man in black no longer defended against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s weapon. Feeling helpless, he used all the strength that he had and released a powerful skill as he dashed towards Zhou Weiqing. His body was thrown back once again. However, he was not trying to escape this time. As his body was thrown backward, a rich aura exploded from his body. When one arrived at the Heavenly Emperor Tier, getting wounded was not as simple as spitting blood anymore. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hammering shocked his entire body immensely. There were tiny cracks on his legendary armor set. The hammers would have severely injured him if it was not for the protection of his legendary armor set.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d The man in black yelled. A beam sparkled on his hand, and a pretty little lady appeared in his hand. She was shielding him. Zhou Weiqing who was going for more stopped his hammering once and for all. Was that not the Elven Princess in the man in black\u2019s hand?</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Elven Queen had rushed there. Her expression turned extremely cold when she saw her daughter.</p><br/><p>The little lady was in a coma at that moment. It was obvious that she was being kept like one of the man in black\u2019s storage item. It was obvious that she was still alive as the Elven Queen and Zhou Weiqing could still feel the life aura on her. The man in black was panting heavily. He could not understand how Zhou Weiqing became so powerful all of a sudden. What made him afraid was that the powerful attribute that he had always depended on could not be felt in any of the elements in the air.</p><br/><p>Even when he was in the Elven Queen\u2019s Natural Divine Territory, he could at least feel the Natural Attribute even though he had a difficult time getting adjusted. However, he could not feel any attributes at all at the moment. Apart from that, all of the attributes that he possessed were being suppressed. Otherwise, he would not be so passive. It was safe to say that he could not even use 80% of his cultivation base during his peak. Without a doubt, all this was caused by the dazzling starry sky. He could not understand it at all. Especially the unbelievable strength in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s last few attacks! He could not accept the outcome at all.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing looked at him coldly, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that you can say now. Give us the little lady, and I\u2019ll consider sparing your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in black said ferociously, \u201cIn your dreams! Will the both of you let me go if I return her to you? Stop your nonsense and back off. Also, withdraw this shitty thing in the sky and let me go. Otherwise, I\u2019ll break this little girl\u2019s head and bring her to hell with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew very well that it was possible for him to escape from this dazzling starry sky that Zhou Weiqing released. Moreover, he guessed that Zhou Weiqing must have drained much of his energy from performing such an ability, and he would not be able to last long. Therefore, it was the most beneficial for him to stall for time. Besides, with the Elven Princess in his hand, Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen would have to stay away from him. That was also the reason why he had been calm.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen clenched her fists in anger, and her beautiful face turned pale. It made sense for her to be enraged after seeing her own daughter in the man\u2019s hand. However, she did not dare to do anything right now. Even if she had absolute confidence she could kill the enemy, the enemy was a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse. It would take him only a second to kill the Elven Princess. It could be seen that the man in black was cunning when he decided to bring the Elven Princess out before he was badly injured. Due to that, it was still possible for him to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the both of you hear me? If you don\u2019t do as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ll tear off her arms first.\u201d The man in black said as he pulled on the Elven Princess\u2019 little hand that was like a lotus.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen instinctively screamed, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s pupils shrunk. Tian\u2019er was going to give birth, and he would be a father soon. The anger within him peaked as he looked at the despicable man.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing put his dual hammers down slowly. He said in his deep voice, \u201cI will withdraw the starry sky but you must let go of the kid. Otherwise, I rather destroy everything than letting a bastard like you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in black laughed, \u201cHey, weren\u2019t you all obnoxious earlier? Do you think it\u2019s up to you whether I get to leave or not? Elven Queen, this is your child. Or did you and this guy commit adultery and gave birth to the princess? If you want this child to live, you\u2019ll have to kill that guy next to you. Otherwise, hehe.\u201d He forcefully straightened the Elven Princess\u2019 arm as he spoke. With a slight pull, he would be able to tear the tiny arm apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. You\u2019re indeed a scum, a savage.\u201d The Elven Queen began to slightly lose control of her emotion. Her body was shaking while rich Life aura was continuously being released from her body. As a glow flashed, Zhou Weiqing kept the Dual God Strength Hammers in his hands and pressed on the Elven Queen\u2019s shoulder with a hand, \u201cDon\u2019t react. For the sake of the child, we\u2019ll let him go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing raised his hand and waved at the dazzling starry sky as he spoke. The stars in the sky dimmed like they were fading away. The man in black was secretly glad. He could feel the elements in the outside world that was completely shielded starting to gradually appear. It was obvious that Zhou Weiqing had withdrawn the ability that was similar to Divine Territory. As the stars in the sky dimmed, something odd happened. All of the stars seemed to be getting further away, and the dazzling glow was fading at a high speed. The night sky that was slowly fading away gathered into a small ball. A beam flashed and fell from the sky before it landed in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hand. It seemed as if Zhou Weiqing had grabbed the stars from the sky.</p><br/><p>The scene that was unfolding before their eyes even stunned the Elven Queen who was agitated. Suddenly, Zhou Weiqing yelled ferociously, \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to kill her? Do it. I\u2019ll kill her for you.\u201d As he said that, he lifted his hand to slap the Elven Princess as he ran towards her. However, before he managed to land his slap, an intensely rich whitish gold glow came out of his palm and rushed towards the Elven Princess. Everything happened too suddenly. Zhou Weiqing was already moving when he was speaking. Even the Elven Queen who was next to him could not stop him. What Zhou Weiqing said had also shocked the man in black. However, it was obvious that he could not dodge at that moment otherwise, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attack might land on him instead.</p><br/><p>All humans were selfish. At such a critical time, the man in black would naturally choose to use the Elven Princess to shield himself. Besides, he had an idea in his head at that very moment. Since Zhou Weiqing dared to attack the Elven Queen\u2019s daughter, would that not mean they would have internal conflict? Even if the Elven Princess died, he would have the opportunity to escape. It was just that he would not be able to complete his mission.</p><br/><p>The whitish gold nebula glow imprinted on the Elven Princess\u2019 body accurately.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard\u2026\u201d The Elven Queen\u2019s eyes turned red in shock. She gave Zhou Weiqing a slap on his body without any hesitation. As a low thud sounded, Zhou Weiqing was thrown into the air. When he was in midair, he spat out blood vigorously. His body was alternately radiating a gold and grey glow. He forcefully stopped the momentum when he was a few thousand meters away.</p><br/><p>A Heavenly God-tier powerhouse\u2019s cultivation base was tremendously powerful. Especially when she gave it her all in anger. Even though Zhou Weiqing had the protection of the Ringless Ground Purging Set as well as the powerful defense of the Immortal Deity Shield, the Demon God Protective Aura, and Dragon-Tiger Transformation, it was tough for him to bear the full brunt of the Elven Queen\u2019s attack without blocking at all. It was his first time getting injured even since he achieved Heavenly King Tier.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that the Ringless Ground Purging Set on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right shoulder was completed crushed, and there were cracks all over the armor set. At that moment, the Elven Queen\u2019s rage had reached its peak. However, her expression changed right after she slapped Zhou Weiqing. She could clearly see that the Elven Princess in the man in black\u2019s hand had turned completely whitish gold in color. The starlight looked extra dazzling, and it was just like a whitish gold sculpture mounted with countless starlight gems on it.</p><br/><p>What was happening? When the Elven Queen was preoccupied with her thoughts, the man in black on the other side noticed that something was wrong. He could feel an intense force of rejection exploding from the Elven Princess\u2019 body. Apart from that, all of the attributes energy in his body was being drained out manically as it headed into the Elven Princess\u2019 body. The little lady\u2019s body looked like it had turned into a black hole. It was a terrifyingly tough case to handle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

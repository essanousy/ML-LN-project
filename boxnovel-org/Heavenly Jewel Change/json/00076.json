Although the look and attributes of Elemental and Physical Jewels could be disguised by items like the Ring of Concealment, their numbers could never be hidden by any means, not even a twelve-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master could change that. Seeing the three sets of Heavenly Jewels around Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s wrists, she was muddled. This was definitely not her sister, who had six sets of Heavenly Jewels; furthermore Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s Elemental Jewels were only ordinary Wind Attributes. \u201cWait!\u201d The white robed young lady shouted, taking a step forward, attempting to step around Fat Cat.</p><br/><p>Fat Cat gave a low howl, a thick gold light emitting from its body, forming a shield which forcibly blocked the white clad young lady from stepping forward. At the same time, the \u2018King\u2019 tattoo on Fat Cat\u2019s forehead lit up brightly, and right in the middle of the word, a dark purple gemstone floated out from where it was hidden, as a rich purple light shone forth along with it, slowly surrounding Fat Cat\u2019s head and turning into a purple crown which nestled onto her proud head.</p><br/><p>As the crown appeared, Fat Cat was surrounded by a brilliant purple treasure light that rose constantly, as the gold shield around her was stained with a strange tinge of purple, looking gorgeously magnificent.</p><br/><p>The white clad lady\u2019s eyes narrowed as she exclaimed: \u201cDivine Descent Heavens Set! You are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRooarr\u201d Fat Cat gave a low growl, interrupting the white robed girl\u2019s words, her eyes filled with a warning look.</p><br/><p>Just as the two were facing off, tension in the air as they prepared to fight, Zhou Weiqing suddenly cleared his throat. With one hand, he pulled Shangguan Bing\u2019er back, walking to the front and looking at the white clad young lady with an embarrassed look on his face. Smiling bitterly, he said: \u201cWait, everyone. Don\u2019t fight. This\u2026 this is a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked at him inquiringly: \u201cMisunderstanding? Little Fatty, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had a gloomy look on his face as he said helplessly: \u201cJust now, I was admiring this jade screen when I suddenly felt a cold behind me. When I turned around, I saw her walking up towards me, and I thought you had changed clothes. So I\u2026 I\u2026 uh\u2026 wanted to be intimate with you\u2026 and so I took advantage of her\u2026 and thus my face became like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the real Shangguan Bing\u2019er appeared, Zhou Weiqing had immediately understood what happened, and realised that he had recognized the wrong person, causing the dramatic scene to take place before them. Although it was technically his fault, he was also rather helpless. After all, if even he couldn\u2019t tell them apart, who could?!</p><br/><p>The white clad young lady also understood what had happened, and her face changed rapidly, turning red and white in succession. Her right hand gripping her sword turned almost green as she exerted too much strength.</p><br/><p>Indeed, this was a misunderstanding, and she was also extremely curious about this young girl in front of her who looked exactly like her. Did they have some connection? But\u2026 that was her first kiss! For it to be stolen away just like that in such a ridiculous scenario, she was even more vexed and gloomy than Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s explanation, the anger in Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s eyes immediately vanished. With her understanding of Zhou Weiqing, though he was stuttering a little, she immediately understood what had happened. She said exasperatedly: \u201cHmph, who asked you to always be so bad. Serves you right!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, though she said that, Shangguan Bing\u2019er immediately turned to the white clad young lady. The enmity on her face had disappeared, replaced with curiosity. After all, no matter who it was, seeing someone looking exactly like them, that would be the natural reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis lady, I\u2019m really really sorry. This is truly a misunderstanding. Little Fatty definitely did not take advantage of you on purpose. As you see, you look exactly like me, and he recognized the wrong person. Although he did take advantage of you, I\u2019m sure he did not take things too far. Since you have already beaten him up, could we let bygones be bygones please?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, Shangguan Bing\u2019er showed her grace. Although Zhou Weiqing had been beaten up, it was him at fault after all. Of course, it was due to a misunderstanding, but it did not change the fact that he had taken advantage of a girl.</p><br/><p>The white clad young lady\u2019s breathing was rather ragged as she visibly restrained herself, glaring hard at Zhou Weiqing as the killing intent was almost piercing, causing him to feel a large pressure on his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d She asked. Of course, that question was directed at Shangguan Bing\u2019er, and when she asked the question, she finally kept her sword and reined in her aura. Although she did not state things clearly, her actions showed that she had agreed to Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s suggestion. Although her nature was cold, she was not an unreasonable person. This time she had indeed lost out, but it was truly a misunderstanding. However, although she restrained herself, her impression of Zhou Weiqing was still terrible.\u3002</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said: \u201cMy name is Shangguan Bing\u2019er. What about you? Why do we look so alike?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white clad young lady\u2019s eyes revealed surprise as she said: \u201cMy name is Shangguan Xue\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShangguan Xue\u2019er?\u201d Both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er both exclaimed at the same time. At the same time, Fat Cat quickly released the crown and gold light, as she leapt back into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s embrace, her body turning small in midair as she snuggled back into her usual spot.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er and Shangguan Xue\u2019er. The two names were just too close. Hearing Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s words, Zhou Weiqing revealed a thoughtful look, while Shangguan Bing\u2019er grew excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cShangguan Bing\u2019er? You\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Shangguan Xue\u2019er also had an excited look on her face, as she examined Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s face closely, as if her gaze could penetrate skin. When she confirmed to herself that it was no disguise or makeup, the surprise in her eyes grew stronger.</p><br/><p>As both girls stood there staring in shock at each other, they were rendered speechless.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing also stood at the side, looking left and right, trying to find any difference between the two. Alas, he was still unable to make out any difference, both girls looked exactly the same, from face to figure, with only the nature in their eyes having some difference.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s eyes were gentle, with a soft, warm aura. Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s eyes were rather cold, with their brilliance and essence hidden, giving others a \u2018Strangers, keep away\u2019 sort of feel. Perhaps, the only way to tell them apart was that aura.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er bit her lip as she said abruptly: \u201cCould I please ask if your mother\u2019s surname is Tang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said in surprise: \u201cHow did you know?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s body shuddered, and her voice was shaking as she said: \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er asked hurriedly: \u201cLady Xue\u2019er, do you know my mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er took a deep breath, her eyes reddening as she muttered: \u201cHow heartless of you, mother! Bing\u2019er, you are my sister! We are triplets [1. I am guessing this is so. He used a different word  instead of , but there is no such phrase in the mandarin vocabulary], you are my third sister! Please, stay here a moment, I\u2019ll be right back, this is regarding your birth background!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er was rather dazed, a hint of resistance in her eyes. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er stepped forward towards her, holding her hand and saying seriously: \u201cPlease, I beg you, wait for me. You must definitely wait for me to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we will wait here for you.\u201d This time, the one who spoke was Zhou Weiqing. He agreed on behalf on Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, Shangguan Xue\u2019er nodded towards him, before disappearing in a flash.</p><br/><p>After watching her leave, Zhou Weiqing extended his arms and enveloped Shangguan Bing\u2019er slowly into his embrace, comforting her shocked heart. \u201cBing\u2019er, calm down. No matter what, I\u2019ll be beside you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er lowered her head and said: \u201cLittle Fatty, you know, since I was young, every time I tried to mention my father, mother would always be extremely angry, shouting that he was disloyal. I\u2026 I do not know if I should go on with this, I\u2019m afraid that mother will not be happy. After all, it must have been father\u2019s fault that caused mother to be so angry and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing asked: \u201cDid aunty ever mention you have sisters?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er shook her head lightly, saying: \u201cNo, mother never spoke of it. However, I often saw her sitting by herself crying. Little Fatty, I really do not want my mother to be heartbroken. How about let\u2019s leave now, I would rather not find my father if that is so.\u201d</p><br/><p>With their looks so alike, with her intelligence, how could Shangguan Bing\u2019er not know that what Shangguan Xue\u2019er said was true, and that they were sisters. However, at that point, her kind heart could only think of her mother.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: \u201cBing\u2019er, trust me, it will all be fine. As the saying goes, \u2018In order to untie the bell, it is best for the person who tied it to do so.\u2019 No matter what happened in the past, since aunty often cries by herself, it shows that she truly loves uncle. At this time, you should not run and hide, but face everything bravely. As a daughter, what you should do is to try to resolve the issues between uncle and aunty, to let them come together again so that your family can be whole once more. If you run away today, in the future, aunty will not be the only miserable one, you will also be in the same state. As such, I agreed on your behalf. Let\u2019s wait here for her, I believe that the truth will come to light. As long as uncle still loves aunty, no matter what problems they have between them, I believe it can be resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing\u2019s words, Shangguan Bing\u2019er was comforted, her expression relaxing a little. She rested her head on his shoulders, listening to his heartbeat. At this moment, they no longer had any interest in touring the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion any longer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

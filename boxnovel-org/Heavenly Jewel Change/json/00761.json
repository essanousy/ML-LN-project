The fact that Zhou Weiqing managed to possess such an attribute could be absolutely described as \u2018complete madness\u2019. Given the condition when the Heavenly Nucleus Core was sufficient, the upgrade speed of his cultivation base was just absurd. From the moment he possessed the Saint Energy Galaxia, he was no longer in the same power ranks granted by Dark Demon God Tiger.</p><br/><p>It was due to the Destruction Attribute in the Heavenly Nucleus Cores of the Second and Fourth Elder, as well as the draining of a significant amount of energy from the purification of Star Reflection. Otherwise, with the concentration of Heavenly Energy by the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses, it would not be as simple as a mere upgrade to the Maximum Level of the Heavenly King Tier.</p><br/><p>Although things had only progressed until that state, it was sufficient for Zhou Weiqing. A bright golden light had showered a layer of dazzling colors onto his dark golden Ringless Ground Purging Set. The rich Saint Energy wave soared in the sky, while healing and upgrading effects took place once again as eight starlights were released. With Zhou Weiqing\u2019s support, Long Shiya and the rest felt exuberant in an instant and suppressed their enemies below them steadily. They instantly felt motivated and suppressed their enemies into a state of disadvantage. Without a doubt, if the events unfolded according to the current situation, there would be no chance given to these Blood Red Hell powerhouses at all.</p><br/><p>In the air, Zhou Weiqing took a step out and arrived right above the battlefield. The Blood Red Hell\u2019s First and Third Elder glanced at each other. The First Elder nodded hard while the overbearing Heavenly Energy erupted, whereas the Third Elder\u2019s body expanded abruptly. Self-detonation \u2013 that was what the Third Elder was going for. Encountering the powerful Zhou Weiqing, they were left with no other option. If they did not do that before Zhou Weiqing acted, it might be difficult for them to find the opportunity to self-detonate. The Third Elder intended to give the First Elder and the rest a chance to survive by sacrificing himself. Besides, he could tell that Zhou Weiqing had completed his upgrade from their Heavenly Nucleus Cores. As long as his self-detonation succeeded, there would naturally not even be a Heavenly Nucleus Core remaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to self-detonate? You\u2019ll have to ask if I\u2019ll allow that to happen.\u201d Zhou Weiqing smiled lightly in the air while the glow of the nebula on his chest started spiraling intensely out of nowhere. Then, a golden light pillar descended onto his body, engulfing the body of the Third Elder within it altogether.</p><br/><p>As the beam of the golden pillar did not possess any ability to attack, the Third Elder could not defend against it no matter how vigorous the Heavenly Energy on his body was.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the Third Elder was so shocked that he almost screamed out loud. He had found out that the Heavenly Nucleus Core he had been activating with all his might had calmed down just like that. Under the illumination of the golden light, it seemed to have gotten very comfortable.</p><br/><p>That was his Origin Energy! However, at that very moment, the Third Elder found out that he had begun to lose control of it. Although it was not a complete loss of control, at least from what he was looking at, it was no longer possible for him to self-detonate. Furthermore, at least more than 30% of his power had decreased.</p><br/><p>Pu \u2014</p><br/><p>To create the opportunity for the Third Elder to self-detonate, the First Elder had been fighting against the combined attacks of the two Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses by himself. There were the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and Demonic Emperor who had just received upgrades from Zhou Weiqing. he could not possibly defend himself for an extended duration. At that moment, he spewed a large amount of blood. While he had been shot and flung toward the back, he happened to see the Third Elder being enveloped by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s galaxy light, along with his expression of not being to self-detonate.</p><br/><p>\u2018What kind of energy is that?\u2019 he thought. At that moment, the First Elder had fear in him. Although Zhou Weiqing had never performed any powerful attack skills since the beginning, his existence had completely suppressed all of the Blood Red Hell\u2019s powerhouses. If it was not for him, how would they be losing the battle that they had the absolute upper hand to? The First Elder hated Zhou Weiqing to the bone but there was nothing that he could do anymore. Moments later, he spewed blood again. The First Elder roared in rage when all of the sudden, a striking dark red flame exploded from his body. Even though as the terrifying dark red flame was out, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and Demonic Emperor dared not proceed with their attack and backed off immediately.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya could not help but exclaim with a deep voice, \u201cThis guy\u2019s insane. He has actually burnt his own Heavenly Nucleus Core. These are the Flames of Life ignited by one\u2019s soul and Heavenly Nucleus Core.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every Heavenly Jewel Master with the Fire Attribute possessed the Flames of Life which offered them a temporary elevation in their power by burning through their life force. However, a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse\u2019s Flames of Life was different from those of an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>While the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse\u2019s Flames of Life might not erupt into a terrifying energy like how the self-detonation of Heavenly Nucleus Core did; the duration of its combustion was longer. Besides, it was not just the burning of Heavenly Nucleus Core. The soul was burnt together as well. Therefore, its impact was even more horrifying. Once the enemies had been scorched by the flames, the person\u2019s soul would be set ablaze as well.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue dared not pursue their pursuit. The Blood Red Hell\u2019s First Elder was putting his life on the line! With the differences being associated with their powers, the Flames of Life of an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master could be stopped anytime. However, once a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse\u2019s Flames of Life had been ignited, it would be impossible to extinguish. Under such a condition, death would be certain upon making this choice. Furthermore, the soul would be disintegrated, which was far worse than self-detonating one\u2019s Heavenly Nucleus Core.</p><br/><p>The First Elder witnessed Zhou Weiqing restricting Third Elders\u2019 self-detonation. He asked himself and thought his cultivation base was far higher than the Third Elder\u2019s, but he was unsure if Zhou Weiqing had the ability to restrict him for the second time. The death of the Second and Fourth Elder had a major impact on him. Besides, looking at the current situation, the worst case scenario would result in the total defeat of the Blood Red Hell! He then became radical and ignited his own Flames of Life.</p><br/><p>As Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue retreated, the First Elder suddenly had no more opponents. He did not pursue the two Heavenly Emperors. Instead, he leaped into the air and dashed towards Zhou Weiqing. Eliminating Zhou Weiqing would be the only possibility for the Blood Red Hell to turn the tables around. The First Elder who was burning in dark red flames looked absolutely evil, like a massive fireball. His clothes, hair, and skin were burning with the terrifying Flames of Life. He no longer exhibited the appearance of a human being. However, there was no doubt that he was the most overbearing one amongst all the Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, Weiqing, \u201d Long Shiya shouted and rose into the air immediately to chase after the First Elder. Wu Yunyue was just one step behind him. Although they were on the case, both of them did not dare to get close. They had only launched long-distance attacks in their attempt to stop the Blood Red Hell\u2019s First Elder. However, the First Elder was now in a state where did not mind losing his life anymore. With the support of the Flames of Life, his speed had peaked as he arrived before Zhou Weiqing almost instantly.</p><br/><p>The nebula that was spiraling in the sky was now engulfed in a layer of faint dark red. One could only imagine how overbearing the energy that the First Elder released was. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s initial casual expression had now turned serious. Not only was he going to receive the full-blown attack of the First Elder, the Third Elder beneath him would possibly successfully perform self-detonation if he failed to put him under control. By then, nobody could guarantee the Heavenly Bow City\u2019s existence from the impact of a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse\u2019s self-detonation. His families and friends were in there \u2013 how could he possibly allow the Third Elder to complete his self-detonation?</p><br/><p>The First Elder was very determined, which allowed him to find this opportunity that he did not see when everything seemed to be hopeless. The Dual God Strength Hammers appeared in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands, while the overbearing Saint Energy Galaxia covered his body with dazzling golden color. The nebula on his chest was spinning at full speed, making Zhou Weiqing look like as if his entire being was being enveloped by a layer of starlight. A layer of dark golden light then exploded from within his body.</p><br/><p>Facing the First Elder who was ignited by the Flames of Life, every single skill would not work on him at this moment. The only thing Zhou Weiqing could do was to fight him by force. He lifted up the dual hammers and swung them. At the same time the Saint Energy Galaxia erupted, he did not forget to retain the Third Elder who was beneath him. Although it sounded slow from the description, he had collided with Zhou Weiqing when the First Elder ignited his Flames of Life. However, their collision this time did not invoke any deafening sounds or energy waves, but only a soft sound as they collided.</p><br/><p>Dark red flames abruptly combusted and engulfed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body, along with the hysterical laughter of the First Elder.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, I\u2019ll have you die along with me, I\u2019ll burn you to death, and make these destructive flames explode on its own. All of you must die, every single one of you must die\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you daydreaming?\u201d</p><br/><p>The outsiders could not gauge the situation between Zhou Weiqing and the First Elder clearly. Amidst the terrifying destructive flames, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Dual God Strength Hammer had struck onto the First Elder\u2019s shoulders accurately. However, the strange thing was that his brutal force did not manage to affect the First Elder who was burnt by the Flames of Life in any way at all. Instead, he was stuck with the First Elder\u2019s Flames of Life. The terrifying flames then engulfed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body through the Dual God Strength Hammers.</p><br/><p>The First Elder\u2019s face had been burnt to ash-black. The only thing that was visible was his eyes, filled with a grudge. Upon witnessing Zhou Weiqing being swallowed by the fearsome destructive flames, his heart sang with joy. At this point, how could he not figure out who the cause of all these events was? He had been tricked by Zhou Weiqing and was led by his nose. It was safe to say that the First Elder hated this young man immensely, that he absolutely had brought him along to his grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh \u2014\u201d, a faint long sigh came from Zhou Weiqing who was being enveloped by the destructive flames.</p><br/><p>The First Elder was stunned at that moment before he heard a deafening sound. A massive gush of energy waves flowed from beneath, propelling him and Zhou Weiqing higher into the sky.</p><br/><p>As he looked downward subconsciously, the First Elder could not help but released a heart-wrenching cry, \u201cThird\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>The Third Elder of Blood Red Hell could no longer answer him as his body had been smashed into a ball of meat.</p><br/><p>Third Elder had never expected that the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and Demonic Emperor who had leaped into the sky all ready to rescue Zhou Weiqing would suddenly alter their direction. They launched a full-blast attack on him instead. Just like what Zhou Weiqing was concerned about, he was ready to self-detonate anytime. His eyes turned completely red when the First Elder ignited his Flames of Life. Among the Four Elders, he had the worst temper. He had no room to bother about anything else anymore, seeing that all three of his brothers would die. As long as he could self-detonation successfully, the people of the Blood Red Hell could definitely escape. He wished to live and die along with his brothers. It would be best to kill Zhou Weiqing and all of his people here.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he was all ready. As soon as Zhou Weiqing loosened his control on him, he would proceed to self-detonate without any hesitation. Unfortunately, the events did not unfold according to the wishes of the two Elders of Blood Red Hell. The two Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses who were on the way to rescue Zhou Weiqing had suddenly changed directions and launched a full-blast strike towards the Third Elder. He now had no way of defending himself against the two Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses even if he had anticipated their attack, let alone be caught unaware!</p><br/><p>The Demonic Emperor and Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had their powers elevated by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy Galaxia while the Third Elder had been draining his energy all this while. Furthermore, he was being showered by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Galaxia nebula glow; it was equivalent to his Heavenly Nucleus Core being controlled by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core. Under such circumstance, how much of his powers could he release?</p><br/><p>It made sense that the Third Elder had failed to complete his self-detonation and was crushed into a ball of meat under the assault of the two Heavenly Emperor-tier. Naturally, he launched his final attack and made Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue spew blood again. It was definitely a great deal to kill a Heavenly Emperor-tier in exchange for such a minor sacrifice.</p><br/><p>Was it Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue\u2019s real intention to kill the Third Elder instead of rescuing Zhou Weiqing? Naturally, that was not the case. To them, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s life was far more important than the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Third Elder. They decided to do that as they heard Zhou Weiqing\u2019s telepathic message!</p><br/><p>Two balls of dazzling starlights exploded in the sky, followed by a loud thud. The screams of the First Elder was heard along with the abrupt emergence of the Flames of Life. As the starlight rotated, Zhou Weiqing appeared in everyone\u2019s field of vision again. It seemed like he was not hurt at all as he held the Dual God Strength Hammers in his hands and floated majestically midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible, that\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d First Elder\u2019s voice was filled with unwillingness. He remained in the appearance of a ball of flames, but his bodily functions were weakening from the combustion. As he was hit by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy Galaxia, he was no longer able to deliver a strike as powerful as he did before.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall explain everything to you and let you die in peace then,\u201d Zhou Weiqing smiled softly, \u201cIf you choose the other option, which is to pull everything on the line and attack me, I would be gravely injured even if I was able to defend it, After all, I\u2019ve yet to master this Star Energy of mine perfectly. What a pity! Why did you blame Tian Lei previously? You\u2019ve forgotten that I\u2019m immune to Fire Attribute \u2013 a pure immunity at that. As for the Destruction Attribute embedded in your Flames of Life, how is it an opponent of my Creation Saint Energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh it\u2019s such a pity that this Heavenly Nucleus Core of yours isn\u2019t bad. Goodbye, dear Elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rich Saint Energy Galaxia flowed from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s dual hammer and engulfed the remnants of First Elder\u2019s Flames of Life within it. As the nebula spiraled, the First Elder\u2019s life had vanished within a short period of time. Unfortunately, Star Reflection could not be conducted on his Heavenly Nucleus Core as it had lost much of its components due to the combustion of Flames of Life. Otherwise, with the First Elder\u2019s cultivation base, his Heavenly Nucleus Core would absolutely allow Zhou Weiqing to be upgraded further.</p><br/><p>Looking at the battlefield below, Zhou Weiqing held his dual hammers by his side in a horizontal manner. As the Galaxia Saint glow was stone, it transformed into seven beams of light pillars and enveloped the remaining Blood Red Hell\u2019s seven Heavenly King-tier powerhouses within it as if it had grown a pair of eyes. The glow was slightly darker than the one that was used on the Third Elder but it was sufficient to handle these Heavenly King-tier powerhouses. What Zhou Weiqing was doing was to not leave any opportunity of self-detonation to them. The disability to self-detonate left them no way to escape. What he said to the First Elder had demonstrated his determination of not leaving anyone alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill.\u201d A cold voice came out from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s mouth. With the restriction by Saint Energy Galaxia in place, his people no longer had any concerns and had launched their mightiest attack.</p><br/><p>After Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue had conveniently gotten rid of a few remnants attempting to escape, they had entered the main battlefield. With the presence of the two Heavenly Emperors, what chance would these Blood Red Hell powerhouses have?</p><br/><p>Beams of starlight shot high up into the sky toward the dazzling nebula. It was a sign that this was the end of the battle. Looking at the disastrous scene and the bunch of crushed meat all around, the people from Heavenly Demon Sect had a feeling as if they were in a foreign world. Ming Yu and Ming Hua\u2019s father, Ming Wu, were among the six Heavenly King-tier powerhouses of Heavenly Demon Set. Everyone had their eyes on Zhou Weiqing, who was in the sky. They had a burning passion in their eyes. The mixed emotions of admiration, astonishment, and envy fluctuated intensely within their hearts.</p><br/><p>All of the Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s Heavenly King-tier powerhouses realized that they would definitely die when they saw so many people from the Blood Red Hell. As they followed Zhou Weiqing, Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue and Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, they had no idea what tactics the former had in store, so it was only natural for them not to feel confident at all. If it was not for their absolute obedience to the Sect Master\u2019s orders and their dignity as Heavenly King-tier powerhouses, some of them would have long desired to escape.</p><br/><p>Before the battle begun, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s series of charms, negotiation, and bets had confused these Heavenly Demon Sect powerhouses even further. They had no idea what this young man wanted. They did not even know what the level of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was and neither had Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue informed them of it. Wu Yunyue had his thoughts all laid out. If they happened to survive and win this battle, he would agree to any of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s terms. If they did not, what was the point of talking about all these?</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Demon Sect powerhouses were shocked as they watched the series of performances exhibited by Zhou Weiqing. They could not imagine a young man who looked only in his twenties to display various strong abilities including cunningness, power, and strategic calculations. Not only had he tricked his opponents into confusion, the two Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses on their side had been following his commands. It was his very command which had led the people to victory.</p><br/><p>They won, they had really won \u2013 it was an absolute victory! Although they had not sustained zero injuries, there was not a single person who was dead or crippled on their side.</p><br/><p>Their opponents were the four Elders and eight Heavenly Kings of the Blood Red Hell who were blessed with the Destruction Attribute! Even without taking the Heavenly Zong-tier powerhouses into account, these forces were so much more powerful than the ones who had attacked their Heavenly Demon Sect back then. Furthermore, this key of absolute victory relied on Zhou Weiqing alone. The dazzling glow released from Zhou Weiqing had even led them to ignore the presence of Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>Without taking other factors into account, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy Galaxia alone had completely suppressed the Destruction Attribute and this had filled the hearts of these Heavenly Demon Sect powerhouse with elation. Without the suppression and integration of Destruction Attribute, they were able to release their power at full potential. Why would they fear the people of Blood Red Hell anymore? The final battle had also completely rectified this issue.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing remained floating mid-air while beams of gold from the Star Reflection shone on him one after another. At that moment, the people could see roughly that there was blood flowing out from the corners of his lips. They could not help themselves from being concerned about him. Encountering the Blood Red Hell\u2019s Destruction Attribute, his Star Energy was the only thing that could fight against it! If anything were to happen to him, would they still be able to defend themselves against these Blood Red Hell powerhouses?</p><br/><p>The sudden uprise of the Dandun Empire had a significant connection with the Blood Red Hell. The Blood Red Hell\u2019s ability was not restricted to those people that they sent. Although this time the Blood Red Hell was in devastation, nobody could guarantee how many Blood Red Hell powerhouses would they encounter next time.</p><br/><p>Yes, Zhou Weiqing was wounded. He was injured when the First Elder ignited his Flames of Life. That was right. No matter how powerful the First Elders\u2019 flames were, it could not break Zhou Weiqing\u2019s immunity to Fire Attribute as long as it did not exceed the powers of one who was at the Heavenly God Tier while the Destruction Attribute was suppressed by the Saint Energy Galaxia. However, one should not forget that the overbearing Flames of Life that was released with the will to kill could attack a human\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s injury came from the ones he sustained in his soul. However, he had been enduring the pain earlier as he was afraid to affect his morale. Now that the battle was over, he could not help but spew a mouthful of blood after releasing Star Reflection. He was seeing black, and his floating body was unstable due to the dizziness that he felt. Fortunately, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s soul had long entered the Heavenly Emperor-tier or even higher. He had no idea to what extent of strength had his soul evolved to. With the help of the dragon Hui Yao as well as his self-upgrade from consolidating the Saint Nucleus Core, it had caused his Soul Energy to elevate continuously. Moreover, he killed the First Elder within the shortest period of time. Although he was wounded, it was not fatal.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body started to shiver vigorously in the air at the next second. A series of unstable golden glows exploded from within his body. Oh no, even Zhou Weiqing was a little scared this time. He suddenly realized that he should not have used Star Reflection on the Heavenly Nucleus Cores of these Heavenly Kings as well as the three Elders at that time. It was because he had already arrived at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly King Tier. With the Heavenly Emperor and seven Heavenly Kings\u2019 Star Reflection, his cultivation base had instantly escalated to the next level, which was the Heavenly Emperor.</p><br/><p>Yes, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was upgrading to Heavenly Emperor-tier when his soul was wounded. Naturally, it was good if he was being upgraded to Heavenly Emperor-tier under the usual circumstance. The power of the new level of Saint Energy Galaxia could only be told after Zhou Weiqing tested it. However, it was extremely dangerous to level up in his current condition.</p><br/><p>No matter the breakthrough from a cultivation base of nine jewels to the Heavenly King Tier or from the Heavenly King Tier to the Heavenly Emperor Tier, it was not a simple upgrade of cultivation base, neither was it mere changes in the Heavenly Nucleus Core. It was an evolution from the inside out, from the head down to the toe, from within the soul to the body outside, and from the meridians to the skeletons. It was a total upgrade to the body.</p><br/><p>In such a process of evolution, although the pain inflicted was not too much, it was an escalation process nonetheless. For a damaged soul to be upgraded, there was a risk of his soul collapsing!</p><br/><p>\u2018What should I do?\u2019 At that moment, Zhou Weiqing was stunned as he had never encountered such a situation so it was only natural for him not to know how to handle the matter. It was impossible to reject the Star Energy reflected at him and his body had already begun to transform. His soul had also started to evolve along with the excruciating pain. Zhou Weiqing could only feel that his consciousness was fading. While his spiritual whirlpool was going through an intense spiral, cracks appeared one after another in the depths of his soul, resulting in the fading of his consciousness.</p><br/><p>The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue had been observing Zhou Weiqing. From their perspective, the golden glow on Zhou Weiqing had become brighter and brighter since the Star Reflection. A faint layer of red began to surface on top of the dazzling golden glow and fused to become an even more colorful reddish gold. The aura radiating from his entire being had become more and more overbearing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he leveling up? Into Heavenly Emperor-tier?\u2019, Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue were stunned as they watched. One must know that when the battle had just begun, his cultivation base was nothing more than that of an Upper-Level Heavenly King-tier powerhouse. He had just upgraded to the Heavenly Emperor Tier just like this right after a single battle. On the other hand, they had spent tens of years to complete their evolution to achieve Heavenly Emperor-tier. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s upgrade speed had completely surpassed their knowledge of Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. Something\u2019s not right about this.\u201d Long Shiya naturally knew his beloved disciple more than Wu Yunyue did and found out about the changes in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s situation as soon as it happened. Although Zhou Weiqing was in the progress of upgrading, his face was as pale as paper, while his body did not stop shivering. His body floating in the sky and the reddish golden glow radiating from his body was extremely unstable. It exuded a feeling that he would collapse any minute.</p><br/><p>This was definitely like the conditions exhibited during the regular process of a Heavenly King Tier being upgraded to a Heavenly Emperor Tier. Long Shiya\u2019s facial expression changed immediately. To him, even the annihilation of the entire Blood Red Hell could not be compared to the safety of his beloved disciple! Long Shiya could also roughly guess that Zhou Weiqing must have had encountered some problems during his previous fight with the First Elder. Although he could not pinpoint the exact issue with Zhou Weiqing, there were wounds on his body.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, destructive disaster could be brought upon a Heavenly Jewel Master who was forcing his way to an upgrade, even if the injury was minor.</p><br/><p>What caused the greatest pain to the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was that in such a situation, there was no way for him to Zhou Weiqing at all. If Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was lower, for instance, the time when he was still breaking through to the Seventh Jewel from the Sixth Jewel cultivation base, Long Shiya would still be able to aid him with his cultivation base. However, he was now upgrading to the Heavenly Emperor Tier, albeit a Heavenly Emperor Tier with Saint Energy Galaxia. In such conditions, Long Shiya knew that there was nothing he can do for Zhou Weiqing. The evolution of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base might very well be an incomparable existence. He would only accelerate the crisis and even be devoured by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy Galaxia if he were to interfere during the process.</p><br/><p>Just as Long Shiya was losing his patience, two silhouettes dashed from the sky like lightning from far away. The two silhouettes were extremely fast and they looked like they were connected. A massive pair of green golden wings flapped continuously and soon arrived above the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Wu Yunyue shrieked and had almost failed to restrain himself while Long Shiya held onto him immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re one of us. They\u2019re here to assist Zhou Weiqing in his breakthrough Everyone, please don\u2019t act hastily,\u201d Long Shiya\u2019s words managed to calm the group of Heavenly Demon Sect powerhouses.</p><br/><p>Soon, the two silhouettes arrived before Zhou Weiqing. The owner of the gigantic pair of green massive sings swung hard at Zhou Weiqing as another person that was in his embrace was flung. It was strange that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s powerful golden Saint Energy did not reject the two outsiders. It was a lady who was flung away. She then floated in the sky with her white dress, looking like a goddess on earth.</p><br/><p>In a flash, she appeared before Zhou Weiqing. Without hesitation, she stretched her arms out wide and hugged Zhou Weiqing\u2019s neck tightly. At the same time, she lifted her head and kissed his lips. The two ladies who came out of nowhere were naturally Shangguan Bing\u2019er and Tian\u2019er. Although they did not join the battle, they had been watching closely with the Heavenly Bow Empire powerhouses. As everything was over and done with, the loud thuds had naturally vanished but the glow from the nebula in the sky was still there.</p><br/><p>Right at that time, Tian\u2019er had an extremely intense feeling out nowhere. She could sense that something was wrong with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s condition. As the both of them cultivated their Saint Energy together, it was only natural for their hearts to be connected, more so within such a close distance. Therefore, Tian\u2019er had asked Shangguan Bing\u2019er to send her here immediately. As soon as Tian\u2019er kissed Zhou Weiqing, his shivers became even more vigorous. However, he then held Tian\u2019er\u2019s slender waist while an immense reddish golden glow that surrounded the both of them started rotating. It was so strong that even Shangguan Bing\u2019er was swept along.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the Saint Energy Galaxia would not harm the two ladies as their bodies were filled with Saint Energy as well. Although they were not as powerful as Zhou Weiqing was, how would this energy of the same source and with the similar nature of Creation Energy harm each other?</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er had also gotten used to cultivating along with Zhou Weiqing during their travels together to the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland. Naturally, she would not miss such an excellent opportunity. She stretched her wings out wide and kept her body afloat as she began to cultivate while feeling the powerful Saint Energy Galaxia surrounding her.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, it was a different situation happening to Tian\u2019er and Zhou Weiqing. Almost without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing had channeled the massive Saint Energy Galaxia, which was about to be upgraded, to Heavenly Emperor-tier into Tian\u2019er\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>With a large amount of energy injected from Zhou Weiqing, Tian\u2019er\u2019s body instantly turned into a reddish gold shade. Zhou Weiqing began to lose consciousness now. Furthermore, he was being led by Tian\u2019er where he had no idea if the baby in Tian\u2019er\u2019s tummy would be hurt by them doing so. He had lost his ability to judge, and all he was doing was to find a way to vent subconsciously.</p><br/><p>Something even odder happened next. As Tian\u2019er\u2019s body turned a reddish gold as well, Tian\u2019er\u2019s belly had actually lit up. A layer of mysterious white color that had never been seen before appeared on her tummy. It was a small ball of glow which appeared to be pure white. As white color appeared, the powerful Saint Energy Galaxia of Zhou Weiqing had actually dimmed and lost its color. All of the reddish golden colors seemed to appear more harmonious in an instant. It was no longer circulating around Zhou Weiqing, but instead, it started circulating the tiny ball of white glow with that as its center.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was finally relieved that the massive amount of upgrading Saint Energy had left his body. His soul started to be stable again. All he needed now was time to heal his soul, which was not difficult. As he opened his eyes by instinct, Zhou Weiqing saw himself being kissed by Tian\u2019er. Suddenly, his body shook vigorously while his eyes were filled with surprise and pain. How did he inject such an abundant amount of energy into Tian\u2019er\u2019s body?</p><br/><p>If Tian\u2019er was not pregnant, what he did would benefit Tian\u2019er as she would gain her energy from it. As the Saint Energy was created by the both of them, Tian\u2019er did not reject any of the Saint Energy at all. However, it was a different situation now as she was pregnant now. Would receiving this massive amount of energy impact injure the baby? If that was the case, Zhou Weiqing would definitely regret for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing soon found out that something was not right. He was surprised to discover that a unique energy that made him comfortable, much as if he was back in the core of the universe, was continuously released by Tian\u2019er who was in his embrace. The gush of energy was weak but it was no doubt a supreme energy. At that moment, all of the Saint Energy Galaxia seemed to become its people. Even the nebula in the sky had stopped spiraling at that moment. A massive amount of Star Energy was poured from the sky, covering Zhou Weiqing, Tian\u2019er, and Shuangguan Bing\u2019er within it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t this Star Energy from the Star Reflection\u2019s energy?\u2019. However, Zhou Weiqing did not use the Heavenly Nucleus Core to conduct Star Reflection this time! This energy was completely gifted to them from the countless stars in the sky. The gentle energy first rotated around Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er as it surrounded them. Under the gush of Star Energy, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s broken soul had recovered to its normal state almost immediately.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing found out that the gush of Saint Energy was different from the Star Reflection that he released earlier. There was a faint white within the golden starlight. Although the white was faint, it was the one that recovered his soul quickly. Otherwise, Zhou Weiqing might not even realize the existence of such a unique energy. Next, the reddish gold that he inserted into Tian\u2019er\u2019s body was poured out and injected back into him. That filled Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body with reddish gold glow once again.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Weiqing and Tian\u2019er\u2019s bodies were against each other, Shangguan Bing\u2019er who was in the sky not far away from them was the only one who witnessed the odd white glow that was released from Tian\u2019er\u2019s tummy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

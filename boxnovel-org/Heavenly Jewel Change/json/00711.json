Yes, I managed to dodge it once but how do you expect me to keep dodging? Not to mention that we\u2019re in an area that you led me to. I\u2019ll have to die eventually, right? Since this is the case, I might as well die straight away. Come on! Just do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Closing both of his eyes, Zhou Weiqing placed his hands behind him. He had a self-righteous look on his face.</p><br/><p>Coldly, Meng Xing asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t even want to know why I want to kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing would not let himself be fooled. Keeping his eyes shut, he replied, \u201cSince I\u2019ll be dead anyway, what\u2019s the use of knowing? Hurry! Be done with it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without warning, the tingling sensation on his skin disappeared at once. Opening his eyes again, he saw that the light sword before him had disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing glared at him furiously, \u201cZhou Weiqing! You bastard! How dare you molest me? Even if I can\u2019t kill you, I\u2019ll make sure you pay a hefty price! Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t give you any chance at all! I\u2019ll use the power of a Sixth Jewel and if you can defeat me, I\u2019ll let you walk out of here freely. Otherwise, I\u2019ll really kill you off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at her infuriated eyes, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart was set at ease. As he expected, it was that incident after all, and not because she had found out about his identity. That was right! He had not revealed any flaw so how could she possibly find out about him right?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what do I get if I win?\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes were alert as he asked casually.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing replied coldly, \u201cI\u2019ll let that incident go if you win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing snorted, \u201cYou\u2019ll use a Sixth Jewel cultivation base? Oh, come on, you may not be a match for me at all, ya know? Besides, who can guarantee that you won\u2019t go against your words later? After all, your cultivation base is much higher than mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Xing was enraged, \u201cWhat sort of person do you think I am? I\u2019ve never gone against my words before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cThen you must swear that if you flop and use a power that is beyond what someone with a cultivation base of Six Jewels, you\u2019ll have to spend a night with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Meng Xing was infuriated to the maximum by the guy standing before her, \u201cYou bastard! What a shameless guy! I really misjudged you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shrugging his shoulder, Zhou Weiqing replied, \u201cHow am I shameless? You want my life, and I just want your body. Speaking of that, you\u2019re the one that\u2019s taking advantage of me, don\u2019t you think so? Besides, this is a battle that you initiated. If you don\u2019t swear it, it means that you just want to deride it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, fine! I\u2019ll swear! Zhou Weiqing! I\u2019ll kill you today no matter what! This gamble is just an excuse for me to kill you off! I, Meng Xing, swear that if I use more than Sixth Jewels\u2019 power to fight Zhou Weiqing later on in the match, I\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d As she was stuttering over the last two words, Meng Xing\u2019s face was already flushed red. In the still end, she gritted her teeth as she spat out, \u201cI\u2019ll spend a night with him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed as he said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it! Don\u2019t you regret it, okay?\u201d As he said that, he tapped his foot on the ground before retreating in a flash. At the same time, layers and layers of dark golden light emitted from his body at once.</p><br/><p>Even though Meng Xing had already guessed that he must have a set of God Tier Consolidated Equipment, the moment she saw the six consecutive dark golden lights flashed by, her pupils could not help but constrict at that moment. Of course, she didn\u2019t know that in truth, he actually had a total of seven pieces of Consolidated Equipment. He even had the Overlord Bow.</p><br/><p>The moment the Dual God Strength Hammers appeared in his hands, Zhou Weiqing could instantly feel his entire body getting filled with a petrifying power. A pair of Yin-Yang Giant Spirit Palms, shoulder pauldrons, a chest plate, along with the armor and war-kilt by his waist. All these formed his six-piece Ringless Ground Purging Set. Under the shadow of the intense dark golden light, he exuded a dense, solid feeling all over his body.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing let out a cold snort. Like Zhou Weiqing, a set of six dark golden lights flared out of her body. Completely different from his Ringless Ground Purging Set\u2019s imposing and spectacular style, her legendary armor set looked more like scales.</p><br/><p>The chestplate was the first to appear. Its center was a series of dense rhombuses that had their ends pointed outwards with a dark red rhombus gemstone right in the middle. The shoulder pauldrons were long and slender. It had a dragon head on both sides that covered her beautiful shoulders entirely. Scale-like armor continued to spread down as it covered both her arms and all the way to her palms where a pair of sharp dragon claws could be seen. Not only that, the armor also extended downwards from her waist, covering both of her legs as well.</p><br/><p>One could say that Meng Xing was completely covered in the legendary armor set other than her head.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes widened. How could this be possible? It was only six pieces of God Tier Consolidated Equipment, wasn\u2019t it? How could it possibly cover her entire body? His equipment had six pieces as well but his legs were obviously still bare! Could it be that\u2026</p><br/><p>Meng Xing slowly raised her right hand. His heart suddenly skipped a beat. Her Physical Jewel was actually similar to Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s. It turned out to be Dual Physical Jewels \u2013 Flexibility and Strength. No wonder her legendary armor set covered such a large amount of area. Only six pieces and it was already enough to cover her entire body. What would happen if her legendary armor set reached ten pieces? Then, the seventh armor would be the helmet and what else was left? Would all of them turn into weapons? That pair of dragon claws already looked like a weapon to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDual Physical Jewels coupled with the Alexandrite\u2019s Cat Eyes Heavenly Jewel. This girl\u2019s talent is basically on par with mine! No wonder she has so much confidence that she\u2019ll be able to defeat me even if she has to use the Sixth Jewel cultivation base!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, looking at how powerful Meng Xing was aroused Zhou Weiqing\u2019s desire to win the duel. He was also at the Sixth Jewel cultivation base. Why would he be inferior to her?</p><br/><p>He smashed the two hammers together. It elicited a loud noise as they clashed. The Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation immediately appeared out of thin air and turned into a hexagram by his feet.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing narrowed her eyes instantly but her movements were not slow at all. She did not use any technique as her delicate body suddenly bounced up from the ground and charged towards Zhou Weiqing with lightning speed. Her speed and power exploded at once, fully displaying her physical strength.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing recalled that he had once held her soft and tender body in his arms, his heart could not help but shudder in surprise. That soft, cotton-like delicate body could actually unleash such a terrifying force?</p><br/><p>Despite what was going through his mind, Zhou Weiqing was not slow at all. He knew that if he lost this battle, with Meng Xing\u2019s wrath now, he would definitely be skinned alive even if he did not die.</p><br/><p>Faced with Meng Xing\u2019s attack, he extended his left foot forward. At the same time, the hammers in his hands made an upward movement followed by a loud shout, \u201cOpen!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dual God Strength Hammers were extremely large. When Zhou Weiqing was waving it, one in the back and one in front, it completely blocked all angles of attack Meng Xing had.</p><br/><p>In the next instance, her dragon claws fell on the Dual God Strength Hammers.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d She panicked as her body spun in the air instantly. She had not done it deliberately do. This was the result of the Dual God Strength Hammers.</p><br/><p>Originally, Meng Xing had only wanted to test Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength. Even though she was only using Sixth Jewel cultivation base, this did not take into account her physical strength. Just with her Dual Physical Jewels, she was extremely confident in herself. She assumed that she would be able to defeat him without unleashing any technique.</p><br/><p>However, the moment her dragon claws crashed with his dual hammers, something unexpected happened.</p><br/><p>On the \u2018smiling-face\u2019 hammer, one of her claw that was imbued with energy seemed to hit nothing. Meanwhile, the terrifying energy that came from the \u2018crying-face\u2019 hammer was far beyond her expectation. With one side weak and the other strong, Meng Xing was thrown up into the air and began spinning uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>How could Zhou Weiqing pass up such a good opportunity? Like a whip, his right leg stretched out and made a beeline straight for her waist.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation activated at once. 100 beads of Lightning Pearls appeared in her spinning trajectory without any warning. She was a true Heavenly King-tier master, how could he possibly show her any mercy? Now that he had gotten the upper hand with his battle tactics, he had to continue unleashing his power till she was completely defeated.</p><br/><p>However, at this time, Meng Xing\u2019s powerful strength began to show itself. At the first opportunity, she regained control of her own body. The body that was spinning uncontrollably in the air suddenly curled up. Similar to Zhou Weiqing, she extended a leg out and clashed with his right leg. At the same time, a faint hazy blue halo erupted out of her body all of a sudden. Tha halo was extremely gentle but instead of blocking the Lightning Pearls, it enveloped them before throwing them far, far away. The moment she enveloped the Lightning Pearls with the halo, the connection between them and Zhou Weiqing was instantly cut off as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Such remarkable control!\u2019 Zhou Weiqing marveled secretly in his heart. It was at this time that both of their legs collided fiercely.</p><br/><p>In the midst of a loud crash, the person who was at loss was none other than Meng Xing. Her curled body was directly kicked by Zhou Weiqing at least ten feet away. When she landed, she staggered seven to eight steps backward before she finally regained her footing.</p><br/><p>Meng Xing stared in astonishment at Zhou Weiqing. She could not accept this! Not forgetting she had the Power affinity for her Physical Jewels and was using Dual Physical Jewels. Strictly speaking, she was supposed to have a bigger advantage than him.</p><br/><p>On top of that, both of her legs were completely covered in the legendary armor set! She had been defeated in terms of strength by his bare right leg that was not covered by armor, not to mention that her entire right leg was tingling in numbness. How could she possibly not be surprised by this?</p><br/><p>Looking at her surprised face, Zhou Weiqing undoubtedly understood what she was wondering about. Chuckling, he asked, \u201cMeng Xing, have you forgotten about my background? I come from the Strength Legacy and the name isn\u2019t without reason. I can also tell you frankly that my legendary armor set is actually called the Ringless Ground Purging Set Which functions to purely boost the strength. Every time there\u2019s an additional piece, my strength will be doubled. Having just six pieces is more than enough to boost my strength by 64 folds. Putting aside the fact that you\u2019re suppressing your cultivation base, even under normal circumstances, if were were to complete purely in terms of strength, I would still not be afraid of you even if you unleash your Heavenly King-tier energy.,\u201d Of course, this was also under the circumstances that Zhou Weiqing was suppressing his own cultivation base.Otherwise, if he were to add his Saint Energy into his strength, he would dare to trade a few blows even if his opponent was a Heavenly Emperor-tier master.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

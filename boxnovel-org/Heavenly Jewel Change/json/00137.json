(2)</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p><b>Chapter 137 Triangular Basin, Ten Thousand Beast Heavens! (2)</b></p><br/><p>The Ten Thousand Beast Heavens was a place with an extremely complicated terrain, set in the mountainous regions of the north with various tall rolling mountains. Most important was the two lines of mountains that crossed the north of the WanShou Empire, of which there was one intersection of the two which was actually crossed with another mountain line, forming a triangular basin.</p><br/><p>Compared to the rest of the icy snow of the north, this particular triangular basin was at a much higher temperature than the rest of the surroundings; in fact, many vegetation that only grew in temperate climates could be found there. This unique basin was actually rather huge, and with such a suitable climate for living in, and over hundreds and thousands of years, more and more powerful Heavenly Beasts were either attracted here or grew strong here. As such, this triangular basin was known as the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ten Thousand Beast Heavens was a rich land abundant with natural resources all of types, with some of the greatest Heavenly Beasts, alone or in groups, living there. The Ten Thousand Beast Heavens truly lived up to its name as the most dangerous place in the Boundless Mainland. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, perhaps not many people in the entire mainland would have heard of this Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, but if they were to speak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, everyone had heard of it. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the Five Great Saint Lands, in terms of individual power, the strongest definitely belonged to the Heavenly Snow Mountain. And the Heavenly Snow Mountain was actually situated right deep in the middle of the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, one of the snowy peaks there. It could be said that the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens was like a guardian zone to the Heavenly Snow Mountain, while the Heavenly Snow Mountain ruled over this most dangerous area in the entire mainland. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As such, there was a saying that the Heavenly Jewel Island was easy to enter compared to the Heavenly Snow Mountain. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Heavenly Snow Mountain could be said to be formed slowly over thousands and tens of thousands of years as the strongest Heavenly Beasts in the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens gathered and grew, gaining the power of human form and after much fighting, slowly gathering together to form the Heavenly Snow Mountain. The </span><span style=\"\">Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers were not just the rulers of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, but also of the </span><span style=\"\">Ten Thousand Beast Heavens.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was also why the other Great Saint Lands were so afraid of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, as they could command all the powerful Heavenly Beasts within the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens. If the Five Great Saint Lands actually fought in the wars of the land, and the Heavenly Snow Mountain activated the Heavenly Beasts to join their armies, it would be a catastrophe for the entire mainland. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens was extremely dangerous, since it held some of the most powerful and rarest Heavenly Beasts in the world, it still had an unbelievable draw to Heavenly Jewel Masters. Everything else aside, if they could beat a wild Heavenly Beast and bring it close to death and Skill Stores from it, the success rate would be much higher than in a Skill Storing Palace. Furthermore, there were many treasures to be found in the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, and even the Heavenly Cores of the Heavenly Beasts were priceless treasures; no matter as medicines or in creating Consolidating Equipment Ink. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It could be said that as long as one entered the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, if he survived to leave, he would definitely earn an unbelievable profit. As long as one had the luck, who knew if he might even be able to pick up a Heavenly Core from the ground. After all, the number of Heavenly Beasts in the entire Ten Thousand Beast Heavens was just insanely high. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As such, every year, the number of Jewel Masters entering the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens was crazy high. Of course, the number that survived was extremely minimal. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Heavenly Snow Mountain did not have a strict control over the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens. As such, as long as they did not enter the restricted core area of the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, it would be unlikely they met any members from the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Even so, the powerful Heavenly Beasts of the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens was still an enormous deterrent force, and the deeper regions of the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens was considered a restricted zone, and no ordinary tribes could enter without permission. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Crossing the vast borders, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s party of six finally entered the WanShou Empire. If they were to claim they were not nervous, it would have been a lie. After all, to all of them this empire was a totally new world, alien to them. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The WanShou Empire did not have any cities, as they did not need such things. After moving along the road for two days, they finally saw the first small tribe. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As compared to the ZhongTian Empire\u2019s borders where their arrangement was filled with preparation against their enemies, as long as it wasn\u2019t the time to attack, the WanShou Empire did not even have any armies stationed at the borders. The various tribes would return to their tribal lands and do as they please. In history, none of the human empires had ever even thought of attacking them. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After all, what benefit would there be in attacking the WanShou Empire? The climate there was so cold that it was nearly impossible to live in, not to mention there wasn\u2019t much to rob easily as all the important treasures and ores were all deep within the WanShou Empire territory. Once they sent armies deep within, the result could be imagined. The WanShou Empire was so huge, and even if a million strong army attacked them, they would likely not be able to return.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould we stop to rest a while?\u201d Lin TianAo asked Zhou Weiqing. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll stop to rest a while.\u201d However, the one who replied was not Zhou Weiqing, but Zhan LingTian, still riding tall on his Ghost Demon Horse. His tone was that of a command, and he did not even look at the others, instead giving a hand signal to Shangguan Fei\u2019er as he moved towards the tribe ahead. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho does he think he is? Our leader?\u201d Ma Qun gave an angry, exasperated humph. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: \u201cLet him be.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ma Qun asked in a low tone: \u201cBoss, you aren\u2019t afraid of that fellow right?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to try sow discord, I know what I\u2019m doing. Come on, after rushing for two days, it\u2019s time for us to rest.\u201d It was already evening time, and so far up north, that meant the temperature was even lower than the usual chill. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Very quickly, the party had advanced to the front of the tribe. It was not very large, with almost fifty stout large tents occupying a flat land. Right beside the tents, there was a small stream, clearly the main reason why they had chosen to camp here. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Many of the WanShou Empire tribes were nomadic in nature, and clearly this was just a temporary settlement for this particular tribe. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Zhan LingTian reached the tribe, he jumped off his mount. At that point, two stout men walked out from the tribal encampment. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing had only seen the wolfman tribe members before, and in comparison, these two stout men were even taller and larger than the wolfmen. Another obvious difference was that they had a pair of horns on their head, looking rather strange. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seeing the party of humans approach their camp, the two stout men did not appear to be surprised. One of them walked forward to greet them, saying: \u201cHuman guests, do you want to have a rest in one of our tents before continuing on your journey? We have delicious deer milk and cheese.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rest of the party dismounted, and Zhan LingTian said proudly: \u201cGive us a few clean tents, we will rest here today.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The expressions of the two stout, horned men changed, and the one on the left said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we do not have too many extra tents, and we can only spare one. Ten gold coins a night, with food and drink included.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhan LingTian\u2019s expression changed as well as he snapped out: \u201cAsshole, you want us all to stay in a single tent?\u201d His was used to being arrogant in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, and all the younger disciples all listened to him, and it was not easy to change such a lofty attitude.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou dare to insult us?\u201d A ferocious light flashed in the eyes of the stout man on the left. With a quick step forward, his powerful body appearing before Zhan LingTian. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhan LingTian was considered extremely tall and well built by human standards, but in contrast to that stout man, he was at least half a head shorter. In that instant, his large hands struck out towards Zhan LingTian. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could Zhan LingTian possibly let his attack succeed. With a cold humph, his leg kicked out like lightning towards the stout man. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop, keep your cool.\u201d Zhou Weiqing\u2019s voice rang out right at that point. With a muffled crashing sound, Zhan LingTian\u2019s foot smashed against Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right foot, which he had barely managed to get up in time. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Although the horned stout man was not successfully kicked, the shockwaves from the clash of the two legs actually knocked him back. Clearly, if he had been kicked by Zhan LingTian, he would have probably died by now. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Zhan LingTian glared angrily at Zhou Weiqing. At this point, he had withdrawn his leg. With his cultivation level, he was shocked to find that his leg was actually feeling numb after his kick had been blocked by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s leg. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s surprise was even greater. After all, he had been using his Demonic Right Leg, the strongest part of his entire body. Although he had not used his Demonic Change State, Zhan LingTian had also not released his Heavenly Jewels. It could be said that both legs just now had been just purely a clash between their bodies and physical strength. Yet, in such a clash, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s leg had almost been knocked away. Just from that alone, he could tell how powerful Zhan LingTian\u2019s body was. No wonder Fei\u2019er had said that this fellow\u2019s overall power was even greater than her. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing did not show any of his inner thoughts, instead giving Zhan LingTian a significant look, saying: \u201cBro Zhan, how can we pick a fight here? Are you going to fight every tribe we come across? Don\u2019t forget our ultimate goal.\u201d As he said that, he turned to the two stout men and smiled faintly, saying: \u201cTwo big bros, I\u2019m sorry, my bro here has no other meaning, he just has a bad temper. One tent is fine. In such a weather, it is good to have a place to rest. As an apology and a sign of good faith, we will pay double to rest here, twenty gold coins. Is that okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how simple the WanShou Empire citizens were, they could easily tell that these youths in front of them were no ordinary folk. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing was paying extra, and they did not say anything more and brought the party into the encampment, finding a large tent for them. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as they entered the tent, before the party could seat down, Zhan LingTian strode right in front of Zhou Weiqing, saying angrily: \u201cI\u2019m warning you, don\u2019t try and interfere with my business again. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me if I take it out on you instead.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After saying that, he stalked off to the deepest part of the tent and sat down there. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lin TianAo, Crow and Ma Qun subconsciously turned to look at Zhou Weiqing. In their eyes, this Zhan LingTian was just too arrogant, and even they could barely tolerate it. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zhou Weiqing shook his head at them, signalling for them not to take action. He walked to the side and sat down as well, the faint smile still on his face. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shangguan Fei\u2019er looked on coolly from the side. She could not understand what Zhou Weiqing was thinking. That rascal was never one to take a disadvantage easily like that. Previously in the Lustre Spatial Realm, he had already dared to break Zhan LingTian\u2019s bones despite all odds. Now, with so many of them outnumbering Zhan LingTian, what was there to be afraid of? </span><i><span style=\"\">He must have some plot or scheme against Zhan LingTian\u2026 </span></i><span style=\"\">She thought to herself. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, Zhou Weiqing had a plot against him. With such a powerful thug like Zhan LingTian, how could Zhou Weiqing not want to make use of his talents fully. He would tolerate it for now, but although our dear Little Fatty was smiling so naturally, this young little rascal was definitely a petty person who would bear a grudge for a long time!</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

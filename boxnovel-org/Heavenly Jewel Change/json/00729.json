The aura of the Heavenly God-tier powerhouse almost pressured Zhou Weiqing onto the ground in an instant.</p><br/><p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing was not prepared at that point. Never had he thought that Dongfang Hanyue would make her move against him at this moment. During their previous conversation, her Heavenly Energy had fully recovered.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing remained perfectly seated as he could clearly feel under the pressure of her energy, that any of his movements would bring a bout of Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s attacks like a torrential storm.</p><br/><p>With a bitter smile, Zhou Weiqing looked at her and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this ingratitude?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue grunted, \u201cWhat good deeds have you done for me? So what if it\u2019s ingratitude? This is an abandoned island, who\u2019s watching?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said painstakingly, \u201cAh, it was never a good idea to be kind! However, are you giving me the excuse to snatch the Spatial Transportation Stone as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue looked at him in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re confident in yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, and said, \u201cAside from being confident, I think I\u2019ve other chances as well. If I haven\u2019t any confidence, what else can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>A strong killing intent flowed from Dongfang Hanyue instantly, and the terrifying pressure sinked the sand around Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>The pressure from the Heavenly God-tier powerhouse was still quite horrifying. However, Zhou Weiqing was no longer feigning his cultivation base of a mere six jewels.</p><br/><p>Facing the pressure form Dongfang Hanyue, he still remained seated and observed her calmly. No hostility could be seen from his eyes, and his gaze was extremely gentle, as if he was staring at his wife throwing fits.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be making my move,\u201d Dongfang Hanyue said menacingly and stepped forward at the same time, strengthening her aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Zhou Weiqing stretched his arms out wide with a smile on his face, as though extending his generosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really not fear death?\u201d Dongfang Hanyue raised her right arm gradually and gestured toward Zhou Weiqing from afar, with unstable Darkness Heavenly Energy concentrating in her palm. It would not be difficult for the mighty strike of a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse to destroy the whole beach.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do, why wouldn\u2019t I? I fear death very much. Who wouldn\u2019t be afraid of dying?\u201d I\u2019ve yet to live enough. There\u2019s still tons of beauties waiting for me. However, you won\u2019t kill me. You can\u2019t bring yourself to do so,\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked at Dongfang Hanyue cheekily.</p><br/><p>Inhaling a deep breath, confusion filled Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes. Her raised arm was gradually lowered and placed on her chest. Her pearly white teeth bit her bottom lip softly.</p><br/><p>It was also at this moment that the rain clouds in the skies had dispersed, and a bright moon hung high up in the sky. The gentle moonlight shone, and under the illumination of the moonlight along with the background of the ocean, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s gaze was dazed.</p><br/><p>The lovely moon shining onto the ocean along with a beauty on the beach \u2014 the alluring scene making his heart throb subconsciously.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue stepped forward once more and finally made her move.</p><br/><p>However, that move was not directed at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cShraa\u2014\u201d the sound of something breaking was not ear-piercing. Instead, it sounded like a barrier between the two being torn apart.</p><br/><p>The next instant, under the luminosity of the bright moonlight, what appeared before Zhou Weiqing was a body like white jade and suet; beautiful without imperfections, as if it was radiating holy light.</p><br/><p>With another stride forward, her legs had already stepped onto the gravel near his feet. Both her legs were bent, and she sat kneeling between his legs just like that. Ten long slender fingers shot out abruptly, grabbing his chest and pulling him closer.</p><br/><p>Little Fatty Zhou swallowed a gulp of saliva. Even he himself felt that the events unfolding before him were unrealistic. He mumbled, \u201cDon\u2019t be too rough, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue stared at him, clenching her teeth, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>With several violent sideway strips of her hands, the shrill sound could be heard again. This time, what was exposed was his wide bronze chest, which was as solid as an iron wall. Her lips met his almost in an insane manner.</p><br/><p>However, when the two pairs of lips truly made contact, he clearly felt that her cold lips were shivering. \u2018Now, these are her true feelings\u2019 he thought.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s movements were crazy. She even pushed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body onto the beach and gripped his wrists tightly. However, for someone who had far richer battles, her kiss was very inexperienced.</p><br/><p>This kiss had shaken the heavens and earth, dried up oceans and melted rocks, and got the primal blood of a certain someone boiling.</p><br/><p>It was only until the two had to part after an extended period of suffocation, had the embrace come to a halt.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue pressed her petite body onto Zhou Weiqing, the smooth and flexible body had almost made someone moan.</p><br/><p>The two were panting, and because of the incessant gasps, the intimate contact between certain body parts grew closer to one another.</p><br/><p>After her panting subsided, there was no movement from Dongfang Hanyue, whereas a certain someone who was already in a climatic blood-boiling state could no longer contain himself. It felt good to be pushed in such a rough manner, but to stop midway rendered him speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that, shall we continue?\u201d Little Fatty Zhou tested the waters.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue stuck her face close to his chest, and said, sightly panting, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me not to be too rough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cActually, what I wanted to say was for the storm to be more violent.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a sudden rise of her head, Zhou Weiqing spotted how Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s face grew as red as a fully ripe apple. She stared at him with blurring focus, and said, \u201cBut, I, don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u201d While she was uttering the sentence, her hands, previously holding onto Zhou Weiqing tightly, had loosened its grip.</p><br/><p>\u2018How were the primal characteristics of men invoked?\u2019 he pondered. He was not clear of what the others had experienced, but he felt as if he had really transformed into a Dark Demon God Tiger at that very moment\u2026</p><br/><p>The next moment, the offending party and the defending party had switched sides, and the Blackfiend Dragon-woman had finally switched places to be on the receiving end. The Dark Demon God Tiger felt exactly like he had captured the most delicious prey, and all of a sudden, thunder roared and lightning struck. The storm really did come\u2026</p><br/><p>Rain clouds drifted, blocking the shy moon, and among the heavens and earth in the dark, only the ocean, abandoned island, beach and the alluring, seductive sounds of a dragon\u2019s moan and a tiger\u2019s roar could be heard.</p><br/><p>Even though she had lived for 29 years, he was her first man. The first man to walk into her heart and capture her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is what I owe him, I\u2019ve lost that day,\u2019 she thought. In the beginning, Dongfang Hanyue kept repeating her reasons in her heart. However, when a certain heated masculine body had conquered her everything, other than the looming sounds of a dragon\u2019s moans \u2013 sometimes loud and sometimes soft \u2013 she was incapable of any other thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u2018He had said what he said, but he does not regret. What about her?\u2019 she wondered. Similarly, she did not regret it either.</p><br/><p>Even if she knew very well that there was no future for her, and that she might lose this man in the next instant, she still surrendered herself to him without hesitation.</p><br/><p>It might sound absurd, but in Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s life, her most beautiful memory might very well be this scene of insanity. Sometimes, not everything requires a conclusion. To enjoy the process and preserve the indelible memories might even be better than a well-planned ending.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue had never thought that she would become so vulnerable, like a tiny boat succumbing to the torrential waves of the ocean; continuously being flung up and down, up and down.</p><br/><p>The madness of the night continued until sunrise.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue held onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s solid arms and fell into a deep slumber. She was too exhausted. However, a sweet smile lingered on her lovely, vulnerable face.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not fall asleep, despite the soft blankets spread beneath them. They were initially prepared by Zhou Weiqing and Bing\u2019er when they first came to the Mysterious Heavenly Palace by the Neptune Shuttle. He would never have expected for the blanket to be of use in this setting.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was experiencing complete sensual gratification with his unquenchable libido. To describe Zhou Weiqing at this moment in this manner would be more than apt.</p><br/><p>However, his facial expression was weird. It was impossible to not feel strange! The objective of his travel here was for the Spatial Transportation Stone. It could be said that his stand was directly against the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, but now, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master was lying in his arms.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the Yin energy of the Heavenly God-tier beauty was pushing the Saint Energy in his body to a sharp increase. Dongfang Hanyue also possessed four Heavenly Jewel attributes, and she herself was very powerful. It could be observed from her fusion with the Blackfiend Dragon against the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Once he received her virgin Yin energy, it was impossible for his cultivation to not experience an upgrade. He even reached the stage where he was near to breaking through the boundaries of the 38th-tier. Under normal cultivation circumstances, even if Saint Energy had the powerful natural abilities to unify Atmospheric Energy of various attributes, it was not easy to break through that tier, especially without half a year\u2019s accumulation,</p><br/><p>However, the benefits Dongfang Hanyue received from Zhou Weiqing were even greater. As she had inherited Heavenly Energy from her father to be upgraded to Heavenly God Tier, the bottleneck imposed on her was much greater than the normal Heavenly God-tier powerhouses. After Zhou Weiqing\u2019s healing with his Saint Energy on top of the prior connection of their souls and body, her bottleneck has weakened a lot after receiving the Saint Energy. At this point, she would never have thought of it on her own.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Dongfang Hanyue groaned, which had almost ignited the flames within Zhou Weiqing. She moved closer to his embrace and found a more comfortable position.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmm, what\u2019s this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhou Weiqing noticed something touching his arm softly. Subconsciously, he lowered his head and saw that it was a pendant not very large in size,</p><br/><p>The pendant was a silverish white metal, in the shape of a diamond. It was large, hanging around the beautiful, slender neck of Dongfang Hanyue by a fine silver chain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

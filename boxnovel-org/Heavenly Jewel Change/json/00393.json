After all, didn\u2019t his father often give forth such pressure on him whenever he made mistakes?</p><br/><p>Upon thinking about his father, Sealed and in danger, Zhou Weiqing instantly felt a rush of rage welling up within. The pressure he had been under suddenly seemed to vanish.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to make a bet with Legion Commander.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBet? Do you think you have the qualification to do so?\u201d Shen Ji\u2019s gaze was like a sword, piercing right into Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing did not back down at all. \u201cLegion Commander Shen Ji, if I do not remember wrongly, our Ruffian Battalion is part of the northern armies, but not directly under your Seventh Legion. As for qualification, today you are all here in civilian attire, not your army attire\u2026 that means you are here to resolve this in a personal level. In such a case, how can there be any sort of qualification needed?\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of surprise flashed in Shen Ji\u2019s eyes. \u201cNo wonder Shen Bu was forced into such a tight corner, you little fellow is quite somebody. Alright, speak then, what sort of bet do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said: \u201cVery simple. I\u2019m sure all of you here today are Heavenly Jewel Master powerhouses right? In that case, send your strongest to fight with me. If you win, I will do as you say, returning everything to you, and you can also deal with me as you please. However, if he or she loses, then we\u2019ll bury this incident. The heavy cavalry soldier and horses equipment I will return, but you will have to pay for it, and the horses and bows I will keep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Shen Ji laughed heartily. \u201cIt has been a long time since I had a good workout. I\u2019ll play with you today then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, let me.\u201d A flash, and Shangguan Fei\u2019er appeared beside Zhou Weiqing. However, at this time, she had already changed back to her male disguise.Although Shangguan Fei\u2019er had not seen this Shen Ji before, he was still a high ranking officer, and she would not want to be discovered so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d Zhou Weiqing looked curiously at Shangguan Fei\u2019er. For her to intervene at such a time, that could only mean one thing \u2013 even she did not think he could defeat this Legion Commander Shen Ji.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about both of you at once?\u201d Shen Ji beamed.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019\u2019\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s your own words\u2026 Fei\u2019er, let\u2019s go together then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019\u2019er started at that, pinching him on the waist as she said: \u201cCan you be more shameless? Don\u2019t you have any face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not feel any sense of shame as he said: \u201cWhat is face worth? I have to think for my over thousand brothers. This is not the time to think about face. Wait until we win then we can think about such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Bu smile coldly: \u201cYou two puny fleas, clowns, you dare challenge my senior elder brother, humph, you are asking for your own death. My senior elder brother is a eight Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, a Mid Level Zong Stage Master, not someone you can strike so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of temper did Shangguan Fei\u2019er have?\u201d Upon hearing that, she said disdainfully: \u201cMid Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, so what, do you think that means he is invincible already? If so, what does a Heavenly King Stage Master or beyond count for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Ji said: \u201cEnough. Empty talk is useless. Since this is a bet, let\u2019\u2019s begin.\u201d Although he said that, he did not have any notion of taking action first. In his eyes, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er were juniors, not of the same generation, and with his own status and rank in mind, how could he possibly attack first?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave Shangguan Fei\u2019er a meaningful look. They had traveled together for quite some time, and seeing the wicked look in his eyes, Shangguan Fei\u2019\u2019er knew that he was going to do. She made a face at him, then in the next instant, she charged towards Shen Ji in a flash.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Shangguan Fei\u2019er had already taken action, Zhou Weiqing did not rush, casually releasing his Overlord Bow, as if their teamwork had already disjointed.</p><br/><p>At this point, the rest of the Peerless Battalion, soldiers, Squad Leaders, Company Leaders, everyone rushed over.</p><br/><p>They had all seen Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s strength, but none of them knew what this peerless beauty\u2019s strength could truly reach. Seeing them all fight, how could these violent fellows not be interested. Furthermore, this concerned whether or not the equipment they had gotten the last few days would be returned or not.</p><br/><p>Shen Ji did not look down on Shangguan Fei\u2019\u2019er, as an army officer, he would not underestimate any opponent, as that was the worst mistake. As such, when he said for the fight to begin, though he did not attack first, he unleashed his Heavenly Jewels.</p><br/><p>Eight of the similar type Physical Jewels like Zhou Weiqing\u2019s, Icy Jade glimmering in the light. Shen Ji did not attempt to conceal his arms, and the Elemental Jewels on his left wrist was clearly the gold coloured diamond of the Earth Attribute. He was clearly a Strength / Earth type Mid Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Master.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s sleeves covered her right Physical Jewels, instead revealing the Wind Attribute Elemental Jewels on the left. When Shen Ji saw the six Elemental Jewels around her right wrist, a hint of surprise appeared in his eyes. Although Shangguan Fei\u2019er was in disguise, \u2018he\u2019 still looked around over twenty years old, even younger than Shen Bu.</p><br/><p>Six Jewels?!</p><br/><p>Shen Ji did not have more time to think, as Shangguan Fei\u2019e\u2019r had already reached him.</p><br/><p>However, his reaction was swift and direct, striking out with his right fist, a thick Heavenly Energy covering it along with the yellow glint of Earth Attribute. Without even using any Skills, his fist had already created a one metre long yellow light barrier in the air, clearly a mix of offense and defense.</p><br/><p>Towards such a powerful fist, Shangguan Fei\u2019er once again showed her shocking close combat talent. Just as it seemed like she would be struck by the fist, no one knew how she did it, but her body actually stopped in mid air, and the next instant she actually spun off to the side.</p><br/><p>A thin glimmer of white light appeared around Shangguan Fei\u2019er, and the position that she stopped was just exactly at the furthest distance of Shen Ji\u2019s attack. With that spin, it was as if she glided across the yellow light barrier.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s movement was just too quick, and for most of the audience, they just felt a dazzle in front of their eyes, and she had already appeared beside Shen Ji, her hands in a claw striking out towards his head.</p><br/><p>Shen Ji was also startled by Shangguan Fei\u2019er, as he had never met with anyone dealing with his direct punch in such a fashion. More importantly, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s actions were just too quick and harmonized, with everything done so smoothly to completion, and even he had not seen clearly.</p><br/><p>Although his cultivation level was higher than Shangguan Fei\u2019er and he was confident that \u2018he\u2019 would not be able to harm him, just being struck by a six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master was definitely not something that was a good thing. Furthermore, this was in front of so many of his subordinates, and he could not lose face like that.</p><br/><p>Shen Ji\u2019s right leg struck down hard on the ground, and with a loud explosion, a thick yellow light rose from below his feet, wrapping his entire body in a light barrier. It was one of the powerful Earth Attribute defensive Skills, the Jingang Shield. He planned to use this Jingang Shield Skill to knock Shangguan Fei\u2019er away, to pressure her with his own higher cultivation level. Alas, that was actually putting himself on the disadvantage, as Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s strength was far beyond his expectation. Just as his foot had stomped on the ground, Shangguan Fei\u2019er had also struck her feet on the ground lightly, her entire body leaving the ground, her right hand still in claw fashion. At this moment, a thick dark-gold light burst forth from her body; it was the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura.</p><br/><p>The dark gold light and the yellow light clashed right together. The Jingang Shield and Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura were both defensive Skills, and in theory, they should not interfere with each other. However, at this point, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s right hand was just so close to Shen Ji\u2019s head, and the two masses of energy just clashed together.</p><br/><p>The result was clear. The Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura was a protective one, not offensive, and Shangguan Fei\u2019er could not use it to destroy the Jingang Shield. However, Shen Ji\u2019s cultivation level was not more than twelve stages above hers, and the Jinggang Shield was also unable to affect the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura.</p><br/><p>As such, the Jingang shield formed, but Shangguan Fei\u2019er was not thrown back by it. At this point, from her right hand to shoulder, her Consolidated bracer-claw appeared.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019\u2019s claws were not the same as Zhou Weiqing; just the claw on the dark gold gloves alone were more than seven inches long.</p><br/><p>Shen Ji was after all an experienced fighter on the battlefield, and when he saw the brilliant light of the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, he instantly realised that things were not going well.</p><br/><p>A God Tier Consolidated Equipment! That was definitely not something that an ordinary person could have! Even though he was a Legion Commander commanding a hundred thousand troops, he did not have a single piece of Consolidated Equipment at that level.</p><br/><p>Seeing the dark gold light, he did not care about face any longer, and instantly reacted. He jumped backward swiftly, circulating his Heavenly Energy to the maximum, and releasing all his Consolidated Equipment as well. At the same time, he also unleashed a Rock Armour Skill.</p><br/><p>A thick, earth-yellow armour appeared around him. Besides the long warhammer in his hands, the other seven were a full set.</p><br/><p>Helmet, twin shoulder pauldrons, chest armour, girdle, twin greaves. A seven piece Set. This was already a Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Set.</p><br/><p>Another layer of thick yellow light also emanated forth as the Consolidating Equipment Set was released, blocking Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s right hand claw momentarily. At the same time, the Rock Armour appeared around the Consolidated Armour.</p><br/><p>Despite that, the entire audience still heard an earsplitting chafing sound. Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s body was forcefully pushed back by the yellow light of Shen Ji\u2019s Consolidated Equipment Set effect. At the same time, Shen Ji also made use of the impact to fall back. Even so, Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s right claw had already left a mark on him.</p><br/><p>The Rock Armour was forcefully torn apart, and on five deep, terrifying claw marks were left on his Consolidated chest armour and girdle. Who knew what would have happened if that strike had not been blocked by his Rock Armour, if the Consolidated Equipment would have been shredded apart.</p><br/><p>Shen Ji stumbled back four, almost five feet before he finally regained his balance.</p>\n</div>"}

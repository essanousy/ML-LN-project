Meng Xing would be able to return to her original level after a few days of recovery.</p><br/><p>If he really managed to drain a Heavenly Emperor\u2019s entire store of energy, including his or her core energy and convert it to Saint Energy, then Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation would probably reach the level of a Heavenly King overnight.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was an impossible mission. The fact that his own constitution would not be able to sustain such an influx of energy aside, he would not be able to apprehend a Heavenly Emperor long enough for him to drain all of his or her energy.</p><br/><p>Regardless, today\u2019s match brought him abundant benefits. After converting all the energy he drained from Meng Xing into Saint Energy and mixing it with his own, Zhou Weiqing had bypassed at least three months of training.</p><br/><p>In fact, had Meng Xing begin to use her Heavenly Emperor\u2019s power at first notice, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Demonic Drain would have been able to be sustained for only a short while. However, due to her bet with Zhou Weiqing and the impressive terrorizing power of Zhou Fatty\u2019s lewd Dragon Claw, she came out of it at a losing end. She not only allowed him to drain so much of her energy but she had also almost lost control of her body to his teasing caress. Her intention was to take revenge on Zhou Weiqing but in the end, it was she, the Heavenly Emperor, who received the short end of the stick.</p><br/><p>From that day onwards, Zhou Weiqing did not run into Meng Xing for as long as a month. That had its bright side to it \u2013 at least he wouldn\u2019t be beaten up for no good reason. Having to suppress his real power, including his Saint Energy in a fight was definitely no fun at all. Therefore, he chose to stay in his room to conduct his honest cultivation training with Shangguan Bing\u2019er. Even though the effect was not as good as when he trained with Tian\u2019er, he already had a good mastery over the Saint Energy, so he improved very quickly. However, the amount of Heavenly Energy needed to level up after the Nine Jewels was still disproportionately high; a great bank of energy was needed to breakthrough from level 37 to level 38.</p><br/><p>These few days, Zhou Weiqing had also received some news through the grapevine. The whole Mysterious Heavenly Palace was in the midst of preparation for their audience with the Blackfiend Dragon. The ships that were meant to sail were all halted and the entire Mysterious Heavenly Palace was in a heightened bustle.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonorary Master Zhou,\u201d A familiar voice from outside the door said. It did not sound like Meng Xing\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing opened the door to let Nie Han \u2013 who was also a God Tier Master \u2013 in.</p><br/><p>Nie Han laughed when he saw Zhou Weiqing, adding, \u201cHonorary Master Zhou sure enjoys the company of solitude! You have not left your room ever since you moved into our Mysterious Heavenly Castle other than to satisfy your basic needs. To be able to create art out of the lonely road of cultivation, no wonder Honorary Master Zhou is so accomplished at such a young age.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing answered with a smile, \u201cCompared to the various elders, I am still thousands of steps behind, I will have to train harder to catch up.\u201d His real thought was the complete opposite of what he said. \u2018Why would I step out of my room? To let your people from the Mysterious Heavenly Castle spy on me? Compared to the Boundless Mainland, the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland is still more inferior by a notch. If not for the Space Teleportation Stone, who would want to come to this godforsaken place? Furthermore, the Mysterious Heavenly Castle is choked full with powerful hidden threats, how am I going to survive if I don\u2019t train harder?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHonorary Master Nie, how is the preparation for the hunt the Dreadfiend Sea Naga coming along? I have been anticipating it. After all, the preparation had been going on for quite some time, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked.</p><br/><p>Nie Han answered, \u201cThat is why I have come today. We will depart to slaughter the Dreadfiend Sea Naga in another five days. It\u2019s the Castle Master\u2019s wish that you remain home to safeguard the place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he did not explicate it, Zhou Weiqing understood this was because they were worried should he be not powerful enough.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cThis kind of opportunity comes once in a lifetime. Senior Blackfiend Dragon has promised to protect me. How will I have the courage to see Senior Blackfiend Dragon if I hide at home? I must join this journey. I thank Honorary Master Nie for the concern but my mind is made up. My wife will stay behind in my stead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nie Han nodded and replied, \u201cIf that is your wish, then I will understand. I was only tasked with informing you of this news after all. Since you have made up your mind, then you might want to start preparing soon. As I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, we will depart in another five days. I shall take my leave because I still have to discuss the battle strategy with the other elders.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing sent Nie Han away, his eyes glowed as he closed the door behind him. The moment he had been waiting for so long had finally arrived.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er came to Zhou Weiqing and grabbed his big hand, communicating to him through telepathy, \u201cThey seem to underestimate you very much, you are not even invited to join the battle strategy discussion. I have a bad feeling about this, Little Fatty. Why don\u2019t you bow out and stay here with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing hugged Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s waist and pecked her on her lips. \u201cSilly girl, there will be so many powerful individuals that they will probably have me only stand there and watch. Or do you lack the confidence in your husband\u2019s ability to protect himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er raised her head to look him right in the eye, adding, \u201cLittle Fatty, you have to remember this \u2014 if you die out there, I will never suffer this life alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s heart skipped a beat and his grip that held Shangguan Bing\u2019er had tightened.</p><br/><p>Five days passed in a blink of an eye. The morning of the sixth day, Nie Han personally came to call on Zhou Weiqing. They were to gather at the cliff outside the Mysterious Heavenly Castle.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er followed her to the door. She knew that women are unable to stand in the way of her man\u2019s dreams, so despite her ill-feelings about this, she did not stop him. She believed with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation, he would be able to save the skin on his back, to say the least.</p><br/><p>The people who gathered at the cliff were all notable characters from the Mysterious Heavenly Castle. There were the Palace Master, Dongfang, the four Supreme Elders, and twelve elders. Even Meng Xing who Zhou Weiqing had not seen for many days was present.</p><br/><p>However, Meng Xing acted like she did not even know him; she didn\u2019t even glance his way. Zhou Weiqing did not think it was a good idea to greet her at such a public occasion.</p><br/><p>After the Palace Master confirmed that everyone was present, she announced solemnly, \u201cSend the signal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Water raised his right hand and a bolt of dark lightning shot out from his palm and down into the deep valley.</p><br/><p>A moment later, a low growl of a dragon rose from underneath. The atmosphere and energy around them started to vibrate.</p><br/><p>The faces of the elders from the Mysterious Heavenly Castles were drawn with respect and deference.</p><br/><p>In the time taken to inhale ten breaths, the large body of the Blackfiend Dragon rose to the sky. His enormous wings, which were shaped like two pieces of dark clouds, flapped as he flew into the sky. After circling the air for a while, he descended slowly before the gathered crowd.</p><br/><p>Under the leadership of the Palace Master, everyone yelled out in unison, \u201cLord Dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon harrumphed to acknowledge their existence. The first individual his gaze fell on was Zhou Weiqing. He nodded at him as a low voice reverberated through the area, \u201cGet on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The Palace Master answered as she leaped into the air before landing on the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s back. The rest did not dare to dawdle and followed suit.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Weiqing realized that not all elders came along. Out of the twelve Heavenly King-tier elders, only half of them tagged along. The rest was going to stay behind at the Mysterious Heavenly Castle \u2014 obviously to keep watch over it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not let the surprise show on his face. However, he did surreptitiously share a look with Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>According to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s original prediction, the entire Mysterious Heavenly Palace would join the mission to take down an opponent as powerful as the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. After all, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace did not have many enemies at the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland; there was no need for them to have too many powerful elders staying behind to guard it. If that was the case, after he claimed the Space Teleportation Stone, he would contact Shangguan Bing\u2019er at first notice and the person left behind to guard the Mysterious Heavenly Castle would not be able to stop her even if she wanted to leave. Now, the plan would have to change. Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s current cultivation and even with an additional Wings of the Wind God, it would not be sufficient to enable her to escape the apprehension of six Heavenly King Elders. The look Zhou Weiqing gave her communicated his advice for her to be extra careful.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded knowingly.</p><br/><p>However, even though the Mysterious Heavenly Palace did not send out everyone, they definitely deployed their main forces. The Mysterious Heavenly Palace Master leading three God Tier Masters, four Supreme Elders and six normal Elders, the fourteen of them combined with the God Tier Blackfiend Dragon definitely represented ninety percent of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon was large enough to accommodate more than ten people on his back without the need of squeezing together. His giant wings flapped once and his enormous body shot into the sky instantly, heading west.</p><br/><p>Even though this was not the first time Zhou Weiqing saw a giant dragon, it was certainly his first time riding on one\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>The Blackfiend Dragon had a sharp protrusion on his back that just so happened to shelter the group from the current as he charged through the skies. As they used their cultivation to attach their bodies to the back of the Blackfiend Dragon, their journey could possibly be considered a stable one.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhou Weiqing had the opportunity to be so physically close to a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. When the Blackfiend Dragon took off, his heart soared with it as well.</p><br/><p>After the Blackfiend Dragon entered the skies, he was surprised to notice the clumps of dark clouds surrounding them. Utilizing the acute detection power of his Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing could discern clearly, that these dark clouds were not summoned by the Blackfiend Dragon. They were formed naturally; quite literally out of thin air.</p><br/><p>Naturally, these were not simple dark clouds but they were Demonic Clouds formed from coagulation of dark and evil energy. They were reacting to the energy radiating from the Blackfiend Dragon as if the dragon was laying judgment to the heavens and earth.</p><br/><p>The current in the air was there only to support the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s gigantic body; it did not put up any resistance. There was a blast of wind from the front.</p><br/><p>This was real power! Including Meng Xing, even though there were at least six Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouses on the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s back, Zhou Weiqing could tell before a Heavenly God powerhouse, that a Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouse was but a toddler learning how to walk in comparison. Even with the combined forces of all these people, they would be no match for the Blackfiend Dragon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

All of the damaged meridians had been healed from her cultivation, even though there was no training. Most of her Heavenly Energy had recovered by itself. Subconsciously, she also felt that her limits, initially imposed due to raising her powers with a special method had decreased. The meridians in her body were bathed in faint silverish white rays and were stronger than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d stretching her body with might, Dongfang Hanyue let out a soft moan. The powers in her limbs made her feel comfortable and expressions of enjoyment could be seen from her pretty face.</p><br/><p><em>Pfft. </em>The dry food in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands fell into the firepit; his eyes almost falling off from its sockets. Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s stretching motions fully emphasized her alluring body lines. In addition to the attractive moan, it made the beast within a certain someone boil in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you please not do this? You\u2019re seducing people to commit crimes.\u201d Zhou Weiqing said while swallowing his saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Dongfang Hanyue rolled her eyes.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue sat on the other side of the bonfire, her arms hugging her knees. Without sparing a glance at Zhou Weiqing, she mumbled, \u201cTell me stories of your Boundless Mainland, and yourself too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zhou Weiqing responded. From his eyes, he seemed to be recalling his memories. He was not hiding, and there was nothing to hide either. He gradually started recounting his experiences.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was born in a small country named the Heavenly Bow Empire on the Boundless Mainland. In the beginning, I could never become a Heavenly Jewel Master, until one fine day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was only in this twenties, his experiences were so rich. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s stories took four hours although it was already his summarized version.</p><br/><p>It was now late night and the two had eaten much of the dry food. Zhou Weiqing had lost count of the times he had added the firewood obtained from the woods behind him into the bonfire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you want our Spatial Transportation Stone then?\u201d Dongfang Hanyue inquired with curiosity.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had told almost all of his important experiences, including those of his romantic affairs. However, he did not see the need to explain his purpose of obtaining the Spatial Transportation Stone.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, and smiled softly, \u201cThis is a secret. I\u2019ll tell you if you give me the Spatial Transportation Stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on,\u201d Dongfang Hanyue replied with a grunt, \u201cIf you\u2019re not telling, that\u2019s fine with me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two fell into a momentary silence; only the crackling sounds of the fire could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to you, my experiences are far simpler. Aren\u2019t you curious about how I got to possess the powers of a Heavenly Emperor or the reputation of being a God Tier Master?\u201d Dongfang Hanyue asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded; he was curious indeed.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue mumbled, \u201cActually, you don\u2019t need to doubt yourself. Your talents are far superior to mine. I\u2019m sure that if it was only self-cultivation, I would never possess powers the way you do, despite being several years older than you. Most of my cultivation is external.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExternal?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue replied, \u201cYou should\u2019ve noticed. The higher ranks of our Mysterious Heavenly Palace have all inherited the powers of Darkness Attribute. In fact, this is the Blackfiend Dagon Bloodline flowing in our body. The bloodlines of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace, especially for me as the Palace Master\u2019s heir is a result of our ancestor being an offspring formed by the fusion of the Blackfiend Dragon and a human. So, in a sense, I\u2019m not a pure human being, but a dragon-human hybrid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy ancestor, transformed into a human being through the cultivation of the transfiguration technique, married a human woman, and then had descendants like us. Combined with the physique of Blackfiend Dragon as well as the wisdom and talents of humans, the foundation of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was formed. This was how the Mysterious Heavenly Palace was built. There was also the Blackfiend Dragon\u2019s protection along the way. This was how the Darkness Attribute came about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, we call ourselves the Dragon Clan. Among the Dragon Clan, there\u2019s an unwritten rule, one that has been passed down. When the former Palace Master is about to die, he\u2019ll be able to channel his cultivation base to the next Palace Master. Although the complete cultivation base cannot be received, with this inheritance, it allows the next Palace Master to possess the greatest power possible in the shortest amount of time. This inheritance is only possible within the purest bloodline of our Dragon Clan. I\u2019m the inheritor of his generation. My father had forcefully made his way to the Heavenly God-tier but failed and gravely injured himself. Before he died, he channeled the cultivation base he had accumulated through his whole life to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis form of inheritance may allow me to promptly possess the powers of Heavenly God-tier, but since it came too easily and I haven\u2019t accumulated sufficient experience, I\u2019m only limited to the cultivation base of a Heavenly God Tier in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Zhou Weiqing finally understood the origins of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. The information Dongfang Hanyue had told him was the secrets of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. However, she had revealed everything without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the Palace Master Dongfang? Who is he? Is he also a Supreme Elder?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked.</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue shook her head and said, \u201cShe\u2019s my mother. My mother is ruling the Mysterious Heavenly Palace alongside me to aid me in holding down the elders. Nevertheless, I\u2019m the key ruler. The first Palace Master you met was me, and the next was my mother as I was then required to show myself as the God Tier Master Meng Xing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realization dawned on Zhou Weiqing, \u201cNo wonder I felt a difference the during the second meeting. It was because there was a change in the person I was meeting. Nonetheless, the mask of your Mysterious Heavenly Palace is magical indeed. I can\u2019t even distinguish between male and female.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s eyes turned blurry, \u201cFor most people, the Mysterious Heavenly Palace is always an untouchable existence. What they don\u2019t know is the loneliness of being a Palace Master. Your experiences can take up a few hours, but mine could just be summarized within these few sentences. Had I been given the choice, I\u2019d rather become an ordinary human being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cDestiny may have chosen you, but you can attempt to alter it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue smiled bitterly, \u201cChange? How? I\u2019m responsible for ensuring the legacy of our bloodline and sustaining the ruling position of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. All I can do is to let the Mysterious Heavenly Palace remain strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, all of a sudden, a surge of powerful aura exploded from her body, Dongfang Hanyue stood up slowly and directed her stern gaze at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cMy powers have now fully recovered.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

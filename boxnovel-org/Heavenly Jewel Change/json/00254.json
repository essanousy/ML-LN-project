However, she couldn\u2019t look backwards and so she didn\u2019t see how Zhou Weiqing had changed.</p><br/><p>Moments earlier, when she had grabbed Zhou Weiqing, his body had finally stopped alternating between those ephemeral flashes of gray light.\u00a0Behind him appeared a gray figure that was just as tall as he was, and it took a step forwards and merged into his body.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the Hate Ground No Handle Set on his body changed.\u00a0Its dark-gold color changed to become a translucent, crystalline gray.\u00a0His entire aura underwent an utterly earthshaking change as well.</p><br/><p>Lonely, ancient, cold, remorseless\u2026 and boundlessly evil.</p><br/><p>In this instant, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes finally opened.\u00a0His eyes were filled with that unlimited evil gray, and he himself seemed to be bathed in evil.</p><br/><p>He stepped forward, moving out from behind Dongfang Hanyue.\u00a0His body had been completely changed as well.\u00a0The Dual Legendary Warhammers in his hands had actually transformed into a gray liquid that instantly merged into his arms, while the Yin-Yang Giant Spirit Palms also transformed.\u00a0The right side transformed into a tiger paw, while the left side transformed into a draconic claw.\u00a0He had instantly transformed to become much larger.\u00a0He had actually gone straight into the second mode of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, \u2018Like Dragon Equivalent Tiger\u2019.</p><br/><p>His right leg still transformed into a hook, but this time it was a completely gray hook.\u00a0A wave of gray light instantly burst out of his body, transforming him into a gray meteor that smashed straight towards the Terror Sea Dragon.</p><br/><p>This time, he didn\u2019t have the terrifying aura of the Demon God\u2026 but when he flew forwards, the Water Attribute energies in his path which had previously stifled him actually melted away on their own, revealing a truly empty \u2018tunnel\u2019 in the skies.</p><br/><p>By the time Dongfang Hanyue saw him, he had already traversed nearly half the distance to the Terror Sea Dragon.\u00a0His entire body lashed out in a strange arc, using some sort of simply inconceivable movement to spin around and launch a vicious kick with his right leg against the Terror Sea Dragon.</p><br/><p>After entering the \u2018Like Dragon Equivalent Tiger\u2019 mode, all of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s physical attributes had increased by a terrifying amount.\u00a0In this state he was unable to use the vast majority of his techniques, but his physical prowess had risen to an utterly terrifying level.</p><br/><p>The Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s attention had been completely focused on Dongfang Hanyue.\u00a0Zhou Weiqing\u2019s sudden attack had caught it completely by surprise.\u00a0However, as a Heavenly God powerhouse it still was able to quickly react with an absolutely explosive level of power.</p><br/><p>The Water atmospheric energies instantly condensed, transforming into many barriers of ice that appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0At the same instant, the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s enormous body swiveled violently, sending its thick draconic tail smashing out at Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare!\u201d\u00a0Dongfang Hanyue turned pale.\u00a0She naturally knew just how much power a physical attack from a Heavenly God powerhouse possessed.\u00a0She poured out the Heavenly Energy from her body, using almost all of the power in her core essence and filling the Dragon Spear with it.\u00a0The Dragon Spear then shot out like a bolt of red lightning that hurtled towards the Terror Sea Dragon.</p><br/><p>The blood-red Dragon Spear dramatically increased in size, expanding to become thirty meters long.\u00a0It hurtled down through the skies like a flash of bloody lightning, carrying an aura of indomitable sharpness.</p><br/><p>However, Dongfang Hanyue was just a bit too slow.\u00a0The red lightning simply couldn\u2019t catch up to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s speed or the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>The Terror Sea Dragon chose to steel its resolve. It had to first kill Zhou Weiqing, even if it meant fleeing with heavy wounds. This was the ocean, after all. Without the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, it could leave whenever it wanted and there would be no way Dongfang Hanyue could stop it.</p><br/><p>The previous Zhou Weiqing would\u2019ve been frozen in midair by the awesome freezing energies.\u00a0But\u2026 the current Zhou Weiqing was clearly in a very strange and marvelous state.\u00a0When the freezing energies around him touched that blurry layer of gray light, they vanished on their own without being able to impede him in the slightest.\u00a0Moments later, his attack slammed right into the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s thick tail.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right leg and the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s draconic tail were on completely different levels of size, but when they collided against each other they actually produced an absolutely shocking explosion.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body was blasted away like a cannon ball and sent flying into the air.\u00a0But\u2026 but!\u00a0Dongfang Hanyue stared wide-eyed at what she saw before her.</p><br/><p>After blasting Zhou Weiqing away, the Terror Sea Dragon actually froze in its attack pose.\u00a0Even when the Dragon Spear pierced through its body, leaving behind an enormous gaping wound, it still maintained that frozen pose.</p><br/><p>Moments later, a thunderous explosion rang out yet again.\u00a0This time, it actually came from the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Its thick, powerful draconic tail actually exploded as a fist of gray light blasted it apart, sending blood and flesh flying everywhere.\u00a0More than a third of its entire tail had been blasted apart.</p><br/><p>A horrified, agonized howl rang out from the Terror Sea Dragon\u2019s maw. Its vast body instantly dove deep into the ocean, not hesitating in the slightest. Protected by an awesome tidal wave, it began to flee for its life.</p><br/><p>Even a Heavenly God powerhouse would suffer heavy injuries when struck by these combined full-strength attacks from Zhou Weiqing and Dongfang Hanyue.\u00a0Why would this cowardly creature even pause for a second?</p><br/><p>Dongfang Hanyue flashed over to the midair Zhou Weiqing.\u00a0She reached out to touch him.\u00a0By now, the gray aura had completely vanished from his body.\u00a0Even his Legendary Set had vanished, and his face was as pale as paper, while his aura was almost gone.\u00a0Beads of blood were dribbling out of his mouth.\u00a0Thankfully, his heartbeat remained strong and vigorous.\u00a0Otherwise, Dongfang Hanyue would\u2019ve believed him to be dead.</p><br/><p>Holding onto his body, she carefully tested pouring her own Heavenly Energy into him.\u00a0However, she was absolutely shocked by what she found.</p><br/><p>The thirty-six Death Acupuncture Points in his body were slowly swiveling.\u00a0As soon as her Heavenly Energy entered his body, it was instantly assimilated into Saint Energy.\u00a0And, judging from his internal condition, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s internal organs and meridians were actually completely unharmed.\u00a0He was simply suffering from agitated blood and energies.\u00a0That silver-white energy was constantly roaming his body, protecting it from harm.</p><br/><p><em>How did he do this?</em> Dongfang Hanyue stared at the man in her arms, completely lost. <em>That strike just now\u2026 it had to be just as strong as my own strike with the Tenebrous Dragon Slayer Spear.</em><em>\u00a0What was that gray light?</em> Even though he was now unconscious, his attack had clearly caused a Heavenly God-stage Heavenly Beast to be injured! What type of level of power had this person reached?!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>By the time Zhou Weiqing slowly woke up, he discovered that he was on a wooden bed.\u00a0He himself didn\u2019t know how long he had been sleeping for.\u00a0This seemed to be a very ordinary wooden room, and it actually stank of fish.</p><br/><p>His mental strength restored, the first thing he did was to examine his body. <em>I broke through?</em> This was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first reaction. Indeed. The Saint Energy in his body had actually broken through the thirty-eighth stage, and so he was now officially at the second stage of Heavenly Dao Energy.</p><br/><p>It must be understood that after gaining Heavenly Dao Energy, each new stage represented an enormous advance.\u00a0This was particularly true after the fortieth stage, where each stage represented an entirely different level.</p><br/><p>It had been just a few short months, but he had actually broken through yet again.\u00a0Even though this came at a price of having to face numerous powerful opponents, he was still alive.\u00a0Being alive was a victory of its own.</p><br/><p><em>As badass as ever!</em> Zhou Weiqing couldn\u2019t help but smile smugly. He lay there, not even moving. Although his Saint Energy had recovered, his head was killing him. Even trying to think simple thoughts made him feel as though his brain was being stabbed by needles.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

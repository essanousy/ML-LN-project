Simply put, Zhou Weiqing had used the \u2018crying-face\u2019 hammer for the first hit, and the \u2018smiling-face\u2019 hammer for the second one. Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s dire injury had been mostly self-inflicted.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyue had told Zhou Weiqing beforehand that he wanted to decide how heavy his injury would be.</p><br/><p>The reason Zhou Weiqing used his full strength when fighting Shangguan Tianyue was that he was worried Shangguan Tianyang might see through their foil, but also because he wanted to test his own strength. Since there was a willing Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouse who had no harmful thoughts toward him, it was a good time to do so.</p><br/><p>The truth is, the older the wiser. Even if they had been fighting for real, Shangguan Tianyang still saw through it, because of Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s performance at the end. He did not stop it, however.</p><br/><p>When he witnessed Shangguan Tianyue\u2019s confession to Tang Xian, Zhou Weiqing nearly laughed out loud. \u2018Who was the one who said I\u2019m good at acting? Compared to my father-in-law, I have got a ways to go!\u2019</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er listened to his explanation with her jaw dropped, her expression was a mix of different emotions.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing cackled, \u201cThey won\u2019t have time to worry about you now, so it\u2019s better that we leave as soon as possible. Otherwise, if your mother came bearing vengeance, I won\u2019t be able to do anything about it! For the sake of your father\u2019s happiness, I had become a total jerk this time. I still don\u2019t know how to explain to your mother in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cYou\u2019re such a swindler, you teamed up with my father to lie to my mother. You two are bullies!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing sighed and said righteously, \u201cHow does this count as swindling? It was a white lie. Do you want to see both of them not talk to each other forever? Can\u2019t you see how much agony your father was in? This way, once that ice wall of theirs melted, it would help their relationship so much, maybe you would even get another younger sibling even.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er blushed, her face turning as red as a tomato. \u201cDon\u2019t speculate about my parents, you\u2019re such a rascal,\u201d she said, but she was relieved.</p><br/><p>A lady\u2019s worst fear is to see her man being in a conflict with her family. Not to mention, it was Zhou Weiqing who had hurt Shangguan Tianyue. When it happened, Shangguan Bing\u2019er really did not know what to do. Now that she found out it was all a show, she was finally at ease.</p><br/><p>No longer worrying about her parents, even though Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not say this, she was surprised at how strong her Little Fatty had become.</p><br/><p>The two traveled rapidly, Zhou Weiqing barely rested before they had arrived, even their meal was eaten in mid-air.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not ask for a stop at all, Zhou Weiqing was smiling the whole way through, but she could tell that he was worried from the look in his eyes. At this moment, it is imperative for her to fully support her man.</p><br/><p>After only three days, they had arrived at the Heavenly Bow Empire territory. Zhou Weiqing only needed to ask around for a little to find out where the army had gone.</p><br/><p>Just as Shangguan Tianyang said, the Heavenly Bow Imperial Army was camping near the Stars Forest outside of the Heavenly Bow City. They had formed a half-moon formation toward the city, ready to launch an all-out attack. Other military details were not known by the people he asked.</p><br/><p>After getting this news, Zhou Weiqing led Shangguan Bing\u2019er straight toward the frontline.</p><br/><p>Traveling through flight was fast, and the Heavenly Bow Empire was not that large, so it was only an extra day of journeying before Zhou Weiqing could see the Heavenly Bow Imperial Army\u2019s camp from afar.</p><br/><p>With clouds shielding him, Zhou Weiqing was not worried anyone else might see him. It was easier to see the army camp from above anyhow.</p><br/><p>After a few moments of studying, Zhou Weiqing was getting really impressed. Ming Yu was deserving of the title of Fei Li God General, Zhou Weiqing himself would not be able to arrange for formations like this.</p><br/><p>From the sky, there were at least ten thousand people camped outside of the Stars Forest, and there were some more camping inside the forest, numbers unknown.</p><br/><p>The whole camp was set up to help each other. Watchtowers were everywhere, teams of patrolling cavalry covered the whole ground. If there were any movements, even if the whole army was mobilized, there would not be any disorganization if they followed the formation. It mattered not if it were the patrols or the soldiers practicing drills, everything showed a strict order.</p><br/><p>It was barely two years since Ming Yu\u2019s enlistment into the Zhongtian Empire. In such a short time, he had already developed the Heavenly Bow Imperial Army into the current state, projecting their powerful combat abilities. If it were Zhou Weiqing, he could not even muster the confidence to say he could do the same thing.</p><br/><p>The current Heavenly Bow Imperial Army not only had the strength to recover their home country, they might even be able to fight back.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fatty, let\u2019s descend,\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er said softly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, hugging her waist. Both of them descended from the sky but did not go directly to the camp to avoid unwanted misunderstanding. They landed directly in front of the encampment and walked directly toward it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho goes there?\u201d Before the two even walked a hundred meters, four soldiers leaped out from the side.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had naturally noticed them before, but these four people had not been in their sights before.</p><br/><p>Now that they were out of their hiding spots, it could be seen that they had dug four holes in the ground. There were plenty of covers on top, and there were straws and weed woven onto their shields, so it was hard to notice where exactly they were.</p><br/><p>These people were the hidden guards.</p><br/><p>Noticing the four shiny blades, Zhou Weiqing laughed and said, \u201cStand down, we\u2019re on the same side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the same side?\u201d The leader of the four looked at Zhou Weiqing, perplexed, then looked over at Shangguan Bing\u2019er before broke out into a shudder. Without hesitation, he genuflected and said to Shangguan Bing\u2019er in utmost respect, \u201cI\u2019m the Sun Pao, Scout of Fourth Regiment\u2019s Twenty-seventh Company, reporting for duty, Chief Instructor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else followed suit, greeting Shangguan Bing\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing rubbed his nose and said wryly, \u201cLooks like my Commander status is not as well-known as you, Chief Instructor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er laughed out loud, saying, \u201cWho asked you to be so lazy and not appear in public that often? This also proved how hard my sisters are working for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said, \u201cAlright, everybody up. To avoid misunderstanding, two of you should lead us into the main tent to meet Ming Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not soften his voice on purpose, so the scouts all heard him. \u2018Commander? What does he mean by that? All of them were confused, however, they had seen Shangguan Bing\u2019er beside Zhou Weiqing from afar. The Chief Instructor\u2019s fame could only be rivaled with Commander Ming Yu. Just who is this young man?\u2019</p><br/><p>Seeing the four of them hesitate, Zhou Weiqing said, \u201cForget it, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d He was impatient about the current situation, so he no longer wanted to wait.</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing raised his right hand, stretching his fingers out in the air. Instantly, the air started to rumble as a dragon formed by lightning soared into the sky, causing the four scouts to stare with their eyes wide. A loud crash mixed with the strong lightning energy wave spread out at the same time.</p><br/><p>The lightning dragon circled in the air for a little while, and finally emitted a chain of thunder crashes and lightning flashes and dissipated.</p><br/><p>Before the flashes of lightning were even gone, a response had already arisen from the Heavenly Bow Imperial Army camp as about a hundred silhouettes leaped into the air, speeding over to where they were.</p><br/><p>They were still far away, but Zhou Weiqing could tell that these people were his Peerless Air Force.</p><br/><p>After a year, when he saw the Peerless Air Force he had founded from scratch, his heart was filled with warmth that tells him he was finally home.</p><br/><p>The hundred-people Air Force quickly arrived at the site, every single bow was drawn to the maximum. Surprisingly, all hundred of these Jewel Masters had cultivation base of at least five jewels, their leader was Kou Rui.</p><br/><p>They did not arrive together. While in the air, they had already fallen into their formation, approaching in a half-circular formation. With about a hundred Jewel Masters locking on, the area was filled with tension.</p><br/><p>Kou Rui was stationed in the middle, his cultivation base had also attained five jewels.</p><br/><p>\u201cKou Rui, come down here,\u201d even before Kou Rui could see who it was, a powerful suction came from the ground, pulling him downward forcefully.</p><br/><p>Kou Rui was caught by surprise and fired an arrow instinctually. As soon as he fired, all hundred of the Peerless Air Force members immediately fired along without hesitation. The arrows made a \u2018whoosh\u2019 sound as they pierced through the air and scaring the four scouts standing in front of Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er as if they had lost their souls.</p><br/><p>With a hundred arrows from the Peerless Air Force, their Consolidated Bows\u2019 explosive attribute could blow the place up into a crater within a hundred meter radius!</p><br/><p>However, by the next moment, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>The whooshing sound only sounded for half the distance before they had stopped. All hundred arrows froze in mid-air. What was even more astonishing was that all the arrows flew back into their own quivers without missing even one.</p><br/><p>Kou Rui, on the other hand, was still dragged onto the ground, landing in front of Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019d only just seen each other, you already wanted to gift me an explosion show? Can\u2019t you at least look clearly before you act?\u201d Zhou Weiqing asked with a grin.</p><br/><p>When Kou Rui saw his comrades\u2019 arrows were all blocked, cold sweat broke out of his skin, he thought, \u2018We\u2019re finished!\u2019 However, when he saw the one who pulled him down, his terror turned into awe</p><br/>\n</div>"}

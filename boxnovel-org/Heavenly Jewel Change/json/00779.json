Because he was in the presence of the Elven Queen\u2019s Natural Divine Territory, it was impossible for him to perform Time Reversal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Elven Queen?\u201d The man in black exclaimed, his voice was clearly husky and was intentionally lowered. It was obvious that he was trying to hide his real identity. That person was completely covered in a black attire, and his features could not be seen at all.</p><br/><p>As dark gold glows lit up continuously, a nine-piece legendary armor set appeared on the Heavenly Emperor, covering his body. The helmet was fully enclosed which made it impossible to see how he looked like. The Elven Queen and Zhou Weiqing stood on one side each while they stared at the man in black coldly. The Elven Queen said in a deep voice, \u201cGive me back my daughter, or else you\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in black was not in a rush at all. Perhaps, he did not dare to make a move hastily. If he made a move, he would definitely trigger Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen to attack him together. Encountering a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse with terrifying strength whom he knew nothing about and the Heavenly God Tier Elven Queen, the man in black would definitely not make a move unless he was an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea what Your Majesty is talking about. I\u2019m just doing my own things as usual. I thought the Elf Tribe doesn\u2019t usually interfere with the human world? If you do that, you might trigger a war between humans and the Elf Tribe.\u201d The man in black said cunningly.</p><br/><p>Although the Elven Queen had a powerful cultivation base, she was not good with words. She burst into rage, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Natural Divine Territory was roiling intensely. An overbearing energy wave exploded out of her body continuously. It seemed like she was going to fight.</p><br/><p>Because the man in black had his body hidden under the black Consolidated Set, nobody could see his expression. However, there was a layer of peculiar distorted glow coming out of his body. The glow was twinkling, and it seemed to be rejecting the Natural Divine Territory around him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled calmly and said, \u201cWho said the Elven Queen is going to stop you. This has nothing to do with the Elf Tribe and the humans. I\u2019m the one that\u2019ll stop you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou? Why would you stop me?\u201d The man in black did not even turn around to look at Zhou Weiqing. Although he was attacked by Zhou Weiqing earlier, the Elven Queen with a Heavenly God-tier cultivation base was more of a concern to him.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he was secretly shocked. Everything aside, Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen had unexpectedly stopped him accurately using Spatial Travel. That was something he did not expect. He had been roaming outside the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land for a very long time to capture the Elven Princess. He even used a couple of consumable treasures to help him succeed. He would only leave after he captured her. As for him, there was no way the Elf Tribe would be able to catch him. However, nobody would have ever thought that the Elven Queen would appear before him in within such a short period of time. He knew that it would be difficult for him to escape today. He was looking for an opportunity to escape. It was not an easy task to run away from a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse! However, he had a trump card as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said, \u201cI stopped you because you abducted my wife. My wife has a bit of my Divine Thought on her so that\u2019s how I found you. Your Majesty, please withdraw your Divine Territory. This is between me and this man. It has nothing to do with you, nor does it have anything to do with the Elf Tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason why the Elven Queen did not instantly attack earlier was because she had her own worries. Even if she and Zhou Weiqing managed to get this Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse to stay today, assuming that there was a slight misstep that affected the Elf Tribe, and the news of how the Elven Queen could not even handle a human being spread out, it would bring great trouble to the Elf Tribe. Besides, she did not have any evidence at all currently.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, they were dealing with a Time Attribute Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse. A powerhouse with this level of cultivation base in Time Attribute was good in spreading news using the trait of time. For example, the Time Portrait. The image of this Heavenly Emperor Tier powerhouse could be placed in the sky like a portrait in the sky right before he was killed. The image could not be removed even if abilities were used on it and would exist forever. It could even remain in the sky no matter what was happening before their eyes. It would put the Elf Tribe in an unfavorable position if somebody was to take advantage of it.</p><br/><p>What Zhou Weiqing said undoubtedly saved her. In regards to the \u2018wife\u2019 that Zhou Weiqing spoke of, the Elven Queen did not take him seriously. How would she know what he was thinking!</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen looked at Zhou Weiqing with gratitude. She withdrew her Natural Divine Territory without any hesitation, and she even retreated. She had almost blind faith in Zhou Weiqing because Zhou Weiqing possessed Saint Energy. Even though both of them were at the Heavenly Emperor Tier, the man in black would not have any chance to win against him. One should not forget that Zhou Weiqing fought even with her earlier. In the end, she only managed to defend against the terrifying attack from the Demon God Sword with the help of the elders\u2019 strength.</p><br/><p>The man in black was stunned. Because Zhou Weiqing had taken all the responsibility upon himself, he had ruined his plan. However, he was not afraid if he was only dealing with an opponent who was at the Heavenly Emperor Tier since he was at the Upper Level of Heavenly Emperor Tier. In regards to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength, the man in black knew that he was the one who was being reckless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re talking about. What wife? I didn\u2019t abduct anybody. Do you think Divine Thought exists just because you said so?\u201d The man in black thought that even if there were Divine Thoughts, it should have been left by the Elven Queen. He had no idea why the Elven Queen was with this human man but it was obvious that this man was taking advantage of the Elf Tribe earlier, and was taken advantage of by the man in black. He did not expect that not only did Zhou Weiqing managed to escape, he even came with the Elven Queen.</p><br/><p>Naturally, he had no idea that when he achieved his goal, he had also triggered a war between Zhou Weiqing and the Elf Tribe. However, the issue was resolved a lot faster than he had expected. That was why Zhou Weiqing and the Elven Queen managed to come so quickly. Zhou Weiqing maintained the smile on his face. He always had that expression on him whenever he wanted to trick a person. \u201cHow about this? You let me search you. I\u2019ll use my Divine Thought to search. If I don\u2019t sense my wife\u2019s presence, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on. I\u2019m a Heavenly Emperor and also the Emperor of a generation. Do you think I\u2019ll let you search me just because you want to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing burst out laughing and said, \u201cEmperor of a generation? Nonsense! You covered yourself from head to toes. You don\u2019t even have the courage to show yourself. How do you live up to your name as a Heavenly Emperor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you insult me?\u201d It was clear that the man in black was mad as the air around him became even more distorted. If the Elven Queen whom he perceived as a threat was not present, perhaps he would have attacked Zhou Weiqing since the beginning. All that he was thinking about at the moment was how to escape.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s appearance was indeed majestic. He had gold armor covering his entire body. Moreover, it was a 10-piece legendary armor set. The pair of huge hammers and the pair of purple wings with golden edges on his back was releasing a terrifying force just like before. These were not easy to handle. However, to him, his threat would still work as it would not be difficult for him to escape without the limitation of the Elven Queen\u2019s Divine Territory. He was thinking of how to escape in a way that would cause him minimal damage. As long as he managed to leave this place, his mission could be considered successful.</p><br/><p>\u201cInsult you? That was insulting to you? Do you know even know what insulting means? Let me show you.\u201d Zhou Weiqing pursed his lips in disdain and said, \u201cLook at you hiding yourself. You must be the worst of all the scum out there. The savage among all the savages. From what I\u2019ve observed, you must lack proper upbringing since you were young, and you lacked love when you were growing up. Your grandmother doesn\u2019t pamper you and your uncle hates you. The left side of your face should be slapped and the right side of your face should be kicked. Donkeys would kick you and pigs would step on you when they see you. You must be a cucumber since birth because you need some slapping! You must be a walnut later on because you need to be pounded! You\u2019re given the opportunity to be anything you want but you\u2019re so shameless that you\u2019re begging to be a bitch! Damn it, why? I want to see you talk but why do you bury your face in your ass? Oh? I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s your face. So where did your ass go? A bitch will be a bitch for life while a pig\u2019s life would end with a chop of a knife. I\u2019m doing a good deed today by helping God in killing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face remained serious when he said all that. It was as if he was talking about some serious matter. Moreover, he was speaking so fast like a cannonball when he said that nonsense in one breath. When the man in black understood what he meant, Zhou Weiqing had already said what he had wanted say with a joking expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Let alone the anger that the man in black felt from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s insults, even the Elven Queen who was standing not too far away found it hard to stop the corner of her lips from twitching. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s insults were too much and there were vulgarities in there. When the Elven Queen looked at that person, who was possibly the youngest Heavenly Emperor-tier human, insulting someone so smoothly, it would have been strange if she was not surprised. She could not imagine how mad she would be if Zhou Weiqing was saying those words to her.</p><br/><p>The man in black started shaking uncontrollably as he lifted his hand to point at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scoffed in disdain, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018you\u2019? Do you mean to say your sister?! Even if you have a sister, I won\u2019t be interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, go to hell.\u201d The man in black could not take it anymore. As a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, he held a certain position. When would he ever be insulted like that? With the expression on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s face, he could not bear it even though he knew that he was supposed to keep calm at that moment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

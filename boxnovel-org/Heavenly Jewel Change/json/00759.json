The First and Third Elders opened up the Enchantment of Destruction to defend themselves from Long Shiya\u2019s attack. The Blood Red Hell powerhouses behind them released their Consolidated Equipment while they moved to gather behind the two elders simultaneously. At that moment, Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had completely showcased his ability. Even the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain had to be cautious when he encountered the 10,000 Devastating Godslayer Arrows, or else he would be hit by the arrows. Although the attack was scattered, it was destructive. It was out of the Blood Red Hell First and Third Elders\u2019 expectation.</p><br/><p>The Enchantment of Destruction that the First and Third Elders released was crushed in an instant. Although the duo was not injured, they were forced to return to the ground from the skies, which caused them to lose the opportunity to save the Second Elder completely. Besides that, since the Enchantment of Destruction was crushed, the Blood Red Hell powerhouses at the back were affected by the impact. The first ones to be impacted by the blow were those who were struck by the Dragon Silencing Seal. Since they could not even release their Consolidated Equipment, how could they defend Long Shiya\u2019s attack? Everyone who was hit by the Tricolor Arrows had their bodies change to six colors immediately and faded away with the dissipating dots of light.</p><br/><p>These people aside, the rest did not fare well either. More than 10 people spewed blood and were badly injured, including four Heavenly King-tier powerhouses. The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor\u2019s ultimate move with his full power could not simply be blocked. Among Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses, perhaps the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was the only one who could defend the Second and Fourth Elders\u2019 attacks and bet his life to kill the Fourth Elder following such a powerful attack.</p><br/><p>A destructive aura swept up into the air. Long Shiya, who was in the sky, let out a deep groan from the impact and spewed blood. After all, he was fighting so many powerhouses on his own. If it was the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, he might not be able to do better than him. The First and Third Elders of the Blood Red Hell screamed ferociously and dashed into the sky in two bloody glows. They hated Long Shiya to their core, and it was the perfect time to attack the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor as he had just released his attack and was about to release another strike. As long as they managed to take advantage of this timing to kill Long Shiya, neither Zhou Weiqing nor the rest would live.</p><br/><p>When the terrifying dark red glow shot up to the sky, an overbearing destructive aura filled tens of thousands of square meters. The remaining Star Tree stumps that were chopped off earlier, as well as those that were spared within the coverage of the destructive aura, turned into ashes in an instant. The ground sank tens of meters deep while a significant number of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses attacked at the same time.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the power of the Blood Red Hell was shown. Although the Heavenly King and Heavenly Zong-tier powerhouses could not be a threat to the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor on their own, they had similar Destruction Attributes. As they released Heavenly Energy respectively and channeled it into the Enchantment of Destruction, not only did that remedy the Enchantment of Destruction, its power increased tremendously. The First and Third Elders were adjusting the terrifying destructive energy towards Long Shiya.</p><br/><p>When they were attacking the Heavenly Demon Sect back then, the Heavenly Demon Sect was quite powerful itself. However, due to the overbearing destructive aura, the two Low-Level Heavenly Emperor-tier Assistant Sect Masters decided to self-detonate, which allowed Wu Yunyue and a portion of them to run away. At that time, the First Elder did not join the battle, only the Second, Third, and Fourth Elders took part. Long Shiya was the reason why the First Elder was here this time. They had given their all this time, and even Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, a real powerhouse, was shocked at the terrifying aura.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunyue had gotten next to Long Shiya as well as the six Heavenly Demon Sect Heavenly Kings. The eight of them had different attributes, which made merging impossible. All they could do was perform their most powerful skills to fight the Blood Red Hell First Elder\u2019s and Third Elder\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Baam \u2014</p><br/><p>The sky turned dark. Yes, the sky turned dark the second the collision happened. Naturally, it was not approaching nightfall. Instead, a massive black hole 1,000 meters in diameter appeared in the sky out of nowhere. All of the Atmospheric Energy was entirely absorbed within the black hole\u2019s vicinity, which forced the two parties to separate into two sides.</p><br/><p>In almost an instant, half of the city wall of Heavenly Bow City, which was far away, collapsed. It was only the impact of the aura. Fortunately, Zhou Weiqing had instructed the soldiers that were stationed near Heavenly Bow City as well as the civilians to move to another side when he received the letter of challenge. Otherwise, god knew how many lives the aftershock of the aura would take away.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell First and Third Elders were forced to return to the ground once again. The destruction-filled bloody aura was much dimmer now. The black hole that was created by the collision of both sides was too terrifying. It was a fearsome energy that could engulf a Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, so nobody dared to touch it.</p><br/><p>Although the Blood Red Hell side of the attack was being stopped, the situation at the Heavenly Bow Empire was much more devastating. The eight people who were led by Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue spewed blood almost at the same time. The blood turned into mist in the air while the eight of them were thrown away. Long Shiya now had more injuries on top of the one that he had just sustained, so he did not look too good. He did not expect these people from the Blood Red Hell to gather all their strength to attack in a unified manner. Even with the help of Demonic Emperor, they did not manage to defend the attack and the strike was immensely powerful.</p><br/><p>Besides, the destructive aura that was filled with destructive energy rushed into their bodies. This meant that they would need massive amounts of Heavenly Energy to keep it from affecting their bodies. After the series of attacks earlier, the Blood Red Hell was naturally on the losing end. The Fourth Elder died, while the Second Elder was dying in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands. Moreover, a couple of Heavenly King-tier powerhouses had killed a bunch of Heavenly Zong-tier powerhouses. Almost half of their full combat strength was lost.</p><br/><p>However, the Heavenly Bow Empire side suffered severe injuries as well. Although nobody died, Long Shiya\u2019s injury was severe, and Wu Yunyue was injured too. That aside, he had yet to heal from his last injury. At that moment, the two Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses had lost much of their combat abilities. The six Heavenly King-tier powerhouses had suffered injuries on different levels too. If this persisted, since the people of the Blood Red Hell could combine their strength all together into their attack, the Blood Red Hell would have the upper hand. However, the people of the Heavenly Bow Empire were proud to have achieved what they had so far despite their disadvantages.</p><br/><p>Naturally, pride was not enough as it was a battle of life and death where there was only one conclusion to the side who lost. Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue looked serious at that moment. No matter how much he did not want to admit it, he knew very well that the situation right now was the same as the time when the Blood Red Hell attacked the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell\u2019s Destruction Attribute was immensely overbearing, but in a one-on-one scenario, he thought the impact of Demonic Change would be sufficient. The Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s root attributes were the Evil, Darkness, and Life Attribute. As a Sect Master who possessed all three attributes at the same time, though his abilities alone might not be better than Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, there was a fine line between them. That was the main reason why the Heavenly Demon Sect had managed to survive throughout the years despite being suppressed by the other four Great Saints Lands.</p><br/><p>However, they were not facing their enemies one-on-one as they were not on good terms with their enemies. How would it be possible that the enemy would give them a chance for a one-on-one? Moreover, he and Long Shiya had suffered severe injuries. He had new injuries added to his old injuries, while Long Shiya had gotten injured again and again. In such a battle, it would be irrational to put their expectations on a couple of Heavenly King-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell First and Third Elders were not easy. With the support of many powerhouses and the merging of Destruction Attribute, their combat strength was too terrifying. Wu Yunyue thought it might be tough to win the battle even if it was the Mountain Lord of the Heavenly Snow Mountain who was fighting these Blood Red Hell powerhouses on his own. That was the main difference as the Destruction Attribute was comparable with the Saint Attribute. Most importantly, the Blood Red Hell had many people who possessed the Destruction Attribute. It would be fatal if all their Destruction Attributes were merged.</p><br/><p>A ferocious look appeared on Wu Yunyue\u2019s face. It would be difficult for them to escape with the situation that they were in today. Moreover, as the Heavenly Demon Sect Master, he had his dignity as well! He could not take the humiliation of escaping after being attacked again and again. He had made his decision, he would never retreat today, even if he had to resort to the self-detonation of his Heavenly Nucleus Core. He must fight the people of the Blood Red Hell to his death.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Long Shiya had a completely different expression compared to Wu Yunyue. Although he had suffered severe injuries, this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was smiling at this very moment. He even looked mischievous in his smile. Perhaps Wu Yunyue regretted listening to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s plan, which caused the situation that they were in, but it was a different story for Long Shiya as he knew his dear disciple very well that he could not act hastily without having more than 80% of confidence. Consulting Wu Yunyue, he had an accurate estimate of how many people the Blood Red Hell would have for the battle today. How was it possible for them to make such a fatal mistake right now?</p><br/><p>Regardless of the energy or the Heavenly Demon Sect, they had forgotten about one thing, which was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ability. They had underestimated their dear disciple. Under normal circumstance, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s defensive abilities were comparable with a Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, and his combat strength was at least on par with a Mid-Level Heavenly Emperor-tier\u2019s ability. However, these estimates excluded his ability to mobilize the Nebula. As soon as he managed to do that, Long Shiya was almost sure that he was the most powerful one on their side. That was right, Zhou Weiqing would be even more powerful than he was.</p><br/><p>The Blood Red Hell First and Third Elders had their eyes set on the two Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses on the other side. They had not even thought about how Zhou Weiqing had managed to defend the Second Elder\u2019s full strike and survived.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The old man and the woman could not hide how impressed they were when they saw Zhou Weiqing\u2019s skills. As God Tier Masters, they also possessed Spatial Attribute, so they were able to identify the Spatial Rend that he was performing. Not everyone was able to have such a meticulous mastery over their skills to the extent that not a single material was wasted. At that moment, they gained a deeper understanding towards Zhou Weiqing. This young man who called himself the Strength Legacy must have possessed powerful Soul Energy. Otherwise, he would not have been able to achieve such control over everything.</p><br/><p>Later on, two minerals appeared in his hands. One was blue and the other was purple. They were both the size of his fist.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing held them both in his hands as he slowly exhaled. What happened next startled the two God Tier Masters.</p><br/><p>The sleeves on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s clothes suddenly exploded! The cloth scattered everywhere, revealing his muscular arms. The lines of his muscles were so defined that the ladies would swoon if they if saw it.</p><br/><p>As he flexed his muscles and clenched his fist, the two hard minerals cracked in his fists.</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s eyes widened as she thought to herself, \u2018What kind of super strength is that? Is this person even human?\u2019 She clearly recognized the two minerals. The blue one was a blue crystal stone while the purple one was a purple devil stone. She was aware that both stones were extremely hard, but Zhou Weiqing managed to crush it using only his body\u2019s strength. It was a little terrifying.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a one-foot tall green vortex appeared before Zhou Weiqing. It was jade green in color. Even though it was small, anyone could tell that it was formed by a high compression of Wind Attribute. The color was refreshing just like the greeneries under the sunlight.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing placed both his hands on top of the vortex and dropped the crushed stones into it. Under the terrifying force of the vortex, the crushed stones turned into powder and were sent out from the vortex.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er who was standing at the side was puzzled. A Spatial Rend could also make a fine powder to a similar effect!! Why did Zhou Weiqing use a different way to make it?</p><br/><p>She was not a Consolidated Equipment Master. Naturally, she could not understand the reason behind his action. However, the doubt that the two God Tier Masters initially had towards Zhou Weiqing was gradually decreasing. Of course, there was a reason why Zhou Weiqing did this. It was due to his knowledge of the materials. It would not cause any problems for him to turn plants, fruits, and vines into a fine powder with Spatial Attribute. After all, these were things that had once possessed some sort of life within them.</p><br/><p>However, the two minerals were a different matter. If he used the Spatial Rend of Spatial Attribute to mill the two minerals into a fine powder, the Spatial Energy might affect the minerals and cause it to lose its original effect. How was it possible for a God Tier Master to make such a mistake?</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing\u2019s sleeves exploded earlier, the two God Tier Masters saw the Heavenly Jewel\u2019s attribute on both of his arms. They saw a shiny rose color Strength Jewel on his right hand.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the power of his right arm did not come across as much of a surprise. However, their eyes lit up when they saw the Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye Heavenly Jewel on his left hand.</p><br/><p>It was an Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye, an Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye! An Alexandrite Cat\u2019s Eye was a symbol that signified a person possessed at least four types of Heavenly Jewel attribute. The precious stone was bluish-green under sunlight. However, it would turn rosy red at night or when there was no light. At the moment, there was no sunlight in the house since the sunlight was only shining through the window, so the stone was rosy red in color.</p><br/><p>The two God Tier Masters who had initially thought Zhou Weiqing was full of himself had a solemn expression on their face now. Whether Zhou Weiqing was a real God Tier Master or not, the fact that he possessed more than four Heavenly Jewel attribute gave him the right to be proud. Moreover, he looked like he was only in his 20s. Even if he was not a God Tier Master, he was definitely a peerless genius on the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>Under the bright light which was emanating from the Heavenly Jewels on both his hands, the five materials with five colors merged with each other. Zhou Weiqing did not stop as more and more valuable materials appeared from his Spatial Ring.</p><br/><p>On the surface, it might seem like he was moving fast. However, if one were to look closely, there was a unique rhythm in his movement. As new materials appeared, one could see that there was a strict sequence to it and the way he ground them into a fine powder. In the end, the crystal vat was halfway filled with exactly 42 materials.</p><br/><p>When he was done, Zhou Weiqing picked up the crystal vat slowly. Rich Heavenly Energy was infused into the vat from both his palms as it merged with the 42 materials that were in powder and liquid form. They were merging together with the help of the Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhou Weiqing closed his eyes again. This time, it felt like he transformed himself into an enormous vat. His own aura covered the mixture in the crystal vat, preventing the aura in the crystal vat from escaping.</p><br/><p>By now, the focus of the two God Tier Masters was fixated and firm. Each God Tier Master had their own unique methods of making the Consolidated Equipment Scrolls. Consolidating Ink could also be formed by varying proportions of ingredients. As Zhou Weiqing was mixing the Consolidating Ink, they tried their best to memorize all the sequences and methods which Zhou Weiqing had used. It was their first time seeing such a combination. They had no doubts that the Consolidating Ink would turn out to be something they had never seen before. The Consolidated Equipment Scroll must be at a high-level judging by the many materials that the Consolidating Ink needed.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was still inserting more Heavenly Energy into the vat while his motions were getting slower. The Consolidating Ink in the crystal vat started to swirl, forming a small vortex. A light glow gradually radiated from the inside of the vat, and it was growing. The light silver glow looked like silver liquid. However, there was a sense of menace in the light silver glow. Although it was not emitting any aura, the two God Tier Masters could sense a tinge of maniacal energy from the glow.</p><br/><p>Finally, Zhou Weiqing stopped what he was doing when he held the crystal vat above his head. Suddenly, his eyes burst open at that moment, and he yelled loudly.</p><br/><p>An intense silver beam shot out of the crystal vat and transformed into a silver flame. Then, it shot up to the roof and into the sky. A strong fragrance suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>Apart from the four individuals in the cottage, even the powerhouses from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace who were keeping watch outside could smell the pleasant fragrance.</p><br/><p>The fragrance smelled like it could awaken one\u2019s soul. Moreover, everyone who smelled it felt like all the pores in their bodies had opened up. It was an odd feeling as even the Heavenly Energy in their body was stronger than usual. Of course, that only lasted for a little while. The fragrance faded as soon as the silver flame disappeared.</p><br/><p>The powerhouses from the Mysterious Heavenly Palace were indifferent to what had just happened. There were always peculiar things happening in the cottage. Their job was just to keep watch and prevent anybody from going in. They were not allowed to interfere with the people in the cottage.</p><br/><p>As the silver flame in the crystal vat that Zhou Weiqing was holding disappeared, the three individuals in the cottage could finally have a clearer look at what happened. The mixture originally filled up half of the vat. However, at that moment, there was only a little bit of the mixture left at the bottom of the vat. The light silver liquid looked like beautiful galaxy river, and it was difficult to remove one\u2019s gaze away from it.</p><br/><p>The two God Tier Masters heaved in a breath of cold air when they saw Zhou Weiqing had successfully made a Consolidating Ink for a Consolidated Equipment Scroll. The entire process only took less than half an hour. They were all God Tier Masters. In fact, the old man had been a God Tier Master for over 40 years now! However, if he were to reflect upon himself, he knew that he would not be able to come up with a Consolidating Ink with so many materials as fast as Zhou Weiqing did. If there were even a single tiny mistake, the entire vat of previous materials would go to waste. The materials were not cheap! The vat of materials was worth at least millions of gold coins, and some of them could not be obtained regardless of how much money one had.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing was secretly relieved. Of course, he was not a real God Tier Master. Well, at least he was not one before today. However, he possessed the Saint Energy which gave him the ability to perform that feat.</p><br/><p>Theoretically, he had known all along how to make a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll. Because he was a potential heir to the Strength Legacy. When he was on the Boundless Mainland, Duan Tianlang taught him the ways to make a Ringless Ground Purging Set. After all, Duan Tianlang did not know when he would die.</p><br/><p>However, this was the first time Zhou Weiqing attempted to create a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll. Although he had a great rhythm when he was mixing the materials, in reality, there were a ton of loopholes in his sequences. If the two God Tier Masters were to try and emulate his method, they would not be able to successfully copy him even if it took them the rest of their lives.</p><br/><p>At the end of the day, the presence of his Saint Energy was the reason why the materials merged perfectly. As Zhou Weiqing was infusing Heavenly Energy into the vat, he was already mixing in his Saint Energy the moment the materials in the vat turned silver.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

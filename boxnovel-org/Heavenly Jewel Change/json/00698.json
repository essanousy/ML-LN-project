At first, we thought that regardless of how talented and excellent he is, he\u2019ll only be able to make a pseudo scroll at best. Even then, his achievements in the future might surpass us as he is still young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er gave an indifferent laugh. \u201cAren\u2019t you just as young?\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, the woman was slightly taken aback. She then shook her head gently. A strange brilliance flashed in her eyes. \u201cNo. I\u2019m different from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPseudo scrolls usually only appear in the first few pieces of Legendary Sets. That\u2019s the reason why a Zong Tier Consolidating Equipment Master has a chance at successfully creating such a scroll as well. Every Legendary Set has to be stronger than the previous one. If the first Legendary Set assembly component is a true God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll, then the number of assembly components needed for the following set will be greatly reduced. That\u2019s why, in general, the first three or four scrolls are usually all Pseudo God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er suddenly said, \u201cSo, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman picked up the scroll made by Zhou Weiqing as she said, \u201cI can see that this is also a part of a Legendary Set. Since it\u2019s not a Pseudo God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll, this should be the sixth or the seventh piece of the Legendary Set. Seeing as he\u2019s only at the Fifth Jewel cultivation base, there is a higher possibility of it being the sixth piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Zhou Weiqing was still awake, he would have been amazed by the woman\u2019s conjecture and observations. Although she had guessed in the wrong direction, with the help of her observations, somehow she managed to guess correctly. This was really the sixth piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set. He was also one step closer to understanding the Fifth Jewel cultivation base.</p><br/><p>At this point, when both the woman and the old man looked at Zhou Weiqing, their expressions had completely changed. Shangguan Bing\u2019er could see a hint of respect in their eyes. It was the kind of respect that was usually reserved for powerhouses.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take him to the next room to rest. Everything else can wait until he wakes up,\u201d the woman said as she walked to Shangguan Bing\u2019er and handed the sixth Ringless Ground Purging Set to her.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er looked surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it? It\u2019s made from the materials that you provided after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman smiled a little. Her majestic aura and dignified manner made Shangguan Bing\u2019er feel inferior. Shangguan Bing\u2019er definitely did not lose out in terms of appearance. What she lacked was self-confidence. The woman carried herself with poise and had the air of absolute self-confidence. Even in the face of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s astounding talent, her confidence in herself had not decreased one bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for the Mysterious Heavenly Palace to be so stingy. You can consider those materials as a gift from us to Master Zhou for our first meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er nodded. Naturally, she did not hesitate as she accepted the scroll. It was also at this moment that Shangguan Bing\u2019er noticed the woman had begun to see Zhou Weiqing in a different light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you to tell him when he wakes up. My name is Meng Xing. People call me Master Meng Xing. This here is Master Nie Han.\u201d After that, she turned around and walked out of the cottage as the old man followed suit.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Xing?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er repeated her name. It was evident that the female God Tier Master was using an alias.</p><br/><p>The cottage next door was equally as simple. It had a table, two chairs, and a wooden bed that was not too wide. However, if one were to take a closer look, they would find that the furniture was all made from yellow rosewood and there was a faint fragrance of yellow rosewood throughout the room.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er carefully placed Zhou Weiqing on the wooden bed. Before she even had the time to properly sit, a powerful hand was placed on her delicate body as it pulled her into a warm embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d Shangguan Bing\u2019er was surprised.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not open his eyes. He softly said to Shangguan Bing\u2019er as he embraced her soft and lovely body. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to sleep too long in a place like this. What\u2019s the situation like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve passed the test. The scroll has also been given to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing then said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m going to rest for a while.\u201d Out of fear that he might be in danger, Zhou Weiqing had forced himself awake despite his splitting headache. After he had confirmed their safety, he felt relieved and quickly fell asleep.</p><br/><p>The consumption of Spiritual Energy this time was really too great. However, it had been beneficial to Zhou Weiqing. There was a smile on his face even as he slept. The fact that he had been stuck at a bottleneck in his Saint Energy cultivation had been haunting him for months. However, he had broken through to the next tier the instant he completed the God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll.</p><br/><p>Due to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s complete control, the other three people in the cottage did not notice anything amiss. The truth was there had been an earth-shaking change in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The originally dense silvery-white Saint Energy was revolving at his 36th Death Acupuncture Point. Then, unexpectedly, the process of filtering and compressing started; his body had also been tempered by the process.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not need to personally oversee the process. Everything was done by the Saint Energy. Breaking through the bottleneck was like entering another realm. After talking to Shangguan Bing\u2019er and falling asleep, he could clearly feel a brand new thread of Saint Energy appearing in his Heavenly Core Nucleus.</p><br/><p>After the breakthrough, the Saint Energy had completely turned into a clear silver color. The color was similar to the silver color that flashed for a split second the moment the God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll was completed.</p><br/><p>It was transparent with bits of glimmering silver light. This new silver color had replaced the originally silvery white. The compressing and filtering were not irritating. On the contrary, it was quite comfortable. It circulated gently in his Heavenly Core Nucleus, giving off a warm and comfortable feeling.</p><br/><p>The process of conversion continued. At times like that, sleeping was obviously the best option for Zhou Weiqing. The Saint Energy\u2019s self-protection made it such that Zhou Weiqing did not need to worry about his body\u2019s problems.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body constantly circulated and transformed. The newly filtered and condensed silvery liquid Saint Energy appeared at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Heavenly Core Nucleus and brain. Shangguan Bing\u2019er, who was being embraced by Zhou Weiqing, did not feel the changes in his body. However, the Saint Energy in her own body was affected. Unexpectedly, it started circulating. This was the first time Shangguan Bing\u2019er had encountered such a situation after obtaining Saint Energy. However, the speed of circulation was a little slow. After all, she did not have the Saint Attribute, and she lacked the key to guide the Saint Energy. However, at that moment, with Zhou Weiqing by her side, and with the higher level Saint Energy within his body as the catalyst, it led Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s Saint Energy along as it circulated</p><br/><p>The speed at which it condensed and refined gave her a feeling as if she had made rapid progress.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s possible to cultivate while sleeping?\u2019 Shangguan Bing\u2019er found it rather funny. Unfortunately, she did not dare sleep. She was in a foreign land, and also in the headquarters of the Mysterious Heavenly Palace. Now that Zhou Weiqing had fallen asleep, how could she not remain vigilant?</p><br/><p>This time, Zhou Weiqing slept for three whole days.</p><br/><p>During this period, there were people who sent them delicious food, fruits, and drinks. Shangguan Bing\u2019er also did not need to take special care of Zhou Weiqing. She only needed to watch over him.</p><br/><p>The God Tier Master Meng Xing and Nie Han visited twice. They were not surprised to see Zhou Weiqing in deep sleep. After all, even they felt weakened for some time after making a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll, much less Zhou Weiqing\u2019s method that used abilities which defied natural order.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u2019er had managed to gain their full approval. They were very warm and cordial both times that they came to visit. A God Tier Master who could create a God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll with only a Fifth Jewel cultivation base. In that case, when he reached the Heavenly King Tier, it was possible that he would be able to create God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scroll with ease. This was not something the Mysterious Heavenly Palace could ignore.</p><br/><p>On the third day, Shangguan Bing\u2019er was pressed up against Zhou Weiqing as she felt a sudden circulation in her own Saint Energy being propelled by the movement of his Saint Energy. Suddenly, the speed of the Saint Energy\u2019s movement circulated faster in her body before settling down again. A strange wave of energy was silently emitted by Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. She could only sense it because she also possessed the Saint Energy. In that short moment, she had also developed a special kind of understanding.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing slowly opened his eyes. He found that everything in front of him seemed clearer than before. He could even see the finest wooden grains on the ceiling.</p><br/><p>The duration he slept was determined by the Saint Energy in his body. After sleeping for three days, his Saint Energy made a breakthrough from the 36th tier to the 37th tier.</p><br/><p>Everything changed after reaching Nine Jewels. Even though it was just reaching a new tier, Zhou Weiqing had a completely new feeling.</p><br/><p>The Saint Energy in his body had not transformed completely, but it had brought enough surprises for him.</p><br/><p>All of his 36 Death Acupuncture Points had a silverish, galaxy-like Saint Energy sphere. It was like a core. The rest of the Saint Energy revolved around it, making it more consolidated.</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether it was this silvery light or that silvery white light that came from within the body, all the Saint Energy had completely turned into viscous liquid. However, the circulating speed had doubled. Just a thought was enough to make the Saint Energy in his body circulate on its own.</p><br/><p>What was even more amazing was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s perception. He could clearly feel that his Spiritual Energy had greatly improved. Due to the Saint Energy in his body, he could clearly feel the fluctuations of the Atmospheric Energy in a one thousand meter radius.</p><br/><p>The valley seemed to be a naturally formed canyon that was filled with Atmospheric Energy. Naturally, it had an overwhelming force in the outside world. As long as there was a slight fluctuation in the Atmospheric Energy, the entire valley would absorb the Atmospheric Energy from the outside world.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing realized this, he felt like he had fused with the Atmospheric Energy. He could control and manipulate the Atmospheric Energy as long as he could sense it. The Saint Energy in his body did not need him to move. It would circulate and cultivate on its own. On top of that, the cultivation process was the expansion of the silvery mass at the 38th Death Acupuncture Point.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

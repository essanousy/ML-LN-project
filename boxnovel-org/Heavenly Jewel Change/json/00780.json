Initially, the distorted Time attribute energy was just hovering around the man in black\u2019s body. However at that moment, it spread out quickly, and the space within thousands of square meters became distorted. There were countless tiny black cracks on them. It was not caused by Spatial Rend. Instead, it was the effect of Time Rend.</p><br/><p>The impact from Time Rend was not as simple Spatial Rend. Once hit, it might not instantly tear the individual apart. However, there would be repercussions such as instant aging or shrinking in size. Besides, the time wave coming through the cracks was different. That said, once hit, the cracks would cause a time disorder in a person\u2019s body. By then, it would be a real pain in the ass. When one had a low Time Attribute cultivation base, one\u2019s Divine Attribute would not have a powerful impact. It was used more to defend instead of attack. However, when one got to the Heavenly Emperor Tier, the offensive prowess of the Time Attribute would be superior to the Divine Attribute. It was comparable to Demonic Attribute. Moreover, it would be even more unpredictable and harder to defend against.</p><br/><p>As the terrifying energy wave exploded, Zhou Weiqing moved quickly with disdain on his face. To their surprise, he chose to retreat. A reddish gold glow that looked like a nebula was released from his body in a spiral shape. It blocked the overbearing time turbulence outside from getting close to his body.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the man in black had arrived in front of Zhou Weiqing. When he was approaching Zhou Weiqing, all of the cracks from the Time Rend avoided him and created a path for him. As he waved his hand in the air, the sword that was initially on his back appeared in his hand. The sword was also completely black. The sword glinted and a strange distorted black glow rushed towards Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>From the looks of it, the black glow was only about ten meters long. Most people at the Heavenly Emperor Tier would judge the attack superficially and they would not consider it powerful at all. However, Zhou Weiqing knew very well how powerful the man in black\u2019s attack was. It was not a simple or normal attack. It was not even a pure Time Attribute attack. To his surprise, the man in black before him possessed double attributes of Darkness and Time. An upper-level attribute combined with a Divine Attribute. Anyone could imagine how impressive the sword attack would be. It integrated Darkness and Time Attributes perfectly. This fellow could be considered a genius.</p><br/><p>It was unfortunate that the person he encountered was Zhou Weiqing. Faced with the man in black\u2019s attack, the reddish gold Nebula Saint Energy around his body started to distort as well. Soon after, he rotated his body lightly and smashed the dual hammers in his hands forward. It was a strong blow.</p><br/><p>When the loud bang sounded, the black sword glow was crushed into pieces by the Dual God Strength Hammers in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands. Even the large coverage of the distorted time glow was quivering.</p><br/><p>A powerful person could fight 10 martial artists. When strength had reached a certain level, it could not be explained using common theory anymore. The trait of the Ringless Ground Purging Set had given Zhou Weiqing the strength to endure attacks of any attributes by force.</p><br/><p>The disdain on his face did not lessen at all. As Zhou Weiqing took a step into the air, he swung his dual hammers again and directly rushed towards the man in black. At that moment, the man in black felt fear. He was not afraid of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ability. However, he was afraid of the legendary armor set that he was wearing. He had the same Physical Jewel as him which was Strength Jewel. The both of them also had the same Heavenly Emperor-tier cultivation base. However, he could clearly feel the difference in strength between Zhou Weiqing and him, and it could not be explained in theory. Why was it like this? Could it be that his legendary armor set increased the base of his strength?</p><br/><p>From what he remembered, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya\u2019s Ringless Ground Purging Set was the only legendary armor set that increased base strength. This young man before him was clearly not Long Shiya; furthermore, Long Shiya\u2019s Ringless Ground Purging Set was silver in color while this young Heavenly Emperor-tier young man\u2019s armor was gold in color. Besides, this young man\u2019s strength seemed to be even more terrifying.</p><br/><p>Due to his previous experience, the man in black did not dare to fight Zhou Weiqing forcefully anymore. He retreated immediately and lifted both of his hand together in the middle. A rich time turbulence in the air dashed towards Zhou Weiqing. He did not expect the time turbulence to kill Zhou Weiqing, he had a legendary armor set on him after all, and it could shield most of the attack. What he attempted to do was to drain Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Heavenly Energy.</p><br/><p>Since the earlier attack, the man in black had become much calmer. He realized that it would be unwise for him to get agitated There was a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse who was watching on the sideline. When he retreated, he already had the intention to escape. He thought to himself that he would teach Zhou Weiqing a lesson about humiliation in the future. If they were in another place, and it was just the two of them, he would definitely fight Zhou Weiqing at all cost just to redeem his honor.</p><br/><p>However, this was not a good time for him to attack Zhou Weiqing. Therefore, he picked the direction that was opposite from where the Elven Queen standing when he retreated. He was waiting for the best opportunity. As he retreated, the black sword in his hand glowed a dark glow. The sword glows were black and distorted. It made it seem like there were countless black snakes moving in the air. As he shook the sword, the black glows left the sword and dashed towards Zhou Weiqing from all directions. \u2018You have powerful strength, right? Then I shall handle you with this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled. He did not avoid the dark glow. He rotated his body quickly along with the dual hammers, and his speed instantly had an immense boost. None of the dark glows got to him where the dual hammers were. They were all dispelled by the Dual God Strength Hammers.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen watched the both of them fight from far away. She was frowning at that moment because she could see that the man in black was not giving it his all and the same could be said about Zhou Weiqing. What were they doing? They looked like they were putting on a show. A bad thought popped into the Elven Queen\u2019s mind. Could it be that they were both accomplices?</p><br/><p>However, the Elven Queen got rid of that thought. Whether Zhou Weiqing was in cahoots with the man in black or not, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s women were still in the Elf Tribe\u2019s Sealed Land. If Zhou Weiqing wanted to leave now, with his cultivation base, it was sufficient for him to bring all of his women along with him through the Spatial Travel. There was no need for him to bring her along to capture the man in black. The Elven Queen felt guilty for being suspicious. However, Zhou Weiqing would not have blamed her even if he knew she had such thoughts. After all, as a mother, it was normal that she would have such thoughts because she was worried about her daughter that was abducted.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Zhou Weiqing dodged his attack once again, his eyes lit up suddenly. He slashed his sword again. However, this time the black sword glow did not distort anymore as he rushed towards Zhou Weiqing with an enormous Light Blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in surprise. He held up his dual hammers and screamed, \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he lifted up his hammers, reddish gold glow covered the Dual God Strength Hammers.</p><br/><p>As a loud thud sounded out, the space a few hundred of meters away collapsed. The man in black\u2019s body was blown away with the help of the intense shock force. Soon after, circles of distorted halos appeared behind him suddenly. The immense push allowed his body to be thrown back into the sky like an arrow and he became a small, black dot instantly.</p><br/><p>That was the opportunity that he had been waiting for. The swing of his sword was no longer tentative and he had given it his all. Otherwise, Zhou Weiqing would not use Nebula Saint Energy to fight. After that, he took advantage of the shockwave to escape. With such speed, even a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse would not be able to catch up to him easily within a short period of time. Moreover, the circles of distorted halos behind him were expanding, it would be much more difficult to discern the direction in which he ran away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe ran away?\u201d The Elven Queen panicked.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to chase after him, she heard Zhou Weiqing\u2019s voice next to her ear, \u201cLet me do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing did not move at all as he lifted his right hand and pointed the \u2018crying-face\u2019 hammer into the sky. A bright reddish gold glow was shot into the sky, and the sky became dark. How could he not know that the man in black was attempting to escape? If it was him, he would have done the same. He would look for the opportunity to escape and not fight forcefully. Since he figured that out, it was only natural that he was prepared.</p><br/><p>The series of pranks that he put on for the man in black was not meaningless. Since using Spatial Travel, his Saint Energy had been significantly drained, and he needed time to recover. Otherwise, why would he spend so much time with all that nonsense earlier? Moreover, he did not give his all in his attacks. With the help of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation and powerful Saint Energy that he had in him, his cultivation base had almost fully recovered. He was almost ready in his preparation, the next step was to reap his reward.</p><br/><p>The sunny sky became dark in an instant. However, the night sky was extremely clear with countless stars shining in the sky. As Zhou Weiqing shot the reddish gold Nebula Saint Energy into the sky, all of the stars seemed to lit up at that moment. After that, a rich Saint Energy wave exploded from Zhou Weiqing, and he disappeared.</p><br/><p>When the starry sky appeared, the time turbulence in the air disappeared completely. The man in black did not leave any trails for the enemy to find him at all. As the terrifying energy wave exploded from Zhou Weiqing, the peculiar reddish gold color dyed the Ringless Ground Purging Set that he was wearing into the same color. His body disappeared into the starry night. When he re-appeared, he appeared before the man in black. Naturally, the man in black had sensed the changes in the sky and in his own Time attribute energy. However, there was nothing he could do apart from running at full speed. What surprised him was that ever since the sky changed, he seemed to be trapped in the night sky no matter where he ran.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As a God-tier Master himself, he knew best how much longer Zhou Weiqing needed to complete the consolidation. Even if he was left with the final part, he would need three more days! If Zhou Weiqing had to go on for another three days in his current condition, his body would most likely not be able to take it.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Master.\u201d The five wives kneeled before him when they saw Duan Tianlang standing up. To them, they did not care even if Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base made no improvement at all. All they wanted was for their man to live! They could not suppress the emotions they had looking at Zhou Weiqing\u2019s situation in the air.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang took a deep breath slowly and flew into the sky by releasing Heavenly Energy. Long Shiya who was mid-air had been observing what was happening to Duan Tianlang. He could not advise Duan Tianlang as the latter had sacrificed far too much for Zhou Weiqing. Whether he was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s master or Duan Tianlang\u2019s friend, there was nothing he could do at that very moment.</p><br/><p>Long Shiya was secretly relieved when he saw Duan Tianlang flying. \u2018Is it finally ending?\u2019 He thought. However, he felt awful and sadness filled his heart. He felt terrible for Duan Tianlang as the more hopeful one was, the bigger the disappointment would be. One could imagine the impact on Duan Tianlang for the failure this time. Perhaps his best brother would bring this regret with him when he left this world. At the same time, he was sad as well. As a person who possessed the Hiltless Heavenly Purging Set, Long Shiya also wished to see the eleventh piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set! However, it seemed like it was far from possible now.</p><br/><p>Duan Tianlang pursed his lips as he flew slowly towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s direction. The closer he was, the clearer he could see Zhou Weiqing\u2019s condition. It was startling, to say the least. To maintain the consolidation process, many of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s blood vessels were clearly visible on the surface of his skin. He had indeed tried his very best to hold on to the consolidation by burning through his life force! Furthermore, he could not afford the slightest mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeiqing, let\u2019s forget about it\u2026\u201d Duan Tianlang said softly as his lips were shaking. However, nobody had expected Zhou Weiqing to ignore what Duan Tianlang had just said. His hand movements did not seem to show any signs of stopping at all. Just as everyone panicked and did not know what to do, a layer of a faint jade-green light emitted from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A mellow sigh came from the sky, \u201cYou idiot, why are you reluctant to borrow my strength? Do you really think that I\u2019ll live if you drain yourself to death? Such an idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the layer of the jade-green light emitting from Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body grew. In an instant, it had dyed Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body in a shade of jade-green color. The life force that he had been consuming was recovering at a stunning speed. Zhou Weiqing was also connecting the Saint Energy that was initially unwilling to complete the final integration, like a kitten under the jade-green glow and imprinted itself on the very end of the scroll.</p><br/><p>A beautiful silhouette appeared in the sky. Six wings opened up on her back, and her expression was gentle as she looked at the persistent man below him. At the same time, a glow was beaming on her chest. She then mumbled to herself, \u201cWhy do I have such painful emotions in my heart? Could this be the affection or the love that humans speak of? But, I\u2019m not human.\u201d</p><br/><p>The appearance of the Elven Queen made a massive part of the sky turn a jade-green color. At the same time, a rich life aura descended from the heavens. The Elven Queen\u2019s blood was probably the most crucial part of the Consolidating Ink. Because of this, the Consolidating Ink became rather smooth. The last step that would have initially taken another three days had been completed by Zhou Weiqing in an instant, with the support of the Elven Queen.</p><br/><p>A scorching jade-green light was shining in the sky while a dense wave of energy shook the area above Heavenly Bow City intensely. Even such a powerhouse like the Elven Queen had to avoid the scorching light temporarily and backed off far away. A few days back, when Zhou Weiqing began consuming his life force, the Elven Queen who shared a life with him had felt it. Although Zhou Weiqing insisted not to borrow the Elven Queen\u2019s life force, how could she not notice it, especially since they were connected closely?</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, the Elven Queen made her way there immediately without hesitation. Even she herself did not know if she did it to save her own life or out of her concern for Zhou Weiqing. It was only when she came to release the life force into Zhou Weiqing by force to protect his body via the connection they had, that she realized that she might have an indescribable connection with this man. It was most probably caused by the time when they absorbed the energy of one another.</p><br/><p>The jade-green light was changing its form slowly in the air. The complicated patterns completely disappeared within a second and turned into a piercing, jade-green light before it sped thousands of meters away instantly. It was drifting quickly in the air like it was celebrating a new life. When the jade green light began to move, it looked like the Jade Dragon\u2019s previous form. However, it was much bigger than the Jade Dragon now. Slowly, intense lights like stars sparkling could be seen on it. Its original green color had gradually faded following the appearance of the starts and it turned a shade of white. It was a crystal clear white.</p><br/><p>The Elven Queen could not help but open her beautiful eyes widely when she saw the white color. She could clearly feel its contents. Zhou Weiqing made it! He had successfully created the eleventh piece of the legendary set. However, it was not merely a legendary set achieved by a first timer. Although Zhou Weiqing was considered a true rookie in the eyes of a God-tier Master, without Time Reversal, there was no way he could complete the consolidation this time. However, one should not forget that how difficult it was to perform the consolidation, especially without using Heavenly Energy!</p><br/><p>In the making of the Consolidation Equipment Scroll of the legendary set, the creator needed to integrate his own Heavenly Energy into the scroll in order to gradually complete it. What Zhou Weiqing put in was not Heavenly Energy, but Saint Energy instead. He had arrived at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor-tier, and he had the power of the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core\u2019s Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>That was the reason why it was so difficult to make the scroll, and was possibly the reason why Zhou Weiqing\u2019s energy was almost drained. One should know that Zhou Weiqing\u2019s ability now was nothing short of a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse. He only managed to complete consolidating the final scroll with the help of the Elven Queen. One could imagine how much Saint Energy was absorbed during the consolidation of the scroll. On top of that, a massive amount of Saint Energy provided by the Astral Divine Territory had been drained too.</p><br/><p>Levitating midair, Duan Tianlang who was not far away from Zhou Weiqing did not have the intention to back off at all. It was Long Shiya who came to protect him lest he was washed away by the overbearing remaining waves of energy in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuring the Dragon, Second to None. This shall be a miracle that will not occur twice. It\u2019s done \u2013 we\u2019ve made it! I\u2019ve finally seen the completion of the eleventh piece of the legendary set. Besides, this is completely not the legendary set that I designed. The Saint Energy had improved it. We really did it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The massive white light instantly shot tens of thousands of meters above the air. They could only see the white dots of light that were left. However, Zhou Weiqing was not in a rush this time as he clearly felt the connection between him and the white light. The eleventh piece of the Ringless Ground Purging Set had finally been completed. The scroll that was consolidated from thin air had become a part of his body as soon as it was completed.</p><br/><p>The very next second, the white light was sent down from above. It spread out when it arrived hundreds of meters above Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head. It then spread out in the form of a gigantic white halo. Zhou Weiqing lifted his right hand up entirely by instinct. There were eleven Ice Jade Physical Jewels releasing a gentle white light on his right hand. It seemed like it was choking with the white halo in the air. Then, the gigantic white halo descended from above. A deafening roar of a dragon\u2019s groan coupled with a peculiar fluctuation that seemed to contain a profound understanding of the heavens and earth gathered towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand from every direction.</p><br/><p>Buzz \u2014</p><br/><p>As the white light met the Ice Jade Physical Jewels, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body began to shake intensely. All the Saint Energy that he had consumed seemed to be completely refilled immediately. Besides, the ten-piece Ringless Ground Purging Set that he already possessed seemed to be activated by the milky white light. They released waves of energy which felt like it was rejecting the last eleventh piece.</p><br/><p>A peculiar thing then happened. A Physical Jewel was consolidated apart from the eleven Physical Jewels that Zhou Weiqing possessed. What set it apart was that although it was also white, it was different from the eleven of them. It was crystal clear; the white jewel that was filled with a profound understanding of the heavens and earth had become the leader of the other eleven Ice Jade Physical Jewels. Besides, this Physical Jewel seemed a little different from the remaining eleven jewels as it felt like it was a void. They could vaguely see a tiny dragon roaming about in the white jewel.</p><br/><p>The initial Ringless Ground Purging Set eventually became quiet. It took a much lesser time to be mastered than what Zhou Weiqing had imagined. Then, ten dark golden lights lit up on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body in a wave as the Ringless Ground Purging Set was put onto his body. It was still the ten-piece set but it was not bright gold when it was completed. It had reverted to a dark golden color, similar to how it was in the beginning. However, Zhou Weiqing clearly felt that the dark golden colored ten-piece set was completely different than it was before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

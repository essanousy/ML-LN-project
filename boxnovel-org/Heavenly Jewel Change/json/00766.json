This was because even though the aura that Bing\u2019er radiated was filled with the energy ripples of the Saint Energy too, it did not have the kind of purity that Zhou Weiqing possessed. It was apparent that there was some Wind attribute energy ripple mixed in with her Saint Energy.</p><br/><p>This was obviously because she did not possess any Saint Attribute in the first place. It was impossible to form a true Saint Nucleus Core without any Saint Attribute in the body.</p><br/><p>However, this did not mean that Shangguan Bing\u2019er was not powerful at all. The nourishment that Zhou Weiqing gave her was not in vain. When she was solidifying her Nucleus Core, her body was entirely filled with the Starcrux Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing transfused into her body. Just that alone would make her Nucleus Core far superior to the other Heavenly King-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>In truth, as far as Shangguan Bing\u2019er was concerned, even if her Nucleus Core was not entirely made from pure Saint Energy, it was still beneficial to her as long as she could solidify the Nucleus Core successfully. This was because after her Nucleus Core was successfully formed, she would be able to devour the Atmospheric Energy on her own to replenish her energy during her cultivation. There would be no need for her to rely on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy anymore for her cultivation.</p><br/><p>In other words, even if her Saint Energy was not entirely pure, it was at least still part of the Saint Energy. She could also solidify it by filtering the energies from the outer world. To a certain extent, Bing\u2019er\u2019s Saint Nucleus Core was actually a sub-Saint Nucleus Core, and it was still far superior compared to the other ordinary Heavenly King-tier powerhouses.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the space in front of the two girls suddenly distorted without any warning. Two huge hands appeared out of thin air and grabbed onto each of them.</p><br/><p>Both Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er had already reached the Ninth Jewel Tier. Coupled with their originally mighty strength, they reacted almost instantly. Just as they were about to unleash their techniques to attack the offender, they suddenly realized that the space around them had abruptly collapsed. A powerful Spatial Energy bound them tightly, and it left them with no space to move at all.</p><br/><p>Within seconds, a familiar figure stepped out of the distorted space and planted a heavy kiss on both of their red lips before he released the two women from the constraint. With a slide, that figure leaped a few meters away from them. Very quickly, the collapsed space immediately returned to its normal state.</p><br/><p>At first, Xue\u2019er and Fei\u2019er were completely taken aback because they thought they had encountered a very strong enemy. The moment they finally caught a clear glimpse of the person, they were immediately filled with wrath. This thief who had just stolen their kisses was none other than that evil bastard \u2014 Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled cheekily at both girls as he asked, \u201cHi, ladies, why don\u2019t you properly welcome your husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei\u2019er snorted coldly, \u201cWho\u2019s your wife? Stop being so full of yourself! Hmmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue\u2019er did not speak a word at all. Her face remained cold as usual.</p><br/><p>Dejectedly, Zhou Weiqing came closer to them as he asked, \u201cWhat are you two trying to do? Just tell me directly if there\u2019s anything that you feel unhappy about. Don\u2019t just keep it in your hearts. Yes, it\u2019s all my fault! I was too occupied recently, to the point that I\u2019ve been ignoring you all. I\u2019m willing to accept any punishment from you two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fei\u2019er scoffed loudly, \u201cIgnore us? You haven\u2019t only been ignoring us for one or two days, you know. Ever since you\u2019ve established that Peerless Battalion, I\u2019ve worked my ass off helping you to take charge! And you? You keep disappearing whenever you like! Fine, I won\u2019t hold you to that, but let me ask you, what the hell\u2019s with the issue of this Little Witch? And what\u2019s going on with that Heavenly Demon Sect? You better explain to us clearly. Otherwise, the three of us will return to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace once Little Sis is done with her breakthrough!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing saw how enraged Fei\u2019er was, he stepped forward to give her a hug. However, she pushed him away roughly with all her might. Although Xue\u2019er remained silent, a look of doubt could be seen in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head. \u201cPlease let me explain, alright? The story about Little Witch is like this\u2026\u201d Zhou Weiqing was indeed smart. He knew very well that sometimes white lies were good, but at times like this, it would be better to just tell the truth. Otherwise, he would lose the love of the girls.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he sincerely retold the story about him and Little Witch. Of course, he deliberately emphasized how deeply in danger he was during that ordeal, and how he was not in his right mind when he slept with Little Witch. Other than that, he more or less told them the truth regarding the entire incident.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Well, as you know, I\u2019m not really a good person. But for the sake of my cultivation, or you can even say, my life, she did sacrifice a girl\u2019s most important thing for me. Not only that, Teacher was there as well during the whole process. So at the very least, I need to be responsible for the things I\u2019ve done to her. This is all my fault. I\u2019m to blame for not being able to find you all in time. Otherwise, there would\u2019ve been no need for me to do that with Little Witch at all. That time, Teacher even told me that Lady Luck was on my side, and at least I got myself a good girl that day. Otherwise, he would have caught a sow to become my sacrifice.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they heard Zhou Weiqing\u2019s last sentence, the two Shangguan sisters could not help but burst out in laughter. They just could not resist it when they imagined Zhou Weiqing being together with a sow. With just this laugh, the tense atmosphere between the three of them lifted almost immediately.</p><br/><p>Fei\u2019er snapped as she glared viciously at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cYou bastard! How dare you flirt as you like everywhere you go. See! There are already five! Let me be frank with you, if there\u2019s a sixth one, I\u2019m going to castrate you without any hesitation!\u201d She even made a furious slicing motion with her hand.</p><br/><p>Horrified, Zhou Weiqing quickly covered his lower body with his hands. \u201cNever again! Your Majesty! I\u2019ll never do that again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Creases formed between Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s brows. \u201cThen what\u2019s going on with the Heavenly Demon Sect? We understand your action of joining forces with the Heavenly Demon Sect to fight against Blood Red Hell. However, you\u2019re now letting them stay at the Heavenly Bow Empire! Not only that, it seems like you\u2019re trying to be a part of the sect as well. Weiqing, even if you don\u2019t consider our position as people who were raised in the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace, you should at least know how bad the Heavenly Demon Sect\u2019s reputation is in the Boundless Mainland. None of the countries dare to formally take them in. Are you trying to make the Heavenly Bow Empire a common target for scorn and ridicule?\u201d</p><br/><p>Smiling faintly, Zhou Weiqing leaned forward and forcefully took Fei\u2019er into his arms before he used another hand to wrap around Xue\u2019er\u2019s waist. \u201cWhat Heavenly Demon Sect? I did not agree to join them. If I join a Saint Land, naturally I\u2019ll join the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace! Three of my wives were all born there after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue\u2019er allowed him to hug her, yet the same expression remained on her face. \u201cWeiqing, you really have to draw a line on this matter. Perhaps you don\u2019t care much about your reputation, but the Heavenly Bow Empire is totally different. I dare say that if the news about Heavenly Bow Empire accepting the Heavenly Demon Sect spreads out one day somehow, the Fei Li Empire will most likely stop supplying resources to us immediately. Not only that, we\u2019ll probably be shunned by the public as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing smiled. \u201cThe Heavenly Demon Sect will never exist in the Heavenly Bow Empire. Xue\u2019er, I\u2019m being serious about this. Oh yeah, there\u2019s something that I\u2019d like to discuss with you two. I\u2019d like to invite you two beautiful women to join me in my newly founded Peerless Sect and become the wives of the sect leader. What do you guys think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeerless Sect?\u201d Xue\u2019er looked at him with a puzzled face.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head. \u201cYes, the Peerless Sect. Me, this useless guy, is the sect leader of the Peerless Sect. My teacher, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, will be the Supreme Elder advisor of our sect. All of the original members of our Peerless Regiment who have a cultivation base of Sixth Jewel and above will become teachers in the Peerless Sect. Although we\u2019re still slightly lacking in terms of mighty powerhouses now, I dare say that once our Peerless Sect is established, it\u2019ll definitely become the Saint Land with the most Jewel Masters in this mainland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s eyes lit up immediately. \u201cLittle Fatty, you want to establish a Saint Land? Seriously?Are you sure you can do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing found what she said funny, so he planted a kiss on her nose. \u201cAs a man, how can I say that I can\u2019t do it? Don\u2019t forget that your husband is a Heavenly Emperor now. Not only that, with my Saint Energy cultivation base, no other ordinary Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses can be compared to me. Why am I not qualified to set up a Saint Land? We\u2019ll have to slowly build up the history and heritage anyway. Oh yeah, there\u2019s another thing that I have to tell you. The Heavenly Demon Sect has already been completely removed from the world. From now on, there\u2019s no more Heavenly Demon Sect. All we have now is the Peerless Sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that Zhou Weiqing had made it so clear, if the two women still did not catch his underlying meaning, then they were not worthy of calling themselves the descendants of the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace anymore.</p><br/><p>Xue\u2019er, who was always calm and composed, had her cherry-red lips wide open. Her face was completely filled with shock.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing stole a kiss from her soft pink lips. When he recalled how he was sent flying from her slap after he kissed the wrong person previously, a gush of warmth filled his heart immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you admire your husband now?\u201d Zhou Weiqing chuckled.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er stared at him. \u201cD-Did you.. you really buy over the Heavenly Demon Sect? How could they possibly agree to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing replied with a face full of triumph, \u201cWell, I have the ability to do that. Do you know why the Demonic Emperor came to the Heavenly Bow Empire in the first place? At that time, I was not even a Heavenly Emperor yet, but he came with the purpose of asking me to join the Heavenly Demon Sect. Not to join the Heavenly Demon Sect per se, but to take over his position as the Heavenly Demon Sect leader instead. Just from his action, it\u2019s obvious that the Demonic Emperor is a lot more sincere than your uncle, you know. However, I didn\u2019t agree to his request at all. Well, the first reason is naturally that I was thinking for all of you, and the second one lies with the problems of the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn truth, I\u2019ve long had a plan of setting up my own Saint Land. A man needs to have his own career after all. When everything on the mainland has gone back to being calm and normal, we should also have a home of our own. Marrying a Saint Lord would not be too bad for you all either.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhou Weiqing saw that there were looks of slight disbelief on the two women\u2019s faces, he said in a slightly dejected voice, \u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s normal that you all don\u2019t believe it. Even though the Heavenly Demon Sect has fallen, there\u2019s still at least one Heavenly Emperor and six Heavenly King-tier powerhouses. Do you find it hard to believe that I can command them with the power I possess now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er did not say a word. Shangguan Fei\u2019er, on the other hand, nodded her head without any hesitation. There was no need for her to hide anything from Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

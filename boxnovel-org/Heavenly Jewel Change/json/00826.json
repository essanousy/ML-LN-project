Although she was around a hundred meters tall when she when she took the form of the Goddess of Nature, she was still not as enormous as Duo Si. However, the Natural Divine Territory was like an iron plate due to her presence.</p><br/><p>Although Hui Yao and Duo Si had lost control of their senses, the thousands of years of experience in battle that they had was deeply ingrained. They would be able to find the weakest spot of the Natural Divine Territory as soon as they attacked. Meanwhile, the Elven Empress levitated in midair as she continuously waved the Goddess Nature Staff. Rays and rays of jade green light spread out, protecting their bodies that were vulnerable to the impact.</p><br/><p>If it was a one-on-one battle, the Elven Empress would definitely suffer severe injuries if she attempted to defeat Hui Yao. However, it was not a one-on-one battle at the moment. With the help from the Elf Tribe\u2019s twelve elders and other factors, Hui Yao and Duo Si would not be able to come within a hundred meters of the Elven Empress even if they were to attack her together.</p><br/><p>Each ray of the jade green light shone on the two enormous dragons\u2019 bodies. The rich Destruction Attribute on their bodies retreated a little from the suppression. Even a portion of it was separated and then dissolved by the Natural Divine Territory. The Elven Empress could not be compared to her former self after she finally understood the principles of the Life Saint Energy. Although it might seem like she had only upgraded from the Upper Level of the Heavenly God Tier to the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier, her abilities had been elevated a few folds in reality.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had previously said that the Elven Empress might be an invincible entity in this world unless he managed to advance to the Heavenly God Tier to suppress the Elven Empress\u2019 attribute. However, this estimation did not take the merging of the Elven Empress and the Ancient Elven Tree into consideration.</p><br/><p>Ever since the Ancient Elven Tree evolved, the entire Elf Tribe became rather powerful. That was how the four Elf Tribe elders could advance to the Heavenly God Tier or it would be impossible for them to experience such a breakthrough. At this moment, the Natural Divine Territory was effectively restraining the attack by the two enormous dragons while it continuously defended the Elven Empress. Although their situation was different from Huang Xingyun and his wife who could not even see what was happening outside, they were trapped even deeper. The Elven Empress\u2019 attack could not compare to the Heavenly Expanse Infinitum Formation. Natural Aura was mixed with rich Life Saint Energy but the lights that shone on the two enormous dragons could not really harm them, though it could efficiently remove the Destruction Energy in their bodies. If that persisted, the abilities of the two enormous dragons would be weakened. Moreover, Zhou Weiqing might not even need to do anything because it seemed like the Elven Empress\u2019 Life Saint Energy was enough to help the dragons regain their senses.</p><br/><p>Although the Elven Empress was executing everything calmly, she did not look too good. She would occasionally display a worried expression on her face as she glanced every so often at the battle that was happening on the other side. Even though she had restrained Hui Yao and Duo Si at the moment, the power of the two enormous dragons surpassed her expectation. Due to that, the Elf Tribe was not able to assist Zhou Weiqing. Zhou Weiqing was currently facing Fen Tian! That person was the true mastermind after all, how could the Elven Empress not worry?</p><br/><p>Even since she and Zhou Weiqing shared a life, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s importance had risen to quite a high position in her heart. She definitely did not wish for Zhou Weiqing to experience any danger. This distracted her as she glanced at the battle between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian. As soon as Zhou Weiqing was in any danger, she would head over there to help immediately.</p><br/><p>However, did Zhou Weiqing truly need her help? After a short moment of observation, an expression of astonishment and disbelief appeared on the Goddess of Nature\u2019s face that the Elven Empress had transformed into. Among the five battles on the battlefield, the battle with the biggest disparity was not the ones that were fought on the ground. Instead, it was the battle between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian that was being fought in the air. One was at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier while the other only possessed a cultivation base at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier. The difference in each rank above the Heavenly King Tier was like heaven and earth. Taking that into account, Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian were four ranks apart.</p><br/><p>If Fen Tian was fighting a regular Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouse, he would definitely say that he would only need a second to crush the person to death. However, his opponent at the moment was Zhou Weiqing so he had to be cautious. Fen Tian stared coldly at Zhou Weiqing as he ascended to the sky. Neither one of them took the initiative to attack first. In Fen Tian\u2019s opinion, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s unpredictability posed the biggest threat. He had no idea what Zhou Weiqing\u2019s most powerful ability was. Based on the fact that he managed to defeat two Heavenly Emperors even though he was only at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier, he was not someone who was as simple as a regular Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor. Fen Tian grew even more cautious when the gigantic wings unfurled on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s back, his eyes filled with a demonic glow.</p><br/><p>On the surface, Fen Tian\u2019s character seemed to be extremely violent. However, he was actually a very cautious person. He would not attack if he did not have absolute confidence. To put it simply, he was not the type to take unnecessary risks.</p><br/><p>The Astral Divine Territory that was hovering above Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head made the glow of the white Saint Energy on his body even more dazzling.</p><br/><p>\u201cFen Tian, I can\u2019t believe that all of you are sacrificing your ancestors for your personal desire. I shall bring you to justice as a Sect Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fen Tian glared coldly at Zhou Weiqing, \u201cAncestors are just skeletons if they stayed in their coffins. I\u2019ve given them the opportunity to be reborn. They should thank me. Though I do admit, I\u2019ve underestimated you. If only I took you seriously earlier, I would\u2019ve killed you before you became this powerful and things wouldn\u2019t have to be so troublesome. I didn\u2019t expect that the one who\u2019s obstructing my way at the very end isn\u2019t the Heavenly Snow Mountain or the Heavenly Expanse Palace but you, the leader of the so-called Peerless Sect. However, do you really think you can take me on fairly with just your abilities alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, \u201cSince you think I\u2019m no match for you, why don\u2019t you attack me now? What\u2019re you afraid of? I\u2019ve seen through you, Fen Tian. You\u2019re actually an indecisive person. If I was you, I wouldn\u2019t have even waited until now to attack. I would\u2019ve used all of my power to attack a Saint Land. However, you\u2019ve only been waiting for the opportunity to suppress the compromise between the Heavenly Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain. You\u2019re afraid that they\u2019d cause you a huge loss. Oh, that isn\u2019t right. That\u2019s not the only thing that you\u2019re afraid of. Perhaps your ambition isn\u2019t as simple as ruling the world. Perhaps Huang Xingyun is your obstacle, maybe even the master pulling your strings has become your target as well. It\u2019s very possible that a mad dog like you would bite your master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Fen Tian\u2019s expression changed and his eyes were ferocious. He pointed the heavy sword in his hand at Zhou Weiqing, and a terrifying aura of suppression made Zhou Weiqing unable to speak. Fen Tian\u2019s body gave off a purplish-black glow in a frenzy, and a gigantic devouring mouth rose behind him at the same time. The difference between that mouth and Shen Mo\u2019s was that there was a faint, gigantic black shadow within the mouth. The shadow seemed to be in the form of an enormous black crab.</p><br/><p>A wave of purplish-black light darted out and surrounded his heavy sword as a domineering Destruction Aura shot and shined towards Zhou Weiqing. At the same time, Fen Tian\u2019s body was expanding together with the wind, and he expanded to a thousand meters in height in an instant. The gigantic devouring mouth and the black shadow merged with Fen Tian\u2019s expanded body while the crab\u2019s shadow was imprinted on his chest.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why the Elven Empress\u2019 expression changed when she saw that \u2014 this was the difference between cultivation bases. At that moment, Fen Tian was releasing the Destruction God. The overbearing Destruction Aura seemed like it was going to tear the heavens and earth apart. Even the Natural Divine Territory that the Elven Empress and the twelve Elven Elders had unleashed shrank due to the suppression of the Destructive Divine Territory since the Destruction God appeared. One could imagine how powerful Fen Tian was at that moment.</p><br/><p>Although Shen Mo could release his Destructive Divine Territory as well, the difference similar to an adult and a child when compared to Fen Tian. The Maximum Level of the Heavenly God Tier was just a step away from an entirely different realm. Among the crowd, there were two individuals who were at the same level. One was the Elven Empress and the other was Fen Tian. Even the enormous dragon Hui Yao was very far away from this level.</p><br/><p>That was true ability, the abilities of a true powerhouse. The heavy sword in Fen Tian\u2019s hand expanded following his body. The purplish-black glow on the gigantic heavy sword completely sealed everything around Zhou Weiqing, including his Astral Divine Territory. The terrifying energy wave seemed like it could smash him into powder.</p><br/><p>As Fen Tian\u2019s opponent, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s felt the most intense emotions. The Destruction Energy felt like it was going to tear off his Astral Divine Territory. The terrifying energy wave was moving frenziedly in the air, resulting in Zhou Weiqing being unable to breathe. Fen Tian was furious. The threat that Zhou Weiqing posed made him unleash his most powerful ability. One could only imagine how the Natural Divine Territory could not be compared to the power of the Destructive God in the Destructive Divine Territory any longer. If the Elven Empress did not have the help of the Ancient Elven Tree, it would be impossible to go against Fen Tian under such circumstances.</p><br/><p>What should Zhou Weiqing do? The appearance of the Destruction God had caused the battles on the ground to slow down. Countless eyes were trained on the sky, and the powerhouses from Love Valley and Blood Red Hell\u2019s had a hint of ferocity in their eyes, their morale flying high. Meanwhile, the powerhouses from the Peerless Sect, Heavenly Snow Mountain, and Heavenly Expanse Palace were clearly stunned. All of them understood that as soon as Zhou Weiqing who was in the air was defeated, it would mean the end of everything once the Destruction God descends from the heavens.</p><br/><p>However, right at that very moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. The demonic glow in his eyes shone while the Astral Divine Territory was rapidly shrinking. It then transformed into a cloud of light and flew towards Zhou Weiqing. When it arrived before Zhou Weiqing, it was only the size of a palm. The Astral Divine Territory advanced slowly as it fastened itself on the Starcrux Saint Nucleus Core on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s chest before it quietly merged with it. Suddenly, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body lit up. Whitish-gold starlight was surging out and supported the territory that belonged to it within the destructive glow by force.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s eyes turned gray. He retracted the Dual God Strength Hammers in his hands as a rich gray color instantly emitted out from his right leg. He shot up into the sky like a cloud of black smoke as the whitish-gold starlight surrounded him. Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body vanished, and similar to before, a gigantic shadow that also grew to a thousand meters tall appeared in the sky instantly. It was in no way weaker than the Destruction God before them. It had an extremely handsome and a pale face with a pair of gray eyes. In the middle of its forehead, was a fine vein that stretched to the area between its brows. The gigantic shadow was giving off a demonic aura.</p><br/><p>Demon God. Yes \u2014 this was the Demon God. Zhou Weiqing could not claim a Divine Territory on his own so it was impossible for him to summon the god from his own attribute like Fen Tian. However, it should not be forgotten that he possessed the power of the Demon God in his blood, and the Demon God was also one of the most powerful gods. The Demon God appeared, and with Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Nebula Saint Energy, it forcefully broke through the seal from the Destruction God with its overwhelming demonic aura and swelled abruptly.</p><br/><p>The Demon God\u2019s body was very distinct, and it seemed like it was an entity by itself. If it was not for the fact that not many people that knew Zhou Weiqing only had a cultivation base at the Maximum Level of the Heavenly Emperor Tier, they would think that both the Demon God and Destruction God were on the same level. The manifestation of the Destruction God bore a resemblance to Fen Tian\u2019s looks as it sparkled with a rich purplish-black glow. Even its eyes were shining with a purplish-black light. Its hair was a devilish purplish, and it was filled with a ruthless aura.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on the other side, the Demon God that Zhou Weiqing transformed into clearly did not look like him. It had a gray robe covering its entire body while its gray eyes were filled with endless pride. Intense disdain gleamed in its eyes as he looked at the Destruction God before him. The two, thousand-meter tall giants faced each other in the air while they released the powerful aura that only gods possessed. The powerhouses from the Heavenly Snow Mountain and Peerless Sect who were in slight despair saw hope again. Although they had no idea how Zhou Weiqing managed to do it, at the very least they now had a powerhouse who could fight the opponent.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, there was a human-like smile on the extremely handsome Demon God\u2019s face. In accordance with his odd character, it gave off a demonic yet mysterious feel. Although he was smiling, his gray eyes were filled with extreme coldness.</p><br/><p>\u201cFen Tian, show me how much of God\u2019s power your Destruction God wields.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the person who was most shocked was Fen Tian. What was a God? It was an entity that completely surpassed the humans. It was a powerful entity that could control the heavens and earth. Naturally, the Destruction God that Fen Tian transformed into was not an actual god. If he could transform into a real god, then he would not only be on the Heavenly God Tier but at the legendary Heavenly Change Tier instead. One could only transform into a god when one achieved the Heavenly Change Tier. If that was the case, how could he still be controlled by his master?</p><br/><p>Therefore, the Destruction God was just an imitation that he created by combining his own Destruction Energy and Destructive Divine Territory. Although it was just an imitation, Fen Tian could faintly feel its level and the power of the Heavenly Change Tier. Due to that, he could clearly feel that the Demon God that Zhou Weiqing transformed into was an entity that was on the same level!</p><br/><p>Fen Tian knew very well that it was not Zhou Weiqing\u2019s actual body. However, even though it was not Zhou Weiqing\u2019s actual body, based on the fact that he could summon the Demon God here meant that Fen Tian was on the losing end in terms of the purity of the gods they summoned. \u2018How did he manage to do it? How exactly did he do it?\u2019 Fen Tian had questions in his heart but it did not matter because the battle had to go on.</p><br/><p>Just like what Zhou Weiqing said, Fen Tian\u2019s character was slightly indecisive. Fen Tian was a little scared when he faced the overbearing Demon God. Moreover, he could sense its powerful aura that was as vast as the starry night. As he lifted up the gigantic sword in his hand, the rich purplish-black glow turned the sky behind his back into a purplish-black color. However, he got into a defensive stance.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the Demon God that Zhou Weiqing transformed into did not move as well. It was just standing there quietly as its gray eyes gave off a demonic glow that shone in all directions. The overbearing force of suppression had forced out a path from the Destructive Divine Territory on his side. It did not affect the Natural Divine Territory nor did it look after the powerhouses from the Love Valley and Blood Red Hell. It was not Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first time summoning the Demon God. However, there was no doubt the control he had on the Demon God would rise significantly each time he summoned it. Zhou Weiqing only managed to summon a faint consciousness of the Demon God during his first try and the instant protection of the Demon God during his second try. This time, he managed to summon an actual projection of the Demon God. Moreover, it was projected with the part of the abilities of the actual Demon God.</p><br/><p>That was how powerful Zhou Weiqing was. The greatness of Saint Energy was boundless, and it allowed him to unleash the power of his bloodline to the highest degree. It was neither possible for Zhou Weiqing to release the actual Demon God, nor was it possible for him to actually become a Demon God. However, he could use the Demon God\u2019s power in his battle. Although he had no idea how long this Demon God that he summoned would last, this was the only way to defend against Fen Tian at the moment.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian who was a thousand meters tall at the moment, let out a ferocious roar as the terrifying purplish-black light suddenly soared upward. Like countless waves, they hit the gray sky on the Demon God\u2019s side. Flashes of purplish-black light transformed into gigantic devouring mouths that were in a frenzy as they tore and destroyed the Demonic Energy in the air.</p><br/><p>The Demon God finally moved, and there was a hint of anger on his handsome face. He seemed to be really agitated by Fen Tian. He lifted his hand slowly and the Destructive Energy before him, approximately tens of thousands of meters in the sky completely solidified from the Demon God lifting its hand. The Demon God clenched his right fist tightly as a gigantic crack that traveled tens of thousands of meters in the sky appeared just like that. All the Destruction Energy that was shot at it at the beginning vanished, as the gigantic crack appeared that seemed to tear the sky in half. When the Demonic Energy appeared like a domineering storm with rolling clouds, the Destruction Energy that initially suppressed the Demon God\u2019s side was instantly devoured.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian widened his eyes in shock as two beams of purplish-black light shot out from his eyes. What did it do? Did the Demon God just devour his Destruction Energy? How was this possible? Could Destruction Energy even be devoured? The Demon God would definitely not be able to devour the Destruction Energy if Fen Tian possessed true Destruction Energy, one that could destroy the world. Unfortunately, his Destruction Energy was similar to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy. There were impurities in it, and his Destruction Energy was not as pure as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy. One could imagine how powerful the Demon God was judging by his Devour ability. Moreover, Zhou Weiqing was supporting the Devour Skill with his Saint Energy, causing even the Destruction Energy was devoured by the terrifying Demonic Energy.</p><br/><p>Based on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s current cultivation base, apart from summoning the Demon God, he would not be able to even release one attack from the Demon God under regular circumstances. What he depended on was Saint Energy! Put simply, if one was to describe Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Saint Energy, it would be described as a form of impure Genesis Energy. Humans and most gods were fatally attracted to Genesis Energy. Of course, the Destruction God was an exception because it was an entity that was the exact opposite of Genesis Energy.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Zhou Weiqing could borrow the Demonic Energy from the Demon God that he summoned and projected here. The Demon God\u2019s actual body could gain Saint Energy from Zhou Weiqing even though its location was unknown. Although it was impure, it was still Genesis Energy after all and was greatly beneficial to the Demon God.</p><br/><p>The gigantic crack in the sky was slowly sealing. If the tear was not big enough to devour the entire Boundless Mainland, it would result in the tear vanishing. Fen Tian roared ferociously and swung the gigantic heavy sword towards the Demon God\u2019s head with both of his hands. He had given up the plan of attacking with caution. After the attack earlier, Fen Tian was absolutely sure that Zhou Weiqing had transformed into the genuine Demon God. Perhaps, it was not the true Demon God, but it definitely possessed a portion of the Demon God\u2019s power. However, if he continued to attack in a testing manner, he would end up being devoured time after time.</p><br/><p>The gigantic heavy sword came from the sky. As the Demon God faced the icy cold, purplish-black Destruction Energy, the sky sank. The whole sky seemed like it was cracking from when Fen Tian swung his sword, and the crack spread towards Zhou Weiqing\u2019s direction. The Demon God moved as its eyes sparkled. Not only did he not stagger backward, he moved forward with both his hands lifted up and put his palms together on top of his head.</p><br/><p>Bang\u2014</p><br/><p>Demonic and Destruction Energy spread out immediately and turned into a circle of distorted ripples that exploded in the sky. The collision this time drove the Natural Divine Territory tens of thousands of meters away. Fortunately, the battle between the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and Shen Mo was on the other side of the Natural Divine Territory. Otherwise, the aftershock might affect them, and they might have to temporarily end their battle. It was also fortunate that the collision happened in the air or else the clash might cause half of the Wan Shou Heaven to vanish forever from this world.</p><br/><p>What was more terrifying was at the back. As the distorted ripples faded away in the air, what appeared next was shocking. The Demon God\u2019s palms that were pressed together abruptly caught Fen Tian\u2019s destructive heavy sword. Fen Tian could not move, and it was the first time the two gods were in close proximity to each other. They looked at each other.</p><br/><p>The Destruction God\u2019s purplish-black eyes had ferocious flames bursting out of it. His huge and muscular arms pressed down with all his strength as he attempted to swing the destructive heavy sword down on the Demon God\u2019s body. However, it was obvious that the Demon God\u2019s strength was far beyond that of the Destruction God. Its palms that were pressed together did not move at all, and there was not even a chance for the destructive great sword to escape.</p><br/><p>That was the difference between an imitation of a god and the projection of a god. Judging by their levels, Fen Tian was below Zhou Weiqing after all. Moreover, the Demon God possessed the Demon God bloodline. That was why the projection had similar characteristics to him and was so powerful. Zhou Weiqing, who had the ten-piece Ringless Ground Purging Set on him, elevated his power by 1024-fold. One could imagine how powerful he was with that elevation of power. Even without the Demon God, Fen Tian might not be Zhou Weiqing\u2019s opponent judging from their strength.</p><br/><p>The Demon God\u2019s right leg moved. It was the most powerful part of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body. His leg kicked towards the side of the Destruction God\u2019s face at lightning speed. At that moment, the Destruction God only had two options. He could either let go of his sword or fight forcefully. Naturally, Fen Tian was unwilling to give up on the heavy sword in his hands. He had a weapon while the Demon God did not. He thought it was his biggest advantage at the moment so he chose to fight by force. The Destruction God lifted his left leg and extended his knee to block the Demon God\u2019s leg that was kicking at him.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>It was another tremendous bang. The Destruction God roared, and it caused the Destructive Divine Territory in the air to spread outward temporarily. Those standing below could clearly see a cloud of warped light spreading out, and they could clearly see that the Destructive God\u2019s right leg became slightly distorted. It was obvious that he suffered a heavy loss.</p><br/><p>The disdain in the Demon God\u2019s eyes became even more intense. However, he let go of the destructive heavy sword because the Demon God\u2019s hands could not take the Destruction Energy that the destructive heavy sword was giving off. It was good enough because the Destruction God was only left with one leg. By then, it was obvious that who the victor and loser were.</p><br/><p>The Demon God\u2019s movements were simple. His body suddenly became incorporeal the instant he let go of the destructive heavy sword. The destructive heavy sword swung across its incorporeal body that was a thousand meters tall and landed on nothing. Zhou Weiqing was using the Spatial Law that he was most proficient at, as he controlled the Demon God to utilize the Spatial Law.</p><br/><p>As the battle progressed, Fen Tian\u2019s experience began to show. He noticed something was wrong when his sword hit nothing, and he reacted instantly by letting go of his sword \u2014 at the very end, he decided to let go of his heavy sword. He pressed his fists against each other on his chest and coincidentally blocked the last slap when the Demon God appeared out of thin air. An intense collision exploded in the air and the two gods began fighting again. Meanwhile, the Destruction God\u2019s left leg was recovering at a stunning rate. It would not die as long as it had sufficient Destruction Energy. It was not its actual body after all.</p><br/><p>Fen Tian\u2019s heavy sword that was thousands of meters long fell from the sky directly onto Wan Shou Heaven. The intense bang was like an earthquake, and as a result, Wan Shou Heaven gained a gigantic canyon. The ground split opened as terrifying Destruction Energy spread across almost a hundred miles before it stopped. Naturally, that left a permanent mark on Wan Shou Heaven.</p><br/><p>It seemed like it was just the beginning of the battle between the Demon God and Destruction God. Both of them had extremely fast attack speed. Although they were huge, the others could only see a purple and gray shadow shining continuously in the air from the ground. Circles of distorted light spread out from the center of their collision as a powerful wave of energy exploded.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, the victor of a battle was finally decided among the five battlefields. It was the battle between Long Shiya and Shen Mo. Shen Mo had had constantly been on the offensive as his frenzied attacks weakened the gigantic body that Long Shiya continuously transformed into as it weakened the energy waves. What was more important was when Shen Mo found out that Long Shiya\u2019s Divine Thought was getting weaker to the point that he could barely control his body any longer.</p><br/><p>Putting aside the joy that Shen Mo felt in his heart, it was obvious that the Six Ultimate Heavenly God who had just achieved the Heavenly God Tier had injured himself from balancing the Destruction Energy by displaying his amazing ability to control the six attributes perfectly. He was controlling a massive amount of energy at that time! It must be petrifying to be drained of his Divine Thought. Could he not unleash it anymore, or was he just unable to hold on to it?</p><br/><p>Although the continuous onslaught of powerful attacks took a major toll on Shen Mo, he was feeling good. He thought that he would be left with at least half of his Heavenly Energy after killing Long Shiya. As long as he made some slight adjustment, he would be able to continue fighting on the ground.</p><br/><p>Shen Mo was not an idiot, he did not plan to fight the Elf Tribe\u2019s formation because there were too many powerhouses. Besides, he had also noticed that Dongfang Hanyue was the one who had caused a lot of casualties to the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley by killing ruthlessly on the ground. She alone had killed at least more than 20 Heavenly Emperor-tier powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley. Presently, her attack speed had dropped due to an excessive consumption of strength. As long as Shen Mo went down to constrain this person, it would not be long before he defeats his enemy in the battle on the ground. Regarding Huang Xingyun and his wife, their life had nothing to do with him. It was best if they died together with the Heavenly Expanse Palace.</p><br/><p>Although the Blood Red Hell and Love Valley had a working relationship with the same master, they were not that close to each other. To Shen Mo, Huang Xingyun only had one option when he was faced with life and death \u2014 to self-detonate. The explosion from a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse\u2019s seld-detonation. It was very likely that both sides would die together and would benefit the Blood Red Hell when they ruled the entire mainland in the future.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Long Shiya was starting to lose ground, Shen Mo showcased the battle techniques that he had in store. He was not worried about Fen Tian and Zhou Weiqing\u2019s battle. As an onlooker and a Heavenly God-tier powerhouse, he had a clearer view than Fen Tian. He remembered that Zhou Weiqing was only a Maximum Level Heavenly Emperor, and did not possess the cultivation base of a Heavenly God. Although he had no idea how Zhou Weiqing summoned the Demon God, how long could it last? As long as Fen Tian could hold on to his summon longer than him, it was impossible for Zhou Weiqing to win.</p><br/><p>Just when as Shen Mo planned this in his heart, a huge impact appeared in waves. The waves came from the Elf Tribe\u2019s Natural Divine Territory Formation. It was not that the Elf Tribe was targeting him, but the explosion of energy from the battle between the Demon God and Destruction God was too overbearing and was filled with destruction. It forced the Natural Divine Territory to divert the energy and naturally, it was diverted at their direction.</p><br/><p>This situation had happened before so Shen Mo did not panic. It was just that his attack was slightly delayed. He had thought about it \u2014 he would launch a fatal attack on Long Shiya as soon as the energy around them calmed down. However, what Shen Mo did not expect was that Long Shiya took the initiative to attack him first for the very first time in their second battle.</p><br/><p>Two unimpressive light rings floated out of Long Shiya\u2019s body. Due to the fact that Shen Mo had been attacking continuously, Long Shiya body had been weakened so the two, six-colored light rings were only around one meter in diameter. They were coming out of Long Shiya\u2019s head and the Six Ultimate Heavenly Path Formation under his feet.</p><br/><p>Was this his last struggle before his death? Disdain filled Shen Mo\u2019s eyes. He did not bother with Long Shiya\u2019s attack at all. The devouring mouth remained glorious and it directed its mouth that was wide open without thinking twice. However, just when that gigantic devouring mouth was about to close, the unimpressive six-colored rings of light that were emitting regular energy waves suddenly accelerated into the mouth.</p><br/><p>The two rings of light did not engage the devouring mouth. Instead, they moved towards each other. To be exact, they overlapped one another. The devouring mouth closed at that moment and devoured the both of them. Since the beginning of the battle, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya\u2019s chubby face had been serious all the time. However, at this moment, there was a faint smile on his face. Shen Mo saw the expression on Long Shiya\u2019s face and wondered what he was smiling about. That was the first thought that Shen Mo had before a gentle energy wave in his devouring mouth.</p><br/><p>Yes, the energy explosion was very gentle. However, it caused the Destruction Attribute in his body to collapse at an exceptional speed. Shen Mo\u2019s devouring mouth was formed from his real body with his Divine Territory. In a way, it was his actual body! He was shocked when his Destruction Energy collapsed. He could not spit the rings of light out even if he attempted to.</p><br/><p>A deep thud sounded as a dense, purplish-black mist of light broke out in the air. The devouring mouth vanished as Shen Mo\u2019s real body appeared in the air. However, he did not have the joy of a victory on his face any longer. As he looked at Long Shiya, he pointed his right hand at him while his left hand was pressed against his chest, \u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Six Ultimate Heavenly God, Long Shiya looked at Shen Mo and revealed a smile, \u201cYou\u2019ve lost to yourself. If not for your overconfidence, we would both have suffered a great loss in this battle. Sigh, I\u2019ve become terrible after spending too much time with Little Fatty. I\u2019ve even learned to deceive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under Shen Mo\u2019s palm was a small, six-colored palm-sized light ring that was embedded in his chest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

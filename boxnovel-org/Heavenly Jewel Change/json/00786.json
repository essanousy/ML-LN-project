How could she not feel enraged now that the Elf Tribe elders wanted to take action against them? With a flash, Shangguan Bing\u2019er made the first move to step forward. The legendary armor set swiftly covered her entire body. It might not have been the full set but the Saint Nucleus Core that Shangguan Fei\u2019er solidified was rather special, unlike the others. Her Saint Nucleus Core did not amplify the Elemental Jewel Attributes but amplified the Physical Jewel instead. Hence, her level of resilience could be considered as second only to Zhou Weiqing. In fact, she was second only to Zhou Weiqing at the Heavenly Emperor Tier. A powerful force erupted, ready for attack.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er spoke in a low voice, \u201cFei\u2019er, wait a moment. Elf Tribe elders, will you please listen to what I have to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Elf Tribe elder replied, \u201cHer Majesty is extremely vital to our Elf Tribe. My apologies, everyone. Perhaps you truly don\u2019t harbor any animosity. However, in order to ensure the survival of our tribe, please excuse our crimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er\u2019s expression sank. A shapeless aura erupted from her body, \u201cFirst Elder, do you understand the implications of your actions? If anything happens to us here, I can confirm that the Elf Tribe will cease to exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words were no simple threats. Whether it was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s newly constructed Peerless Sect, Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace or Heavenly Snow Mountain, they were all the best of the best in the human world. If all them attacked the Elf Tribe at the same time, the Elf Tribe would most likely face imminent destruction.</p><br/><p>The First Elder\u2019s expression grew complicated. After engaging with them for over a day, he already knew that these women were not to be trifled with. Others may not be able to comment but they had reached a formidable cultivation base at such a young age. Not many humans could achieve such a thing. One could imagine the great powers that supported them. Naturally, he did not know that the reason why the five women were able to achieve such a level in their cultivation base was because of Zhou Weiqing alone.</p><br/><p>However, the Elven Queen was more important. Furthermore, he did not have any intention of harming the women. After a brief hint of hesitation in his eyes, he immediately hardened his resolve again. Only if they captured these women would they have a better chance of threatening Zhou Weiqing. Finding the Elven Queen was currently the most important thing.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er took one look at the change on the First Elder of the Elf Tribe\u2019s face and knew something was wrong. \u201cProtect Tian\u2019er,\u201d she said darkly. Just as she spoke, she took the lead and stepped forward. She pushed Tian\u2019er behind her. Among the five wives, the pregnant Tian\u2019er was undoubtedly the one who needed the protection the most.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er had never mentioned this before. In reality, among the five wives, she had the strongest cultivation base. She only wanted to see what Shangguan Xue\u2019er would choose to do in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>Among the five wives, Tian\u2019er and Shangguan Xue\u2019er were the most powerful. Shangguan Xue\u2019er was the heir to the Heaven\u2019s Expanse Palace and the eldest among the three Shangguan sisters. The three of them were sisters! Therefore, Tian\u2019er had been working hard to establish a good relationship with them. Considering Tian\u2019er herself received Saint Energy at the same time as Zhou Weiqing, she was crucial in helping Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base. Naturally, the other three wives would not fight with her over the position of the first wife.</p><br/><p>At this moment, when Shangguan Xue\u2019er moved in a horizontal direction to defend Tian\u2019er, Tian\u2019er\u2019s heart finally officially recognized her as a sister. Regardless of the situation, at the most crucial moment, they were a family. That\u2019s right. Because of Zhou Weiqing, the five of them had become a family!</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er slowly closed her eyes. One by one, she silently placed the God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set on her body as the powerful Divine Energy fluctuated continuously from her being. The purity of Saint Energy seemed to surround all five of them at once.</p><br/><p>The color of her Saint Energy was not the same as Zhou Weiqing\u2019s. Instead, a sparkling and translucent shade of gold with flecks of starlight surrounded the five women. From a distance, a large shadow of an angel appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>The faces of all twelve Elf Tribe elders fell. They could all clearly sense what the large angel shadow brought. It was not as simple as the Purgatory Angel that Zhou Weiqing summoned. It was a divine angel. Additionally, this divine angel had six wings on its back.</p><br/><p>A Seraphic Blazeangel! It had an existence that was comparable to the Demon God! Perhaps it was slightly inferior to the Demon God. However, it certainly could not be compared to gods like the Goddess of Nature. Zhou Weiqing alone was able to summon the Demon God. The last time it took all of the Elven Queen\u2019s might to resist his attacks. This time, among the five women, one of them was able to summon a divine angel. What kind of powers did they possess?</p><br/><p>The divine Seraphic Blazeangel descended from the sky. It suppressed the twelve Heavenly Emperor-tier Elders with such might that they were unable to mobilize the Atmospheric Energy. Even the Natural Elements in the air were constantly fueling this divine angel.</p><br/><p>Tian\u2019er stood in the middle of the four wives. At this moment, she suddenly felt a bout of weakness. However, what shocked her the most was a jet of Saint Energy slowly entered her body around her lower abdomen and it caused the feeling of weakness to slowly fade away.</p><br/><p>Based on Tian\u2019er\u2019s current cultivation base, it was similar to the time when Zhou Weiqing previously summoned the Demon God. The deterrent force was greater than the fighting strength. The divine Seraphic Blazeangel was enough to deter and intimidate a Heavenly God-tier cultivator but she had no control over it. At most, she could try very hard to defend them.</p><br/><p>The twelve Elf Tribe elders began to feel awkward as they prepared to make their move. How could they simply act under these circumstances? They could not make sense of the situation at all! They had already seen the Demon God Sword once and this time, they did not have the Elven Queen to lead them.</p><br/><p>Just then, an Elf Tribe cultivator flew in at top speed. It was a Heavenly King Elf Tribe member. Shock was all over his face. However, he did not seem to notice the enormous divine Seraphic Blazeangel. Even before his physical body could be seen, they already heard his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cElders, you must come and have a look. The Ancient Tree of Life. Something seems to have happened to the Ancient Tree of Life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The twelve Elf Tribe elders naturally recognized him. This was a tribe member who was responsible for guarding the ancient elven tree. When they heard that, the color immediately drained from the twelve elders\u2019 faces. They could no longer bother about dealing with the five wives. The twelve elders immediately retreated, and they all left in the same direction.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Xue\u2019er and the rest heaved a sigh of relief as well. Tian\u2019er, who was in the middle, exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s have a look as well.\u201d Then, without withdrawing the Seraphic Blazeangel, all five were swept up in a flash of golden light and followed the Elf Tribe elders.</p><br/><p>The Ancient Tree of Life was, without a doubt, of extreme importance to the Elf Tribe. Even the Sealed Land\u2019s source of energy came from the Ancient Tree of Life.</p><br/><p>More importantly, the Ancient Tree of Life was crucial in producing Elf Tribe offsprings. Every member of the Elf Tribe was born from the Ancient Tree of Life. In the first few moments of their birth, they were bodies of energy. They would grow into elves over the passage of time. If anything happened to the Ancient Tree of Life, the Elf Tribe would face extinction. They would need to sacrifice the Elven Queen in order to restore the Ancient Tree of Life. Furthermore, the Elven Queen had been absent for more than a day now.</p><br/><p>The twelve Elf Tribe elders rushed to the Ancient Tree of Life immediately. However, when they laid their eyes upon the Ancient Tree of Life, they could not help but slip into a daze. Their anxiety was completely obliterated.</p><br/><p>The Ancient Tree of Life was a large ancient tree that was about a hundred meters in height and around two hundred meters in diameter. Its trunk was tough and solid, and its countless branches were widely stretched. Every piece of leaf was ornately carved in a light shade of jade-green, and it brimmed with endless life force.</p><br/><p>This was also the Elven Queen\u2019s residence. The breath of life emitted by every inch of the Ancient Tree of Life granted life and ensured the continued survival of the Sealed Land of the Elf Tribe.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, a completely confusing transformation was happening to the Ancient Tree of Life. Every branch of the large ancient tree began to move. It was not because it was wilting, but because it was producing propitious vapor.</p><br/><p>A faint gold propitious vapor wafted through the large tree branches as it enveloped every inch of the large ancient tree. Every time a branch moved, it made the breath of life from the tree grow even stronger.</p><br/><p>Besides, one could see the link between the Ancient Tree of Life and the earth very clearly. The soil surrounding it was torn open, and the Ancient Tree of Life was growing upwards continuously. Furthermore, every branch seemed to grow at the same time as they danced. The breath of life that had grown to a terrifyingly large degree gave every elf around the ancient elven tree a brand new feeling. Their cultivation base seemed to gradually grow without having to cultivate at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, this is?\u201d After the twelve Elf Tribe elders recovered from their momentary daze, their eyes displayed an expression of complete disbelief. Perhaps the average little Elf would not be able to understand what was going on. However, how could they, who had been around for more than a thousand years, not see what was going on?</p><br/><p>The transformation in the ancient elven tree that was happening before their very eyes could only mean one thing \u2014 evolution.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ancient Tree of Life is evolving?\u201d The First Elder of the Elf Tribe gulped. After his astonishment, joy took over. It was a mad kind of joy. He even leaped and hugged another Elf Tribe elder next to him. Overjoyed, he cried out, \u201cThe Ancient Tree of Life is evolving. It\u2019s really evolving. This is too great. Too great! It\u2019s evolving. Can you all see it? It\u2019s evolving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon receiving confirmation from the First Elder of the Elf Tribe, every member of the Elf Tribe cheered. Yes, they had witnessed the unbelievable. To the Elf Tribe, this also meant that there would be unbelievable benefits that came with the Ancient Tree of Life\u2019s evolution.</p><br/><p>The evolution of the Ancient Tree of Life meant that it would be much easier for the Elf Tribe to survive and pass on their traditions to the future generations. This also meant that the Elf Tribe would grow even stronger.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

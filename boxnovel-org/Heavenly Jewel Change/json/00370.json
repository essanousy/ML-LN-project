There were countless of fights here everyday, and though Zhou Weiqing\u2019s fight against Green Wolf was indeed exciting, it was not enough to draw everybody\u2019s attention for a long time. The cacophony of fighting sounds and cheers continued all around the building.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er was standing beside Zhou Weiqing, and she gave him a pinch around the waist, saying softly: \u201cWhy must you act like that? Why don\u2019t you just reveal your power? Haven\u2019t you been emphasizing your lack of time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing felt the sudden pain and had a bitter look on his face as he said: \u201cWe have just reached and are very unfamiliar with this place and its situation. It\u2019s better to take things a step at a time, to learn more before I can advance my plan. Sometimes, if you are standing at too high a position, you\u2019re unable to learn many things. For example, that Ruffian Battalion that Green Wolf is from\u2026 what kind of place or formation is that? Is that even something that should exist in the army?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said: \u201cHow would I know? Anyway, I\u2019m itching to fight. Since you didn\u2019t let me fight here, tonight you are mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, if any ordinary man heard Shangguan Fei\u2019er tell him those latter words, it would definitely set his heart aflame. Alas, when poor Zhou Weiqing heard those words, his first reaction was to take an involuntary step back, pleading sorrowfully: \u201cHeroine, please let me off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er said smugly: \u201cI\u2019ll leave it up to you, in any case, if I\u2019m not satisfied here, tonight I will be teaching you personally more about close combat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing gave a humph and said: \u201cIf you dare, let\u2019s not use Consolidated Equipment, only Elemental Jewels.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Fei\u2019er\u2019s greatest strength was her terrifying close combat skills along with her four unique Legendary Set Consolidated Equipment, while Zhou Weiqing\u2019s greatest strength was his many powerful skills and unending changes and variety he could use them in. If Shangguan Fei\u2019er did not use her Consolidated Equipment, he might actually stand a chance against her.</p><br/><p>Alas, it was not so easy to trick her, and she just lifted her head and ignored his words.</p><br/><p>The fights continued, and the atmosphere in the Duelling Center remained as lifely as before. After some time, Zhou Weiqing finally spotted someone walking up to the empty middle platform. It was one of the Company Leaders from earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll brothers of the Sixteenth Regiment, listen up! When this round of fights ends, the beginner competition fights will stop for a while.\u201d His voice had clearly been enhanced by his Heavenly Energy, and it travelled out far and wide to all corners, suppressing the loud noise in the building, allowing even the furthest audience to hear him.</p><br/><p>The original lively building quietened down instantly, and everyone turned to look at the Company Leader in the middle platform curiously.</p><br/><p>The Company Leader smiled faintly and said: \u201cVery soon, there will be an unbelievably exciting fight here in the Intermediate Challenge stage. Our challenger is a fresh recruit, a young brother who has just joined our Sixteenth Regiment. His name is Zhou Little Fatty. His opponent has been chosen via drawing of lots, and is our very own Tyrannical Bear. All of you should know Tyrannical Bear; like me, he is a Company Leader, and I\u2019ve heard rumours that this fellow once tore a Polar Bear apart with his bare hands, thus earning this nickname. Furthermore, Tyrannical Bear is a Six-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master with the Strength and Speed boosts. Amongst our Sixteenth Regiment twenty Intermediate ringmasters, he is considered one of the top five. Let us await this exciting spectacle and enjoy ourselves!\u201d</p><br/><p>His words had barely ended when a massive uproar of cheers shook the entire building. An intermediate challenge was definitely far more exciting than any beginner\u2019s competition, especially since Tyrannical Bear was extremely popular in the Sixteenth Regiment; in the war against the WanShou Empire, he had killed more than fifty enemy powerhouses, and he was one of the few who had slowly raised through the ranks through his own military exploits. If not for the fact that his leadership skills were not up to speed, with his military exploits and rank in the Duelling Corner, he could perhaps be at the Battalion Commander level.</p><br/><p>After the proclamation of the upcoming match, the other Company Leader who had left at the same time returned back to Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bro, your luck isn\u2019t very good! There were seven Intermediate ringmasters here today, but you actually got Tyrannical Bear. That fellow isn\u2019t any kind soul, and he\u2019s renowned for his Physical Strength as well. According to him, he has some bear bloodlines within him. Later on, you better be careful. If you feel like you cannot take it anymore, just surrender, do not force yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Company Leader Big Bro for your advice.\u201d Zhou Weiqing gave him a heartfelt thanks before saying: \u201cSo, does this mean the fight is starting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Company Leader looked hard at Zhou Weiqing, but could only see that innocent, honest face. Finally, he nodded and said: \u201cWhen all the current beginner competition fights end, then your Intermediate fight with Tyrannical Bear will begin. For the Intermediate Fights, every victory has a reward of a gold coin. If you are able to defeat Tyrannical Bear, and challenge successfully another few more times consecutively, you can even become a Company Leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps because of the upcoming Intermediate fight, the remaining beginner\u2019s competition fights all ended quickly. Led by the Company Leader beside him, Zhou Weiqing quickly ascended the central stage.</p><br/><p>As compared to the Heavenly Jewel Tournament\u2019s stage, this place was much smaller and simpler, rougher. However, as soon as he entered the stage, that feeling of being watched by thousands of audiences, of being the center of attention returned. Hearing the cheers from all directions, the excitement was sparked within Zhou Weiqing. Stretching his body, he felt as if he was imbued with an endless supply of energy.</p><br/><p>The Company Leader which had ascended the central stage earlier to give out the proclamation was now taking on the role of the judge, and he shouted out loud: \u201cAlright everyone, the Intermediate Competition Fight is now beginning. Let me first do a quick introduction. This young man here is the one I spoke about earlier, our new recruit Zhou Little Fatty. Do not underestimate him just because he is a fresh recruit; earlier he has just fought three in three beginner competition fights, and defeated all his opponents in an instant. One of those three opponents was even Green Wolf from the Ruffian Battalion. It was because of those victories that he was given the opportunity to fight in the intermediate ring. Zhou Little Fatty\u2019s strength is also his speciality, so it is time for us to see whose strength is ultimately greater, him or Tyrannical Bear! Alright, next is our honoured Intermediate Ringmaster, Tyrannical Bear!\u201d</p><br/><p>*Swoosh* Before his words had ended, a huge figure jumped onto the stage, landing with a loud clash.</p><br/><p>Tyrannical Bear\u2019s figure was actually not as huge and overstated as Green Wolf earlier, standing around 1.8metres tall, even slightly shorter than Zhou Weiqing. However, his shoulders were extremely broad and muscled. The thing that attracted the most attention were actually his arms; his army uniform was sleeveless, revealing his two powerful arms that were as thick as most thighs, covered with black hair. His yellow eyes stared fixedly at Zhou Weiqing, filled with a bloodthirsty aura as he licked his lips. \u201cZhou Little Fatty right? Be careful, or Your Father, I, will break your nuts. Heh heh heh.\u201d Tyrannical Bear said to Zhou Weiqing as he brandished his powerful arms.</p><br/><p>Seeing Tyrannical Bear, Zhou Weiqing immediately remembered back to the time when he had just joined the Heavenly Bow Empire army, and they had ran across a Kalise Empire ambush on Shangguan Bing\u2019er. At that time, the Kalise Empire\u2019s Jewel Masters had been the attackers, and amongst them was a five-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master who had been using two warhammers, and his figure was extremely similar to this Tyrannical Bear. Of course, it was without doubt that this Tyrannical Bear was much more powerful, at the six-Jeweled level. However, at this point, Zhou Weiqing was no longer that weak, one-Jeweled Zhou Little Fatty.</p><br/><p>Facing his opponent\u2019s mocking provocation, Zhou Weiqing only smiled faintly and said: \u201cBig Bro, those big arms of yours look really good, if we pull out all the fur and skin it, and barbeque it with salt and spices, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll taste very good. I wonder how it compares to Bear Paws 1?\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing at the side, the Company Leader who was the judge was totally stunned by those words. In his eyes, Zhou Little Fatty was an innocent, honest young man, but his current words were nothing like that at all; not only arrogant but extremely provoking.</p><br/><p>When Tyrannical Bear had heard that Zhou Weiqing had defeated Green Wolf so easily, he had been extremely wary. Despite his looks, he was not a careless or brash person. He had to admit to himself that he would not be able to defeat Green Wolf without using any Heavenly Energy, and before he ascended the stage, he had still been hoping that the little fellow on top was not a Jewel Master. The provoking words he had spoken were actually to sound out Zhou Weiqing, but who knows that he had not successfully angered Zhou Weiqing, and was instead the one angered.</p><br/><p>With an enraged howl, Tyrannical Bear charged forward towards Zhou Weiqing. However, despite his anger, he did not lose his reason, releasing his Physical Jewels at first chance.</p><br/><p>From a single glance, Zhou Weiqing was able to tell that this Tyrannical Bear\u2019s Physical Jewel was considered quite a good boost in the ordinary Jewel Master world, with seventy percent boost in strength and thirty percent on speed. His six Physical Jewels glowed brilliantly, and in a flash, he was right in front of Zhou Weiqing, his large arms hammering down onto Zhou Weiqing\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s own physical strength was extremely terrifying, one of the many strongest benefits that the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline had granted him. Furthermore, he had gone through two evolving, causing his already considerable strength to grow even further. Along with that Demonic Right Leg of his, he could take on ordinary Jewel Masters without problem even without unleashing his Heavenly Jewels. Even so, he did not dare to face a six-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master of Tyrannical Bear\u2019s calibre with just his own physique alone.</p><br/><p>A Jewel Master\u2019s power grew exponentially every Jewel he had, and just facing the Four-Jeweled Green Wolf earlier with his physique alone, Zhou Weiqing had already felt it was extremely difficult. If he underestimated Tyrannical Bear and attempted to use only his physique, he would undoubtedly have no chance.</p><br/><p>In a midst of swirling mist, four pure Icy Jade Physical Jewels appeared around Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right wrist, and around his left wrist, four red Emperor Tourmaline Jewels showed, showing the Strength and Wind Attributes of a Heavenly Jewel Master respectively. Without question, that was the effect of Zhou Weiqing\u2019s Ring of Concealment.</p><br/><p>After some consideration, Zhou Weiqing had decided to reveal his Elemental Jewel as the Wind Attribute. Amongst all his six Attributes, the Wind Attribute was probably the most \u2018normal\u2019 of them all. Furthermore, his four Wind Attribute Skills were very good, and more importantly, the most all-encompassing. It could be said that no matter Support, Control, Offense, his Wind Attribute Skills had them all, and with those, he could handle most situations.</p><br/><p>With his Heavenly Jewels unleashed, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s strength multiplied. However, when Tyrannical Bear saw the four pure Icy Jade Physical Jewels around his wrist, his heart sank.</p><br/><p>Zen\u2019s note: I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when I read that last bit. So much for hiding his power!</p>\n</div>"}

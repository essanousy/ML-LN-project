Yes, it was true that it was afraid of dying but that did not mean that it was actually stupid. It was plain to see that the reason Dongfang Hanyue rushed all the way here was to save Zhou Weiqing. It was also thoroughly caught off guard by Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s attack and right now, all it needed the most was to catch its breath. As the saying went, attacking the enemy\u2019s key point would invite reinforcement. Its full-scale attack this time would mainly focus on Zhou Weiqing. With that, not only can it lure Dongfang Hanyue to go to his rescue, it would also be able to annihilate one potential enemy if its plan was successful.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhou Weiqing\u2019s cultivation base was not taken seriously by the Dreadfiend Sea Naga, it still found the energy ripples and the Dragon Emperor Bloodline in him to be quite dreadful.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, seeing the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s attack suddenly directed towards Zhou Weiqing now, Dongfang Hanyue put aside her crazy attack and with a flap of her wings on her back, she immediately put herself in front of Zhou Weiqing. The Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear was waved speedily in front of her, creating a completely sealed defense. Like a red-colored shield, it blocked the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s shooting attack in one swoop.</p><br/><p>The power of the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear\u2019s attack was indeed notorious. At the same time, it also consumed a great deal of Heavenly Energy. Right now, as it was being used as a defensive force by Dongfang Hanyue, it was actually draining her own Heavenly Energy greatly.</p><br/><p>It was apparent that Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s face that was hidden underneath the mask, had started to become tense. If the situation continued, she and Zhou Weiqing would most likely meet their fates here. They could no longer continue the fight; it would be better to flee first for now. The Dreadfiend Sea Naga before them was not yet a threat, so she could once again team up with the Blackfiend Dragon when it was completely recovered and kill the sea naga together.</p><br/><p>As she was thinking about this, Dongfang Hanyue swang the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear on her right hand while her left hand went toward Zhou Weiqing behind her, planning to bring him along to flee the scene.</p><br/><p>With her cultivation base and the utilization of her full speed, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga would still be unable to stop the two from fleeing even if it chased them all the way. After all, this place was not too far away from the Mysterious Heavenly Mainland.</p><br/><p>However, when she grabbed onto him behind her, a weird thing suddenly happened.</p><br/><p>An icy aura suddenly could be felt from behind. That aura was so chilly that it could not help but make Dongfang Hanyue shiver. The hand that was holding on to the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear almost slipped from continuing the defense in front of her.</p><br/><p>In fact, she was wearing the full Blackfiend Dragon Set. One could easily imagine how bloodcurdling the energy had to be in order for her to be able to be affected by such a chill.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the evil coldness suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>As she could not turn her head back, Dongfang Hanyue did not see the changes to Zhou Weiqing.</p><br/><p>Before this, his body finally ceased to shine with a looming grey light when she was reaching out to grab onto him. A grey luster of a shadow that was as tall as him suddenly appeared behind him and stepped forward to merge with his body.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Ringless Ground Purging Set on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body suddenly changed its color, from the original dark golden color to a translucent, sparkling, greyish crystal-like shape. The aura that was released by his whole body had undergone a completely earth-shattering change.</p><br/><p>Loneliness, desolation, cold and also that endless evil.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing finally opened his eyes. His eyes were completely filled with a devilish grey, an infinite grey. His entire being was immersed in that strange grey color.</p><br/><p>Taking a step forward, he emerged from the back of Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s. His body had also just undergone a humongous change. The Dual God Strength Hammers actually turned into a grey liquid and integrated into his arms. The Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palm also underwent changes at the same time. His right palm turned into a tiger\u2019s paw while the left evolved into a dragon\u2019s claw. His entire body had also instantly inflated. It turned out that he had directly entered the second stage of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation.</p><br/><p>His right foot was still a hook but this time, it was an entirely grey hook instead. A layer of grey aura erupted from his body. Like a grey-colored shooting star, Zhou Weiqing charged directly towards the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.</p><br/><p>This time, there was no earth-shattering intimidating aura of the Demon God\u2019s Illusion. However, in the wake of his passing through, the water that had previously taken his breath had now automatically melted like ice, leaving a vacuum-like passage in the air.</p><br/><p>When Dongfang Hanyue saw him again, he was already halfway through his charge toward the sea naga. His entire body contorted in a peculiar manner in midair. With a strange, almost unthinkable movement, he rolled one round over and lifted his right leg before crashing down on the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing, who had now entered the second stage of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation had all his attributes elevated in a hair-raising manner. Under such a situation, he could not use most of his techniques but his body\u2019s physical strength had increased to an extremely alarming level.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga originally had its attention concentrated on Dongfang Hanyue but the sudden eruption from Zhou Weiqing was like the sudden emergence of a dark horse.</p><br/><p>The Dreadfiend Sea Naga was indeed a Heavenly God-tier master. Though he was faced with such an unforeseen attack, it could still unleash its brutal and unreasonable combat power at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><br/><p>The water element in the air solidified in a split second, forming numerous layers of ice that blocked Zhou Weiqing. At the same time, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s enormous body suddenly made an abrupt half-turn in the sea before it used its stout tail to whip at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Dongfang Hanyue turned pale with distress. Of course, she knew how frightful the physical attack of a Heavenly God-tier master could be. Releasing her Heavenly Energy, the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear transformed into a red flash of lightning as she used almost all of her energy to hurl the spear towards the Dreadfiend Sea Naga.</p><br/><p>The bloody red Dragon Slaying Spear swelled up in the air, and the length suddenly increased to ten feet long, bringing with it an immense amount of might as it soared down from the sky like a blood-red lightning bolt.</p><br/><p>However, Dongfang Hanyue\u2019s attack was still a little too slow. The bolt of red lightning still failed to catch up to Zhou Weiqing\u2019s speed and the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>At this time, the Dreadfiend Sea Naga was already set in its heart that it must first kill Zhou Weiqing. It would rather be injured and flee later since this was the sea anyway. As long as the Ward of Darkness was not here, Dongfang Hanyue could not possibly stop it if it wanted to flee.</p><br/><p>Had it been the previous Zhou Weiqing, the cold current that cooled down abruptly would be able to freeze him mid-air but right now, he seemed to clearly be in a very peculiar state.</p><br/><p>The moment the cold current touched the greyish aura on his body, it automatically dissipated, leaving no effect on him at all. Immediately afterward, he collided hard with the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s stout tail.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right leg hit against the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s tail. These two were fundamentally disproportionate but the moment the both of them collided without warning, a loud rumble could be heard in the air.</p><br/><p>Like a bullet, Zhou Weiqing was sent flying in the air. However, Dongfang Hanyue who was still in the air could not help but widen her eyes.</p><br/><p>After sending him flying in the air, the Dreadfiend Sea naga\u2019s body remained in its previous state as it stood there motionless. Even if his body was pierced by the Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear, leaving a huge wound on its body, it continued to remain in that state.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, another vicious rumble erupted. This time, the sound actually resonated directly from the Dreadfiend Sea Naga\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Without warning, the stout, tyrannical tail unexpectedly detonated when greyish light burst out, causing flesh and blood to fly in all directions. The entire tail was actually blown up by more than a third.</p><br/><p>Bloodcurdling cries could be heard instantly, coming from the Dreadfiend Sea Naga. Its tremendous body dove straight into the sea without stopping. It fled in a flurry under the cover of the dreadfully foaming waves.</p><br/><p>Even a Heavenly God-tier master like the sea naga would be seriously injured after being assaulted by both Zhou Weiqing\u2019s attack and a direct hit from the mighty Dongfang Hanyue at the same time. It was without a doubt, afraid of dying and did not dare to stay any longer.</p><br/><p>Within a moment, Dongfang Hanyue already had Zhou Weiqing in her arms. At this moment, the grey color on Zhou Weiqing\u2019s body had completely subsided and his legendary armor suit had now disappeared. His entire face was as pale as a paper, and he was breathing very shallowly. Fine blood kept seeping and bleeding through his pores. Fortunately, his heartbeat was still strong, or Dongfang Hanyue would have really thought that he was dead.</p><br/><p>Hugging his body, she carefully tried to infuse her Heavenly Energy into him. However, she was completely taken aback by the condition of his body.</p><br/><p>The 36 major Death Acupuncture Points were slowly functioning. The moment her Heavenly Energy was infused into his body, it was immediately assimilated by his Saint Energy. Looking back at his body, she could see that all of his meridians were actually unharmed; only his vital energy and blood circulation was slightly weaker. The silverish white colored energy was constantly swimming in his body; protecting it automatically on its own.</p><br/><p>How did he do that? Dongfang Hanyue stared absent-mindedly at the man that she held in her arms. The heavy blow just now was most likely as powerful as her own Blackfiend Devastation Dragon Slaying Spear. What on earth was that grey light? Even though he was unconscious now, but that blow could even injure a Heavenly God-tier Heavenly Beast! What level is this guy\u2019s strength actually at?</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing had no idea how long he had slept for. When he finally woke up albeit groggily, he found himself lying on a wooden bed.</p><br/><p>This seemed to be a very ordinary wooden cabin that also came with a bit of a strange smell.</p><br/><p>The instance he came to his senses, the first thing he did was to quickly check his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did I experience a breakthrough?\u2019 This was Zhou Weiqing\u2019s first thought. Yes, the Saint Energy in his body had now broken through to the 38th-tier Saint Energy, which also meant that he had now officially entered the second stage of the Heavenly Dao Energy.</p><br/><p>In fact, after entering the Heavenly Dao Energy, every tier was a huge and heavy threshold. Especially when one had reached the 40th-tier, the rest of the tiers in the future would be equal to one level.</p><br/><p>It was another breakthrough in just a short few months time. Even though it was at the cost of facing many strong enemies several times, but at the very least, he was still alive. Being alive was already a victory in itself.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m still so incisive after all!\u2019 Zhou Weiqing could not control the proud smile that crept onto his face as he thought to himself. He lied on the bed motionlessly. Though the Saint Energy in his body had already recovered, his head was throbbing with pain right now. Pondering just a small matter was akin to having needles prickling onto his head.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

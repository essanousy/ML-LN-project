What?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Desolate Ground was the battlefield of the Ancient Gods and Devils.\u201d Zi Dan explained. \u201cEver since the Ancient Era, this place had been sealed. This place is devoid of spiritual energy and it\u2019s barren, a dead land. According to legends, no man or beast is able to survive here. In the Ancient times, Yucang City was initially connected to this place, however, after this world was sealed, no one had ever discovered the entrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, we can\u2019t get out?\u201d Zhu Yao was dumbfounded. Then, she might as well die right there and then.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zi Dan nodded confidently.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly had a little yearning for version 4.0.</p><br/><p>Ever since the Desolate Ground was brought up, Feng Yi no longer spoke, rather, she began to meditate at the side, recovering her former mountain-top flower look.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed lightly. That Chen Zi had long became crazy, as he had been wishing for Feng Yi all this while. Just when he finally managed to obtain her after putting his everything into it, in the end, not even a few days later, she ran away again. It was no wonder that, even when he had to die, he still wanted to give her another blow, and thus sent Feng Yi to this place which had no exits. He must have been holding onto the thought of dying together with her, however, he never would have expected that two cannon fodders would be added into the mix.</p><br/><p>Cannon Fodder No. 1 nudged Cannon Fodder No. 2. \u201cSenior brother, since that Chen Zi can send us in here, then there must definitely be a way to get out, right?\u201d She remembered she was sucked in here by a black hole, and the shape of the black hole, looked a little like a formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, there\u2019s one.\u201d Zi Dan sighed. \u201cSovereign Feng Yi is a Demigod practitioner, if she were to use all her strength, she can tear through space, and return to the cultivation world. However, currently, senior-martial aunt Feng is heavily injured and has not fully recovered, there\u2019s no spiritual energy in this world either, so it\u2019s impossible to heal senior-martial aunt\u2019s injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, as long as we\u2019re able to heal her injuries, we can return?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, could it be that you have a plan?\u201d Zi Dan was excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like you have forgotten, I\u2019m a Wood Spirit Vein holder as well. If there\u2019s no spiritual energy, I can transfer her my spiritual energy.\u201d Was this not one of the reasons she was sent for this mission?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou definitely can\u2019t!\u201d Zi Dan said. \u201cWith your Nascent Soul cultivation, it\u2019s basically impossible for you to fully heal senior-martial aunt\u2019s injuries. Also, this world is devoid of spiritual energy, you will be in danger as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>That serious? Zhu Yao gave a face. She seemed to have emptied her spiritual energy for quite a number of times, however, nothing had ever happened to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, if we had known, we could have healed senior-martial aunt\u2019s injuries at the passage before coming out.\u201d Zi Dan sighed. Unfortunately, who would have known? \u201cThat Chen Zi is really vicious though, even in his death, he wanted to pull senior-martial aunt to follow him in his grave as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao glanced at Feng Yi who was currently acting as though she was meditating. Suddenly, a bright idea flashed in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother, can we use the Water Spirit to heal her injuries?\u201d Zhu Yao suggested.</p><br/><p>Zi Dan slapped his head. \u201cOh right, how can I forget about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Water spiritual energy was the most serene, it\u2019s the most suitable for healing. With the Water Spirit\u2019s support, this little brother of his might be able to heal senior-martial aunt without using all of his spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not tardy, we will begin now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, be careful. Just try your best, do not force yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded, walked over to Feng Yi\u2019s side, and sat cross-legged. \u201cSovereign, I wonder if I can borrow the Water Spirit to use it for a moment. I shall first help heal your injuries, after that\u2019s done, I will return it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi opened her eyes. She had naturally heard the conversation earlier as well, so, she did not hesitate, and passed the Water Spirit over. Then, she closed her eyes again.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao unreservedly took the Water Spirit from her hands and kept it into her divine sense.</p><br/><p>The moment the Water Spirit entered, the Wood Spirit excitedly began to circle around it, making \u2018chick chick chick\u2019 sounds as it turned about. However, the Water Spirit did not have any reaction, it was quiet like a blue gem.</p><br/><p>She finally managed to pacify the Wood Spirit, after telling it to change her body\u2019s spiritual energy to wood spiritual energy, she then turned it into the water-attribute healing spiritual energy via the Water Spirit. Stretching out her hand, she wanted to pass it into Feng Yi\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>However, it was blocked by the mystic robe she was wearing\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. She subconsciously leaned forward, and with a \u201chuaa\u201d sound, she pulled apart the clothes in front of her chest.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi instantly opened her eyes, and completely without any hesitation, a big slap was thrown to her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d Zhu Yao could not but curse out, and she gave her a slap in retaliation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Feng Yi looked at her with a face of disbelief, it was unknown if it was due to the shock from him pulling apart his clothes, or the fact that he had just slapped the number one beauty in this cultivation world in the face. \u201cYou actually dare\u2026 Do you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing so many goddamn clothes, how am I going to heal you? Even though you want to be healed, you\u2019re not even willing.\u201d This lady was not willing to serve her any longer. The fact that she was initially forced to save Feng Yi had caused her to feel displeased enough, and ever since meeting her, she had been giving the \u2018It\u2019s your blessings to have you guys save me, why aren\u2019t you kneeling before me yet?\u2019 attitude. No matter who she met, she would offend them. She\u2019s basically asking for a slap in the face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial aunt, don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d The moment Zi Dan saw that the situation had turned for the worse, he immediately came out to pacify the crowd. \u201cYour mystic robe is able to block off healing mystical arts, there\u2019s nothing little brother can do about it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Feng Yi\u2019s expression softened. Still holding onto a little anger and a sense of injustice, she glanced at the man in front of her. As though she was suppressing the anger in the depths of her heart with all her might, , only then did she remove a corner of her outer garment, revealing a piece of palm-sized inner garment, as she turned her head away resentfully.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently rolled her eyes. It\u2019s not like she was Chen Zi, did she think that she bothered looking at her? Whatever you have, I once had them as well, twice!</p><br/><p>Mn\u2026 Other than the breasts!</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, she then once again gathered a little water and wood spiritual energy, once again casting out the healing mystic arts. Reaching out her palm, she planted it below Feng Yi\u2019s shoulder, and she diligently mended the meridians that were damaged in her body.</p><br/><p>Zi Dan had long already turned his body around to avoid arousing suspicion, casting out protection arts at the side.</p><br/><p>Only after Zhu Yao had transferred spiritual energy to Feng Yi\u2019s body did she find out how deep Chen Zi\u2019s obsession for Feng Yi was. His actions were absolutely ruthless, the several important meridians around her body had been completely damaged, her spiritual energy were in a chaotic mess, and it was fortunate that she was able to walk along with them throughout the underground city while enduring this level of injuries.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder she was a practitioner that was capable of cultivating to the Demigod-stage, she sure had a very good endurance.</p><br/><p>The reason why she forcefully summoned her sword intent to kill Chen Zi while her body was in that state, was probably her pride as a Demigod-stage practitioner as well. Most probably, this captivity was considered to be a huge humiliation to her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently retracted the scornful eyes she had earlier. For that point, Zhu Yao respected her as a man!</p><br/><p>She began to diligently mend her meridians.</p><br/><p>After spending a total of six hours, only then did Zhu Yao mend a large portion of her meridians. Only the last long meridian had yet to be connected. This meridian was extremely important, the moment one began to mend it, it must not be interrupted, otherwise, the efforts would be wasted.</p><br/><p>However, when Zhu Yao had only mended half of it, loud bangs gradually came from afar. In the beginning, they were only faintly hearing mixed noises, at the end, they became louder like booming thunder, as though a huge army was pressing forward and tens of thousands of horses were galloping.</p><br/><p>Zi Dan suddenly stood up. \u201cThis is\u2026 a beast tide! A demonic beast beast tide!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, what happened to the promised Desolate Ground, and the fact about humans and beasts not being able to live here?</p><br/><p>You\u2019re screwing with me!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, don\u2019t be anxious. It\u2019s just a mere crowd of beasts, leave it to me.\u201d Zi Dan patted his chest, giving a \u2018you can always rely on me for everything\u2019 expression. \u201cConcentrate on healing Sovereign, I will definitely not allow those demonic beasts approach a single step.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he summoned his sword, and hurriedly moved a few dozens of meters.</p><br/><p>Before Zhu Yao could even feel touched, a few seconds later, Zi Dan came running back, shouting as he ran. \u201cLittle brother, hurry and flee!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, what happened to the promised \u2018I can always rely on you for everything\u2019?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was dumbfounded!</p><br/><p>\u201cTenth-ranked, tenth-ranked demonic beasts\u2026\u201d Zi Dan ran as he turned his head back, shouting. \u201cA large crowd of tenth-ranked beasts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tenth-ranked! And it was even a crowd of them.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao made a prompt decision. Grabbing onto Feng Yi beside her, as she constantly transferred spiritual energy, she summoned her flying sword, and fled while riding on her sword.</p><br/><p>Zi Dan who was still madly sprinting, slapped his own head. \u201cI forgot I can fly as well!\u201d And began to ride on his sword as well.</p><br/><p>However, the crowd of demonic beasts behind, seemed to have locked onto them, roaring as they chased after the three of them. The strength of their momentum, had even brought about a storm of sand and dirt in the sky, as though the entire world was shaking.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao basically did not dare to turn back. Initially, it was already very difficult to ride a flying sword in this world devoid of spiritual energy, however, she just had to bring along another person, and even worse, she was still constantly transferring spiritual energy, slowly, her power was being drained.</p><br/><p>The crowd of demonic beasts however, did not give up in their chase. After flying for an entire hour, they still did not shake the demonic beasts away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a glen in front.\u201d Zi Dan pointed to the barren cliff in front. \u201cLet\u2019s hide in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Zhu Yao followed after him, however, right before entering, she quietly released Sesame. A mere glen was most probably unable to block a crowd of tenth-ranked demonic beasts. She simply hoped that Sesame, with the identity as an eleventh-ranked, could scare them.</p><br/><p>Zi Dan leaded the way to the very depths of the glen, and hurriedly set a formation that could hide their presences.</p><br/><p>The moment Zhu Yao landed, Feng Yi who she had been holding onto, suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>This was bad. Zhu Yao hurriedly sat down again, wildly circulating the spiritual energy in her body to wrap about the broken meridian. Zhu Yao was already dog-tired in the first place, currently, undoubtedly, she was losing more of her spiritual energy, her head had long been drenched with sweat.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi opened her eyes, unknowingly glanced at him, before closing her eyes again.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she had made it in time, and the spiritual energy did not go rampant, lose control and attack the rest of the mended meridians. Zhu Yao quietly heaved a sigh of relief. Calming her heart down, she began to complete her final job.</p><br/><p>After an hour, the glen suddenly quietened down, to the point where those terrifying beast roars could no longer be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like the crowd of beasts have already left.\u201d Zi Dan heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao finally completed the healing too. The spiritual energy in her body had been consumed by a large amount as well, and the moment she tilted her body, she laid motionless on the ground and was no longer able to get up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother!\u201d Zi Dan hurriedly held him up.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi opened her eyes, glanced at Zhu Yao, and then, cast a mystic art for relief. Biting her lower lips, after a while, she then said. \u201cMany thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zhu Yao was already tired to the extent that she no longer had the energy to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial aunt, please, hurry and cast the mystic arts used to return to the cultivation world.\u201d Zi Dan anxiously said. \u201cThis place is devoid of spiritual energy, I\u2019m afraid little brother isn\u2019t able to hold up for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi clenched her fists tightly, turning, she did a set of hand seals. The spiritual energy in her body began to circulate, and a gust of wind began to blow. With a swing of her hand, she forcefully sliced towards the air, only to see a black hole floating five inches away from them.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi who had used up all of her spiritual energy was a little unable to withstand it either, as she took two steps back. After that, she walked over to the black hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Once again she turned her head to glance at Zhu Yao, before entering the black hole.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zi Dan held onto her as they walked over. At the very moment before they entered the black hole, Zhu Yao paused for a moment. Only after seeing a white light flying into the spiritual beast pouch that was by her side, did she then follow after Zi Dan and enter the black hole.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

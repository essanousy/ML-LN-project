If it isn\u2019t the demonic beast, what else can it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we have squatted here for three whole hours, yet we haven\u2019t seen that demonic beast. Why don\u2019t we enter and look for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Zhonggu Lu immediately shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d It\u2019s definitely better than growing grass here, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rumoured that the poisonous creature is extremely powerful. What if we\u2019re discovered? Putting aside you being injured, if someone who is as beautiful and flowery like me is injured, are you going to take responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao felt like her spirit was tainted. You\u2019re already like a flower, why the hell do you want to be beautiful too!?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, you must understand that for a beautiful man that possesses such style and peerless beauty, there\u2019s a need for more caution. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Please swallow back the words \u2018style\u2019 and \u2018peerless beauty\u2019, hey! Just where the hell does his confidence come from?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s movements!\u201d His expression changed as he pointed to the mist up ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately stuffed back her three views and took a closer look. As he had said, a pitch-black figure appeared out of the mist made of layers of poisonous gas. Coarse breathing sounds could be faintly heard, and the poisonous mist seemed to have grown thicker as well.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the figure grew bigger and a thick rotten stench suffused into the air. The figure began to grow clearer as well, until it revealed its rough silhouette.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cThis\u2026 is the cow-like demonic beast that Squad Captain Nangong drew?\u201d Just how did he draw a two-legged creature into a four-legged living being?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be.\u201d Zhonggu Lu nodded as well, and then said with a stern look. \u201cThough the illustration was a little out there, it\u2019s still looks rather similar to a pig.\u201d</p><br/><p>How is it similar!? Zhu Yao pointed at the demonic beast that was breathing poisonous gas. \u201cHow is that two-legged creature similar to a pig?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s figure is really similar. Dongfang girly, your eyesight is really poor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Your eyesight is poor, your entire family\u2019s eyesights are poor.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has hands and legs, so it\u2019s clearly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA dog!\u201d A cold confirmation sounded from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, why are you here?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. Wasn\u2019t he teamed up with Squad Captain Nangong? They were headed to the other side to inspect the terrain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was worried about you.\u201d Yu Yan walked past his disciple, his face did not carry the slightest bit of guilt for acting on his own. What if my disciple courts death when I\u2019m not looking again? He glanced at the black figure in front. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with both of your eyes?\u201d Zhonggu Lu rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a pig.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, a dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a pig.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that supposed to be a sheep?\u201d Another voice weighed in as well.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying\u2026 The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Why was he here as well? What happened to splitting up in teams?</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu: \u201cYou guys must believe me. That\u2019s a pig.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u201cA dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying: \u201cSheep\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Was she the only worried that student Nangong was on his own right now?</p><br/><p>Roar~~~</p><br/><p>A loud roar interrupted the four\u2019s debate. A large mass of poison gas came spraying in the direction where the four of them were hiding.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap, we were discovered.\u201d Zhonggu Lu\u2019s face changed. In a flash, he retreated to the back. \u201cRetreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan grabbed onto his disciple, and then along with Yue Ying, they retreated several dozens of meters away. They then looked at the place were they were hiding just earlier. The bushes had already begun to wilt as they get dyed with layers of black, and they did not have any signs of life before long.</p><br/><p>And that poisonous gas was beginning to spread towards them as well at incredible speed. That ferocious roar grew even louder and clearer.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Zhonggu loudly shouted. \u201cTo the Purifying Pond.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment his voice fell, a black substance shot out of the mist and flew towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d Zhu Yao called out to notify him. Zhonggu Lu materialized a defensive barrier at the nick of time, yet it was still useless. The black substance broke directly into the barrier. Fortunately, he was nimble enough to dodge it by shifting his body to the side, and the black substance grazed his body as it fell onto the ground with a long bang. In an instant, a large crater was formed, and it was even expanding still, corroding everything in its surroundings. The rotten smell grew thicker, and Zhu Yao was dumbfounded from this sight. This is basically a biological weapon, right?</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu\u2019s body was grazed by it as well, and his mystic robe began to melt. Hurriedly stripping it off, he was saved from being corroded himself.</p><br/><p>With such a powerful corrosion that could instantly corrode such a large crater, it was no wonder Squad Captain Nangong said that one would die from being touched by it. If the corpse and bones were melted as well, then wouldn\u2019t that be certain death?</p><br/><p>The surroundings of the crater began to emit out poisonous gas as well, and they had no choice but to make a detour out. The roar of the demonic beast sounded from behind once more, and the black poisonous substances from earlier suddenly came smashing at them like raindrops.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and dodge!\u201d Zhonggu Lu loudly reminded them. It was already too late for the four of them to run, so they had no choice but to dodge those raindrop-like poison as they flew. The surface of the ground looked as though they had been smashed by a rain of falling boulders, craters appearing one after another. The moment a crater was filled with poisonous gas, they would form a large mass of poison mist in the next moment.</p><br/><p>They had no choice but to stop. \u201cWhat do we do? We can\u2019t escape now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The demonic beast from behind caught up to them as well. A large figure stepped out of the poisonous mist. Possessing a muscular figure, there were a pair of ram horns on its head, and four limbs that were shaped like a dog\u2019s. With its entire body made of purple, its two paws were raised in the air and two were on the ground. On the sides of its lips, two long teeth could be seen. It would occasionally ooze out a black liquid with incredible stench, and the mere sight of it was incredibly disgusting.</p><br/><p>This demonic beast was neither a cow, sheep, pig nor a dog. If it were to put down its front paws, it would unexpectedly look the same as the creature that Squad Captain Nangong had drown.</p><br/><p>Everyone present: \u201c\u2026\u201d So it wasn\u2019t student Nangong\u2019s art being unrealistic, rather, this demonic beast was simply too abstract.</p><br/><p>The surrounding poisonous gas was growing ticker by the second. Since they couldn\u2019t get out, they could only fight!</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu immediately cast an art and summoned several hundred vines, trapping the demonic beast in front of them. Zhu Yao immediately materialized millions of icicles and shot them at the demonic beast. That strange-looking demonic beast however did not dodge either. Instead, it opened up its bloody mouth and madly shouted out. It was incredibly piercing to the ears.</p><br/><p>The vines that were still lush green earlier instantly wilted and turned into ashes, while the icicles that filled the sky immediately turned into water as well. Furthermore, they were tainted by the poisonous gas, and they fell back to the ground as poisonous rain. Yu Yan immediately materialized a fire dragon which charged up into the sky. The sky was instantly filled with flames, burning the poisonous rain in time.</p><br/><p>When they thought that things were finally settling down, Zhu Yao remembered what her biology teacher had told them a long time ago. If water were to encounter fire, it would turn into\u2026 steam! In the face of this venomous demonic beast, the situation became even more dire as poisonous steam was formed.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. The poisonous mist grew thicker.</p><br/><p>The four\u2019s range of movements grew smaller, and in just a few moments, merely a few square meters of area remained untouched by the poisonous mist. That demonic beast suddenly opened its mouth wide, black sparkles could be seen from within, as though it was about to spit something in their direction. Naturally, it was definitely the poisonous liquid that smashed the ground into a crater from earlier.</p><br/><p>What to do? Ice, fire, and wood type attacks were all ineffective, and the demonic beast\u2019s magic defense was simply too high.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank. With a twist of his hand, he summoned his Life Artifact \u2013 the lightning sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s heart clenched. If he were to use lightning-type arts, their identities would be exposed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d Yu Yan stroked her head. They were left with no choice right now. At the very most, they would face some troubles in the future. Just as he was about to attack, a gust of wind swept past from the sky above, instantly scattering the poisonous gas that surrounded them. Student Nangong who was \u201cabandoned\u201d by his team was standing within the wind. He came to save them! As expected, he was definitely a great party member!</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and go!\u201d He only had the chance to utter this, as the surrounding poisonous gas was already beginning to gather once more.</p><br/><p>The four of them immediately caught up with him as quick as possible. While scattering the poisonous gas with wind-type arts like he did, they madly flew towards the direction of the Purifying Pool. The enraged roar of the demonic beast resounded behind them. They did not dare to stop. As they flew towards the Purifying Pool, they thought that the demonic beast would stop chasing after them. However, the moment they heard the \u2018sousou\u2019 noises, black poisonous liquid came shooting at the small group of five.</p><br/><p>They immediately flew to the shores of the Purifying Pool, and with a few resounding bangs, craters once again appeared in the surroundings. Strangely, in a radius of a few squared meters from the Purifying Pool, the poisonous gas would immediately scatter.</p><br/><p>However, the poisonous gas outside the Purifying Pool grew thicker, and in just a few momembers, the figure of that demonic beast appeared. However, it did not dare to approach them, and simply contained to patrol around several meters away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhu Yao pointed at the demonic beast and said. Then, she looked towards student Nangong. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that it wouldn\u2019t follow us here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Nangong was confused as well. \u201cWhen I came here the last time, the demonic beast would return right after we arrive in this pool. No matter what we did, we could not lure it in. Today\u2026 it might have been in a good mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d This reason was a little too nonsensical!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, with the Purifying Pool here, let\u2019s take this opportunity to bring it down. \u201cSquad Leader Nangong\u2019s eyes shone and he said. \u201cThis is simply a god-sent opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>He inspected the terrain and said. \u201cThis poisonous mist is incredible, but it can still be scattered with wind-type arts. Adding that we have our divine physiques, even if we\u2019re latched on by the poisonous gas, sustaining for seven minutes or so isn\u2019t difficult. Not to mention this pool can instantly scatter the poisonous gas. We can use wind-type arts as our shield, and then take turns in pulling the demonic beast and coming back here to detoxify. As long as we aren\u2019t injured by the poisonous liquid, defeating this demonic beast at a slow pace isn\u2019t impossible. What do you guys think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Is he talking about swapping tanks? It is indeed a good plan. After everyone considered it for a moment, they all nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s settled.\u201d Squad Captain Nangong looked at the demonic beast that was still loitering outside. He did hand seals with one of his hand, materializing a shield of wind which instantly enveloped his surroundings like a spiral of wind. Then, he took the lead and charged out.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to cast an art, a shield of wind had already begun to envelop her surroundings. When she turned to take a look, her eyes landed on a certains someone who was just putting down his hand. \u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave too far away from your master.\u201d He instructed as he began to fly up.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt her heart warming up. Who says \u201cwarmth\u201d is useless?</p><br/><p>Squad Captain Nangong\u2019s plan may sound perfect, but it did not account for the boss\u2019s tough muscles and hard skin. Furthermore, the various mystic arts that they threw on it earlier were all completely ineffective. Though the five of them were not injured, they did not have any advantage over it either.</p><br/><p>Squad Captain Nangong seemed to specialize in wind-type arts, but at the very most, he could only drive away the mist. Whenever he were to throw a wind blade at the opponent, a \u2018miss\u2019 damage marker would float up. It lacked destructive power. Zhu Yao and her master did not find it good to simply use lightning-type arts either. Fortunately, her master\u2019s sword skills were at the very peak as well. With a sky filled with spiritual swords, he firmly locked the demonic beast\u2019s movements. Furthermore, his cold sword intent was the only thing that could break past its skin, and thus became the main DPS of the team.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao knew all five types of mystic arts. Other than the lightning-type arts, she was most familiar with either water or ice, which were the elements she researched deeply on in order to teach Little Radish well back then. However, this demonic beast was simply unafraid of them. When the icicles struck its body, not even a single scar was left on it. The words \u2018miss\u2019 constantly floated above its head.</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu was even more unfortunate. His wood-type arts basically wilted before they could even form, leaving behind a bunch of dead grass. Yue Ying was still able to provide some help as he restrained the demonic beast with her master. He retracted all of the devillic energy in his body, and was using mystic arts to attack like everyone else. Zhu Yao did not know what he was thinking, and did not want to bother either, simply letting him do whatever he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys hold on, let me catch my breath.\u201d Zhonggu turned around and returned to the Purifying Pool to detoxify himself. With a defeated look, he said as he walked. \u201cThis demonic beast is really\u2026 It\u2019s as though it\u2019s born to be my mortal enemy. It instantly destroys all of the life within my wood-type arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Life? Zhu Yao was stunned for a moment, as something flashed across her mind. She raised her head and looked carefully at that demonic beast. Ever since she entered the tower, all of the living creatures would have names and levels shown above their heads, as though she was looking at a net game\u2019s point of view. She had asked her master about it, and it seemed like this was something that only she could see. Zhu Yao had thought that this was a cheat that Realmspirit had given her. This demonic beast was no exception, with the words \u2018Early-stage Demonic Beast (Poison)\u2019 floating about it, though its name was red in colour.</p><br/><p>As for Zhonggu Lu and Squad Captain Nangong, the words above their heads were initially \u2018Unknown Deity (Level 1)\u2019. After making their introductions, the words above their heads turned into their own names, and their colours changed from yellow to blue.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was not entirely mindful of these words in the beginning. Now that she thought about it, these names were truly similar to the settings found in net games. Red names signified enemy targets, like the current demonic beast. Yellow names referred to passive targets, where they would only turn red and counterattack when they receive an attack. Those heaven-defying rabbits in the plain back then chased after them because she poked it a little, and they did not bite her on their own initiatives. The reason why Zhonggu Lu and Nangong Cheng had blue names, was because they had formed a party with her! The names would only turn blue if they were party members of the same party.</p><br/><p>In that case, in the brackets next to the names, that should be where the levels and attributes were displayed.</p><br/><p>This demonic beast was a poison-type, and according to the rules of net games, poison was a type that deprived life. Water, wood and fire type attacks were thus ineffective on it. It would thus make sense why a bunch of \u2018miss\u2019 would float above its head when she struck it with icicles.</p><br/><p>If they wanted to deal with it, then the only choice would be\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately flew towards the Squad Captain. She had to inform the Squad Captain of the raid guide. \u201cSquad Captain\u2026\u201d Eh? What was the Squad Captain called again? \u201cNangong\u2026 Huang (Yellow)?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nangong Cheng!\u201d Flips table! Who the hell is Nangong Huang?</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya! Whatever! In any case, it\u2019s all about the same~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d How are orange and yellow about the same? The colours are different, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d His expression darkened as he released a wind blade to blow away the poisonous mist near Yue Ying and Yu Yan. He did his best to provide support to the main DPS players.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

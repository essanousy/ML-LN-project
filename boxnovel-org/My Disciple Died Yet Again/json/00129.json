She was barely able to hold onto the weapon in her hands as well. Thump. Thump. Her heart beat wildly, as she finally began to feel afraid.</p><br/><p>Actually, ever since her master descended upon the Lower Realm to find her, she had a faint guess that the shadow wasn\u2019t that simple. Even if it wasn\u2019t a Deity of the Higher Realm, it was still definitely an overpowered mighty power. However, no matter how she racked her brains, she wouldn\u2019t have guessed that it would be one of the legendary Devil Race.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt like crying, and had the impulse to close down her store to go on a strike. Momma\u2019s egg. That\u2019s a Devil, you know! A race, which spread death all around their surroundings, that had only existed in the Ancient Era of legends and had fought against the God Race to the death! If they were to fight against it with just their physical mortal body, they would either be courting death, or was tired of living in the first place! They were basically not on the same level, alright?</p><br/><p>Could it be because she had accidentally activated the route of a God Race, which led to the appearance of a Devil to balance everything out?</p><br/><p>Momma\u2019s egg. Other than having a dragon\u2019s body, she basically did not possess this so-called power of a God Race, alright? She did not even receive the most basic form of inheritance from a dragon, otherwise, how would she simply possess the cultivation of a Demigod?</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign. In your opinion, what do you think we should do?\u201d Probably because the scene earlier was too frightening, one Nascent Soul practitioner turned around, and looked towards Zhu Yao who was still standing still at where she was.</p><br/><p>The moment his words fell, everyone, who was still deep in shock at the fact that the Devil Race had once again appeared in the world earlier, as though they had only regained their senses at that moment, turned to look towards her one after another. That\u2019s right, earlier, Sovereign Zhu Yao was the only person who was able to go against the Devil. They still had hope.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt a chill from the staring eyes, which were filled with the piteous cry for food- ah pui, which were filled with hope, and reflexively took a step back. If she were to say that she didn\u2019t know what to do as well, would she be beaten to death?</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, do not panic.\u201d Zhu Yao took a deep breath, and suppressed her fear. \u201cI see that the Devil has yet to mature. At the very least, it has yet to completely resurrect, otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have to borrow a practitioner\u2019s body. Furthermore, I have just forcefully tried to expel it from its host, so it has definitely injured it gravely. In light of this, we can only take the opportunity while its energy has yet to recover, to completely exterminate it.\u201d In any case, they had to take its life while its sick- ah, no, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s to chase after it while they still had the upper hand.</p><br/><p>When everyone heard this, their eyes which were filled with despair earlier, finally had a hint of light. She\u2019s right, the outcome of that battle earlier, was indeed a victory.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter is of great urgency.\u201d Zhu Yao instructed with a stern expression. \u201cWe must definitely find that Devil before its energy is fully recovered. Otherwise, the outcome will be severe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expression became serious. In the face of a great matter that concerned the survival of the cultivation world, the various Clans and Sects demonstrated unprecedented unity. Every one of them began to chip in by sending out all of their disciples, to undergo a large-scale search operation, excluding Celestial Indus Sect and Azureflight Sect.</p><br/><p>As the culprits for hiding a Devil, although they were actually victims as well, they had completely lost everyone\u2019s trust. In an instant, these two Sects received everyone\u2019s hostility.</p><br/><p>It was initially an emperor abdication drama, however, because of the re-appearance of the Devil Race, it turned into a multi-racial warring campaign. And Ancient Hill Sect, which was initially being forced to give up the right to host the Inter-Sect Tournament, was once again logically standing at the unshakable leading position. Most likely, no one would have ever thought of this dramatic turn in events.</p><br/><p>As for the news regarding the re-appearance of the Devil Race, under Zhu Yao\u2019s behest, it was spread throughout the entire cultivation world extremely quickly. Seemingly every single practitioner, and even the heretic practitioners, had begun to spontaneously search for the traces of the Devil. Mu Meiyan\u2019s name had resounded through the entire cultivation world.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Not Rulu, but Mu Meiyan.</p><br/><p>When Rulu was expelled from Celestial Indus Sect, she had changed her name to Mu Meiyan when she fled to Azureflight Sect. Hence, everyone believed that Mu Meiyan was this Devil\u2019s real name.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had believed that with so many people involved in the search, she would be able to obtain news regarding Mu Meiyan before long. However, never did she expect that even after three months had passed, forget about Mu Meiyan, there wasn\u2019t even any news on Yue Hanxin whom she had swiped away.</p><br/><p>Seemingly every plausible lead that was made known to her, she would immediately rush over. However, there wasn\u2019t even a single trace of the Devil\u2019s hair. Mu Meiyan and Yue Hanxin, this pair who loved to kill each other, seemed as though they had dissipated from the world, completely disappearing into thin air.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but feel a little anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d Yu Yan sighed. This stupid disciple in front of him, had already repeated walked back and forth more than a hundred times, and even he was about to get a headache from it. His disciple, who was usually like a firecracker, was currently unexpectedly quiet. He had already appeared for such a long time, yet, she did not even have the slightest of reaction. Mn, he wasn\u2019t happy at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Zhu Yao seemed to have only realized that a figure had suddenly popped out from the jade pendant. After being startled for a moment, she once again frowned, and continued to walk back and forth. \u201cI have something that I can\u2019t figure out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust where did that Devil pop out from?\u201d Just how did it appear? And how did Mu Meiyan obtain him? Ever since she saw the resurrected Mu Meiyan for the first time, it had been by her side. Then evidently, that shadow had existed since the very beginning, and it might even be possible that Mu Meiyan\u2019s resurrection and body-takeover were all the doings of the Devil. Otherwise, when she was trying to take over Little Radish, how did Mu Meiyan\u2019s soul appear directly in Little Radish\u2019s divine sense region without being sensed by anyone else? And, that black hole, which she escaped into after the takeover failed, was very strange as well. It did not seem to be any sort of Mystic Arts.</p><br/><p>That Devil definitely wasn\u2019t simply linked with Mu Meiyan just by a blood contract alone. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have used all of its strength to help Mu Meiyan. The Devil Race did not have any human morals to speak of, after all. For it to do something like this, it definitely had some sort of purpose, or had made an agreement with Mu Meiyan.</p><br/><p>Then, could she make a guess that, ever since the beginning, Mu Meiyan wasn\u2019t actually some sort of bug, the real bug was actually the Devil inside her body? Probably, ever since the beginning, her methods were incorrect. What she should defend against was actually that Devil, and not Mu Meiyan.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan slightly frowned, and a moment later, replied. \u201cThe Devil Race are born to kill, and existed in the world all this while. However\u2026 during the Ancient Era, all of them had been sealed by the God Race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any which escaped?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there was, why would there be the current cultivation world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Master means\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cThat thing isn\u2019t an actual Devil.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned, and shook his head. \u201cYes, and no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d What do you mean? Can you speak human words?</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you realized the irregularity of that Devil?\u201d Yu Yan continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIrregularity?\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cDoes being irregularly powerful count?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yan swept a scornful look at her, sighed, and gave an \u2018as expected, she\u2019s stupid\u2019 expression. \u201cOther than that, when the others attacked that Devil, were they effective?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEffective? What effectiveness? The rest basically did not manage to land a hit\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao stopped there, and suddenly widened her eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a physical form?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan lightly nodded. His disciple\u2019s stupidity seemed to be salvable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe physical body of that Devil had already been destroyed?\u201d Zhu Yao instantly became a little excited. Every living being in this world contained a soul, and only a physical body could harbor a soul. No matter was it a demonic beast, or a human, they were both the same. Other than the Reincarnation Path which could temporarily accommodate souls, all souls which had lost their physical bodies could not last more than seven days in the living world. After seven days, the souls would dissipate away.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 That Devil clearly could separate from Mu Meiyan\u2019s body.\u201d Back then when she was at Azureflight Sect, that shadow had cone alone, and Mu Meiyan was not in the vicinity. \u201cAnd that Devil had clearly existed before Mu Meiyan attempted a body-takeover.\u201d When Rulu was being devoured, that Devil could have completely accomplished it itself, so why did it have to bring along Mu Meiyan? And, they were so lovey-dovey like family, coexisting for such a long time. It was basically illogical. Even if a Devil\u2019s soul could dwell in anything\u2026 Wait a minute, anything? Could it be\u2026 \u201cThat Devil isn\u2019t possessing Rulu\u2019s body, but is actually dwelling in Mu Meiyan\u2019s soul?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan deeply frowned, and nodded. That was indeed a possibility.</p><br/><p>In an instant, Zhu Yao was a little speechless. That Devil sure was unlucky. It could have found anything to dwell into, but it just had to find a soul to dwell in. It was no wonder it would help her with the take-over, and act as her guardian the entire time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Devil\u2026 Is it stupid?\u201d Zhu Yao could only explain it this way.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost probably, when its former body was being destroyed, it basically could not find any suitable physical body. Hence, it could only dwell into the soul of a human practitioner, whose physical body had similarly died.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao wiped her sweat. Why did a soul have to make things difficult for another soul?</p><br/><p>No, wait. They were already family who loved each other.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took out the mirror-like Mystic Tool she had refined on her own, and muttered. \u201cIn other words, what I struck back then, was not the link between a blood contract, but the link between their two souls?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. She had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, that strike had instead helped it, allowing that Devil to gain the ability to enter another physical body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d Zhu Yao suddenly had the impulse to chop off her hand. Look at what you did for being overly eager!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Yu Yan continued. \u201cThat strike of yours had injured the soul. Injuries done to a soul cannot be restored by anyone. Even if the Devil tries to do a body-takeover again, it might not succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, temporarily, it won\u2019t be looking for a new physical body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Phew\u2026 That scared the hell out of her. Why couldn\u2019t say everything in one go?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan looked towards the Mystic Tool in her hands as well. This was a part which he couldn\u2019t figure out completely as well. Theoretically speaking, souls were enigmatic objects, while his disciple was actually able to cut it apart. He was a little suspicious as to what Mystic Tool his own disciple had managed to refine.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s line of sight landed on her the Mystic Tool in her hands as well. Truthfully speaking, she herself was shocked, alright? Back then, she only thought of refining the sharpest weapon ever, while the mirror in her hands was indeed a genuine tenth-ranked Mystic Tool.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao grabbed onto the handle of the mirror, and twisted it. In an instant, the face of the mirror and the handle were separated. The Mystic Tool which was emitting spiritual energy all around earlier, was suddenly split into two extremes. The handle\u2019s spiritual energy was even denser than before. The regular tenth-ranked Mystic Tool earlier, was currently filled with the aura an extreme-grade Mystic Tool. While the other half, the face of the mirror, had instantly lost its luster, turning into a regular copper mirror. It couldn\u2019t even be considered as a Mystic Tool.</p><br/><p>However, what actually harmed the Devil, was not the tenth-ranked extreme grade handle, but this regular copper mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what kind of object did you refine?\u201d When his disciple was refining, Yu Yan had watched the entire process. Yet, he was still completely unable to figure it out. Clearly, it was a very normal object.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao smiled. \u201cBack then, I simply thought of making the sharpest thing. But, after thinking about it, that thing has always been by my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot the Profound Deep Metal?\u201d That was the most special piece among the materials he had left for his disciple. If it was used carefully, it could even be used to create a Divine Tool.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shook her head. Pointing to the sky, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s light!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

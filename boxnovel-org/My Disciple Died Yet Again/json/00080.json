Rui Yu was not by his side, so he must have spent the extra three days to appease her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Seeing them entering the hall, Xiao Yi welcomed them with an excited expression. To be precise, he was welcoming Feng Yi. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re fine and well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Feng Yi responded blandly, and then, brushed past him, walking over to the higher seats. At that moment, Xiao Yi\u2019s expression turned a little ugly. A gap had opened up between them.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stroked her nose, and found herself a seat as well. Having some bad thoughts in her mind, she found this scene to be really amusing.</p><br/><p>She carefully looked at Xiao Yi\u2019s cultivation, and as expected, it had rose by quite a bit again. Earlier, he was at the second level of Nascent Soul, but now, he\u2019s at the peak of the second level, and it faintly looked as though he was about to break through into the third level as well. It seemed like in these ten days, he did not forget to do the thing he had to with Rui Yu.</p><br/><p>His own master\u2019s life and death was uncertain when she was trapped in the Desolate Ground, yet, he submerged himself in a couple\u2019s bliss. Thinking it this way, he really deserved losing Feng Yi\u2019s trust.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, why was she able to see his face clearly now? It seemed as though the word BUG on his face had lightened a little.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment, and then, she raised her head. The hell! The exclamation mark on his head had disappeared as well!</p><br/><p>Could it be because she released the Water Spirit, it resulted to a part of the BUG being fixed? The more Zhu Yao thought about it, the more she felt this was plausible. In her dreams, Xiao Yi obtained the three Spirits, and then, with his senses for the Five Spirits, he summoned the remaining Earth Spirit and Fire Spirit.</p><br/><p>Currently, he only had the Metal Spirit in his hands. In other words, the Earth Spirit and Fire Spirit would never be in his hands. If she were to take the Metal Spirit off his hands as well, without his only golden finger, naturally, he would no longer be a bug. When she thought of this, Zhu Yao momentarily got excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother, he hooked himself with a heretic practitioner. Ever since the ancient times, good and evil has never been able to co-exist, this issue cannot be prolonged. Sect Master senior-martial brother, please handle this matter impartially.\u201d Zi Dan spoke up with a furious expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi frowned deeply. \u201cSenior-martial brother Zi Dan, please do not slander me. You say that I hooked myself up with a heretic practitioner, do you have evidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvidence?\u201d Zi Dan snorted coldly, it seemed like the anger in his heart was not light. Walking towards Zhu Yao, he said in agitation. \u201cYou want evidence? Little brother, tell them. Back then in Yucang City, was he together with that devil woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao could only nod her head.</p><br/><p>So it was because of this matter. It was no wonder she and Feng Yi was called here so hastily. Heretic practitioners and Deity practitioners had fought for so many years, and they had long been divided like water and fire. It was thus no wonder Zi Dan would be this furious till now. This time, Xiao Yi had landed himself in deep trouble.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi\u2019s expression became even uglier, yet, he still rebutted with a just attitude. \u201cBoth of you are biased against Rui Yu, your words cannot be easily taken for truth. And, even if I\u2019m together with her, it doesn\u2019t prove that I have hooked up with a heretic practitioner, does it? Rather, you two\u2026\u201d He coldly looked at the two people in the eyes, his expression revealed a hint of disdain. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that the reason why you two are still alive was because she released you two back then in Yucang City. Not only do you two not know how to show your gratitude, you still wish to frame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re really unreasonable.\u201d In an instant, Zi Dan was furious to the point where fumes were about to rise from his head.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was even more dumbfounded by this twisted concept of his. Show Rui Yu gratitude? Did she hear him right? The one who caught them was her as well, and instead, she had to thank her? What kind of joke was that?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Since little brother Soi\u2019s and my words are not trustworthy, then your master\u2019s words should be trustworthy, right!?\u201d Zi Dan took in a deep breath. Looking towards Feng Yi who was seating at the higher seats, he said with a bow. \u201cSenior-martial aunt, you saw that scene for yourself as well. In the underground city, wasn\u2019t he hooking up together with that heretic practitioner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. Not only did she see it, she was even given a free ticket to watch a \u201cThere\u2019s Only Me in Your Heart, and You\u2019re the Only One in My Heart\u201d movie.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi recalled that live pornographic scene as well, and her expression instantly darkened quite a bit. Her delicate brows furrowed deeply, and only after a moment did she helplessly nod.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Xiao Yi widened his eyes, and looked at Feng Yi with disbelieving eyes. His expression instantly sank to rock bottom, and his entire face was filled with the \u201chow can you not understand me?\u201d look.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi did not bother looking at him, and instantly turned her head away.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi\u2019s face was instantly ashen.</p><br/><p>Although he saw that Xiao Yi had suffered a setback, Zhu Yao still felt rather refreshed. However, in the end, he would not be sentenced to death. If he was really judged as someone who had hooked up with an heretic practitioner, most likely, he would no longer have a footing in the deity cultivation world. Although he was quite a playboy, and would always open his legs whenever he see beautiful women, generally, he could not be said to be too nasty of a person. Adding that in Yucang City, he had once saved her before, so to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yi, did you really hook yourself up with that heretic practitioner?\u201d Zi Mo\u2019s expression sank as well. This matter was too grave, although he was the disciple of a Sovereign, for the sake of the Ancient Hill Sect, he could not afford to be soft.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 I think there\u2019s some sort of a misunderstanding.\u201d Zhu Yao stood up, stopped Zi Mo, and cleared her throat. \u201cActually, when we were at Yucang City, the three of us were captured by that heretic practitioner. And she was a Demigod-stage practitioner.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment these words fell, the great hall was momentarily in an uproar. Heretic practitioners had never been easy to deal with, and all of them had their own methods at their disposal. However, the reason why the deity sects had been able to suppress them for so many years, was exactly because of the Demigod-stage practitioners in the deity sects. And although heretic practitioners, through relying on their heretic practices, could cultivate faster than the disciples of deity sects, none of them were able to reach the peak. However, currently, a Demigod-stage practitioner appeared, which everyone could not help but exclaim about. To the deity sects, this was definitely a big threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, the three of us were unable to defeat her, and we almost disco- uh\u2026 I mean, we almost died in her hands.\u201d Zhu Yao continued. \u201cIn the end, Xiao Yi, with his quick wits, bewitched that female practitioner, and thus, was able to save all of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he clearly, with that woman\u2026\u201d Zi Dan was still furious, and wanted to speak up.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tugged him. \u201cSenior-martial brother, back then, heretic practitioners were everywhere. I believe junior-martial brother Xiao had no other options as well, so he had to put an act that entire time. If he had really betrayed the sect, why would he return, and walk himself into a trap?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Dan frowned and thought for a moment, and then, he no longer argued.</p><br/><p>\u201cHence, junior-martial brother Xiao was only putting up an act, to fool that heretic practitioner.\u201d Zhu Yao looked towards Xiao Yi who was in the center. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Xiao Yi gritted his teeth, before blurting out an answer a moment later.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo frowned deeply. He kind of felt that this incident was not as simple as this. After pondering for a moment, he said. \u201cJunior-martial brother Xiao, since you have already returned, it means that you have completely broke off from that female practitioner. You should not have continued discussing about the matter of that heretic practitioner, which even caused junior-martial brother Zi Dan to misunderstand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi simply lowered his head, and did not reply, as though he was silently agreeing to his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the truth is clear, then there\u2019s no need for us to investigate it any further.\u201d Zi Mo continued. \u201cHowever, to prevent all circumstances, even more so to prevent that heretic practitioner from taking the opportunity to seek revenge, junior-martial brother Xiao will not be allowed to head down the mountain for two hundred years.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the best way to deal with the situation. First, he had given face to Sovereign Feng Yi, and second, he could prevent any implications of him being with the heretic practitioner.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any objections?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi was silent for a moment, before he hugged his fist and replied. \u201cI shall comply with the Sect Master\u2019s orders!\u201d Raising his head, his eyes, however, moved to Zhu Yao who was behind him. At that moment, his gaze turned cold, a hint of hatred flashed past his eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart shook! The hell, what\u2019s the meaning of this expression of his? She saved his life, you know? Hey? Why did her hatred parameter rise every single time she saves him?</p><br/><p>With Zi Mo\u2019s order, he announced that the meeting was adjourned.</p><br/><p>In this happy and satisfactory ending, Zhu Yao was the only one who felt terrible.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi was the first one to leave. When she passed by Zhu Yao, she cast a grateful glance at her, and only then did Zhu Yao found some comfort.</p><br/><p>As expected, there were still understanding people in this world.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Probably because Zhu Yao had saved Xiao Yi, Feng Yi, the mountain-top flower of Ancient Hill Sect, had recently warmed up to her. Since they were both at the Beast-Taming Mountain, they were quite near each other. Feng Yi would occasionally come down to converse with her. Coincidentally, little wimp had entered the rebellious phase, and it was unknown what the old man Zi Mo was thinking, every bunch of documents pertaining to the Ancient Hill Sect were pushed to her. She was extremely busy, and when Feng Yi came, she could finally find an excuse, to pat her own buttocks and disregard them.</p><br/><p>When Feng Yi came to look for her, she was currently giving a lesson to the new little turnips who had just entered. Zi Mo\u2019s explanation was, these were the future of the sect, as an elder, she had the responsibility to supervise them.</p><br/><p>Momma\u2019s egg, it\u2019s not like she was taking in any disciples, the hell she needed to supervise them for?</p><br/><p>Looking at these bunch of naive little turnips circling around her, and because she had to maintain her reputation, she could not hit them and could not scold them, it was very terrifying, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, elder, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Number one turnip asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, elder, you can fly, so is your name flyman?\u201d Number two turnip asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, my father said that those that can fly, are called birds though?\u201d Number three turnip asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, is your name birdman?\u201d Number four turnip asked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao squatted down, pulled the bunch of curious little turnips, and sighed. With a heavy tone, she explained. \u201cLittle buddies, this elder\u2019s name, is not flyman, and not birdman either. I\u2019m called Superman!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, I\u2019m the Superman tasked to save the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The little turnips had a sudden realization, and the place was filled sighs of admiration.</p><br/><p>Pfft~</p><br/><p>A light laughter came from afar, the mountain-top flower had came here to converse with her again. Zhu Yao finally had an excuse to dodge this affair. After casually picking out a disciple, she handed the bunch of little turnips over, and then, pulling along Feng Yi, she ran away.</p><br/><p>Little kids or whatever, were too terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you trick those little children?\u201d Feng Yi sat down on the stone chair in the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you say that I tricked them?\u201d Zhu Yao poured herself a cup of tea, and explained with a serious expression. \u201cI\u2019m giving them a very important lesson, \u2018loose lips will sink ships\u2019\u2026 Really!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi shook her head, however, she did not continue to argue. After taking the cup of tea from him, she expressed her thanks.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d It wasn\u2019t for you, though.</p><br/><p>Alright, she felt embarrassed taking it back, hence, she could only pour herself another cup.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi seemed to have something to say. While glancing at him for a couple of times, she kept biting her lips. \u201cSoi Sauz\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 What do you think of me?\u201d Feng Yi suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhu Yao gave an air-headed answer.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi, however, lowered her head. Lightly glancing at him from the corner of her eyes, as though she had something that she could not bring herself to say, her face began to redden bit by bit.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly felt a little uncomfortable. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you so strange today?\u201d</p><br/><p>After conversing with her for so many days, Zhu Yao had already treated her as a good girl friend. This was still the first time she had seen her with such an expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you willing\u2026 to form a practitioner-pair with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfft~~~~~~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

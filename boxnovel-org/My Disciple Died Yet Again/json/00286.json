She must had transmigrated into a world of insect wars or something, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, why is this place so, so\u2026\u201d Xiao Bai\u2019s complexion paled, his face was filled with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably because the food here is especially good, which led to them grow excessively?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Even if it\u2019s excess, they shouldn\u2019t grow this big, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s first move further ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instructed them to retract their aura, and continue forward. The dense forest before their eyes grew wider, and the number of gigantic insects decreased. Just as she had thought that they were about to reach the exit, a gigantic demonic beast appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>It seemed to have sharp fin growing at its back, and its figure was like a lizard. However, its claws were flowing with lava-like red light. Its cry was very strange, as if it was screaming with a broken voice. It was neither sharp nor piercing, but the main problem here was, she was unable to understand its voice.</p><br/><p>A furious, flaming aura rose in the air. That demonic beast continued to spit fire at its surroundings, though the area in front of had long turned into charred ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 What is this?\u201d Ye Qingcang was dumbfounded. He pondered deeply for a moment. \u201cI have neither seen nor heard of such a demonic beast. I wonder what rank it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had never seen it either. Even in the beast wave from one of the previous worlds, she had never seen such a species.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, can this demonic beast be tamed?\u201d Little tyrant asked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat all of a sudden. For some reason, she instinctively disliked this beastie, faintly sensing that it was different from the rest of the demonic beasts. Not to mention she was basically unable to understand what it was screaming about.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThe creatures in this place is too strange. It\u2019s best that we don\u2019t offend them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a detour!\u201d Zhu Yao pointed to the side, and walked over from one of the sides of the dense forest. She wondered if it was because the rank of the demonic beast was too low, as it actually did not sense them at all.</p><br/><p>However, the number of demonic beasts they encountered later on grew, and they were all species which they had never seen before. They all had strange appearances. Some of them looked similar to certain beasts, but because of their attributes, sizes and the locations of their claws, they were all different.</p><br/><p>These demonic beasts all occupied territories of their own, and without a single exception, all of them were extremely irritable. Either they were burning down trees or digging through rocks, harbouring intense enemy intent towards every creature that approached them.</p><br/><p>She had once thought of wanting to talk with one of the beasts, but she had almost been pierced through by an icicle it spat out, which led them to fleeing for several kilometers. Zhu Yao was finally certain that the World Favourable Impression was ineffective on these strange beasts.</p><br/><p>The doubts in the depths of her heart grew deeper. She faintly sensed that there was something strange with this land, but she was still missing a connecting piece. No matter how she thought about it, she was unable to figure it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny, there seems to be something up front?\u201d Ye Qingcang pointed to somewhere in the sky and asked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao peered, and just as Qingcang had said, far away, nearing the horizon hanged a fine white line, as if there were double eyelids in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a closer look!\u201d Zhu Yao summoned her sword and flew in that direction. The other two hurriedly followed after her.</p><br/><p>After approaching it did they notice that the white line was actually a light-emitting translucent wall. The wall was like a gradient layer, the part connecting the surface was pure white, and it grew dimmer as it extended towards the sky.</p><br/><p>With its circular shape, it encased a large territory. There seemed to be a tall palace tower within. It was as if the gigantic barrier was enclosing the thing inside, and on the wall floated several golden runic characters.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao subconsciously sensed that inside this wall laid the answer behind this strange land.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 seems to be a very ancient Great Mountain Barrier Formation.\u201d Little tyrant looked at the runic characters on the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have seen this before?\u201d Zhu Yao was a little astonished.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai frowned. \u201cI have once seen this on a certain mystic record in the sect, it\u2019s named Dawncloud Formation. According to legends, this formation cannot be broken, and the formation core is within the formation as well, so it\u2019s basically undispellable. However, this formation can only be used for defense, with absolutely no offensive properties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying, we can\u2019t enter it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little tyrant nodded. \u201cThis formation only has a single formation core. It can only be opened from within.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFormation core?\u201d Zhu Yao suddenly recalled a certain person\u2019s dudou. Maybe\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai, did you bring a dudou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAahh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh pui, I meant do you have any defensive mystic artifacts on you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little tyrant shook his head strongly. No matter if it\u2019s a dudou or mystic artifact, he did not have either!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao then turned to look at Ye QIngcang!</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that sort of hobbies either!\u201d He shook his head even more wildly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPea~~\u201d At this key moment, a certain pea leapt out. It flew at a height horizontal to her line of sight and then suddenly let out a \u2018ahmu\u2019 sound, spitting out a\u2026 brick.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao casually caught it. Why are you throwing this at me? The ones who were immoral were those two, not me, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh rank mystic artifact!\u201d Ye Qingcang pointed at the brick in her hands with an astonished look.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gave it a closer look. The hell, it was really a seventh rank mystic artifact! So the thing that the pea threw at her was not a brick, but an iPhone+!</p><br/><p>However\u2026 She couldn\u2019t use a seventh rank mystic artifact either! She was presently just a Foundation trash.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeapea, do you have one with a little lower rank?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea\u2026\u201d Peapea called out again, once again letting out the same \u2018ahmu\u2019 sound, spitting out a sixth rank\u2026 brick!</p><br/><p>Just how much do you love bricks?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still too high of a rank, do you have one with an even lower rank?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea!\u201d Fifth rank brick\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven lower\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea.\u201d Third rank brick\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is enough.\u201d Zhu Yao carried the four bricks of various ranks, and a sense of a tycoon who had bought all the iPhones from series one to six instantly welled within her. \u201cCome, come, come, don\u2019t be shy. Everyone gets one.\u201d She turned around a stuffed the few bricks to the youths at the side, and then left herself with the third rank brick.</p><br/><p>\u201cPea\u2026\u201d The pea suddenly called out, once again opening its mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You still have something for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u30fd(??\u25bd?)\u30ce</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao excitedly spread out her hands, preparing to receive the goods. Could it be an iPad this time? What came floating towards her was a red dudou.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two little ones: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea?\u201d Seeing that she wasn\u2019t reacting to it, Peapea spat out a few more of various colours and designs. It looked as if it was saying: Do you want more? Do you want more? I can spit out a lot more!</p><br/><p>Who wants something like this!? -faints- There\u2019s still two youths behind me, you know? Don\u2019t teach little children bad things!</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>\u201cPea\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao clamped onto the pea\u2019s mouth, her face darkened. \u201cEnough, enough. I know you\u2019re Doraemon now.\u201d</p><br/><p>With how it could spit out anything she wanted, this pea\u2019s mouth must be the fourth dimension, right?</p><br/><p>In order to prevent it from spitting out anything immoral again, Zhu Yao immediately used the third rank defensive mystic artifact as the formation core to cross the barrier, charging in with other two youths and one pea.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

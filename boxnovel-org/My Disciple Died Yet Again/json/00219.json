Mn. It was definite that his mother wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize him now. Only after Zhu Yao\u2019s hands had begun to numb and no longer had any strength left to throw her fists, did she finally stop while panting hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuwuu\u2026\u201d Lin Qi raised his piggy face and when he groaned, he received a glare from her. In an instant, his entire body released a white glow. It seemed like he had expended too much energy and wanted to revert back to his original form. As expected, not even a moment later, a puff sounded. That blue-robed figure disappeared, and in front of her, there was now a\u2026</p><br/><p>Chow Chow!\u00b9</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened to the promised Qilin?</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a Qilin of the God race?\u201d What\u2019s with this look of his?</p><br/><p>\u3002\u201cEy em! (I am!)\u201d Chow Chow shrank its body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m blind!?\u201d I didn\u2019t go to school, don\u2019t lie to me. \u201cYou think I haven\u2019t seen an actual Qilin? How can it possibly look like\u2026 a dog like you? Where are your scales? Your horns? Your hooves?\u201d Although she was rather fierce with her punches earlier, it couldn\u2019t possibly mutate him, right!?</p><br/><p>\u201cEy\u2026Ey really am!\u201d The Chow Chow pitifully sniffled. \u201cEy am the final beast with the Qilin bloodline. Mei haze (My race) had passed the bloodline down through so many generations, so it\u2019s natural to have some changes in our appearances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d This change is a little too much, right? You have basically mutated into another species, hey! \u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026 You only carry the bloodline of a Qilin?\u201d The heirs of the God race were never interested in other species before. Back then, when she opened the World Crossing Heavenly Door, she sent the Gods to different small worlds. Could it be that because it could not find someone of its own race, it got married with someone from a different species and then\u2026</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 Why did she feel that it was a little scary?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not a true God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEy em! (I am!)\u201d The Chow Chow desperately nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour ass!\u201d As someone who was once a true God, she simply did not want to be a relative to a Chow Chow, alright? \u201cI\u2019m warning you, in the future, if you dare to address yourself as God, I will pull out your skin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Chow Chow Lin Qi shook. Suddenly, within his doggy eyes that were swollen like buns, tears swelled. As he sniffled, as though he had found something to vent on, he began to bawl out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuaaah\u2026 How can bully a Godbeast like this? You\u2019re so inhumane! I don\u2019t want to live on anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d The hell, what happened to your noble and cold demeanor? Do you have to cry this shamelessly?</p><br/><p>\u201cWuaah\u2026 I simply wanted to hook up with a girl, yet you beat me up to this state. How are you expecting me to flirt now? I might as well die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hook up with a girl? Yi Ling?</p><br/><p>\u201cEarlier, you wanted to kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted to give a performance in front of the girl, would it kill you to just let me hit you a little!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would!\u201d Zhu Yao coldly replied. \u201cEarlier, you clearly wanted to kill me, right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says so!\u201d Lin Qi was crying even sadder than before. \u201cEarlier, I just wanted to frighten you a little. If I really wanted to kill you, I wouldn\u2019t have controlled your demonic beast in the beginning while I simply stood at the side and watched the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019s sounding a little logical. \u201cBut you injured Yue Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because that person suddenly appeared, and I wasn\u2019t able to withdraw\u2026\u201d Lin Qi argued.\u201d I can\u2019t be blamed for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you say that you won\u2019t allow me to leave this place alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qi lowered his head, and was suddenly fidgeting a little. \u201cI\u2026 I just wanted to act a little domineering. All girls like that type. There\u2019s a possibility that after she wakes up from her trance and see that scene, she might think of giving her heart to me, you know?\u201d After saying that, he even meaningfully glanced at Yi Ling who was still in a trance state, and sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand the sorrows of a single beast at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t want to understand, alright? If you just want to flirt with Yi Ling, why did you drag me along too?</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that the truth is clear, can you return me my Life Origin Fire?\u201d His face was filled with a pitiful look. \u201cThe Life Origin Fire is the source of a Godbeast. Without it, I\u2019m just a regular demonic beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. If it was truly as he said, then she seemed to have really misunderstood him, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone must take responsibility for his or her own actions.\u201d Zhu yao coldly said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if what you said is true or false. Sesame and Yue Ying, they are both my closest people, and it\u2019s true that they are injured because of you. You can\u2019t simply say you didn\u2019t intend for it to happen and everything will be resolved. Even if you didn\u2019t have any evil intentions in the beginning, it\u2019s true that you attacked me. I\u2019m not your mother, and I don\u2019t have the obligation to look over your mistakes. A mistake is a mistake. As long as the end result is a mistake, no matter how you good of a standpoint you started out from, you can\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s a mistake. If you had the guts to do it, then you should have the courage to shoulder the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Qi lowered his head, his face was filled with despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally, I will give you an advice. Yi Ling is not suited for you, she already has someone she loves.\u201d And it\u2019s not just one.</p><br/><p>Lin Qi shook, and he suddenly widened his eyes. His face was filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, hurry up and remove your control on Sesame.\u201d Zhu Yao did not have the time to manage his feelings.</p><br/><p>Lin Qi carried a heart-broken expression. \u201cI can\u2019t remove it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhu Yao instantly picked him up from the fur on his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cRea\u2026 Really\u2026\u201d Lin Qi trembled. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not a purebreed God, so I can only control, and do not have the powers to remove it. Furthermore\u2026 Furthermore, I have already lost my Life Origin Fire, so I have already lost my right as a God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. As he said, the word \u2018bug\u2019 on his face had disappeared. He was no longer the Beast Lord? Then\u2026 The crisis of world destruction has been resolved?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s too easy and random, right? She was just venting off steam.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, how can the control on Sesame be removed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless\u2026 Unless there\u2019s a bloodline suppression by someone who has a higher purity of a God\u2019s bloodline than me, or suppression by someone who is of a similar level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suppression? The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She had one!</p><br/><p>But, for safety\u2019s sake\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 What are you trying to do?\u201d Lin Qi shrank from her stares.</p><br/><p>Zhu yao recited an incantation, and with a wave of her hand, she sealed the Chow Chow in ice.</p><br/><p>After looking around and confirming that there wasn\u2019t anyone else, she heaved a huge sigh of relief. Haah, it seemed like she had no choice but to activate that vile World Favourable Impression ability.</p><br/><p>Summoning a water mirror, she tapped on the button above her head.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhu Yao walked towards Sesame who was sealed in ice, and snapped her fingers.</p><br/><p>Seemingly in an instant, that thick block of ice completely turned into water.</p><br/><p>\u201cMis\u2026 tress\u2026\u201d In an instant, the person the ice was stunned for a moment, and then, its eyes began to shine. With wide steps, it pounced towards her.</p><br/><p>And then, with a flash of white light, her right thigh sank, and a figure came clinging onto her. \u201cMistress, I feel that you\u2019re so tragically beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could even react.</p><br/><p>A tender and frail voice stole her opportunity to reply. \u201cI feel the same way!\u201d Her left thigh sank at the same time.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat.</p><br/><p>Lowering her head, she saw a tender pink figure was tightly hugging onto her left thigh like Sesame. Using a tone filled with overflowing tenderness, she affectionately said. \u201cI have never seen such a divine-looking woman like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt as though lightning had struck her.</p><br/><p>Ho\u2026 Hoho\u2026 Hohoho\u2026</p><br/><p>She must be dreaming! Definitely!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

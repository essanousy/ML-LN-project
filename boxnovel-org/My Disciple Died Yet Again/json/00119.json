A moment later, as though a projected image was formed, a small-sized white figure appeared above the jade pendant. With that habitual cold-looking face of his, he looked at his disciple who was feebly lying on the table. He could not help but reach out his hand to stroke her head, yet, what he could touch was merely empty air. His voice unconsciously softened a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao curled her lips. \u201cDisciple\u2019s heart is broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan blanked. His softened expression earlier, suddenly became stern, and was even faintly emitting out a cold aura. A broken heart? When had she ever been attached to someone else?</p><br/><p>Hence, his cold aura\u2026 filled the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s hand trembled. Did he have to suddenly become this frightening? \u201cI\u2019m talking about my disciple. My disciple! That little girl you helped me take in back then. Your grand disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan paused for a moment, and his cold aura instantly dispersed completely. With a disinterested attitude, he responded. \u201cMn.\u201d Grand disciple or whatever, did not seem to be related to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cInitially, I saved a child. Seeing that he and Yu Luo mutually liked each other, I handed her to him.\u201d Zhu Yao recalled the matter back then, and faintly began to feel that she was a little too rash. Initially, she had thought that there would be another time to watch over their relationship, but she had never expected that after this indulgence of hers, a thousand years would pass. \u201cBut now, that child had actually begun to like another woman.\u201d According to little radish\u2019s description, that third-party was even saved by Wu Song himself.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. \u201cSince he was already in a relationship, why would he like another woman?\u201d This was a little absurd to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that he merely sees Yu Luo as his sister.\u201d After his so-called true love appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuses.\u201d Yu Yan coldly said.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but leak out a bitter laugh. She had never expected that her master, who was initially a person without much EQ, would be able to see that the person in question had merely used an excuse to cover up his change of heart. Yet, her own disciple was unable to see it clearly herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan lightly spoke. \u201cCastrate him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuh kuh kuh\u2026 Zhu Yao choked from his words. With a dumbfounded expression, she looked at that certain person with a \u2018naturally\u2019 face. Master, what did you say? What happened to your icy and cool image?</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 Fine then. As expected, they were master and disciple alright. \u201cBut\u2026 This is after all Yu Luo\u2019s matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat him up to the point he\u2019s unable to tend to himself in life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake away his virginity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Master, tell me. Where did you learn these things from, hey? Return me my icy, cool and pure master!</p><br/><p>Yet, he simply turned his head slowly, and glanced at her. His eyes were basically saying: Didn\u2019t you threaten me the same way as well?</p><br/><p>She was guilty alright!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao covered up with a few coughs, and only then did she finally regain her reason in front of her master who had already turned completely handsome to her. \u201cActually, I wish to have master teach me about refining weapons.\u201d Initially, she had only wanted to complain to her master about the bitterness she was feeling, but who would have known that they would drift from the main topic so quickly? It\u2019s still best to go back to the main situation at hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeapon refinement?\u201d Yu Yan frowned. \u201cRight now, you should be raising your cultivation in order to ascend as fast as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still young, after all.\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled. Unknowingly, she had once again found herself going back to that earlier argument. However, she then recalled that shadow. \u201cMaster, didn\u2019t you say that the reason why that shadow is accompanying Mu Meiyan, is due to the blood contract which it had sighed with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Yu Yan nodded. \u201cThe blood contract coexists with the former owner. While the five elemental arts may be capable of bringing it harm to a certain degree, most of it will be affected on the host. Likely, that person had definitely tampered with the host, and before he disperses, he will exterminate everything that\u2019s able to harm him. Hence, for now he\u2019s unable to separate himself from the host\u2019s body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about forcefully separating them from the outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan blanked, as though he was shocked by her thoughts. A moment later, he replied. \u201cAlthough separating from the exterior looks possible, with the mystic tools of this world, even a mystic tool created by the sharpest Profound Glacier Metal might not be able to bring out any effects. While divine tools are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I wish to try.\u201d She had already decided. Mu Meiyan\u2019s biggest cheat was that shadow of hers, and it was also the key to her turning into a bug. So what if she was reincarnated? What reincarnated was her soul, and not her abilities. Zhu Yao simply couldn\u2019t believe that Yue Hanxin who won her completely in her past life, would not be able to suppress her.</p><br/><p>She had once thought of using the method her master had spoken of to quickly raise her cultivation. After all, she was basically unable to block against even a single attack from that shadow, hence, she had no choice but to raise her abilities, in order to have a chance of going against it. However, no matter how much she was to cultivate, she did not have the confidence of possessing the strength to defeat it before her ascension. Also, according to the information revealed by her master, even the people from the Higher Realm, would feel a certain degree of fear towards that shadow. So how could she believe that she would be able to possess strength that was much stronger than a Deity of the Higher Realm, merely from harsh training done in a short period of time?</p><br/><p>Since she was unable to defeat it head-on, then she could only do it with some intelligent tricks.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to tell Yu Yan her plans, the door was suddenly pushed open. A blue figure instantly came leaping through the door, and pounced into Zhu Yao\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying?\u201d Zhu Yao looked at the little boy who had already tightly hugged onto her, and was a little speechless. With a wave of her hand, she kept her master\u2019s jade pendant back into her storage ring.</p><br/><p>Only then did Yu Yao came rushing over, a hint of embarrassment flashed past her face. \u201cMaster, Yue Ying, he\u2026 wanted to find you no matter what. I couldn\u2019t stop him at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a long sigh, and her head momentarily ached. This little boy couldn\u2019t have a mother complex, right? Ever since they returned, he had been sticking next to her, and he wouldn\u2019t leave even for a mere moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Yu Yao, go and practice your arts. I will have a talk with him.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t do for it to like this. She was about to head into isolation to learn about weapon refinement. One could not afford to be distracted while refining. And, in order to create a single mystic tool, it\u2019s common to stay isolated for one or two years. So how would she have the time to look after him at every given moment?</p><br/><p>Bending her waist, she hugged Yue Ying up, and placed him on the wooden bed next to her. Then, she grabbed a chair over, and sat in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, I have something that I need to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yet, Yue Ying looked as though he hadn\u2019t heard her. Waving his hands about, he wanted to pounce into her embrace, yet, he did not make a single sound.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao recall that he had yet to learn how to speak. So how was she going to communicate with him, hey?</p><br/><p>\u201cYue. Ying!\u201d Zhu Yao straightened him up, and pointed to his small chest. She decided that it was best to first begin by teaching him how to speak.</p><br/><p>He tilted his head, and his little face was still as expressionless. Evidently, he had yet to understand.</p><br/><p>Alright then. Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened, and she turned her hand to point at herself. \u201cMy name is Zhu\u2026 Yao. Zhiwuuu Yauu. Zhu\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying was still as blank as ever, while his lips twitched. As though he had finally understood something, he let out a \u201cYawu\u201d a moment later.</p><br/><p>Probably because it\u2019s been a long time before he started to speak, his voice was especially hoarse. If she did not hear him carefully, it would have simply been too unclear to make out what he was saying.</p><br/><p>Him being willing to speak, was already considered a huge surprise. After all, she was forced to bring him to experience so many gruesome events, she was really afraid that he had developed autism because of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhu\u2026 Yao. Zhu Yao.\u201d Zhu Yao had no choice but to repeat it over and over to teach him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYawu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao. Yauuu, Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYawu\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s Yao.\u201d Zhu Yao kissed him out of excitement. Taking this opportunity to teach him even more, she once again pointed at him. \u201cYue. Ying. Yooou eehh. Inngg. Yue Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time however, Yue Ying did not reply, as though he did not feel anything from his own name at all. Zhu Yao was a little anxious, as she once again pointed at herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhu Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then, pointed at him. \u201cYue Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Silence.</p><br/><p>Do you really not like your own name at all? Zhu Yao had no choice, and could only start teaching from the basics. \u201cMy name is Zhu Yao. I\u2019m older than you, so you have to call me big sis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yao.\u201d He still only knew how to say that one word.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, big sis.\u201d Zhu Yao still kept her finger pointed at herself. \u201cBig\u2026 sis.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying frowned, and only a moment later did the corner of his lips twitch. \u201cZis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSis!\u201d Zhu Yao once again corrected him, and slowed down her words. \u201cBig. Sis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSis.\u201d He finally spoke with the correct pronunciation, though his tone was still a little strange.</p><br/><p>Though, Zhu Yao was already very satisfied. In just a short moment, he had learnt two words. Hence, she decided to help him consolidate what he had learnt. \u201cFollow what I say. Big sis Zhu Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig. Sis. Zhu. Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying this time was really agitated. The corner of his lips twitched for a couple of times, before he slowly spit out two words. \u201cSis\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 flips table \u2013 Who are you scolding?</p><br/><p>You\u2019re a prostitute! Your entire family is made up of prostitutes!\u00b9</p><br/><p>After not speaking for so long, how could he scold someone the moment he spoke? Zhu Yao suddenly had the thought of wanting to move a boulder and smash it on her own leg. And\u2026 it hurt a little as well.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been two days since Zhu Yao returned. Yu Luo looked pretty happy on the exterior, however, sad creases could be occasionally seen in between her brows. Zhu Yao knew that she had yet to walk out of her failed relationship with Wu Song, so Zhu Yao could only occasionally pass the mission of taking care of Yue Ying to her. This way, she could have her think of something else, and not have her constantly wallow herself in depression.</p><br/><p>Today, Zhu Yao decided to bring her over to Zi Mo\u2019s. After all, they were little radish\u2019s parents, and they could perhaps provide her with some guidance.</p><br/><p>Although, to her, Zi Mo was a friend she had not seen for merely a few days, but in actual fact, it had already been more than a thousand years. Zi Mo still had that old man look, but the spiritual energy being emitted from his body, was not as condensed as before.</p><br/><p>As she looked, Zhu Yao\u2019s heart squeezed. She could sense that he did not have much time left. The lifespan of a Nascent Soul practitioner was limited, however, because Zi Mo had spent too much of his time on the matters regarding the Sect, he had not been breaking through into a Demigod.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at the reunited family of three. Their faces were filled with joy, however, she felt a little bitterness in her heart. Though, Zi Mo seemed to especially happy that she had returned. \u201cLittle martial aunt, you\u2019re finally back. Ancient Hill Sect finally has three Demigod Sovereigns again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree?\u201d Shouldn\u2019t it be four?</p><br/><p>Zi Mo revealed a regretful expression, and sighed. He explained. \u201cLittle martial aunt doesn\u2019t know of this, but two hundred years ago, Sovereign Yi Ran fell after attempting the Lightning Tribulations of Ascension. And coincidentally, you were missing\u2026\u201d Zi Mo did not continue, however, his thoughts did not have to be conveyed with words. The reason why Ancient Hill Sect held its current standing as the number one Sect in the cultivation world, was largely due to the four Demigod Sovereigns present in the Sect. However, when four of them had suddenly halved, it was indeed a pretty big blow in regards to the Ancient Hill Sect.</p><br/><p>Recalling Yi Ran, Zhu Yao did not have too big of an impression of him. She simply remembered that he was a very kind middle-aged man. When he appeared, he would usually sit on his jade lotus. She did not really have an overly deep relationship, yet, she never expected that in a blink of eye, he had already fallen.</p><br/><p>Compared to him, Zhu Yao could not help but feel a little shameful. As the Demigod Sovereign of Ancient Hill Sect, she had merely carried the title, and had yet to really do anything for the Sect at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle martial aunt, I wonder what plans you have from now on?\u201d Zi Mo asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI plan to go into isolation for a period of time.\u201d From now on, if she did not need to leave the Ancient Hill Sect, then it\u2019s best for her to stay here as much as possible.</p><br/><p>As expected, Zi Mo revealed a hint of joy. \u201cNaturally, it\u2019s great that little martial aunt is able to stay within the Sect. According to reports, Celestial Indus Sect currently has two Demigod Sovereigns as well, and was tied to our Sect. Now that little martial aunt has returned, naturally, there isn\u2019t a need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celestial Indus Sect? Wasn\u2019t that the Sect Mu Meiyan was in? It seemed like things went according with the scenario, and Qi Han had broken through into a Demigod.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was planning to hear the details, a disciple suddenly came in to make a report. The Sect Master and disciples of Azureflight Sect wish to seek an audience.</p><br/><p>Azureflight Sect\u2019s\u2026 Sect Master? What kind of joke was this?</p><br/><p>\u00b9Sis Yao or Yao Jie, in Chinese, often refers to prostitutes in the ancient times.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

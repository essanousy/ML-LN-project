All of the enemy bugs had all been captured and locked behind bars.</p><br/><p>From that day on, time seemed to flow especially quickly. Using the reason of sending the wedding invitation cards, Shao Bai brought her around every corner of the world, and even to where the Dragon and Qilin races resided. She met many old friends, every single person that she had met ever since she transmigrated. Even though they clearly lived in different worlds, they seemed to have all gathered together here in an instant. Furthermore, the Three Realms were experiencing peace and harmony. Other than the occasional harassments from the Devil race, the life here was considerably calm.</p><br/><p>Everything in the world was becoming perfect, as though there was no longer an endless stream of bugs to fix. There was thus no need for her to die and resurrect again. Master, Little Radish, everyone in Ancient Hill Sect, Little Sixth, Little Eighth, all of the people of the Phoenix race, even Little Tyrant, Ye Qingcang, the Little Qings of the dandelion race and Mushmush. All of them had appeared in their best state in this present life of hers. There was no need for her to fuss about anything, and she merely had to peacefully and calmly wait to be married to the person she loved.</p><br/><p>Everything was really perfect. So perfect, it felt as if everything that happened in the past had never occurred. However\u2026 It was just too perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, little sister.\u201d Shao Bai reached out for her hand. \u201cYour practitioner-pair ceremony is about to begin. Sovereign is waiting for you. Let second elder brother bring you over to the celebratory hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>His smile was especially brilliant, and his entire body was emitting out a sunny glow which made people feel warm and fuzzy. It was as if as long as she reached out her hand, she would be able to hold onto the entire world. Zhu Yao however blanked while staring at his slender and long fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Are you afraid?\u201d Shao Bai took a step forward and directly held onto her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. If he dares to bully you, then let your second elder brother know. Second elder brother will always stand by your side and protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were sincere. Though they carried some intentions of teasing behind them, every single word of his was serious and true. It was as if she was looking at the second elder brother that came to fetch her from the bunch of large rocs. \u201cLittle sister, let me bring you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai pulled her and was planning to walk her out, but Zhu Yao did not budge.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>She raised her head and stared intensely at Shao Bai\u2019s familiar face, till a slight sense of anxiety that could not be easily detected flashed across his eyes. Only then did she slowly retract her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Shao Bai turned around and looked at her with the usual smile, though his eyes were a little anxious.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath. \u201cShao Bai, thank you! You will always be second elder brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stiffened for a moment, and then immediately recovered his usual demeanour. \u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you spouting? I\u2019m naturally your second elder brother. It\u2019s your bid day today, if we don\u2019t head off now, we will miss the auspicious time.\u201d As he said that, he once again reached out his hand to pull her, but Zhu Yao dodged it this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond elder brother.\u201d Zhu Yao raised her head and looked deep into his eyes. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve always\u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted to tell you something.\u201d She paused for a moment, and then said with emphasis on every word. \u201cSecond elder brother, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m not a good little sister. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t save you. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I wasn\u2019t able to find a better path for the God race. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 It\u2019s my fault for making you turn towards the side of the Devils. Back then\u2026 when I activated the World Crossing Door, I initially wanted to save all of you. However, the outcome of the world crossing\u2026 did not seem to be as perfect as I thought it would.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw Little Eighth!\u201d He\u2026 didn\u2019t have a good time. The others\u2026 don\u2019t seem to have a good time either!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister\u2026\u201d The smile on his face had stiffened. He finally caught her hand, but his was faintly trembling a little. \u201cYou\u2026 What kind of nonsense are you spouting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure now. Was it right for me to have forcefully sent all of you into the Three Realms?\u201d Zhu Yao took a deep breath and suppressed the sense of fatigue in the depths of her heart. \u201cHowever\u2026 I didn\u2019t have any other choice back then. If I simply let all of you stay in that collapsed world, most likely, none of you will even have the chance to reincarnate. This is simply too unfair for all of you, who have always been suppressed by the Devil race! That\u2019s why\u2026 even if I was wrong, I don\u2019t regret my decision!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 You\u2019re the only guilt that I have.\u201d A hint of pain surfaced in the depths of her heart. \u201cSometimes, I wondered if I\u2019ve clearly told you all of the causes and effects, would things be different? That way, he wouldn\u2019t have turned towards the side of the Devils, and maybe\u2026 just like Little Eighth, I would have been able to meet him again in another world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 He won\u2019t.\u201d He replied solemnly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s right, he won\u2019t! Given his personality, most likely, he won\u2019t simply stand idly by and watch me die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister\u2026\u201d He stepped forward and grasped her hand tightly, his face was filled with anxiety. \u201cAren\u2019t things good right now? Is this really bad? Can\u2019t we stay like this forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d She nodded heavily. Looking at him for a short moment, she then said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just too perfect, to the point where\u2026\u201d Everything is just too unrealistic.</p><br/><p>His expression instantly paled.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Zhu Yao thought that this place was just an illusory realm. However, she had tried to use arts to break through it, but they were all ineffective. After that, she then thought that it was some sort of illusion art. However, everyone here was clearly behaving and acting the same way as they were in reality. Finally, she thought that this was her heart demon. However, the so-called heart demon would simply expose all of the perfect things in her heart, and then give her the final fatal blow. However, she had stayed here for so long, yet she didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit of evil intentions. Instead, things were so perfect that one could sink into it, as if this place was trying to keep her here through all means possible. More importantly, she clearly knew what her own heart demon was, and it was far from what she was seeing here. Not to mention, back then, Realmspirit had given her a heart demon barrier.</p><br/><p>That was why everything was was unreasonable, except for\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is indeed really great.\u201d Zhu Yao grasped back onto the person in front of her instead. \u201cUnfortunately, everything here isn\u2019t real. I am no longer Little Seventh of the Phoenix clan, and you\u2026 are no longer my second elder brother Shao Bai. The past in the past, and it can never return. Don\u2019t you think so\u2026 Yue Ying?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was stunned, and then, the light in his eyes instantly extinguished, turning misty and dull. Something seemed to be slowly collapsing as tears flowed out just like that. The tears fell onto her arm, filled with the pain of heartburn. \u201cBig sis\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything that happened here was not her heart demon, but Yue Ying\u2019s.</p><br/><p>The scenery in the surroundings instantly began to distort and change. Ancient Hill Sect disappeared. The Parasol Tree began to collapse, as though it was returning to the day where the world of the God race was being destroyed. The heaven and earth was in chaos, and the place was filled with the cries of the three God races as one enormous figure after another fell from the sky.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the ground turned into a barren wasteland. Corpses filled the place, piling up like a mountain. She once again looked at the entirely red bones. She finally figured out that those were actually the bones of a dead Phoenix.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying. You\u2019re Yue Ying.\u201d Zhu Yao looked at the person in front of her who had reverted back to Yue Ying\u2019s appearance. \u201cYou\u2019re not Shao Bai, and I\u2019m not Little Seventh either. Do not be trapped in your past life again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying raised his head, tears were still flowing down his face. However, he suddenly laughed out, his laughter was filled with chilling intent. \u201cYue Ying? If I\u2019m Yue Ying\u2026 Will big sis Yao forgive me? Even if I admit my wrongs, and no longer make big sis angry, will you\u2026 believe me again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to be Yue Ying.\u201d He shook his head strongly, as if he had descended in some form of madness. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be abandoned! I\u2019m Shao Bai\u2026 I shall be big sis Yao\u2019s second elder brother, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. So this was his heart demon. Because of her\u2026 he even wanted to kill off his own existence?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Yao.\u201d He tugged her sleeves a little anxiously. \u201cLook at me, I won\u2019t be Yue Ying anymore. I\u2019m Shao Bai\u2026 Yue Ying made you angry, Yue Ying had done many bad things. But\u2026 Shao Bai will never do it. In the future, I will never make you angry again, so don\u2019t ignore me anymore, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really changing now.\u201d His hand was shaking, as if he was grasping onto that final bit of hope. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill Wang Xuzhi. I began to treat the people next to you well. I even protected Sesame when we crossed worlds. In the future\u2026 In the future, I will still continue to learn how to become a good person. The things that big sis Yao won\u2019t allow me to do, I won\u2019t do them\u2026 I\u2026 I won\u2019t even be Yue Ying, alright? In the future, I will be Shao Bai, is that fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s hear ached. Letting out a long sigh, she had no choice but to break apart his heart demon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026 You\u2019re still Yue Ying, not Shao Bai!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hint of light in the depths of his eyes finally extinguished entirely.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>When she opened her eyes again, she saw a familiar white figure carrying an anxious look on his face. \u201cYu\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Zhu Yao was a little startled. \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a heart demon tribulation within the floor-raising light. You sank into your heart demon, and it has been a month since then.\u201d Yu Yan explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cA month!\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. When she recalled about the matters concerning the heart demon, she hurriedly turned her head. \u201cWhere\u2019s Yue Ying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan looked towards the right not far from her. When she turned to look, as expected, she saw Yue Ying whose eyes had already opened. However, he was unmoving, and eyes were staring upwards listlessly, as if he had lost a part of his soul.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. After hesitating for a moment, she could not help but walk over and sit next to him. Though she did not know how she had entered his heart demon, there were some things that shouldn\u2019t be dragged on.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not have any reaction, and simply maintained the same posture.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lie to myself, and I can\u2019t lie to you. \u201c\u2026 really can\u2019t forgive you.\u201d Zhu Yao sighed heavily. \u201cEverything that you\u2019ve done, I\u2019m really, really angry about them. I really wish that I could give you two big slaps and no longer see you ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d His hands that were by his sides slowly curled into balls.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026 After calming down and thinking back about it, how can I not have the slightest bit of responsibility in everything that you\u2019ve done?\u201d She looked sternly at his face. \u201cI treated you as my little brother, and I had used up all my power to teach you everything, but you were never able to learn them. Furthermore, you began to stray even further away. At the same time I despaired about you, how can I not be disappointed in myself? When a child isn\u2019t taught properly, it\u2019s not just because he or she is born stupid, but rather, there are some problems with the way education is brought to that child as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying was stunned. He finally had some sort of reaction, as he slowly turned his head over.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao then stroked his head and continued. \u201cBut Yue Ying\u2026 When you\u2019re wrong, you\u2019re wrong. I admit that I didn\u2019t teach you well, but everything that you\u2019ve done are indeed unforgivable. Even now, I still can\u2019t find myself to forgive you. Big sis is human, and big sis\u2019s heart is made of flesh as well. It can\u2019t take your constant beatings. When my disappointment for you turned into despair\u2026 I no longer had the courage to continue teaching you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Yue Ying\u2026 Why don\u2019t you be the one who show me this time?\u201d Zhu Yao retracted her hand, and said with a serious look. \u201cYou said that you already know your wrongs, and is changing your ways. You said that you no longer want to be Yue Ying of the past. I don\u2019t have the courage to believe you right now, so why don\u2019t you show it to me? Let me see just how you\u2019ve changed. From today on, I will no longer avoid you, and I won\u2019t ignore your existence. However\u2026 You are no longer my little brother either. Let us begin right from the start as strangers. Let us witness just how great you have become. This courage of trust, give it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig\u2026 sis\u2026 Yao.\u201d His eyes began to grow distant, and were being covered by mist little by little.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath, reached out a hand and said. \u201cHello, nice to meet you. I\u2019m Zhu Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tears instantly flowed, pouring out like flood. He hurriedly stood up and stuffed his head into her embrace, crying out loud. It was as if he was letting out all of the grievances, joy, discomfort and guilt. He was gasping for air as he cried, and the same words were constantly being uttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig\u2026 sis\u2026 big\u2026 sis\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

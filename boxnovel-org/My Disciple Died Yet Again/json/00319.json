Gathering his earlier smile, he stepped forward and looked at the mystic artifact in Hua Lin\u2019s hand. Then, he said. \u201cWhat can one mystic artifact prove? Is there a mark on it that can possibly prove her words?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, even Hua Lin could not help but frown. \u201cWhen I say this mystic artifact is something she refined, naturally, it is refined by her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Fu still did believe it. \u201cI simply feel that it doesn\u2019t look too realistic for a tenth rank extreme grade mystic artifact to appear. Furthermore, since she\u2019s a tenth rank artificer, she can\u2019t possibly have only made a single mystic artifact, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wish to look at my other products?\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that junior-martial sister can give me some pointers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Zhu Yao asked once more.</p><br/><p>Wu Fu frowned, and still nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine then!\u201d Zhu Yao sighed. \u201cActually, back then when I was still in Skybond Peak, I had refined several mystic artifacts, but I did not bring them along with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Fu\u2019s expression turned joyous, evidently not believing her words as he said in a mocking manner. \u201cNow that sure is unfortunate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s tone changed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not being held onto by someone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Wu Fu\u2019s expression changed. At that moment, he had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, I did not bring out even a single one of the items that I have refined, and left them all in Skybond Peak.\u201d Zhu Yao looked at the crowd. \u201cAfter so many years, I believe there should be one or two disciples in the sect who have fancied my mystic artifacts, and have tried to keep and use them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you\u2019re saying that some of the mystic artifacts in Skybond Peak are refined by you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t believe me, but back then, I learnt of an interesting formation, and had thus inscribed it into the mystic artifacts. If one wish to use one of these artifacts, he or she needs to first chant an incantation. We will be certain one I chant out this incantation.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Zhu Yao did not care about his changing expression, and immediately shouted out loud within the hall. \u201cCheng Qingdiao, you sick-ass pervert!\u201d</p><br/><p>When her words fell, flashes of light appeared one after another. Dozens of mystic artifacts instantly flew up and floated in the air, emitting a white radiance that looked as if they were responding to her call. Even a bell-like eighth rank defensive mystic artifact had flown out of Wu Fu\u2019s storage pouch.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned to glance at him, and chuckled. \u201cIt seems senior-martial brother Wu Fu likes the mystic artifacts I refined as well. Oh right, do you want me to repeat the basic functionalities of these mystic artifacts, and their respective construction methods? After all, you even carried one with you for so long, but this is the first time you have heard of it\u2019s activation incantation, so it being inconvenient at times is inevitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Fu\u2019s expression was instantly dyed in green, looking especially fascinating. He no longer let out a single croak.</p><br/><p>The various clans and sects were now looking at the people of Ness Cesary Sect differently. They were clearly using the artifacts that she had refined, yet they were instead biting her back and accusing her of theft. This course of action by Ness Cesary Sect was truly shameless.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not intend to shame Ness Cesary Sect at first either, after all, this sect was once her former home. However, Wu Fu continued to bite on her without letting go, which infuriated her a little. Furthermore, that Skybond Peak had almost killed the demons in Tranquil Valley. Little Eighth had even expended all of the godly energy he managed to gathered so far because of this matter, and had yet to wake up even now.</p><br/><p>As for those mystic artifacts, they were indeed refined by her. Back then, when she came out of the dimensional space, though Little Eighth had resurrected, at the bottom of her heart, she still hated that pervert Cheng Qingdiao. Thus, out of boredom, she secretly learnt from Wang Shang and refined a bunch of mystic artifacts, while inscribing this incantation, which taught by her master, within them. However, who would have expected that the mystic artifacts she refined would actually be more popular that the original products in Skybond Peak. These Nascent Soul and Demigod practitioners of Ness Cesary Sect actually hauled them in.</p><br/><p>As someone who was so cooperative in digging his own grave, Wu Fu could be considered the best in this aspect in the cultivation world.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign, how do you think we should deal with this matter concerning the heretic practitioners?\u201d The crowd finally circled back to the matter at hand. Probably because they found out that she was tenth rank artificer, there were now faint hints of them seeing her as a leader figure, as they began to ask for her opinion.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had thought about this. \u201cI feel that no matter the decision to fight or rest, there is a need to first find out who are the culprits behind the destruction of Office Shell Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd nodded. Indeed, finding the true culprits were indeed the most important task.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026 Countless Office Shell Sect disciples have already lost their lives, and those who were fortunate to survive had all turned insane\u2026 With our chain of clues broken, I\u2019m afraid that no one else had seen the looks of the culprits\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might not be the case!\u201d Office Shell Sect Master Gu suddenly stood up, as though he had just thought of something. With an excited look, he said. \u201cI recall that there\u2019s a piece of Visual Recording Stone at the core of the Great Mountain Barrier Formation. It\u2019s usually above the formation core, and because it\u2019s required to supply the formation with spiritual energy, it has never been activated. However, the assault of the heretic practitioners had coincidentally destroyed the Great Mountain Barrier Formation. With the destruction of the formation, the spiritual energy from the Visual Recording Stone which could no longer supply the formation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re meaning to say that this Visual Recording Stone might have recorded everything that happened back then?\u201d The crowd instantly revealed excited faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the Visual Recording Stone isn\u2019t destroyed!\u201d Sect Master Gu nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring us to the formation core!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately pulled onto Sect Master Gu and left. The crowd exchanged glances and then immediately followed after them. Even the Demigod practitioners at the back were keeping up as well. Wu Fu\u2019s eyes sank, and had no choice but to go along with the crowd.</p><br/><p>As Zhu Yao flew over, she could already see the so-called Visual Recording Stone mentioned by Sect Master Gu, from afar. How could that possibly be a stone? It was clearly a stone wall! It was no wonder Office Shell Sect would use such a common material as a formation core. It was a shattered mountaintop, and the rock on the broken wall of the mountain was a piece of Visual Recording Stone. Furthermore, it was pointing right at Office Shell Sect.</p><br/><p>Sect Master Gu inspected it carefully for a moment. Other than a few traces of blood on it, it did not sustain much damage. Thus, he quickly cast an art and inserted it into the stone wall. A bright light flashed, and there was a blurry image appearing faintly behind it. The image grew clearer with each second. It was the exact recording on the day of the sect massacre.</p><br/><p>The crowd could not help but watch carefully with widened eyes, afraid that they would miss some sort of detail.</p><br/><p>When they managed to clearly see the situation behind the screen, the crowd was dumbfounded. They were simply unable to believe their own eyes. Some were even beginning to rub their own eyes, wondering if they had been mistaken.</p><br/><p>Behind the screen, corpses filled the land and blood flowed like rivers, just like what they had seen when they arrived before. The only strange thing about this was\u2026 there wasn\u2019t a single heretic practitioner!</p><br/><p>Forget about heretic practitioners, not a single villain-like figure could be seen. The place was filled with just Office Shell Sect disciples. They were actually\u2026 killing one another!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, there were even occasional glows of self-destruction, and every single one of them had crazed looks on their faces, shouting something at the top of their lungs. Unfortunately, the Visual Recording Stone was unable to record sounds.</p><br/><p>The person who was the most shocked was no doubt Sect Master Gu. He had turned numb from astonishment!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? An internal conflict?\u201d Someone expressed his doubts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely impossible!\u201d Sect Master Gu quickly shook his head. \u201cMy sect has always been harmonious, how could an internal conflict possibly occur? Furthermore, look at these two over there. One of them is Elder Yu, and his opponent is his son who had just formed his Azoth Core\u2026\u201d It was indeed strange that an old man and his son was locked in a battle to the death.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao watched carefully. These people looked a little like\u2026</p><br/><p>She could not help but look at the sky within the displayed image, and her eyes sank. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

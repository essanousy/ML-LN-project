Out of rationality, she still silently lit a row of candles for Mei Xue in her heart. However, immediately after, she could no longer rationalize her thoughts.</p><br/><p>She suddenly recalled. Momma\u2019s egg! How are we going to pass this grass field!? In other words, they were going to encounter those strange flowers beneath the earth as well. Recalling that enormous flower which didn\u2019t even burp after swallowing one of them whole, she could not help but tremble. She wondered if it was too late for them to make a retreat?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strange flowers and plants underneath the earth are definitely not limited to just that breed earlier.\u201d Zhonggu Lu\u2019s expression was especially terrible to look at. \u201cAlso, I can sense that these flowers most likely possess sentience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSentience.\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re saying those earlier were all flower spirits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu nodded, a hint of doubt surfaced on his expression once more. \u201cI\u2019m a Plant Immortal, so I can naturally sense them. However, those flower spirits are a little different from flower spirits that cultivate normally. They seemed to be even more\u2026 violent than the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest were all stunned for a moment. Spirits that were formed by plants usually had gentler and warmer personalities. After all, plants were creatures that were the hardest to develop sentience with. Also, compared to human practitioners and demonic beasts, they needed an extremely long time to grow, and they were not able to even move in their preliminary stages. That was why they would not develop any impatience, let alone violence.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake that Lasting Flower for example. Formerly, it\u2019s a Resident Flower. Only after developing sentience would it mutate into a Lasting Flower.\u201d Zhonggu Lu explained. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s extremely hard for such flowers to grow, and so it\u2019s extremely rare for one to cultivate into a spirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank. Suddenly, she thought of something. \u201cThen what are those three man-eater flowers called? Do you know what effects they have on practitioners?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu\u2019s expression changed, and he lamented in dissatisfaction. \u201cYou Deity practitioners are really\u2026 Why do you all first think of their effects when spiritual herbs are brought up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care about that right now, just tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other breed must be the Heavenly Immortal Herb.\u201d Zhonggu Lu pouted, but he still answered. \u201cThough, the Heavenly Immortal Herbs are usually spiritual herbs that would only grow up to a few inches tall. I wonder why they could become so big. As for what effects they have on practitioners, I don\u2019t know either. I\u2019ve never eaten them anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResident Flowers can be used to refine the Immortal Pellet.\u201d Yu Yan suddenly said. \u201cThis pellet can resurrect a dead person and allow his or her bones and flesh to regrow. As long as his soul does not dissipate, no matter how severe his injuries are, they can all be restored in just a single incense worth of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, it\u2019s that overpowered?</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the Heavenly Immortal Herbs, it can be used to refine Realm Crossing Pellets. Taking one will enable a practitioner\u2019s cultivation to immediately improve by a large realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA large realm!\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cIn other words, in the Lower Realm, if our initial cultivation is at the Nascent Soul stage, eating it will allow one to immediately become a Demigod? And if one is a Demigod, then he or she can immediately ascend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same in the Divine Realm as well.\u201d He added. \u201cThis is a divine herb in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. \u201cThough, the recipes for these two pellets have long disappeared. I\u2019ve never heard of someone capable of refining it in the Divine Realm, let alone the Lower Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this Mei Xue\u2019s cheat? She could refine Realm Crossing Pellets and immediately raise her level. This cheat was much more incredible than hers. It was no wonder her level was 1 while the others were all at level 2 when they first met in the second floor. Most likely, her cultivation had all come from eating pellets and medicine. Her foundation was not stable, and coincidentally, Lightning Divine Tower forbid dru- ah pui, forbid taking herbs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly, have you thought of something?\u201d Nangong Cheng took a step forward and said. \u201cShare it with us so that we can come up with plans together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt like crying. \u201cI just thought that, if this floor is truly the tribulation of karma, then all of the plants here are most likely materialized by the pellets that we\u2019ve eaten before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026 It can\u2019t be!\u201d Nangong Cheng was a little anxious. Who wouldn\u2019t eat pellets or medicine all their path of cultivation? Even Zhonggu Lu, a Flower Deity, had swallowed high-ranking spiritual herbs in order to raise his cultivation as well. \u201cAren\u2019t spiritual herbs supposed to be sentienceless? Also, when we gather them, we\u2019ve never met any resistance either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already mentioned that they\u2019re spiritual herbs.\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes. \u201cThat proves that they must contain spiritual and divine energies. Where do they come from? Do you think they would enter these herbs by themselves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople with divine or spiritual energies in their bodies can be considered practitioners. Then, plants with divine or spiritual energies, can also be considered as sentient spirits. Though, the differences would simply lie in how long it has been since they blossom.\u201d The same logic applied to how demonic beasts would have higher level of intelligence as their ranks increased. \u201cAlso, all pellets and medicines possess their own pellet poison, and this applies to divine herbs as well. Theoretically speaking, the bodies of spiritual herbs contain the purest divine or spiritual energies, so they should be able to take in energy just like spirit stones. Then why would they contain poison? And where does the poison come from? Could the so-called pellet poison is actually the final retribution by those herbs that had just awoken their sentience but has no means to fight back?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group was instantly silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly, from how you\u2019re putting it, I\u2019m starting to feel anxious!\u201d Nangong Cheng\u2019s face instantly drooped down. He glanced at the field of grass before them, and then silently took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d Yu Yan said with a calm look, as he stroked his disciple\u2019s head. \u201cIf this grass field is truly testing one\u2019s karma with spiritual herbs, then we master and disciple have never eaten a single medicinal pellet. I believe passing this stage wouldn\u2019t be hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right!\u201d Zhu Yao said with a enlightened expression. \u201cThen why are we being afraid!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never eaten one either!\u201d Yue Ying immediately raised his hand and expressed himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood job.\u201d Zhu Yao stroked his head.</p><br/><p>Her beating little heart instantly calmed down. She felt rather domineering all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng and Zhonggu Lu: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>We ate them before, hey! Where\u2019s the promised love between teammates? Don\u2019t speak as if you three are the only ones here, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly\u2026\u201d Nangong Cheng pitifully tugged Zhu Yao\u2019s sleeves, and his hand was instantly shoved away by Yue Ying with a scornful look. My big sis\u2019s sleeves is mine! \u201cWhat about us? What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned, and only then did she regain her senses. \u201cOh right! I forgot you guys were still here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>From Mei Xue\u2019s situation earlier, those spiritual herbs seemed to appear based on the amount of aggro accumulated. The more one ate, the more frequent they would appear. \u201cCome, tell us what medicine and pellets you two have eaten. How many flowers have you all destroyed? Just how many youthful spiritual plants have you all harmed altogether?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Why did he feel as if he was a greedy beast now? \u201cNot\u2026 Not\u2026 Not that much?\u201d What\u2019s with this sense of shame I\u2019m feeling all of a sudden? \u201cI\u2019m a Demonic Immortal. You should be aware that demonic beasts don\u2019t know how to refine medicine at all in the Lower Realm. When we encounter spiritual herbs, I would usually swallow them whole.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, you actually swallow them alive!\u201d Before Zhu Yao could even speak, Zhonggu Lu had already retorted. \u201cYou\u2019re so murderous and violent! You\u2019re actually a beast like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, you sound as if you haven\u2019t swallowed one before.\u201d Nangong Cheng glared at his good homosexual buddy. \u201cWhen you first materialized into a human form back then, didn\u2019t you destroy an entire mountain peak worth of spiritual herbs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was subjugation based on my beauty!\u201d Zhonggu Lu praised himself as he stroked his cheeks with his muscular arms. \u201cThat was a battle concerning us Flower Deities, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat battle was a little too intense, don\u2019t you think? After all, you did swallow the flowers, their leaves, and even their roots. More importantly, you didn\u2019t distinguish them by gender, and took them all in. You\u2019re too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe Flower Deities don\u2019t distinguish ourselves based on gender in the first place! We can be either a man or a woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask just how are you a woman with that body of yours?\u201d This daddy here has never seen such a muscular lady before, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still dare to speak of it!? Your race allows you to choose a gender when taking up a human form in the first place. I already told you to become a female beastie, yet you chose to become male! Now that things turn out this way, you\u2019re blaming me for it!?\u201d Who doesn\u2019t know how to argue and fight back, huh?</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it all because you said you can choose your gender when you\u2019re taking up a human form too? Otherwise, do you think things would have turned out this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re clearly the one at fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of three spectators: \u201c\u2026\u201d They seemed to have found out something incredible.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The two\u2019s argument on heartlessness, shamelessness, and nonsense lasted for exactly two hours, and Zhu Yao lost interest after watching for fifteen minutes. With her master and Yue Ying, they inspected the strange grass field before them.</p><br/><p>The matter of throwing aside Nangong Cheng and Zhonggu Lu had never crossed her mind. After all, this tribulation of karma was just a guess she made. Though theoretically speaking, their family\u2026 ah pui! She, her master and Yue Ying had never eaten any pellets, but that did not mean they had never harmed any flowers or herbs. At the very least, she had caused the deaths of many cactuses in the modern era. If this grass field even took that into consideration, they she would be stabbed to death!</p><br/><p>So they still had to look at this from a long-term perspective. However, they walked around the sides a few times, but they did not discover any loopholes. They couldn\u2019t make a detour around either. She immediately squatted next to it and silently dug a hole in the grass field with the size of a face, wanting to find out just what was being hidden underneath. However, it was all but a fruitless effort, as there was nothing to be found. Could these mutated flowers and plants simply like to play tricks? Why not dig a tunnel through then?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere must be something unique hidden in this grass field.\u201d Yu Yan squatted down and held up his disciple\u2019s hands which was still trying to dig even deeper. Then, he filled the hole back. \u201cIt seems it will only activate once we truly take a step into it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d So you\u2019re saying tunnels are useless?</p><br/><p>\u201cMost likely, the things that appear after entering it, are different from person to person.\u201d Yu Yan continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cDifferent from person to person\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re saying there\u2019s a formation underneath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be capable of enveloping such a large grass field, materialize so many strange plants and flowers, and not to mention targeting different people with different plants, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not something formations are able to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLaws.\u201d Yu Yan solemnly said. \u201cOnly the laws of the heaven and earth can see through a person\u2019s everything. And only laws can materialize those unreasonable creatures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLaws of the heaven and earth\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao suddenly thought of Realmspirit. These so-called laws are made by that bastard, aren\u2019t they? Why do I suddenly feel like I\u2019m about to get trolled?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, we can only figure out the situation by entering it.\u201d Yu Yan reached out his hand and held hers, tightening his grip. \u201cThis might be a hard battle. Are you prepared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded heavily. \u201cMn.\u201d Since they were already here, they had to reach the goal no matter what.</p><br/><p>She took a deep breath and held tightly onto her master. Just as she was about to step into the grass field, she suddenly thought of something. She turned to look at the male and male (female and female) leads that were still acting out their drama, and the corner of her lips twitched. She then spoke to the person that had long been waiting next to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, bring them over as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying\u2019s eyes shone and happily raised his leg. With a kick, he sent the two people that were still in a heated argument into the field.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She read about it once in a book, and it said that the scent was comparable to the drool of a dragon. Now, her face really was covered with this dragon\u2019s spittle fragrance, but the only thought she had right now was\u2026</p><br/><p>Puke, puke, puke\u2026</p><br/><p>She felt that she could puke out all of the food she had eaten in her entire lifetime.</p><br/><p>The single dragon who kissed a girl for the first time received 2000 damage, as his glass heart shattered into pieces.</p><br/><p>He silently cast an art blocked the Devil\u2019s attack with all his might. Turning his head back, he said resentfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Seventh, at least save me some face.\u201d Was it really that disgusting? \u201cNo matter the case, we can be considered as acquaintances, right? When you were still an egg, I even visited you a few times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao retched for quite a while, before she finally managed to stop. \u201cI beg you, don\u2019t talk to me right now.\u201d She really did not wish to puke again, alright?</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, she sat in a meditative posture on the ground and began circulating the godly energy within the dragon pearl. Her present character was not a God, and she was basically unable to endure the presence of godly energy in her body. Seemingly in an instant, she could sense that the meridians in her body were like fireworks, popping resoundingly one after another. However, she had no choice but to grit her teeth and continue on.</p><br/><p>Though Aojiang\u2019s barrier was powerful, it could only barely fend against Yan Chi\u2019s attacks. Adding that he had lost the dragon pearl, the source of his godly energy, he was holding on in a very desperate manner.</p><br/><p>Yan Chi seemed to have realized that they seemed to have come up with a plan, and thus put in more effort in his attacks. He no longer maintained his human form and had turned into a mass of constantly shapeshifting black mist. Once, he turned into countless of faces to bite him, then into a twisted-looking strange beast, as though he was acting in a horror film with an extremely high production budget value.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Seventh, hurry up, I can\u2019t hold on much longer.\u201d Cold sweat was already dripping off from Aojiang\u2019s head. The barrier was growing weaker, and now that they were backed in a corner, he had no choice but to shapeshift back into his dragon form, in order to use his gigantic body to block Yan Chi\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao wildly guided the godly energy, and was forming complicated hand seals with her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cHohohoho\u2026\u201d That Devil began to let out a sinister laugh. \u201cAojiang, no matter what you people plan to do, once I have completely merged with this girl who carries incredible luck, none of you will be able to stop me. From now on, the Heavenly Dao shall be rewritten!\u201d</p><br/><p>His laughter grew even louder, yet it carried a bone-piercing chilling intent, causing one\u2019s heart to tremble. The darkness surrounding his body grew even thicker, as though he was merging with Yi Ling\u2019s soul with all his might. Suddenly, his body shook for a moment, and his face began to distort.</p><br/><p>It was slowly dyed with pain, and a moment later, it turned into Yi Ling\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Ling!\u201d Zhu Yao called out. The godly energy in her body began to go into disarray again.</p><br/><p>She seemed to be in extreme pain, and her entire face had turned into a frown. Looking at Zhu Yao from afar, she seemed to have been stunned for a moment. Right after, she murmured out. \u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She still had her own consciousness.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tightened her fists, and for a moment she was a little frustrated. This Devil was truly a motherfucking bastard.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu.\u201d her expression turned even more painful, as though she was resisting against something with all her might. A moment later, she said. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me\u2026 Hurry\u2026 Run!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, if you say such things, this lady here can\u2019t bear to see you die even more. She suddenly recalled when she left Blue Parasol Sect, Yi Ling was also hesitant like this. Most probably, she had already sensed that she was going to be in danger, and had wanted to seek Zhu Yao for protection. However, she still did not speak up in the end.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but feel a hint of guilt at this moment. In the past, because Yi Ling\u2019s Mary Sue trait had left a very deep impression on her, she had habitually avoided her because of it. Ever since she was affected by the World Favourable Impression ability, Zhu Yao never trusted her either. Now that she thought about it, that World Favourable Impression ability really carried the effects of suppressing her Mary Sue cheat.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected that you still held onto your consciousness.\u201d Yan Chi\u2019s face twisted for a moment, and then it reverted back to its former look, as though he had once again suppressed Yi Ling down. The darkness enveloping his body once again thickened.</p><br/><p>There was no time left. If this continued, Yi Ling would be completely killed by him. Zhu Yao gritted her teeth, and took a gamble.</p><br/><p>She immediately turned on the World Favourable Impression ability above her head. If this World Favourable Impression ability could suppress Yi Ling\u2019s luck, then she could most probably use this point to completely remove Yi Ling\u2019s bug.</p><br/><p>Seemingly in an instant, something was transferred in Yan Chi\u2019s direction, and the devillic energy on his body seemed to have receded quite a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Yan Chi was in a fluster, and his figure suddenly shook. A hole seemed to have opened up within the black mist, and a pink figure was struggling to escape from within. Though she was unable to see it, Zhu Yao could sense that Yi Ling\u2019s luck was being transferred over in her direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, how is this possible? How can she possibly escape my control?\u201d Yan Chi released out even more devillic energy, fully enveloping Yi Ling with the intention of trapping her back within his own body. However, it was ineffective. It was as though Yi Ling was being guided by a completely irresistible force towards the direction of the barrier.</p><br/><p>Even Aojiang was staring straight at Zhu Yao, his eyes were filled with sparkles. Seeing Zhu Yao who was already covered in blood from the uncontrollable godly energy, he turned back his gigantic dragon head and annoyingly said. \u201cLittle Seventh, so you phoenixes all look so divine. Are you interested in bearing an egg for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Zhu Yao glared at him, and sent a voice transmission. \u201cAojiang, once the girl with incredible luck completely escapes from the Devil\u2019s grasp, immediately release the barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aojiang was startled for a moment before nodding his head.</p><br/><p>As for Yan Chi, he had already fallen into madness, as he desperately tried to stop Yi Ling from escaping his control, but to no avail. Looking at Zhu Yao within the barrier, as though he had awoken from a dream, his eyes widened like that of a cow\u2019s. \u201cNo\u2026 Impossible. There\u2019s actually still someone with even greater luck in this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry, the World Favourable Impression ability is that overpowered. Zhu Yao calmed herself down, and used all of her willpower to have Yi Ling escape. Yi Ling\u2019s figure was becoming clearer as well.</p><br/><p>Yan Chi realized that he was unable to stop it either and decided to not restrict Yi Ling any longer, instead, he came attacking in Zhu Yao\u2019s direction. At the same time, Yi Ling fell in the direction of the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cAojiang!\u201d Zhu Yao shouted and Aojiang instantly released the barrier.</p><br/><p>Yan Chi had already charged in, and at the same time, Zhu Yao guided out all of the godly energy in the dragon pearl. Her hand seals were complete, and just as the other party was about to approach her, she instantly activated the seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil Smiting Inscription!\u201d In an instant, a ray of light scattered in all directions with Zhu Yao as the source like an exploding fireworks. Everywhere the light went, there weren\u2019t any changes to the anything, though the Devil turned into nothingness the moment he came in contact with it.</p><br/><p>Devil Smiting Inscription. The only art that could completely exterminate Devils.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 This seal is?\u201d Aojiang was stunned, as though he was completely unable to react to what happened. His gigantic head turned about, and he said with a dumbfounded look. \u201cWe\u2026 won?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Zhu Yao merely had a single breath left, and her consciousness were beginning to blur. Turning to look at Yi Ling who fell down not too far away. Her breathing was normal and her face looked really clean as well, there wasn\u2019t any strange writings in it any longer. In an instant, Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>From the beginning, she knew that the moment the Devil Smiting Inscription was activated, she would definitely receive a serious rebound. Even with how tough a God was, one was only able to use it twice, let alone her who was merely a tree demon at the Demigod cultivation level.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she protected a strand of her consciousness at the very last moment. As long as she did not move too rashly, then she would still be able to\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a relief.\u201d Aojiang suddenly shouted excitedly, and then pushing his two feet off the ground, he pounced in her direction. \u201cLittle Seventh!\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, a gigantic dragon-shaped shadow came descending from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over!\u201d</p><br/><p>Splat~~~</p><br/><p>Her entire world turned into darkness\u2026</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>A familiar conversation window once again popped out.</p><br/><p>Crushed to Death by Piggish Party Member Achievement \u2013 Unlocked!</p><br/><p>Congratulations, you have died again. Please select an option.</p><br/><p>[Revive] or [Reincarnate]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>Aojiang, if you have the guts, don\u2019t run away after school ends!</p><br/><p>This was definitely the most ridiculous death of the year, with no competition to speak of!</p><br/><p>The conversation window stopped for two seconds before it flashed again, changing into another row of words.</p><br/><p>User did not select an option, then [Reincarnate] it is! Congratulations, you will soon log into a new version.</p><br/><p>Loading character template\u2026</p><br/><p>10%\u2026</p><br/><p>20%\u2026</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, and she said with a sunken voice. \u201cRealmspirit, stop hiding. Come the hell out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The loading numbers instantly paused. They stopped for exactly a minute, before they flashed and disappeared.</p><br/><p>A familiar QQ conversation window popped out.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Courageous young lady, you have finally taken over the world. Welcome back. The bug fix this time was done too marvelously! I gave you a five-star review, dear friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still dare to say something like that? What\u2019s with that scenario? Not only were there not any images, you even gave me a wrong version?\u201d If she had not guessed everything out at the end and seen through the causes and effects, it would have long been game over for her. \u201cJust a single scenario, did it have to be so brain-draining?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Young lady, calm down! I have said it from the beginning that you would encounter an unprecedented difficulty with the bug this time, didn\u2019t I?</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask, which one of your scenarios did not pose any difficulty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Hohoho\u2026 Don\u2019t mind such details.</p><br/><p>\u201cDetails, your sister!\u201d Zhu Yaoo took a deep breath and suppressed her impulse to beat him up. \u201cAlso, what\u2019s with that World Favourable Impression ability? It\u2019s basically a powerful aphrodisiac, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: That\u2019s actually special treatment. I only gave it to you because we\u2019re so close, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be close with you, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Don\u2019t be so heartless, young lady. Didn\u2019t you use it really well?</p><br/><p>Alright, she had to indeed thank this World Favourable Impression ability, otherwise she would not have been able to deal with Yi Ling this quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe made a deal back then. After fixing this bug, you will tell me everything. It\u2019s time. Tell me, who in the world are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Uh\u2026 Hohoho. Young lady, the weather today is pretty good. Why don\u2019t we chat about something else?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cThe way you\u2019re changing the subject is too obvious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, even if you don\u2019t say it, I have already guessed more than half of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: (\u2299o\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re capable of providing me with unlimited rebirths, and also capable of freely choosing my rebirth targets. Furthermore, you\u2019re even able to provide me with a seemingly heaven-bending ability such as \u201cWorld Favourable Impression\u201d, and not to mention you\u2019re fully aware of all the matters concerning the Three Realms. Let\u2019s not forget the jobs you task me with are all these impossibly high-level missions like saving the world and such.\u201d Zhu Yao took in a deep breath, and continued her analysis. \u201cIn the beginning, I had thought that you were an incredibly powerful ancient God. Thereafter, I realized that when compared to the things that you do, what the Gods are capable of doing are extremely weak, and even they are in the palm of your hand. After that, I thought that you originated from the Realm of Gods. After all, I have never met a true God within the Three Realms and am unaware of their abilities, so naturally I would be led to believe that a God would be capable of doing these things. But currently, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Oh?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zhu Yao thought that her sad exile in the Divine Realm was about to end, the next step was to bind herself to her former body, and from then on, with her master, live a shameless and immoral\u2026 Ah pui! She meant living a blissful and lovely life with her master. However, when they returned to Lightning Divine Palace, she realized her thoughts were truly naive.</p><br/><p>Her soul returned, but\u2026 her avatar had disappeared!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my body?\u201d Did she had to go through something so saddening?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no traces of living people around.\u201d Yu Yan released his divine sense and searched through the entire Lightning Divine Palace. However, he did not find his disciple\u2019s body at all.</p><br/><p>They both turned their heads back and with eyes that were as sharp as blades, looked at a certain someone who left his guard duty.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Yu Jin was dumbfounded as well, and then he weakly took a step back. \u201cShe was here just earlier.\u201d It was not even an hour since he left, how did his little little grand disciple\u2019s body disappear? \u201cThe formation outside has no traces of being activated. Logically speaking, others are unable to enter this place either. It\u2019s impossible for it to disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I disappeared into thin air?\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. I\u2019m an ethanol! I must have vaporized!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle little grand disciple, don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d Yu Jin smiled and said. \u201cI placed a tracking formation on your body. As long as I activate it, we will naturally know where your body is.\u201d</p><br/><p>He threw Xue Yi down and then cast an art that materialized a water mirror that had the height of an adult. He brushed his palm against the surface of the mirror, and after a flash of light, what appeared slowly within the mirror was\u2026 a mass of white fog.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened to the promised security footage? Your wireless technology clearly can\u2019t make it, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s face stiffened, and then chuckled in front of them. \u201cHoho\u2026 This is a miss\u2026 Umm, I suddenly recalled that I was still barbecuing the corn in the backyard! Let\u2019s meet up again later.\u201d After he said that, he ran off, leaving a trail of dust clouds.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Where\u2019s the promised trust between people in the same sect?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d What to do?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. He carefully placed his disciple on the table and glanced at the water mirror that was still as foggy, to the point that nothing could be clearly seen. With a sunken voice, he said. \u201cThe water mirror is unable to display the location, which means that the formation is in a place with extremely great security. This person who has the ability to infiltrate Lightning Divine Palace, bring your body away and leave unharmed, is not simple either. There\u2019s a need to look at this from a long-term perspective.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do I still have to stay as a sword?\u201d Zhu Yao felt like crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the case.\u201d Yu Yan lightly sliced his finger, squeezed out a drop of blood and had it drip onto the blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d In an instant, the smell of blood once again filled her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to puke it out, she stopped. She had no choice but to fight back the discomfort and swallow it. In an instant, the discomfort disappeared. Instead, familiar divine energy began to pour into her, and she felt that her blade had lightened quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan cast an art, causing a formation to flash past. The row of symbols on her blade suddenly began to gather, slowing converging at the bottom of the hilt. When the light of the formation finally scattered away, a familiar lightning cloud mark appeared. It was the mark of Lightning Divine Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Just as Zhu Yao was about to ask, the blade suddenly emit out a white light. She felt that her entire being was floating up, and when she regained her senses, she was already standing next to the table, while the sword was still on the table. She subconsciously wanted to touch the sword on the table, but unexpectedly, the moment she touched the blade, her fingers passed through it. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Did she return to the soul state?</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao. This sword is not your main body.\u201d Yu Yan spoke up solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot my main body!\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cThen, I was possessing this sword?\u201d When did a second rank divine sword become so incredible? It actually had the capabilities to lure in souls.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re a part of this sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a sword spirit of this sword right now.\u201d He glanced at the sword on the table. \u201cThe reason why you weren\u2019t able to leave the sword earlier, was because you had insufficient divine energy, thus you weren\u2019t able to maintain your appearance. Earlier, I inserted divine energy into your body, which aided you in manifesting your corporeal form.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered deeply for a moment. This was actually quite plausible. Back then when she was picked up by Miao Bo, he couldn\u2019t hear her talk at all. After that, she was thrown into the sea and suddenly others could hear her, and right before that, she had indeed taken in a lot of divine energy that leaked out of Miao Bo\u2019s body in that mysterious Secret Realm. In the end, the reason why people couldn\u2019t hear her was because she had insufficient battery.</p><br/><p>Eh? Wait a minute\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pointed at the mark belonging to Lightning Divine Palace on the blade. \u201cMaster, since I can make an appearance when divine energy is inserted, then what\u2019s with this mark?\u201d Was there a need for the sword to recognize a master first before inserting divine energy?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan stiffened for a moment. After blanking for two seconds, he suddenly stood up. \u201cYour divine energy right now is still unstable, and you can\u2019t manifest your corporeal form for a long period of time. Your master shall first bring you to the Lightning Abyss Pool to stabilize your divine energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu\u2026\u201d Why did she feel something was off?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan immediately held his disciple and flew towards the mountain peak. Stamping his disciple in order to prevent her from being taken away, was a very common thing to do, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>This was already the second time Zhu Yao had entered the Lightning Abyss Pool. Compared to the first time she came here as a rock, it was clearly much better this time. Putting aside how she wasn\u2019t feeling any pain, she had a family member keeping her company for the entire process.</p><br/><p>She bathed in it for exactly ten days before the divine energy in her slowly started to stabilize. She could finally maintain her corporeal form for twenty-four hours a day without a single interruption. However, she still couldn\u2019t hold onto the sword, as a sword spirit was a part of the divine sword in the first place. Strictly speaking, the sword was the main body, while she was just an accessory. Thus, she naturally could not control the sword. Furthermore, she could only appear in half a kilometer radius with the sword at the center. Any further than that and she would return to the sword.</p><br/><p>There were still no news on her body. Her master had reinforced the formations surrounding Lightning Divine Palace. Those dense layers of formations were enough to make Zhu Yao a little dizzy. Even a fly would most likely fail flying in here, let alone a human being.</p><br/><p>As for the culprit great great grandmaster, fellow comrade Floor Master Yu Jin, on the very first day she entered the Lightning Abyss Pool, he reported that he would personally search for her body. After leaving behind his greetings, he hurriedly left Lightning Divine Palace. No matter how she saw it, it seemed like he was desperately trying to flee.</p><br/><p>However, with that somewhat unreliable personality of his, Zhu Yao did not harbour any hopes at all.</p><br/><p>Though she was used to having her avatars changed, the one that was misplaced was the original version! She had to find it and get it back no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, are there many places where great great grandmaster\u2019s formation isn\u2019t able to track?\u201d Zhu Yao crawled out of the Lightning Abyss Pool as she asked.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan pondered for a moment. \u201cNot more than three.\u201d The Floor Master had the cultivation of a High Deity Paragon. The number of things that could escape his tracking art was extremely few.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us head to those places to take a look then?\u201d Zhu Yao suggested.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not reject her idea. With a wave of his hand, he cast an art on his disciple and on that divine sword, removing the excess lightning energy in her body. He then held onto his disciple on one hand, and then grab the sword with the other, before flying into the air. Her master was a High Deity, so he didn\u2019t need support from any mystic artifacts to aid him in flying in the air. In just a flash, the two had already left Lightning Divine Palace.</p><br/><p>When she turned back to look, lightning clouds shrouded over the place, as the dense layers of formations began to close.</p><br/><p>Eh? Why did she feel as though she had forgotten about something?</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t recall anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>Haah, whatever. Most likely, it\u2019s not that important either.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Foot of the Mountain of Lightning Divine Palace</p><br/><p>A certain someone that was unconscious for ten days slowly awakened. He looked at the surroundings blankly, only to find out that the place was covered in dark, scorched earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is\u2026 this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao thought that she could find her avatar very quickly. However, she never expected she had hit another miss. The three places that her master brought up did not have any traces of her avatar at all. Yu Yan had his divine sense filled more than half of the Deity cultivation continent, and he meticulously searched for about five days, yet he still did not find any leads.</p><br/><p>This was illogical! Could Realmspirit have retrieved her avatar? He couldn\u2019t have not greeted her before doing so, right?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! She suddenly recalled that before this, she could switch between the two avatars. However, in these few months, the phenomenon where she would switch her avatar in real-time had completely stopped. Could there be a unique set of rules for this switch to occur?</p><br/><p>She carefully recalled the experiences with the two avatar switching incident. During the first time, she seemed to have returned after being placed in the storage pouch. On the second time\u2026 she seemed to have suffocated quite badly. If there was any similarity between these two incidents, then\u2026 the switch occurred when she was completely devoid of divine energy!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt a bell ringing and a candle lighting up in her mind. She hurriedly tugged her master. \u201cMaster, I know how I can return to my original body. Hurry and place me inside the storage pouch.\u201d She meticulously explained to him whatever she had thought of.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan however frowned and was clearly rejecting her proposal. \u201cThough the method you proposed makes sense\u2026 even if this method works, we don\u2019t know where your body is right now? If you were to wake up, and if there was any sort of danger, you will be held in a disadvantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, master. I will be careful.\u201d Zhu Yao patted on her chest and guaranteed. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long. Just place me inside your storage pouch for a while should be fine. At the very most, you can pull me out fifteen minutes later. After that, my soul will naturally return. Isn\u2019t the problem solved now?\u201d</p><br/><p>He hesitated for a moment. He was still completely rejecting such a risky endeavor. Zhu Yao uttered out all of her excuses and persuaded him for a long while, before she was finally given a bare pass.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, do not move recklessly.\u201d He instructed her repeatedly. \u201cOnly act after discussing with your master when your return. Just in case, I will just put you inside for three breaths of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! That\u2019s a little too short a timeframe, right?\u201d Three breaths. In other words, it was only three seconds. How could she possibly see anything through with such a limited timeframe?</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then!\u201d You\u2019re the boss.</p><br/><p>In a flash, Zhu Yao\u2019s figure returned to the sword. Yu Yan held onto the sword tightly as he still harboured a hesitant look. A short while later, he finally opened the storage ring on her palm, and Zhu Yao instantly turned into a ray of white light and entered the ring.</p><br/><p>One second\u2026</p><br/><p>Two seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>Time\u2019s up. She could be retrieved now. With a wave of his hand, Yu Yan had the second rank divine sword once again appear on his hand. On the pure-white blade, the lightning cloud mark was especially eye-catching. She hurriedly called out in a solemn voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d There was no reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d There was still no reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cReply your master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Wang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Complete silence.</p><br/><p>On Yu Yan\u2019s former light and bland face, dark clouds began to surface. The dark clouds turned cold, and finally brought down a hail\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His face was filled with utter disbelief. \u201cYou\u2026 He. How can you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow what?\u201d And here she wanted to ask about it too? After all, he was still a Sect Master, right? Why did he have to be this courteous to a beast raised in his own home?</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi tugged onto her sleeves with a tensed look. \u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, he is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar\u2026\u201d The demonic beast reverted back to its former demeanour and roared at Wang Xuzhi.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned back to glare at it. \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu\u2026\u201d It instantly became submissive.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sent a slap towards the beast\u2019s head. \u201cAs a domestic beast, you must promote unity and love, and be close to humans, understand? If I see you bullying my family\u2019s little wimp again, I will thoroughly skin you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOwuu\u2026\u201d Its eyes turned misty. (?_?)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, stop following me. Otherwise, I will really beat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The beastie stiffened for a moment, and then, as though he could finally bear it no longer, like an opened tap, tears began to flow onto the ground. \u201cWuuuuuu\u2026\u201d \uff08\u252d\u252e\ufe4f\u252d\u252e\uff09</p><br/><p>The corners of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cYou\u2019re crying again!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The demonic beast trembled, though its tears did stop, it suddenly choked. \u201cKuh!\u201d It hiccupped.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not leaving!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As it hiccupped, it looked at her with sparkling teary eyes. The mist in its eyes accumulated, and accumulated\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWuaaah\u2026\u201d Finally, it broke. Sprinkling the entire road with tears, it cried as it sprinted into the forest, without even turning back.</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>A familiar chat window instantly popped out in front of her. Congratulations, you have unlocked the Achievement: \u2018Harmed a Pure and Innocent Realm Guardian Beast in an Inhumane Manner, Shattered the Pure Heart of a Beast\u2019.</p><br/><p>Achievement Title Unlocked: Pui! You Shameless Human!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was cussing at her right? He\u2019s definitely cussing at her, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao\u2026\u201d Wang Xuzhi looked at her with a face that looked as though he was about to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what in the world is that?\u201d She was really just an innocent bystander who was unclear of the truth, hey.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, when you came into Spiritual Realm, did you not encounter Highlord Bai Yuan?\u201d Wang Xuzhi curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only met that ridiculous beast in the forest near Ancient Azure Sect.\u201d And I was this close to being swallowed by it too!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Wang Xuzhi was stunned. \u201cHigh Bai Yuan is the Guardian Beast of the entire Spiritual Realm. Without his permission, no one can enter Spiritual Realm from the Underworld. Big sis Zhu Yao, just how did you make your way here to Spiritual Realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded rather incredible, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI came over by flying straight up in the sky!\u201d Only a ghost would know passing through it would require the permission of a beast?</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi became even more stunned. \u201cBut when crossing into Spiritual Realm, there\u2019s the Abyss of Eternity one must pass through. Did big sis Zhu Yao not see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was there such a thing? \u201cNope!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>According to Wang Xuzhi\u2019s words, between Underworld and Spiritual Realm, there\u2019s a place separating the two called the Abyss of Eternity. That was a dead land, and anything entering it would be swallowed into it, including souls. The only way to safely pass through it, was to be led by Bai Yuan, titled the Realm Guardian Beast.</p><br/><p>As to what kind of beast it was, where it came from, and the strength it possessed, no one knew exactly for sure. However, every single person who entered Spiritual Realm was led in by it. Nor did anyone know just what rank of a demonic beast it was. The only thing they understood was its name, Bai Yuan! It held a position which no one could replace in Spiritual Realm. No matter how dazzling of a human practitioner one could be, he had to respectfully refer to him as Highlord Bai Yuan. This was also because why the relationship between human practitioners and demonic beasts were especially harmonious in Spiritual Realm.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little dumbfounded from what she heard. She was simply unable to connect that demonic beast which had a few screws loose earlier, with such an incredible status. Rather than calling it a Guardian Beast, Zhu Yao felt it was more like a mascot character of Spiritual Realm. One that would keep the place safe and secure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHighlord Bai Yuan had always been rather easy-going, and would often travel between various clans and sects, or stay for a short period of time.\u201d Wang Xuzhi explained. \u201cWhen the Ghost King appeared back then, the reason why I went to the Underworld was also due to Highlord Bai Yuan coincidentally residing in Ancient Azure Sect at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She seemed to have offended a beastie that was sort of incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiritual Realm is different from other cultivation worlds. No matter if it was ascending to the Higher Realm or entering the Underworld, he or she must receive approval by Bai Yuan. Otherwise, one would fall into the Abyss of Eternity. At best, your soul scatters, at worst, you will forever be unable to reincarnate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUu\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao felt even guiltier the longer she heard his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough Highlord Bai Yuan is in the form of a beast, rumours state that ever since the birth of Spiritual Realm, he had existed in this land. His strength is deep and profound.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle wimp\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf\u2026 I apologize to it now, would it be too late?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Evidently, it was too late. Because that beast had long disappeared without a trace. Whatever. In any case, it wasn\u2019t the first time she had offended that beast. Furthermore, was it really suitable for the setting of a demonic beast to be this incredible? The God Races express their dissatisfaction!</p><br/><p>After walking for another half an hour, the horizon suddenly grew dim, and the spiritual energy in the air was now scarce to an incomprehensible degree. It felt as though that the further they walked, the amount of spiritual energy would decrease as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao\u2026\u201d Wang Xuzhi suddenly called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d When she turned around to look, she saw that his forehead was covered in heavy sweat, and his face was pale, giving a pained look. \u201cLittle wimp, what happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was frightened, as she hurriedly held him and sat him down. Wasn\u2019t he still alright earlier?</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi shook his head, his face had a frail look, yet he still pointed to the front and said. \u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, the place in front should be the land at the end of the horizon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao focused her eyes, and she saw a place that looked like a huge chasm appearing in the sky.</p><br/><p>The green forest looked as though it had been firmly cut off. On one side, it was lush green, while on the other, there was an empty void. Nothing could be clearly seen, and the surroundings were strangely quiet, as though the noises in the entire world had completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao split a strand of her spiritual energy into his meridians, and after a while, she suddenly widened her eyes. \u201cWhy is the resentment in your body in such a disarray all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m uncertain as well.\u201d Wang Xuzhi shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the more we approach the land at the end of the horizon, the resentment in my body would stir even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank. Could it be that really was something that could influence resentment in the land at the end of the horizon? Calming her heart down, she cast an art to first aid Wang Xuzhi in suppressing the resentment.</p><br/><p>For a moment, she was hesitating if she should actually continue going forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, since we\u2019re already here, we must investigate the cause.\u201d Wang Xuzhi said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already like this, and you\u2019re still trying to act tough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Zhu Yao knocked on his head. \u201cIn your present state, even if you enter the place, you will just be holding me back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He lowered his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I shall first head over there to take a look. If the resentment in your body goes berserk again, you can make your way back first. There\u2019s no need to wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo buts!\u201d Zhu Yao glared at him. I\u2019m this authoritative alright!</p><br/><p>That void was not even a hundred meters away from them. She had not felt it earlier, but as she approached the place, even Zhu Yao was beginning to feel an oppressive feeling. Even the spiritual energy in her body was scurrying uncontrollably, as though they wanted to break out of her body.</p><br/><p>Her chest was feeling incredibly oppressed, and she was having difficulties breathing. Clearly, she was in a dense forest, but huge winds were blowing from all around her. She was beginning to feel chills from the winds. The feeling that something was a little amiss grew as the winds blew even stronger, and even her face was starting to ache. With every blow of the wind, she could feel her body turning colder by a certain degree, as though she was not being protected by her spiritual energy in the slightest\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, spiritual energy!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled, as she circulated the spiritual energy in her body. However, she realized that not much spiritual energy was left in her Dantian.</p><br/><p>The winds were actually able to scatter away the spiritual energy in her body!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately upped her pace and hid into the forest. However, the winds seemed to have eyes grown on them, as they immediately changed their directions and blew straight towards her.</p><br/><p>Big sis Zhu Yao!\u201d Wang Xuzhi realized her anomaly as well, as he chased after her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be blown by the winds in the surroundings!\u201d Zhu Yao reminded out loud. \u201cThe winds will scatter away the spiritual energy in your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little wimp\u2019s feet paused, and he immediately reacted after. He instantly made a turn and avoided the winds that were blowing at him.</p><br/><p>For a moment, the two people had no choice but to crawl and jump about within the forest.</p><br/><p>However, winds were shapeless and formless. They were basically unable to be seized hold of, and the two of them had no choice but to rely on their senses to dodge them. It was still manageable in the beginning, but after a long while, they would still end up being blown. Zhu Yao could barely feel the meagre amount of spiritual energy in her body now.</p><br/><p>As she hid in the east and concealed themselves in the west, unknowingly, she had gotten closer to that void. At that moment, she was unable to circulate even a single strand of spiritual energy in her body, she dodged, and beneath her foot was empty air. She suddenly realized that she had already reached the edge. Next to her feet was an unfathomably deep chasm, and behind her was the void.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao breathed in cold air. Mamamiya, fortunately, she managed to step on the breaks in time. Otherwise, she would have fallen down.</p><br/><p>So fortunate, so fortunate\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a white figure leapt out of the forest, and came pouncing right towards her.</p><br/><p>A familiar beast roar sounded next to her, along with little wimp\u2019s terrified voice.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s entire body fell backwards from the pounce, and she felt straight into the void.</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>A phrase could not help but surface in her mind: A beastie\u2019s revenge, even ten years wouldn\u2019t be too late\u2026 my ass!</p><br/><p>Just what kind of grudge did she have with this demonic beast!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao fell into the void at the land at the end of the horizon, and it even came with the demonic beast which played the scapegoat. That void was very deep, and she felt her entire body was soon about to fall apart. Every single one of her bones were painfully creaking, while nothing was happening at all to the culprit beast.</p><br/><p>Probably because it had to settle its great grudge, it had circled around her several times, happily leaping about. Voices of excitement were also emitted out from its mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOu ou ou\u2026 She\u2019s down here. She\u2019s down here. She\u2019s finally down here.\u201d That voice was soft and tender like a child\u2019s. After circling a few rounds, it actually began to roll on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Zhu Yao ruthlessly glared at it, and had managed to sit up straight only after putting in a lot of effort into it. She did not even bother thinking about how it suddenly knew how to talk, and simply felt that she would hurt even more if it made even more noises.</p><br/><p>As expected, Bai Yuan stopped, and obediently sat next to her. Its gigantic white beast head stretched out, and its two large bell-like eyes were staring straight at her.</p><br/><p> \u201cYao Yao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zhu Yao was given a shock, and had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>That pair of eyes grew even brighter, and the tender and soft voice once again resounded. \u201cI want to kiss you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yuan opened its mouth wide, ahmu, Zhu Yao entered its mouth. It grinded her up and down several times, and then, puuf, it puked out Zhu Yao whose entire body was covered in saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she rubbed off a portion of the sticky saliva, Zhu Yao\u2019s hands trembled. She felt that the chord that was named \u2018reason\u2019, was being snapped apart, and was presently making creaking noises.</p><br/><p>Yet, Bai Yuan which had plastered her entire face with saliva earlier, was licking its lips. Then, its beast face twisted into a lump, as it turned around and retched out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuu\u2026 Hair, stuck, the hair got stuck\u2026\u201d It puked out for a short while, and then with a wronged look, it turned back. \u201cHair\u2026 Hair isn\u2019t washed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pata!</p><br/><p>The chord named \u2018reason\u2019 shattered apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWash your sister!\u201d She instantly pulled that flowery white beast head over, grabbed onto the whiskers next to its mouth, and then ruthlessly pulled them outwards. \u201cWhat rights do you have to be disgusted at me! This old lady has yet to settle the debt of you pushing me down here. And here you are, disgusted with me!? This is what you get for being disgusted with me, this is what you get! You\u2019re the one who hasn\u2019t washed its hair, your entire family has unwashed hair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOuuuu\u2026\u201d Bai Yuan let out a miserable cry, as it began to roll on the ground. Its paws waved about in the air, yet it did not dare to wave them in her direction.</p><br/><p>Only when Zhu Yao had completely pulled out all of the whiskers without leaving a single one, she then kicked away the huge beast body, and stopped to gasp for air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuuu\u2026\u201d Bai Yuan used its front paws to hold onto its swollen beast mouth, and then laid on the ground like a quail. Its eyes were filled with complaints towards her vile actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at!?\u201d Zhu Yao returned with a glare. Just by looking at it, anger would swell within her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to cry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The \u2018ee\u2019 crying noises instantly stopped, and they turned into muffled sobs instead.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not be bothered with it as she inspected her surroundings. It was completely dark, as though the sky and earth had connected into a single entity. She did not see any reincarnation chat windows, which proved that she was still alive. But just what was this place? The land at the end of the horizon? Why wasn\u2019t there anything here?</p><br/><p>Staying here was not an option either. Taking in a deep breath, she dragged her painful body and slowly walked a step at a time. She had tried it earlier, and realized there wasn\u2019t a single strand of spiritual energy in her body. Not just that, she was unable to sense the presence of spiritual energy at all.</p><br/><p>This proved that her cultivation had regressed, and it had even regressed back to her pre-awakened state, becoming a regular mortal. The strange winds earlier had not only scattered away the spiritual energy in her body, but her cultivation as well.</p><br/><p>In her present condition, if she did not find an exit, she would starve to death here.</p><br/><p>She aimlessly walked for half a day, yet she was unable to find a single thing. Her surroundings were abnormally quiet, and the only sounds she could hear were breathing noises, two sets of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d Zhu Yao turned to glare behind her.</p><br/><p>A certain beastie, which had been maintaining a distance of five steps, trembled. There were still undried tears within its large eyes. It weakly glanced at her, and then hurriedly sprinted over to her.</p><br/><p>A white paw stretched out towards her, and its face looked as though it wasn\u2019t afraid of death itself. \u201cGive\u2026 pull!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPaw, lots\u2026 of fur!\u201d It waved its paw, and large amount of tears filled its eyes. \u201cPull fur, don\u2019t go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was it trying to say? Let her continue pulling its fur? You\u2019re a masochist, aren\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was not moving even after a long while, it turned anxious. It instantly stuffed its paw into her arms. \u201cPull\u2026 Pull. Bai Yuan not hurt. After pulling\u2026 friends! Don\u2019t ignore me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why did she feel a sense of guilt from bullying a child?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we, be friends?\u201d It sniffled, as though it was desperately trying not to cry. It then used that paw to nudge her hand. \u201cI will let you pull. If one isn\u2019t enough, I still have three paws.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt a deep sense of powerlessness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

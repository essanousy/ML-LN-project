Rather than witnessing one, you were struck by one, right!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d That disciple immediately flattered a few words. \u201cAmong us disciples, only senior martial brother have personally gone to Lightning Divine Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Miao Lin nodded complacently, and then with a complacent expression, he said. \u201cI really wish I can once again witness Lightning Divine Hall\u2019s arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Are you a masochist?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already said this before, no lightning techniques are allowed to be executed in Advent Cloud Hall. Seeing that this junior martial sister has just entered the sect not too long ago, and has already suffered her punishment, I will leave this matter to rest. Disperse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, senior martial brother.\u201d The two followers expressed their thanks together, however, they then looked at Tao Manfeng, who was lying in the pool of water, with difficult expressions.</p><br/><p>Miao Lin frowned. After casting an art, the water on the ground once again condensed into a water dragon, and flew up. Only then did the two followers lift Tao Manfeng up and leave.</p><br/><p>Pulling along the mushroom, Zhu Yao was just about to flee as well.</p><br/><p>However, she heard Miao Lin\u2019s suddenly shouting out. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a flash, his figure had already blocked in front of Zhu Yao\u2019s path. \u201cThis junior martial sister, have we met somewhere before?\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m doomed!</p><br/><p>In front of her, Miao Lin had already reached out his hand. \u201cWhy are you constantly lowering your head?\u201d</p><br/><p>Out of desperateness, Zhu Yao retracted all of the divine energy in her body, and poof, she returned to her original form.</p><br/><p>A piece of snow-white jade instantly landed on Miao Lin\u2019s palm, which he was unable to retract in time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you return to your original form?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior martial brother\u2026 I\u2019m your aficionado.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAficionado? What\u2019s that?\u201d Miao Lin blanked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAficionado. It means that I really like, and really worship you.\u201d Zhu Yao immediately activated her bluffing mode. \u201cThis disciple has long heard of senior martial brother\u2019s mighty name. Now that I finally managed to see the person himself, I got a little excited, and returned to my original form.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miao Lin was filled with smiles. As expected, he dropped his suspicions, and flipped the jade in his hand about. \u201cYou sure have good eyes. Cultivate well. In the future, you will have the same level of achievements as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tried her best to express her own excitement. \u201cThank you senior martial brother. I will definitely work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Miao Lin passed the jade over to the mushroom at the side, and instructed. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for the both of you to be afraid. Our Advent Cloud Hall isn\u2019t a place without rules. If junior martial sister Tao comes to trouble you again, you can look for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, senior martial brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Miao Lin nodded. Most probably because this was the first time he had a fan, the expression he was looking at the mushroom with had become gentler as well. \u201cIf you have any concerns, just look for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, senior martial brother. Thank you, senior martial brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn. Go on then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao never expected that she could actually pass this off so easily, and she immediately urged the mushroom to bring her back. It seemed like she could not continue to stay in Advent Cloud Hall for long. There would come a day that someone could recognize her. She had already found her clue anyway, so right now, she just had to find the opportunity to rush over to Fluorescent Wind Sect as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>The two of them traveled in an urgent manner, and the moment they returned to the lodging, they closed the door. Only then did Zhu Yao heave a sigh of relief. She habitually circulated her divine energy so that she could return to her human form, only to realize that her body was completely empty. A hint of pain came from her Dantian, and she could not transform at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s jade-body instantly felt uncomfortable. \u201cMaster, I can\u2019t return to my human form.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to worry. Earlier, when you forcefully returned to your original form, your withdrawal of divine energy was too rapid, which caused some damage to your Dantian.\u201d Yu Yan gently said. \u201cYou simply have to stop circulating your divine energy temporarily, and it will be restored in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat gave me a fright. That\u2019s good, that\u2019s good.\u201d So it was because she withdrew her divine energy too quickly, causing her to have a stitch.</p><br/><p>\u201cRock spirit, who are you speaking to?\u201d The mushroom curiously lowered his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d She had forgotten that the mushroom was still here.</p><br/><p>His familiar face suddenly closed in, and Zhu Yao simply felt a shiver in the depths of her heart, as a strange feeling surged. As she thought, she was still unable to get used to Mushmush\u2019s human form, especially this little-wimp look-alike face of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. I was muttering to myself.\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The mushroom glanced at her and furrowed his brows, as though he wanted to ask something. After opening and closing his mouth a few times, he still changed the topic in the end. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to revert to your human form?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d She however, did not conceal this matter from him. \u201cI transformed a little too quickly earlier, so I can only restore my human form after a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then have a nice rest. I\u2019m going to head back first.\u201d The mushroom gave her a few words, before returning to his own cave residence. However, before he left, his expression was a little heavy, as he turned around to give her a few glances.</p><br/><p>Did rock spirit have a master? Master\u2026 In the depths of his initially pure-white heart, an indescribable emotion suddenly surfaced. Why did he feel that this word sounded a little familiar?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao planned to head over to Fluorescent Wind Sect when she regained her human form. Currently, as a piece of jade which did not have any movement ability, the only thing she could do was \u2013 sleep. However, she never expected that there would actually be someone assaulting her at night.</p><br/><p>That person suddenly appeared in her house. There wasn\u2019t any ripples produced from divine arts, and furthermore, the door and windows were nicely shut. In a blink of an eye, the lodging simply gained an additional human figure. His figure was especially tall, and she could faintly see that he was a male practitioner. Even though the moonlight was especially bright within the house, she still couldn\u2019t clearly see that person\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to speak, she was interrupted by Yu Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d Carrying an anxious tone, her master\u2019s voice resounded in her mind. \u201cThis person is the individual who infiltrated Lightning Divine Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao blanked, and was thrown into elation a moment later. She hurriedly transmitted her voice. \u201cThen does that mean that as long we capture him, master can leave this dimensional space?\u201d Various age-restricted bondage methods began to fill her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s voice was solemn. \u201cThis person\u2019s cultivation level is higher than mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Then how the hell was she going to play this? Fortunately, she did not speak out earlier, otherwise, she would have been the one trapped. \u201cThen what do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not make any noise. Wait and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao withdrew from her inner view, and quietly continued to act like a piece of jade. The room was strangely quiet, and even the cicadas outside the window had stopped singing.</p><br/><p>It was unknown for what purpose this person came here for either, as ever since his appearance, he had been standing inside the room without moving from his position. Even Zhu Yao was about to believe that the reason why he was here, was simply because he liked the floor he was stepping on. Finally, he moved. Turning his ahead, he swept his eyes around the room, as though he was searching for something. A moment later, she sensed a divine sense sweeping over.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhu Yao rejoiced that she did not have a single strand of divine energy in her body, and had returned to her true form. Without any ripples of divine energy, even if someone else\u2019s divine sense were to sweep pass her, she would still just be a regular piece of jade. That person definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to discov-</p><br/><p>Ehhhhhh? Why was he coming over?</p><br/><p>That person retracted his divine sense, and walked straight towards the table. As though he had identified her, there wasn\u2019t even a single trace of hesitation in his footsteps. Did she have to be this unfortunate!?</p><br/><p>In an instant, Zhu Yao felt that even her heart had popped out. What happened to the promise of being undiscovered?</p><br/><p>A pair of cold lines of sight fell on her body. Even though he clearly did not do anything, Zhu Yao still felt a cold intent penetrating the depths of her heart, as though she was about to choke from his gaze. Just when Zhu Yao couldn\u2019t bear it any longer and was about to speak out, he suddenly shifted his line of sight. In a flash, just as how he had appeared, his figure disappeared from the room.</p><br/><p>What kind of situation was this?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was completely lost. However, that terrifying feeling earlier still lingered in her heart. Just who the hell was that person?</p><br/><p>A moment later, a slit of the door was suddenly pushed open by someone. A head sneakily came inspecting the room.</p><br/><p>Little bitch!</p><br/><p>It was actually Tao Manfeng who came to seek trouble with her during the day! Was today labelled as Nightwalk Day on the calendar? This was even a team night assault?</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng looked around for a moment, before she carefully pushed the door open and came in. She first quietly looked at the bed. As though she had confirmed that no one was in the room, her brows furrowed, as she searched around. Just as she was about to leave, she discovered Zhu Yao on the table, and in an instant, her eyes lighted up.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine jade!\u201d Tao Manfeng picked up the piece of jade from the table with an excited look. After inspecting its front and back, she muttered. \u201cAs I thought, it\u2019s the same piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this little bitch trying to do? She couldn\u2019t be planning to pose as her again, right?</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng, however, did not speak up again. Instead, she held onto Zhu Yao, and left through the door with a happy look. Her flying sword rose, and she directly flew out of Advent Cloud Hall. Just where was she bringing her to?</p><br/><p>She seemed to be really excited, as she looked at the piece of jade while flying. The other hand of hers was even constantly stroking the surface of the jade.</p><br/><p>She stroked her to the point Zhu Yao was feeling as though all her hair were standing on ends. After restoring her human form, she was definitely going to take a bath. The type where she was going to vigorously rub every nook and cranny of her body.</p><br/><p>She flew for exactly an entire night, and she only landed on the ground right after arriving at a small market. She then however entered a secluded courtyard, and only after setting down several layers of concealment and isolation formations outside, did she finally enter the house.</p><br/><p>After looking around her surroundings, she then pulled out the jade with a serious look, and began to carefully inspect it. In order to prevent herself from being exposed, Zhu Yao did not let out a sound during the entire journey. Tao Manfeng clearly recognized her true form, but seeing her worriless expression, evidently, she did not know that Zhu Yao had already cultivated a human form.</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng flipped the jade back and forth, and stared at it for a long while. The more she looked, the deeper her brows furrowed. She then muttered to herself. \u201cCould it be that this piece of jade is simply used to prove one\u2019s identity as a Lightning Divine Hall disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes in the depths of her heart. It seemed like she still couldn\u2019t forget about the Lightning Divine Hall, huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn item of the Lightning Divine Hall definitely isn\u2019t that simple.\u201d Tao Manfeng took a deep breath, and continued to inspect for a long while. First, she merely used her naked eyes to look, and then, she used her divine sense to sweep through it. Then, she even inserted a little of her divine energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is impossible.\u201d Seeing the completely unresponsive divine jade, her expression became a little ugly. She then tried to use various other methods, such as bathing it in the water, burn it under a fire, and plant it under a soil. Even Zhu Yao was about to praise her for her dedication and perseverance. She silently rejoiced that she was currently a piece of rock. Otherwise, if this continued, even if she wouldn\u2019t die, a layer of her skin would have been ripped off.</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng continued to toss about for an entire night, and throughout the entire thing, Zhu Yao was quietly acting dead. Finally, she gritted her teeth, condensed a spiritual sword, and then sliced it across her own finger. Suddenly, a large number of fresh blood pearls were produced, merrily flowing down her finger. She raised her bleeding finger, and pressed it on Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Alright, she finally found the correct method. However, she was simply too late, as Zhu Yao had already been sprayed with someone else\u2019s blood. No matter how much she were to drip her blood on\u2026</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>Binding of Dimensional Space \u2013 Success!</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>Just how much love did this dimensional space have to give? How could it be bound with just any random person with a single drop of blood, hey? This thing recognized blood, but not the owner\u2019s. In an instant, Zhu Yao felt like she was going insane.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what do we do?\u201d This woman wasn\u2019t as easy to hoodwink as Dog-Egg. \u201cWe definitely mustn\u2019t allow her to enter the dimensional space.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t come in.\u201d Yu Yan said with a solemn voice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

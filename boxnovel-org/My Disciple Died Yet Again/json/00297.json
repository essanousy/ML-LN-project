She turned to look at the hand she raised, and then glared straight at it!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head and looked at the thing in her hand.</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>With a wave of her hand, she threw out the bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did his expression soothed quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Haah! It was truly tiring to have a master who was on odds with medicinal pellets.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. Yu Yan however suddenly took a step forward and pulled her into his embrace.</p><br/><p>Before she could even react, her vision was assaulted by a dark figure, and her lips were heavily pressed onto. A familiar scent instantly filled her nose.</p><br/><p>Eh!?</p><br/><p>Why did she suddenly receive a blessing?</p><br/><p>\u201cMas\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when she was about to speak up, a certain someone had already came charging right in in a familiar fashion, tender and lingering. She had to admit, though a certain someone was not enlightened in this aspect, his ability to learn was pretty impressive.</p><br/><p>Though she did not understand why her master was being this abnormal, since she could not resist, then she should just enjoy it!</p><br/><p>(*\u256f3\u2570)</p><br/><p>Let the blessing grow even more ferocious then.</p><br/><p>Little Eighth who had settled down on her head and was watching the entire scene: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Should he leave for a while?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little dispirited throughout the day, sensing that something was about to happen. Even when it came to trafficking\u2026 ah pui! Even when it came to searching for little radishes, she could not lift up her mood to do it either. Only after she sensed abnormal movements with the spiritual energy within the sect did her sixth sense became reality. The abnormal activity with the spiritual energy there was not very obvious. If not for her powerful divine sense, even she wouldn\u2019t have been able to sense it. The thing she was truly worried about, was the fact that the ripples of spiritual energy belonged to the little tyrant.</p><br/><p>She felt her heart skip a beat as she turned around and flew back to Ness Cesary Sect. When she arrived at the cave residence where little tyrant was isolating himself in, about seven people had already gathered there.</p><br/><p>Sect Master Qu Jiang and three Nascent Soul Elders. Even Sovereign Wu Fu was among the crowd as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, what a pity!\u201d She could hear Qu Jiang\u2019s sigh from afar.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately squeezed in. \u201cWhat happened to Little Bai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Bai was sitting at the center with a pale complexion, and the spiritual energy surrounding his body was considerably chaotic. There were even faint traces of them scattering and leaking out. An Elder was presently sitting behind him, healing his injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to senior-martial aunt!\u201d Qu Jiang and the several Elders greeted her in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhu Yao looked towards Qu Jiang.</p><br/><p>His expression changed, and he said with an unfortunate tone. \u201cZhiyuan\u2026 failed in establishing his Foundation. Fortunately we realized in time, so his fundamentals shouldn\u2019t be damaged.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe failed!?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned, unable to believe what she just heard. \u201cLittle Bai\u2019s aptitude is pretty good, isn\u2019t it? So how could he possibly fail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 disciple doesn\u2019t know.\u201d Qu Jiang had the same doubts as well. This child\u2019s fundamentals had always been rather firm, and he was the one who suggested to go into closed-door training to establish his Foundation in the first place as well. Yet, he still failed. Fortunately, it was just Foundation establishment, so even if he failed, at the very most he would simply lose two levels of cultivation. He just had to re-cultivate once more.</p><br/><p>Puaah\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, little tyrant spat out a mouthful of blood. His chaotic spiritual energy earlier instantly scattered completely, and his complexion grew even paler. His cultivation instantly fell from the Essence Paragon level back to the third level of Essence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bai!\u201d Zhu Yao took a step forward and quickly held onto the little tyrant who was about to collapse. She placed her fingers on his pulse, making it look as casual as she could. Fortunately, though there were damages to his meridians, his Dantian was still rather intact.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d Little tyrant raised his head and looked at her, his expression looked a little dazed.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to console him, the Elder sitting behind him stood up with a stunned look. \u201cHow\u2026 How is this possible!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial brother Qu Ying, just what in the world happened?\u201d Qu Jiang frowned. Normally, a Nascent Soul practitioner like him should have been able to easily suppress the chaotic flow of spiritual energy belonging to a Foundation disciple. How could he possibly fail?</p><br/><p>Immense anger instantly surfaced on Elder Qu Ying\u2019s face. Pointing at Little Bai, he said. \u201cHe\u2026 He\u2019s not a duo spirit veins holder!\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words fell, everyone looked at him with a confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial brother, what do you mean by those words?\u201d Qu Jiang had a faint guess, but he still asked, unwilling to accept the thoughts he had.</p><br/><p>Qu Ying coldly snorted, as though he had suffered from some sort of huge prank. Trembling in fury, he glared at Little Bai. \u201cHmph, when I was helping to guide his spiritual energy earlier, I discovered that there were faint traces of other spiritual energy mixed within his body, and they were not as pure as that of the duo spirit veins. I harboured some suspicions, so I inspected his spirit veins. I discovered that there were still three other spirit veins sealed within his body, and they were exposed after his failure in establishing his Foundation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree others! Then wouldn\u2019t that mean\u2026\u201d He possessed the trash penta spirit veins?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Little tyrant had a face of utter disbelief. Disregarding the heavy injuries on his body, he refuted. \u201cI clearly possess the metal and fire duo spirit veins. How could they possibly turn into penta spirit veins?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will have to ask you that.\u201d Qu Ying\u2019s fury grew even further. \u201cYou\u2019re clearly a trash penta spirit veins holder, yet you impersonate as a duo spirit veins holder, what\u2019s the point of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little tyrant grew even more anxious as he explained. \u201cImpersonate? No, I did not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, no one present believed him. Even an idiot would know the differences between duo spirit veins and penta spirit veins. A sect would spend a large amount of resources to raise a duo spirit veins holder, but never raise a penta spirit veins holder.</p><br/><p>In an instant, everyone looked at Bai Zhiyuan with disappointed and enraged eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao held onto Little Bai who was moving haphazardly about, and spoke. \u201cCan I ask something? Under what sort of situations can one conceal his own spirit veins, preventing the Spirit Testing Stone from testing them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qu Ying replied. \u201cEither seal the spirit veins before he begins taking in spiritual energy into his body, or his cultivation level exceeds that of an Azoth Core\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he spoke till there, he paused. Only then did the crowd finally realize something was amiss. Bai Zhiyuan was merely at the Essence stage, so it was naturally impossible for him to conceal his own spirit veins. Another method was to seal his spirit veins right before he even began to cultivate. Bai Zhiyuan grew up in the sect since young, and he had his spirit veins tested before three years old. No matter how talented a child was, he could not possibly have such a scheming heart at three years of age, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if he\u2019s not the one who did it?\u201d Qu Ying still could not let this go. He possessed the metal and fire duo spirit veins as well, which was why he was helping Little Bai who had the same spirit veins curb the chaotic spiritual energy. Who would have known that after making his move, he discovered that he actually possessed the penta spirit veins. Adding that he was not mentally prepared, even he received some repercussions with his cultivation as well. This was also the reason why he was enraged, and that he made been made a fool out of. \u201cEven if the person who sealed his spirit veins isn\u2019t him, he plays a huge role in it. I simply don\u2019t believe he isn\u2019t the slightest bit aware of it before this. A disciple with a greed of a wolf should not be underestimated!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial uncle\u2026\u201d Little Bai\u2019s complexion was already pale to the point where not even a single trace of red could be seen. His eyes were filled with pain from suffering such a huge blow, yet he still wanted to explain himself. He turned to look towards Qu Jiang. \u201cSect Master, you must believe me. This disciple definitely doesn\u2019t have anything to conceal in his heart. I truly am unaware that\u2026 I\u2019m actually a penta spirit veins holder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhiyuan\u2026\u201d Qu Jiang believed him, after all, he watched this child grow up with his own eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother Sect Master!\u201d Qu Ying continued. \u201cThis wind can\u2019t blow too long! Otherwise, where\u2019s the prestige of our Ness Cesary Sect? How will the various sects see us? Think about it. If everyone is like his sort, how can our Ness Cesary Sect keep its foothold in the cultivation world? This time, because he only cultivated two types of spiritual energy, it created a false image of an Essence Paragon, and then he was only discovered after he forcefully tried to establish his Foundation. If he were to cultivate in all five types of spiritual energy now, who will be able to realize it? Wouldn\u2019t that be a waste of our sect\u2019s resources? No matter if he knows about it before this or not, we can\u2019t just leave things unsettled like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Bai\u2019s figure faintly trembled as he clenched his fists at the side. A while later, he spoke with great pain. \u201cSenior-martial uncle, please be at ease! This disciple will personally leave the Inner Sect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Qu Ying coldly snorted and turned his head away.</p><br/><p>Qu Jiang had a difficult expression as well. Qu Ying was right. Concealing spirit veins was usually a taboo in the cultivation world. As a Sect Master, responsibility laid with him, and he indeed could not take it as if he had just seen nothing. Sighing, he stepped forward and said. \u201cZhiyuan, after this, pack up and leave the Main Peak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen come under my tutelage, and go to Skybond Peak!\u201d Zhu Yao continued.</p><br/><p>The crowd turned their heads one after another and looked at her as if they were looking at an idiot. Qu Ying\u2019s reaction was even more intense. \u201cIf he heads to Skybond Peak, how is that a punishment anymore? He\u2019s a disciple who holds penta spirit veins, how could he possibly have the qualifications to enter Skybond Peak?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m a penta spirit veins holder as well!\u201d Zhu Yao childishly pointed at her own nose. Before despising others, first consider the person taking the bullet, can you?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Qu Ying was backed into a corner, his face was flushed red from anger.</p><br/><p>Little Bai turned his head around, his eyes reddened in an instant. \u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood boy!\u201d Zhu Yao stroked his head. This grandma shall cover you.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle martial aunt, you\u2026 how can you be this nonsensical?\u201d Qu Ying\u2019s beard fluttered in fury, yet he did not dare to argue with her head-on. He looked around, and then he looked pleadingly at the only Demigod Sovereign at the side. \u201cSenior-martial uncle Wu Fu, how do you see this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Fu frowned as well, a little disapproving of Zhu Yao\u2019s clear protective behaviour. Sighing, he spoke. \u201cJunior-martial sister Zhu, it is indeed not appropriate to take him in under Skybond Peak. Skybond Peak is left behind by our ancestor of Ness Cesary Sect, and should only benefit descendants who comprehend his intentions. As for this child, based on this matter alone, even killing him wouldn\u2019t be excessive. Not only is taking him in under Skybond Peak not a punishment, it has instead turned into a reward.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it that way at all!\u201d Zhu Yao patted on Little Bai\u2019s head as she looked at Wu Fu and said. \u201cYou people want to punish him for his mistake, but that can only happen when he did make one! He basically wasn\u2019t aware of his spirit veins being sealed at all, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have taken in only two types of spiritual energy all these years, no matter how stupid he is. Not to mention he wouldn\u2019t have court death by establishing his Foundation this way either. As they say, those who are unaware are innocent, so even if he is in the wrong, he can only be faulted for not discovering the problem with his spirit veins in time. If that\u2019s the case\u2026 as his elders, all of your experiences are richer than his, and all of you possess more knowledge than him as well. Since none of you realized this till now, on what basis can you blame him then? If he\u2019s wrong, all of you are in the wrong too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd exchanged glances. Qu Jiang\u2019s face especially, had a trace of guilt flashed across it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao continued. \u201cAll of you state that penta spirit veins holders are not qualified to enter the Skybond Peak, then may I ask Sovereign Wu Fu and the various Elders this? Is it because of my poor memory? Among the rules in Ness Cesary Sect, is there any written rule that states a spirit vein restriction when it comes to a disciple joining a Peak or Hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Crowd : \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, even Wu Fu was left speechless. Indeed, though the various sects took spirit veins in high regard, there truly wasn\u2019t such a rule. For a moment, the crowd grew a little hesitant.</p><br/><p>Qu Ying at the side grew even more anxious. He had an explosive temper in the first place, and he hated being made fun of the most. Adding that he had a stubborn personality, he no longer cared about his status and immediately burst out. \u201cThis is plan sophistry! No matter what you say, I see that there\u2019s no redemption for the wrong made by this Bai Zhiyuan, and he has to be ousted from Ness Cesary Sect. I will never agree to having the resources of Skybond Peak be used on someone like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>When his words fell, it looked as if everyone else had woken up as well as they all began to grow hesitant.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression instantly turned cold. To the very end, he simply could not bear to have those things from Skybond Peak be privately used on little tyrant, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master, what\u2019s your decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Qu Jiang had a complicated look as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma.\u201d Little tyrant tugged on her sleeves, and shook his head in despair. \u201cForget it.\u201d Turning around, he gave Qu Jiang a heavy bow. \u201cThank you, Sect Master, for your many years of teaching. This disciple\u2026 Zhiyuan, will now leave Ness Cesary Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he heavily kowtowed three times, and then struggled to stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s heart ached, holding onto him. \u201cIf you want to go, then let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly opened his eyes wide. \u201cGrandma!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you I want to take you under my tutelage, so I will naturally have to stick to my words, and it takes effect immediately. Since you\u2019re my disciple, then your wrongdoings are my responsibility. Why don\u2019t we get ousted out together then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle martial aunt!\u201d This time, it was Qu Jiang who grew anxious, as he reached out his hand to hold her back. \u201cHow can you possibly leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Zhu, do not act impulsively!\u201d Wu Fu persuaded as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you leave, what are we going to do about Skybond Peak?\u201d Qu Ying blurted out.</p><br/><p>See, as expected, she was just a gate guardian. Zhu Yao sighed. After scanning the crowd, she said. \u201cIf I were to say, that the formation of Skybond Peak has already been dispelled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s dispelled, you can\u2019t\u2026 What!?\u201d Qu Jiang opened his eyes wide, as he looked at her in disbelief. \u201cY-Y-You\u2026 You\u2019re saying, Skybond Peak is now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can now enter and exit it freely.\u201d</p><br/><p>The place turned silent for two seconds. Glows of excitement seeped out of everyone\u2019s eyes. There were even some people who impatiently turned to look in the direction of Skybond Peak.</p><br/><p>With the formation dispelled, the treasures in Skybond Peak could now be taken out freely. Those artifacts were all left behind by the ascended ancestor. Just how many were there, they wondered?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial aunt, is the formation of Skybond Peak really dispelled? How did you dispel it?\u201d Qu Ying took a step forward, once again confirming.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was tidying up the mystic arts and techniques inside, I saw a description related to the formation. I merely wanted to test it out, and I didn\u2019t expect it to actually dispel the formation. In the first place, the reason why I\u2019m here today is inform you all about this.\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at the crowd that could hardly conceal their excitement, and casually continued making up her story. \u201cSince the formation is already dispelled, I\u2019m going to return Skybond Peak to you. That way, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems with me leaving Skybond Peak, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d This time, it was Little Bai who grew anxious and wanted to speak up. Zhu Yao shook her head, signalling him to keep quiet.</p><br/><p>How could Qu Ying still possibly refute her now? His head was filled with thoughts of what treasures there could be inside. Qu Jiang however had regained some of his calm, as he took a step forward and said. \u201cSince little martial aunt is able to dispel the formation, this further proves that you share a fate with Skybond Peak. Why mention returning it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother, now what you said is wrong.\u201d Before Zhu Yao could even speak up, she was interrupted by an Elder at the side. \u201cThis Skybond Peak was left behind for our sect by our ancestor in the first place, and it does not belong to a single person. The trial of bestowing Skybond Peak to the person who could solve the riddle back then was just a wild speculation by the descendants as well. Though senior-martial aunt Zhu carries the merit of dispelling the formation, she has simply done what she was ought to do. Furthermore\u2026 With her aptitude of penta spirit veins, it\u2019s already a heavenly fortune for her to form her Azoth Core in just five years.\u201d The meaning behind his words were: She occupied Skybond Peak for five years, and had even formed her Azoth Core. She has already been treated well enough, so returning it was something she ought to do.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

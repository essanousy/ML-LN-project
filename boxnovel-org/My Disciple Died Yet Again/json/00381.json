After the sunflowers were reclaimed by the grass field, there were no signs of them growing back. The moment the final one fell onto the ground, the Pea Shooters that were attacking so wildly suddenly stiffened. As though the pause button had been clicked, they no longer shot out their peas.</p><br/><p>The Chompers, Squash and the rest that were swaying about had also stopped moving as well. A few dozen seconds later, while making loud rumbling noises, they suddenly began to sink back into the ground. In just a short few minutes, they could no longer see a single figure of those strange plants above the field. Even the craters that were created from the explosions had all disappeared without a trace, restoring its previous plain and flat surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won!\u201d Nangong Cheng and Zhonggu Lu happily ran over, they faces were filled with the light of joy. \u201cDongfang girly, those strange flowers have retreated. Does that mean we\u2019ve cleared this stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either!\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned as she looked at the boundless grass field in front of her. For some reason, she felt that things weren\u2019t that simple. Earlier, they had just destroyed the sunflowers, so theoretically speaking, there were no reasons for the Pea Shooter to disappear as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Light of Guidance isn\u2019t far off.\u201d Zhonggu Lu pointed at the path in front of them. From where they were, they were about five kilometers away from the golden pillar of light. \u201cI think we should hurry over! If we stay here for too long, those strange flowers might resurrect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded. Indeed, they had to hurry over. Thus, she no longer hesitated and walked forward. However, after just walking a few steps, the ground began to shake tremendously, and it was more intense than before. Even Zhu Yao could barely stabilize herself. A hundred meters in front of them, dirt and mud flew as something enormous slowly rose.</p><br/><p>The five of them gripped their weapons tightly as they stared in front of them. The thing from the ground first showed a hint of yellow. As its height increases, it then revealed a green body. Compared to the plants before, it was clearly much taller. It continued to rise, and rise\u2026</p><br/><p>Two meters\u2026 Three meters\u2026 Four meters\u2026 Finally, after reaching a height of three storeys, it revealed its entire body.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorn?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a huge corn cob!\u201d Nangong Huang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan corn cobs grow so big?\u201d Zhonggu Lu asked.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, the corn cob suddenly straightened itself. In the next moment, the place where the five of them stood shone greatly, as a white circle of light that looked like a formation appeared on the ground. At the center, there was even a cross that looked like a target marker.</p><br/><p>This is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCob! Cannon!\u201d Zhu Yao grabbed onto the people next to her with each hand and ran out of the glowing circle. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>She unleashed the strength she had from all the milk she had drunk in her lifetime and desperately ran out. With a swoosh, that enormous corn cob had already flown into the air, and was smashing down in the direction of that circle of light.</p><br/><p>A loud boom could be heard as an enormous force assaulted from behind. She was pushed all the way forward by the shockwave of the explosion, and the ground beneath her feet began to crumble inch by inch. She used all of her strength to prevent herself from falling, and continued her mad sprint, barely escaping the Cob Cannon\u2019s attack range. Her bones were already beginning to rattle, and before she could even catch her breath, a white object came smashing at her the moment she turned her head around. She was basically unable to dodge in time, and her chest began to hurt. It was as if she was smashed by a enormous bolder. She immediately spat out a mouthful of blood, yet she could smell a charred scent with her nose.</p><br/><p>When she took a look, the thing that smashed onto her body was actually an enormous popcorn.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao once again spat out some old blood. Next time I\u2019m watching a movie, I\u2019m never going to eat popcorn again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d Yu Yan was startled. He pushed away the popcorn from her body, held up his disciple and then cupped her wrist.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying was frightened as well, and even his face had turned pale. He hurriedly squatted down and stopped her from bleeding.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care about me!\u201d Zhu Yao pulled her hand back. \u201cHurry! That Cob Cannon requires some time to fire off another corn cob, take this opportunity to destroy it! Hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, hurry!\u201d Zhu Yao pointed at the Cob Cannon that merely had its leaves left. \u201cWe must not allow it to fire off a second corn cob.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. He then gripped onto his sword tightly and ran over with Yue Ying. The Cob Cannon was now in its weakened state and was basically unable to attack at all. However, it was simply too big, and Yu Yan could only strike its stem a slash at a time.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned to look at the two homosexual buddies Nangong Huang and Zhonggu Lu. Their injuries were not light as well, as they sat on the ground unmoving. Next to them were a few popcorns that they barely managed to push off from their bodies. Beneath her feet, soft rumbling sounds could be heard. A large crater of about ten meters wide appeared from where the corn cob struck, and it was now beginning to be restored. Suddenly, the grass at the sides found an opportunity to use their automatic restorative abilities, and were beginning to cover up the empty spaces.</p><br/><p>It was as if ghosts or gods were being involved in this. Zhu Yao really wanted to know what\u2019s underneath this surface. She took a deep breath, stood up, and then looked into a hole that yet to be completely restored. However, she suddenly held her breath, and she stood rooted to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Nangong Cheng saw her strange behaviour and struggled to his feet as well. He walked over to her side, but he widened his eyes immediately after. \u201cThis\u2026 This is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Black. Entirely black. Beneath the surface was actually a layer of boundless black substance. The substance was tumbling and bubbling, as if water was flowing out of a water tap.</p><br/><p>\u201cResentment!\u201d She never expected that resentment was buried underneath the entire surface. As she had thought, the plants were materialized from resentment.</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng unconsciously took a step back, his face instantly darkened. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d If they were formed by resentment, then those plants could not be killed at all.</p><br/><p>Before Zhu Yao could even answer, rumbling noises from the earth once again rang. Several meters away from the Cob Cannon, following after a few popping sounds, four plants popped out. Wearing yellow petals, they continued to grow.</p><br/><p>The hell! The sunlight-gathering sunflowers again!</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng had an anxious look as well. The Cob Cannon had yet to be removed, but the sunflowers had once again appeared. Yet, they couldn\u2019t move at all either. If Yu Yan and Yue Ying were to ignore the sunflowers, Pea Shooters would most likely fill the land again. If they were to let go of the Cob Cannon, once it were to completely regain its strength, they wouldn\u2019t be able to endure its next corn cob either. Unwilling to admit defeat, he gritted his teeth as he walked wobbly towards a sunflower. However, after taking just two steps, he fell onto the ground again, puking out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang\u2026 girly\u2026\u201d What do we do?</p><br/><p>The ground had already begun to shake, and Zhu Yao fell onto the ground from the tremors. We\u2019re going to die, we\u2019re going to die, we\u2019re going to die. From the strength of this tremor, the one drilling out from the ground definitely isn\u2019t a Pea Shooter, but the next Cob Cannon!</p><br/><p>Do they really have to play it this way? Why did the weapons suddenly upgrade, hey!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath. Calm down, calm down! There must be other ways. Sunflower, sunflower, sunflo\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell! She suddenly recalled that these plants require sunlight!</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying!\u201d She used all of her strength to shout towards where the Cob Cannon was. \u201cHurry and use your devillic energy to cover the sun! Do not let the sunflowers absorb sunlight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying was stunned for a moment, and then he immediately began to release a dark aura to the surroundings. Large masses of dark devillic energy emitted out from his body and rose into the air. Like clouds, they began to cover up a large half of the sky with layers upon layers. The area suddenly dimmed, as if time had instantly turned from high noon to sunset. The surroundings had already begun to turn darker.</p><br/><p>As expected, in the next moment, the sunflowers that were still swaying about earlier lowered their heads after another, as though they liveliness had been seeped out. The intense tremors had instantly stopped as well.</p><br/><p>The two zombies Yu Yan and Yue Ying finally destroyed the Cob Cannon. They then turned around and sprinted towards the row of sunflowers behind. They then continued their harvesting act.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief, and even her legs were beginning to give way.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly, you sure know a lot.\u201d Nangong Cheng pulled her up and even held onto Zhonggu Lu next to him. The three of them then limped towards Yu Yan\u2019s and Yue Ying\u2019s direction. \u201cYou\u2019re actually able to see that those sunflowers need sunlight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho\u2026 I simply played a lot of games, that\u2019s all.\u201d As a professional game designer, she had especially spent some time to research on these games. \u201cFurthermore, sunflowers are plants that direly need sunlight in the first place. As long as it\u2019s night, we will be fine since there\u2019s no sunlight to absorb. Unless there\u2019s the appearance of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMushrooms?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Sun-shrooms\u2026 What?\u201d Nearby in front of them, a row of yellow mushrooms suddenly popped out.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s really sun-shrooms here, hey! Have we cut straight into night mode now!? Do you have to be this professional!? The ground shook once more. Clearly, the Sun-shrooms had already begun to generate sunlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cPull them out directly!\u201d The Sun-shrooms were closest to the three of them. Zhu Yao had no choice but to suppress the pain from her injuries, grit her teeth and run over. She hugged onto one of the bucket-sized yellow mushroom and pulled with all the might she gained from drinking milk. However, it wasn\u2019t effective at all? The Sun-shroom did not even budge.</p><br/><p>Instead, it blinked at her in a cutesy way, and then suddenly dove into her embrace, emitting out a crisp sound. \u201cChi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. It\u2019s this sound again. Just what did it mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly, these mushrooms are rooted too firmly, I can\u2019t move it!\u201d Nangong Cheng was also looking at her with a regretful expression. \u201cI even tried moving it with my weapon, but it doesn\u2019t even budge. What do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yellow heads was already beginning to pop out from the surface. After a closer look, there were actually five of them.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan and Yue Ying had already chopped off all the sunflowers and were rushing over. Zhu Yao lowered her head and looked at the blinking and unmoving Sun-shroom. Gritting her teeth, she shouted to Yue Ying. \u201cYue Ying, retract your devillic energy and release the sunlight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying stopped his feet. With a wave of his hand, the devillic energy in the sky scattered, and the boundless sunlight scattered down. Coincidentally, it first shone right down at the Sun-shrooms.</p><br/><p>She heard a weak cry from the mushroom in her embrace. \u201cChi\u2026\u201d Its pair of crystal-bright eyes began to slowly close, as if it was about to fall asleep. The tremor instantly stopped as well.</p><br/><p>The mushrooms then began to sink down into the earth. The one which Zhu Yao was hugging suddenly shone with a bright golden light right before it sank, and a mass of yellow light flew towards her, entering her chest.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt a warmth in her chest, and this heat instantly spread to all four of her limbs.</p><br/><p>She stroked her chest in slight confusion. Her injuries\u2026 were healed!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

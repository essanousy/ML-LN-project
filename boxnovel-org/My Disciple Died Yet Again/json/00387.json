Zhu Yao could not help but feel a chill in her heart. Though she had already mentally prepared herself when she destroyed the Light of Guidance, telling herself that the Realm of Gods was not a good place, it was still an astonishing sight when actually seeing it first-hand. This place was even worse than the Netherworld. Though the Netherworld was filled with ghastly air, at the very least, it wouldn\u2019t be as barren and cold as this place. Furthermore, though there were many human figures around, it was terrifyingly quiet. It was like a soundless movie, and one without any subtitles at that.</p><br/><p>A familiar human figure walked past her. Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank as she instinctively pulled onto him. \u201cNangong Cheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned around, but his two eyes were hollow. He seemed like he was looking at her, but there clearly wasn\u2019t any reflection in his pupils. And, Zhonggu Lu wasn\u2019t next to him.</p><br/><p>Even though he cared about his homosexual buddy so much, he basically wasn\u2019t by his side right now.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s hand shook for a moment, and she unconsciously released him. Nangong Cheng however simply changed a direction and continued walking forward. He did not reply, neither did he get angry, nor was there the slightest display of emotions. He was like a precise instrument walking on a predefined path, with neither sadness nor joy in him.</p><br/><p>She suddenly recalled his final smile when he walked into the Light of Guidance. It was clearly filled with hope and expectations, as if he was obtaining a new lease of life. But now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Zhu Yao fiercely turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has lost all awareness of himself.\u201d Realmspirit materialized into a look similar to hers, and then took a step forward to stand next to her. \u201cThe light above the Lightning Divine Tower is the first strand of light that scattered throughout the Three Realms at the very beginning of the creation of this world. It is also the purest light in this world\u2026 the Light of Purification.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPurification!\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cPurify what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit turned around and looked at her seriously. With a gentle voice, he said. \u201cResentment, obsession, love, joy, sadness, desire, fear, and everything else\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She suddenly widened her eyes. \u201cTheir\u2026 seven emotions and six desires were purified!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit nodded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a step back and then looked at the human figures before her once more. No wonder\u2026 It\u2019s no wonder these people looked as if they\u2019re puppets.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy create a Realm of Gods such as this?\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s chest felt heavy, as if something was pressing against it, preventing her from breathing properly. \u201cIs there a need for this? Could this really be cultivation\u2019s final stop? Is this the truth behind the Heavenly Dao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026\u201d He sighed. The scenery before her eyes instantly changed, and she arrived at place filled with flowers, a place that was as beautiful as the realm of fairies. \u201cThis is their own choice. Becoming Deities or Gods, they had chosen this path on their own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you the one guiding them onto this path?\u201d Zhu Yao solemnly said. \u201cRealmspirit, you\u2019re the spirit of the Three Realms. The Three Realms are you, and you are this entire world. Aren\u2019t all of the living beings in this world your children? Is it your wish to see their final resting place to be a barren land like that Realm of Gods?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s naturally isn\u2019t my wish to see that!\u201d Realmspirit turned to look at her, as he pulled up the corners of his lips and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026 I found you. My friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026 I\u2019m the spirit of the Three Realms, so naturally, I cherish this world.\u201d He frowned. \u201cHowever, all of the living beings in this world are the same. No matter if they\u2019re humans, plants or demons, as long as they are able to gain sentience, they will be harassed by their seven emotions and six desires. As long as they have desires, they will never be satisfied. After becoming Deities, they will want to become Gods, and after becoming Gods, they will most likely wish to cultivate even further to become something else\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cThough I am the spirit of the Three Realms, what I can do is however very limited. Luck, spiritual energy, and even the Heavenly Dao can all be changed according to my will. I\u2019ve always wanted to change and save this world, but no matter what I changed, there will always be new problems surfacing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNew problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>He sighed. \u201cDo you still remember those bugs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment, and then she nodded, puzzled. Why did you suddenly bring that up?</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, from the very start, they were not actually loopholes that could destroy the world. Rather, they were patches I made to save this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d You\u2019re motherf**king kidding me? Those Mary Sues and Gary Stus are patches!?</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t believe me, but that\u2019s the truth.\u201d He waved his hand, and in an instant, two screens appeared in mid-air. What were being displayed were the bugs that she had fixed, though the two screens had different words labelled above them. On the left it was written \u2018Predicted Outcome\u2019, while on the right was \u2018Actual Outcome\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake Xiao Yi for example.\u201d Realmspirit pointed, and the screens immediately displayed the scenes of the first bug she fixed. \u201cHe was born poor and frail, and he grew up from the very bottom. He understood the pain of practitioners of the lowest level the most, that was why I bestowed him immense luck. I hoped that, with this level of understanding, he could stop slaughters and prevent the birth of resentment. That way, it would reduce the burden of the Netherworld. However, I never expected that\u2026\u201d What were shown in the two screens were completely different. On the left, Xiao Yi was a great saviour, saving the injured and aiding the poor everywhere he went. Upholding justice, he walked on the path of a saint. On the other \u201cActual Outcome\u201d side, it was the scenario that she received back then. He gathered the five spirits and ascended to the Higher Realm, resulting in the collapse of the world. \u201cHe directly destroyed a world, and the resentment that would have been accumulated was estimated to be several million times more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d This patch was indeed a little upsetting.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s Mu Meiyan.\u201d Realmspirit continued. \u201cHer rebirth was initially to suppress the resurrection of the Devil. As long as her soul is undying, then the Devil will never be able to completely resurrect. The world will thus avoid a tribulation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Ling as well. Her existence was initially to have the Devil, that taken over Lin Qi\u2019s soul, develop feelings. As long as Lin Qi develops feelings for her, then he would be able to suppress the Devil\u2019s nature within his body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet alone Yi Ling, whose existence is a patch itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Zhu Yao did a stop gesture, and then scratched her head a little irritatedly. \u201cIn other words, these bugs were actually all made by you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d He nodded innocently.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The hell! So she wasn\u2019t here to save the world, but to help cover up his ass.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, you must believe me. I really had no other choice but to call you here.\u201d He said with an expression that looked as if he was about to cry. \u201cI\u2019ve looked for many people, but no matter if they\u2019re humans or beasts, or even a living being that had awakened its sentience, they would all become the bugs of their respective worlds. The more powerful they were, the more they were possess, and the more severe the consequences would become. There had never been a person like you who stood fast to your beliefs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. There\u2019s no need to let me wear a tophat. Just tell me your ultimate goal.\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hands.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit paused for a moment. Clenching his fists, he looked at her seriously in the eyes, and finally said with a heavy tone. \u201cI want you to redraft the procedures of the Three Realms, rewrite the Heavenly Dao, and change everything in its entirety. I want you to become the manager of this Three Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. With widened eyes, she sized him up from top to bottom, and then reached out to touch his forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re not having a fever, right?\u201d Though she\u2019s a main game planner and could be considered as a small supervisor, she had never been a CEO.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026\u201d He immediately pulled down her hand, and he had a stern expression which she had never seen before. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can stop the Three Realms from walking to its destruction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it sound so certain, hey.\u201d Zhu Yao grew a little anxious. \u201cI\u2019m someone who only knows how to make games, and I really haven\u2019t done anything like this before.\u201d What\u2019s going to happen if I make a mistake?</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even have confidence myself, just where is your confidence coming from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do it.\u201d He revealed a brilliant smile. \u201cActually, ever since you came, this world has been changing in a good direction. You\u2019ve already been to all of the Three Realms, so you should already have sufficient knowledge of this world. It\u2019s fine as long as you speak out your thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is\u2026 He\u2019s making me handover my post-experience reflection on my tour around the Three Realms?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was silent for a moment, and then she slowly started. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve already said the things that\u2019s needed to be said. You\u2019ve already understood the problems of this world, right?\u201d She raised her head and looked at him. \u201cWhen you closed all the Ascension Heavenly Doors of the various worlds, wasn\u2019t that recognition for what I said about people who conducted countless slaughters basically not being worthy of becoming Deities?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit, you mentioned that you once dispatched many people to fix bugs, but all of them would turn into new loopholes in the end. Because they lost their beliefs on their journey, they then began to walk on the most extreme route. Then why didn\u2019t you request everyone to hold fast to their beliefs right from the beginning?\u201d She patted on his shoulders. \u201cActually, I just don\u2019t get this practice of the strong eating the weak of this world. Because if we look at it from another perspective, slaughters enlarge people\u2019s greed and desires. The hearts of people do not amount to just that. As they say, \u2018man at birth is fundamentally good in nature\u2019, kindness actually exists in the depths of everyone\u2019s hearts. However, after they lost their beliefs, they abandoned this kindness. Yet, the Heavenly Dao has never cared about this point. That\u2019s why those who can ascend, ascends, and those who can become Deities, become Deities.\u201d</p><br/><p>She took a step forward and looked straight into Realmspirit\u2019s eyes. \u201cRealmspirit, have you ever thought that maybe, they didn\u2019t lose their beliefs on their journeys? Rather, right from the beginning, the Heavenly Dao that you designed, has never requested them to maintain their beliefs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit, actually, all of the living beings in this world are the same. They are all born the same way, and there\u2019s nothing different about them at all. It\u2019s merely there experiences that influence their choices. If the world tells them that there\u2019s no need to stick true to their beliefs, then they will throw them away without a shred of hesitation. If the world tells them that it\u2019s the most important thing, then they will hold onto them forever.\u201d Zhu Yao smiled. \u201cYou said that I\u2019m the only person in this world who can save them, but that\u2019s not right. I\u2019m actually the same with everyone else. The only difference is that I lived in another plane, and my world tells me that slaughter, stealing, and scheming are all wrong. Such acts will be met with prosecution. My conscience tells me that they\u2019re acts of utmost evil and cannot be forgiven. That\u2019s why even if I die, I will never do such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit, what this world lacks isn\u2019t someone who can hold fast to their beliefs, but a power that can guide everyone to holding fast to their beliefs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr should I put it this way? There hasn\u2019t been anything in the world that clearly tells everyone that they have to hold fast to their beliefs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit was silent for a long while, before he slowly began to reveal a smile. Even though they had the same face right now, his smile looked as if the sun had finally come out of the clouds, brilliantly\u2026 blinding.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 Why do I feel like I\u2019ve lost? Can you change to another face?</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand what you mean now.\u201d</p><br/><p>T/N: Realmspirit is currently borrowing Zhu Yao\u2019s appearance, but I will be referring Realmspirit as \u2018he\u2019.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

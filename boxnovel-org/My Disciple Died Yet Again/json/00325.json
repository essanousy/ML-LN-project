She did not know for sure if this world would actually collapse, but she herself was about to collapse very soon. As someone who had rich reincarnating experience, she realized at this very moment that her past experiences were nothing at all.</p><br/><p>There were actually this many methods of death in this world. Death by exploding. Death by falling. Death by stabbing. Death by formation\u2019s activation. Death by biting from a demonic beast. Death by walking into a pit and ended up being pierced. Death by activating a trap and being smashed. Death by choking on water. Even when she was just walking, she would even be suddenly slammed by a falling tree.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao who had countlessly rewound time by five minutes, was deeply suspecting whether if this avatar was carrying a innate talent for suffering, and a talent that surpassed all records at that. If this were to keep up, she could even write a book when she finally get to head back. The title of the book would be:\u300aMy Hundred and One Ways to Die\u300b</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heavily panted as she observed the terrain in the surroundings. Phew, safe! Only then did she sit on the grass. Let me make a save file first! She silently counted five minutes in her heart. File saving has been completed. If she were to die again later on, at the very least, she did not have to return to that ceiling support frame.</p><br/><p>She raised her head and looked at the place she came down from. For some reasons, this Spirit Heaven Palace was constantly giving her a dangerous feeling. She faintly sensed that she shouldn\u2019t continue staying there. This feeling was really strange, and she did not know what reason was causing it either.</p><br/><p>The various mechanisms and formations outside the room earlier had especially shaken her heart. She wondered just who was trying to deal with her. However, from the looks of the present situation, if she were to continue on like this, she would definitely be embroiled in the entire matter. She decided it was best that she leave as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stood up. Just as she was about to continue forward and leave this forest, she suddenly heard wails from the side\u2026</p><br/><p>Who the hell is crying in broad daylight?</p><br/><p>She cautiously scanned her surroundings, yet she couldn\u2019t see a single human figure. She could not sense any presence of life around her at all.</p><br/><p>However, the wails grew louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d She could not help but ask, yet she did not receive a reply. She couldn\u2019t have encountered a ghost, right? She instantly recalled various midnight horror movies, where ghosts had severed heads, were dressed in red gowns, or had long tongues. Immediately after, memories of her time in the actual Netherworld flashed in her mind. Instantly, her fear was dispelled. Uh\u2026 With the intellect of those ghosts, they are most likely nothing to be afraid of.</p><br/><p>Just as she was in doubt, she suddenly felt a chilling sensation crawling on her arm. Several drops of water appeared on her skin. She wiped her face out of reflex, and realized her hand was now wet.</p><br/><p>The hell, she was actually the one crying? When did she start crying? Why wasn\u2019t she aware of it at all?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao strongly rubbed her eyes, only to realize tears were dropping faster than before. She might not even stop at this rate. Just what was going on?</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Her heart clenched. After calming down and sensing her own body, she realized that the wails were coming from within her body. She instantly felt a chill rising from the bottom of her heart.</p><br/><p>She immediately sat down in a meditative posture, and then looked into her Dantian.</p><br/><p>At the very corner of her Dantian, a ghost dressed in white robes was squatting there. Her two arms were wrapped around her knees, and her head was buried within her thighs. With her arms trembling, she constantly let out her cries.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Zhu Yao was shocked. \u201cWhy are you in my body?\u201d</p><br/><p>That female ghost was stunned for a moment. She slowly raised her head, unexpectedly revealing a face with flowery features. Eh? Why does she look a little familiar?</p><br/><p>The hell! Doesn\u2019t she have the appearance of my current avatar?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m not\u2026 inside your body.\u201d The maiden sniffled and said. \u201cYou\u2019re the one\u2026 in my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh!?\u201d Zhu Yao instantly felt like she had been struck by lightning. \u201cY-y-y\u2026 You\u2019re saying the body I\u2019m in right now, is yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d The maiden nodded her head strongly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!?\u201d</p><br/><p>And here she was wondering why Realmspirit was treating her so well all of a sudden, giving her such a high quality avatar and all. So this avatar was actually owned by someone else! Then what was Zhu Yao? Did she take over this girl\u2019s body? And she was about to strip herself naked too!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shall return this avatar to you immediately.\u201d Realmspirit, come out here right now!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The maiden suddenly turned anxious, as she stepped forward to hug Zhu Yao\u2019s thigh. \u201cI\u2026 I, I\u2019m not going back! I beg you, don\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d There\u2019s actually a weirdo in this world that begs others to take over her body. Girl, your resolve is a little too strong, don\u2019t you think?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a pillar anymore! Realmspirit told me\u2026 that you can help me. I beg you, help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. Could this girl be the scenario herself? Pulling apart the arms that were clinging onto her thigh, Zhu Yao then sat down next to her. \u201cTell me, just what is going on? What did that bastard Realmspirit tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the girl rub her eyes and stop her tears. She pulled out a crystal-like transparent small ball and passed it to Zhu Yao. \u201cRealmspirit gave me this. He mentioned that you will understand once you see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Zhu Yao received it, and with a bright flash of light from the ball, a lightscreen instantly appeared in front of her. Yo, it\u2019s actually a projector. This screen\u2026 Is the scenario about to be played?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao straightened herself and immediately turned serious.</p><br/><p>Three minutes later\u2026</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She glanced at the lady next to her. \u201cI say, girl\u2026 Did you take out the wrong disc?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d The girl had a serious look on her face. \u201cThis is the only one I received from Realmspirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened!</p><br/><p>Certain, my ass! These action scenes involving a woman and a man, or a woman and two men, or a woman and n number of men, in various indescribable postures, were obviously part of an AV film! Where\u2019s the scenario in here?</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao took in a deep breath. \u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t have one, I do!\u201d She said earnestly.\u201d Haaah! I can understand you single little kitties possessing one or two special collections like this, but if you want to learn these moves from observation, at the very least, find another man to watch these with you! What are you trying to pull by making me watch this with you?\u201d Even fellow lesbians won\u2019t watch something like this together, my friend!</p><br/><p>The girl had a dumbfounded look, as though she was unable to comprehend the situation at all. She kindly glanced her in direction. \u201cEh? Realmspirit clearly mentioned that you would understand after watching it\u2026 Ah, you held it wrongly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl immediately reached out her hand to turn the direction of the ball, and then she said with a naive and pure look. \u201cIt\u2019s correct now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao wasa stunned. This disc had different recordings on different sides?</p><br/><p>After a closer look, the scenes were clearly purer than before. Like the past scenarios, a young girl appeared on it. Most likely, the young girl was the bug in question this time. Zhu Yao watched the scenario unfold seriously, all the way to the end.</p><br/><p>Immediately, a disgusting feeling welled up inside her, as though she had sneakily watched an extremely controversial movie while being drenched in dog\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>The first part of the scenario was till rather normal. The female lead with the bug this time was called Fan Zhishan, who was part of a well-known aristocratic family. Aristocratic families were always good at producing babies, and Fan Zhishan was a daughter birthed by a concubine. Because she was mentally ill, she was not highly regarded by the family. Then, when she was six years old and was tested to possess quad spirit veins, she was cast away even more so than before. She was basically left to fend on her own. Adding that was she mentally deficient, she was naturally bullied by other children. However, on the year she turned ten, everything changed.</p><br/><p>Her mental illness was suddenly cured, and she turned smart and sharp. She was actually able to recite poems with ease and converse with a linguistic tongue. Often, the arguments she gave would even stun the adults. Her talent was instantly spotted by a manager of the main family, and he made the decision to bring her into the school of the main family, marking her start in cultivation basics. The female lead was very hardworking. Though she had aptitude of quad spirit veins, her cultivation level rose to the fifth level of Essence in just three years.</p><br/><p>Thus, along with a pair of sisters of the main family, she was fortunately chosen by the main family to head over to the number one deity sect \u2013 Sleipoup Sect, to look for a master. During the entrance examination, because she broke through a profound mechanism of one of the checkpoints with her Dao of Language, she was actually fancied by a Demigod Sovereign of Sleipoup Sect and was taken in as his disciple.</p><br/><p>After that, Fan Zhishan journeyed towards the summit of life. She tamed beasts, obtain treasures, cleansed her meridians, her cultivation rose, and she finally dominated the world, before ascending into the Divine Realm\u2026</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 Fine then, that\u2019s how the regular path should look like. However, Fan Zhishan was a female lead, and female leads had never taken the regular path to the summit. That\u2019s why, on her fifteenth birthday, with a \u201csmack\u201d, her entire style changed along with a incredible turning point. She activated the \u2018heavy taste\u2019 mode. As though some sort of seal had been broken, her charm level rose explosively, attracting a large number of fans. Furthermore, she did not go for the \u2018uncertain\u2019 play, but instead went for physical relationships.</p><br/><p>Thus, on the screen, the scenes from earlier appeared.</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan was taken in by a master, and then\u2026 papapa~</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan had a new junior-martial brother, and then\u2026 papapa~</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan encountered a genius of the cultivation world in a tournament, and then\u2026 papapa~</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan picked up a tenth rank human transformed beastie, and then\u2026 papapa~</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan encountered a heretic practitioner, and then\u2026 papapa~</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan got to know a Hall Master of Spirit Heaven Palace, and then\u2026 papapa~</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan\u2019s spiritual artifact birthed a spiritual consciousness, and then\u2026 papapa~</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan encountered\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl\u2026 Can we fast-forward this part?\u201d Zhu Yao nudged the girl next to her.</p><br/><p>She had confused look. \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018fast-forward\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Nevermind, forget I said anything.\u201d Zhu Yao hardened herself and watched through it.</p><br/><p>The screen was already beginning to show the scenes of forbidden realms, and those n number of male leads who had an\u2026 no, a lot of affairs with her, still loved her to death in the very end. Even though they were fully aware that she was a public bus, they were still willing to find their own place in her heart.</p><br/><p>If that was all there was to it\u2026 Zhu Yao would just treat it as though she had just watched a movie with an especially heavy taste. PS: Along with another girl.</p><br/><p>However, this female lead actually inserted an advertisement in such a movie!</p><br/><p>The female lead said:</p><br/><p>Master, senior-martial sister doesn\u2019t seem to like me very much, and she often prevents me from bothering master\u2026 I\u2019m helpless\u2026 Uuuu\u2026 I can\u2019t have master kick her out of your tutelage, right? No, of course not! She\u2019s my senior-martial sister, everything is my fault\u2026 Master, don\u2019t blame senior-martial sister. I will work hard\u2026 and become a good junior-martial sister.</p><br/><p>And then, that senior-martial sister suddenly died from going overboard in her cultivation.</p><br/><p>The female lead said:</p><br/><p>Junior-martial brother, I met your cousin. She mentioned that she\u2019s engaged to you since young\u2026 Uuuu\u2026 How can you cheat my feelings? It\u2019s best\u2026 that you return to her side. Let us never meet ever again\u2026</p><br/><p>And then, that cousin encountered an assault and was eaten by a beast.</p><br/><p>The female lead said:</p><br/><p>Senior-martial brother Lang Chen, you\u2019re the disciple of Everday Clan, and your Sect Master strongly rejects us being together. He says that I\u2019m not worthy of you\u2026 It\u2019s best that we break up!</p><br/><p>And then, Everday Clan was annihilated.</p><br/><p>The female lead said:</p><br/><p>Hua Hao, you move my heart so incredibly so, but\u2026 the other beasties of Seero Forest all looking so terrifying\u2026 I don\u2019t dare to look at them.</p><br/><p>And then, the other beasties of Seero Forest were chased away.</p><br/><p>The female lead said: Hall Master Cao\u2026</p><br/><p>Balabala\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, no matter who was advertised by the female lead, murder would definitely occur in their surroundings. Countless cannon fodders were sacrificed. She was simply a mass murdering machine. With just her single word, a river of blood would flow.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was simply dumbfounded. Isn\u2019t this a little too unreal? She suddenly recalled the girly Yi Ling who had walked on a similar path, where both their harems were made of countless men. However, Fan Zhishan\u2019s was clearly of a much higher level. At the very least, the men by her side were not of the shallow \u2018love at first sight\u2019 type, but unconsciously grew attracted to her after getting to know one another.</p><br/><p>Though Zhu Yao still found it a little ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Fan Zhishan grew her harem while raising her cultivation and inserting advertisements. And then\u2026 the world collapsed.</p><br/><p>At the very final scene, the female lead finally stood at the summit of the cultivation world. Suddenly, the earth shook, and the entire world began to collapse, turning into nothingness at the very end.</p><br/><p>What was this situation?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was shocked. She did not understand at all? Though Fan Zhishan was a bug and had shot at a few cannon fodders, she did not bring about a world war, nor had she done anything remotely close to cause something as serious as the collapse of the world. Why did this suddenly happen?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Zhu Yao pointed at the screen and asked the former owner girl by her side. \u201cWhy did the world collapse just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s lips curled up, and she suddenly cried again. With a saddened look, she said. \u201cI died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d What did she mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cOver there\u2026 I\u2019m already dead.\u201d The girl once again said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Zhu Yao had a puzzled look. Within the scenario, the girl was also one of the crowd of cannon fodders. In the action film, Fan Zhishan advertised her to Hall Master Cao of Spirit Heaven Palace: Little sister Ling Tian became a Sect Master at such a young age, she\u2019s truly amazing\u2026 I can\u2019t even be compared to at all. She definitely doesn\u2019t like me\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus, that Hall Master Cao instantly overthrew the girl and had the female lead become the Sect Master. From this event, it proved that the female lead was the only shining moon in his heart, and other women could not even be compared to the toenails on her feet. Only the heavens knew that Sect Master Ling Tian had never even met the female lead.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, Ling Tian was this girl\u2019s name, and she was the final cannon fodder that was sacrificed in the scenario.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what does that have to do with the collapse of the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl rubbed her eyes, and said while sobbing. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a pillar of the world, it\u2019s final pillar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhu Yao was dumbfounded. She sized her up for a moment. Does a new term have to pop up here and now?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a pole at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a \u2018pole\u2019.\u201d The girl grew anxious. \u201cI\u2019m a form of existence that maintains the world\u2019s balance, preventing it from collapsing. If I\u2019m gone, this world will no longer be balanced.\u201d</p><br/><p>So she\u2019s not a pole, but a balancing scale?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re not human?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao grew even more confused. Then what\u2019s with this pillar deal?</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit told me that because a piece of this world was missing, as it was destroyed once before.\u201d The girl said seriously. \u201cThen, this missing piece was patched up before the world finally gained a new life. However, the patched piece after all did not belong to this world, yet it was something that could not be lacked. Thus, after this piece gained a spiritual consciousness, it went into a reincarnation cycle. The purpose was to make use of this method of reincarnation to slowly integrate the piece into this world. Coincidentally, I am that piece in this stage of reincarnation cycle, and it\u2019s also the final stage of integration. As long as this stage passes, this world will be complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, the integration this time is interrupted?\u201d Zhu Yao asked. \u201cYour death will cause the world to lose a piece, and thus cause the collapse of the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d The girl nodded, her face looked a little saddened. Suddenly, as though she had recalled something. \u201cNot just that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s something even worse than this\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

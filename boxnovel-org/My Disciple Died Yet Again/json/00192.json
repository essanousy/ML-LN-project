It was just moving houses, right? However, after arriving at the Nether Abyss, she realized she was too naive.</p><br/><p>Black Tortoise\u2019s sudden awakening had intensified the abnormal movements in the world. Various places were affected, and the place which was affected the most, was the Devil Sealing Grounds. After the seal was broken before, the Devils once again broke out of the seal, and the Gods, who already had severe losses, were being pushed back. They had no choice but to retreat to the Nether Abyss, preventing the Devils from fusing with the devillic aura within.</p><br/><p>The tragic degree of the scene they saw when Yue Gu and Zhu Yao arrived could no longer be described with mere words. The place was filled with Devils shrouded in black mist, and Gods battling while bathed in blood. The Gods had already been forced into a position where they could no longer retreat, while the number of Devils continued to increase, looking as though they could never be completely exterminated.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu summoned countless of heavenly lightning bolts, and began to open up a bloody path for them to charge forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time left. Hurry and head into where the Black Tortoise\u2019s Dantian resides.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded. Releasing her divine sense, she faintly sensed something was calling out to her on her right, and then, she flew straight in that direction. Only after arriving did she find out that it was a pool of water. It only had a size of a regular swimming pool, the water was not very deep, and the waterbed could be seen due to how clear it was.</p><br/><p>The moment she walked into the place, the entire pool radiated a white glow, and faintly, flashes of lightning sparks could be seen. The godly energy was so concentrated, it looked as though it could solidify at any moment. This was the Black Tortoise\u2019s godly energy! Zhu Yao was a little shocked. This was hundreds and thousands times more powerful that the amount she received when she was fixing the seal.</p><br/><p>Time was running out. Zhu Yao hurriedly walked. Just as she was about to enter the center of the pool and receive the godly energy to open the World Crossing Heavenly Door, a terrified voice suddenly reverberated from behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister!\u201d Shao Bai suddenly appeared at the side of the pool, and he was tensely watching her movements. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She knew that she would definitely encounter Shao Bai here. If she were to tell him that she\u2019s here to swim, would he believe her?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to open the World Crossing Heavenly Door.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWorld Crossing Heavenly Door!\u201d Shao Bai blanked for a moment, and as though he thought of something, the color on his face faded away. A moment later, pulling the corners of his lips, he revealed the same warm smile he always had, and reached out his hand. \u201cHow can opening the World Crossing Heavenly Door be such a simple task? Little sister, be obedient! Why don\u2019t you first come out of there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gritted her teeth, she decided to ignore his words. Turning around, she walked towards the center of the pool. Black Tortoise had already begun transferring his godly energy, how could she possibly leave now?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister!\u201d Shao Bai shouted loudly, his voice was no longer as calm as before, rather, it was filled with panic and fear. Wanting to enter the pool to chase her, he took a few steps forward, only to be forced back by the countless lightning sparks in the water. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Zhu Yao sat in a meditative posture at the very center of the pool, and smiled towards him. \u201cI\u2019m saving all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would we need you to save us?\u201d Shao Bai was even more anxious now. After casting an art, he took a step into the pool with a great difficulty, and once again reached out his hand towards her. \u201cLittle sister, be obedient. Your second elder brother promised that no matter what happens, I will always protect you. Come out of there for now, alright?\u201d His voice sank even more. When he was speaking the last few words, it even sounded as though he was begging her to stop.</p><br/><p>Having such an elder brother who doted her own so much, Zhu Yao was a little moved. However, if the Heavenly Door was not opened, they would not be able to live on. So in the very end, she would be the one earning from doing so.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, just take it as though second elder brother is begging you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao let out a sigh. She suddenly recalled the time when she was still an egg, the look Shao Bai had when he was willing to even use his blood to attack in order to protect her. She was fortunate to have such an elder brother, however\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Bai, actually, I\u2019m not a phoenix.\u201d Zhu Yao gathered her godly energy, and created a faint image of her original form \u2013 a green-skinned tortoise with the shadow of a snake faintly encircling its body. \u201cI\u2019m a Black Tortoise, not your little sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou being my little sister is unrelated to what your race you are.\u201d Shao Bai refuted, and still continued to persuade her. \u201cSecond elder brother doesn\u2019t care what you are, as long as you don\u2019t leave my side. So, be obedient\u2026 and come out, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Haah\u2026 Zhu Yao sighed, and lectured him with a smile. \u201cYou sis-con. I\u2019m actually older than you. I merely stayed in my egg for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I shall change my way of addressing you.\u201d Shao Bai was unexpectedly very easy to talk with. \u201cAs long as you come out, I will promise you anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still not understand, Shao Bai?\u201d Zhu Yao released her divine sense, and began to receive the ancient godly energy within the pool. \u201cBlack Tortoises have always been existences used as cornerstones for the sky and earth, and since I\u2019m a Black Tortoise, I will naturally integrate into this world one day, falling into deep slumber. Right now, I\u2019m merely using another method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about all that!\u201d Shao Bai\u2019s expression instantly changed, and a boundless, furious aura began to spread, withstanding the lightning suppression as he approached her a step at a time. \u201cThe only fact I know, is that you\u2019re my little sister. If there\u2019s really a need to save this world, you will never be the one to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai was persistent in pulling her out, and a faint madness could be seen from within his eyes. As though he was a wild beast whose bottom line had been crossed, the warmth and gentleness he had before had completely turned into violence and madness.</p><br/><p>However, how could lightning sparks formed by godly energy be so simple? In just a few moments, his body was already filled with injuries, yet, he still did not stop.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was struck with terror as she watched on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over.\u201d Zhu Yao was a little anxious. \u201cThis world isn\u2019t going to last. As long as the Heavenly Door is opened, everyone can be saved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what about you?\u201d He raised his head, and stared at her intensely.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d She would naturally get disconnected. Could it be that he knew of the consequences of forcefully opening the Heavenly Door, and hence wanted to prevent her from doing so?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf saving the world requires your life as the price, then what\u2019s the point in saving it?\u201d The aura surrounding Shao Bai instantly changed, as it grew even wilder than before. Yet, the eyes he were looking at her with were filled with inexplicable sadness. The look he had now, was completely the same as that skinny, frail child she saw when they first met. \u201cLittle sister, you clearly know that you\u2019re the only remaining person your second elder brother has. If you disappear as well, even if everyone is saved, what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heartstrings twitched. At this moment, she finally realized he had never walked out of that experience of being abandoned since the very beginning. No matter how warm of a smile he had on the surface, he was merely concealing it even deeper within himself. That was a scar that could break out at any moment, as long as his landmine was stepped on, then it could possibly explode. And she seemed to be that said landmine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be fine. I promise you.\u201d She could resurrect, after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t promise that!\u201d He had already arrived by her side, and pulled her into his tight embrace, as though he wanted to smother her. He buried his head next to her neck, and said with emphasis on every word. \u201cYou promised me. You promised that you wouldn\u2019t abandon me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt as though she had returned to that dark, skyless place. A frail and skinny child was tightly hugging onto an egg, like he was hugging onto the only belief that was keeping him alive, refusing to let go.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heartstrings pulled, and for a moment, she hated herself a little. Why had she not seen through Shao Bai\u2019s abnormalities? She should have seen through it long ago. Although he looked like he was treating others warmly on the surface, other than her, he had always been keeping a distance from anyone else. He did not even have a intimate relationship with his mother Qian Yu either. Furthermore, because of the matter of her being born prematurely, he hated Little Sixth to the extreme.</p><br/><p>He had always been the same child who treated her as the only person to depend on. The same child who maintained a sense of enmity towards the world. The same child who regarded her as his life.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gritted her teeth. A white light flashed in her palms, pushing Shao Bai away. The lightning sparks in the pool instantly disappeared as well, though this time, countless lightning sparks seemed to be surrounding her body. An immense amount of godly energy she had never felt before seemed to be emitting out from her body.</p><br/><p>She did not delay any further. Quickly making a few hand seals with her hands, she formed a formation, and slammed her palm downwards, instantly releasing all of her godly energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Shao Bai, who was blasted hundreds of meters away, shouted with a face filled with panic and fear.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a golden light shone brightly. Within an area of about ten meters around her, a heavenly pillar charged towards the skies, shattering directly across the skyline. For a moment, the entire skyline twisted. Countless of foreign illusory realms, like projections, appeared in the sky. There were dense forests, luxurious streets, and blessed lands filled with practitioners\u2026 Every single one of them represented a world out of the present three thousand worlds.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Door had opened\u2026</p><br/><p>The sounds of battle between the Gods and Devils paused in an instant, as everyone raised their heads to look at this mystical phenomenon.</p><br/><p>Twisting her palms, Zhu Yao once again cast another mystic art. Within the pillar of light, several rays of golden light were formed, and they flew to the various Gods and living creatures. After the rays of golden light had caught them, turning into what looked like soap bubbles, they flew straight towards the opened Heavenly Door.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s godly energy was currently depleting at an extremely fast rate, and she could only barely sustain the Heavenly Door, as she tried her best to allow even more living creatures pass through the Heavenly Door. As to which world they would go after entering the Heavenly Door, it was no longer something she could predict.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister!\u201d Shao Bai was also enclosed in those soap bubbles, smacking them as he wanted to get out. Presently, Zhu Yao had after all inherited the Black Tortoise\u2019s ancient godly energy, so how could she possibly let him out? Instead, she circulated her mystic art, and had him float towards the Heavenly Door.</p><br/><p>Watching as the Heavenly Door was closing in on him, Shao Bai\u2019s eyes instantly turned bloodshot. He desperately struggled, and even disregarded his own injuries, as he struck the small bubbles, only to have half of the energy reflected back at himself. Zhu Yao grew anxious as she watched, and her actions slowed down quite a bit. This madman.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sunk her thoughts, and planned to forcefully push him through.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, within the bubbles, a red light shone. With a crackling sound, the bubbles shattered, and following after a cry that resounded through the clouds, a phoenix whose body was dyed completely in black rose into the skies, several streams of black water gently flowed around its body.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was completely dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>This was Shao Bai!?</p><br/><p>Why did he suddenly change?</p><br/><p>That black phoenix had only appeared for an instant. After Shao Bai broke through the bubbles, he regained his human form and flew over, most likely wanting to prevent her from sustaining the Heavenly Door. However, he was stopped by a white figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Gu!\u201d Shao Bai\u2019s expression was filled with cold intent. \u201cYou dare stop me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my disciple\u2019s own choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai\u2019s fury felt as though it was about to take up a solid form, as he sent an attack straight towards him. \u201cYou can stand by and watch as she send herself to death, but I can\u2019t!\u201d He threw an icicle towards him. \u201cI\u2019m going to save her. Whoever blocks my path, shall die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was only focusing on sustaining the Heavenly Door. Finally, all of the bubbles had passed through the Heavenly Door, and only two people remained in the sky, along with a sky filled with Devils.</p><br/><p>For an instant, she even had the feeling to cuss at her own mom. Momma\u2019s egg, is this really the time to fight among themselves? The two of them were dealing with the Devils while fighting among themselves like it was nobody\u2019s business.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, let him come over.\u201d Zhu Yao retracted a strand of godly energy, and sent a voice transmission to Yue Gu in the sky. Shao Bai had already flew straight towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, hurry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao flung a wind mystic art towards him, taking the opportunity when he had yet to react, she pulled the spoilt child into the pillar of light. In times like this, she shouldn\u2019t talk reason with him.</p><br/><p>Shock, fear, pain, disappointment, unwillingness, and various other emotions flashed past Shao Bai\u2019s face, yet his figure had slowly disappeared into the pillar of light.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao cough out a mouthful of blood. As she had constantly released her godly energy, she felt that her entire body was about to crumble.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, hurry and get in!\u201d She couldn\u2019t sustain it any longer.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu did not respond. Instead, from afar, he reached out his hand towards her, and did a head-patting action. Turning his head, he looked towards the Devils which had already occupied the entire sky and earth. \u201cI can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher!\u201d Zhu Yao was anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the final ancient God in this world. The Heavenly Dao will not allow me to leave.\u201d Her teacher still had that same emotionless look, as though the matter he was discussing did not concern his life and death. Raising the corners of his lips, he suddenly sent her a very stunning smile. \u201cDisciple, I will accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She suddenly sensed a familiar ripple of godly energy coming from Yue Gu\u2019s direction. An immense amount of godly energy spread in all directions like fireworks. Wherever it went, the Devils that made contact with it would turn into ash.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s godly energy had already been depleted, and the Heavenly Door closed right after. The familiar darkness began its assault, and she suddenly recalled the mystic art that Yue Gu just invoked.</p><br/><p>Devil Smiting Inscription. It was the only mystic art in the world that could exterminate Devils. Her teacher had said that he could only use it twice in his lifetime, and this was his second time.</p><br/><p>In the last second before she closed her eyes, she could faintly hear his sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, what a pity. Your teacher here has yet to ask for your real name\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

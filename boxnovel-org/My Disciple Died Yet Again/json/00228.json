No matter how strong one gets, it\u2019s impossible to be stronger than heaven\u2019s will and resist against the Heavenly Dao. But, the \u2018World Favourable Impression\u2019 Achievement broke this rule. So\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at the conversation window, and said with certainty. \u201cEither you\u2019re an existence comparable or even above the Heavenly Dao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, is there something wrong with my conjecture?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: It\u2019s not wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: I suddenly realized your IQ has made its way back home. Congratulations!</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. \u201cSince you\u2019re so powerful, then you should be able to casually deal with those bugs that I fixed, so why do you have to pull me over? Or\u2026 is the world that I live in in your control as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: You\u2019re wrong, young maiden.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: You should know this right? There are many planes in the spatial void, and there are even more small worlds under each plane, just like the Three Thousand Worlds that you saw. As for you, you were living in another plane.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you drag me over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Because we\u2019re friends, young maiden.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d You must have plotted this right from the start, right? Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have chatted with me for so many years on QQ, before revealing your true intentions.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Haah, young maiden. In truth, having too much power doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good thing. Putting aside the fact that I have no vacation all year round, I have to work without getting paid. It\u2019s really sad, you know? Occasionally, I will get sick, and I don\u2019t have any medical insurance to speak of, not to mention there isn\u2019t a doctor I can look for. I have to support myself with my own immune system, you know.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak human!\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: This old man can\u2019t fix these bugs, and you\u2019re the only one capable of doing it?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can even bend the Heavenly Dao, you\u2019re telling me you can\u2019t fix these little bugs?\u201d Zhu Yao expressed her doubts.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: No one is perfect, young maiden.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re simply looking for someone to help you protect world peace\u2026\u201d Uh, something seemed strange with what she said? \u201cThere\u2019s so many people in the Three Realms, can\u2019t you just pick out someone randomly? Why did you have to go all the way out to trick someone from another plane over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Trick\u2026 Young maiden, you\u2019re harming the friendship between us.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Our friendship has long shattered into pieces, alright? \u201cJust why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: No one in the Three Realms can do it. They are beings that are born in this world, so they are affected by the Heavenly Dao of this place. Just like Yi Ling\u2019s situation, since she possessed incredible luck, people who were affected by this luck of hers would be unable to escape, and everyone would unconsciously submit to her luck. However, you\u2019re different. You don\u2019t belong in this world in the first place, nor do you belong in the same plane. The Heavenly Dao simply can\u2019t do anything to you.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what you\u2019re saying, no one is able to escape from Mary Sue\u2019s cheat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: The luck that everyone possesses, carries a purpose given by the Heavenly Dao. The luck present in Yi Ling\u2019s body was to keep the Devil in check in the first place. Yi Ling who carried incredible luck would not encounter any danger next to the Devil. Then, the Devil would suppress his instincts, and his nature as a Devil would have slowly disappeared. This was the goal of the Heavenly Dao.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what you\u2019re saying, if I didn\u2019t go to that world, Yan Chi would have fallen in love with Yi Ling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: In the beginning, yes. However, luck can be controlled, but one\u2019s heart is difficult to perceive. Not only did Yi Ling\u2019s luck affect the Devil, it had affected others as well. The Devil who could not obtain what he wished for, instead had his nature strengthened, and then brought about the collapse of the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying, Yi Ling was initially a patch came up by the Heavenly Dao, but not only did it not end up fixing the problem, it turned into a bug instead.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Young maiden, you\u2019re too clever. I like you.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut when I saw the Devil, forget about falling in love with Yi Ling, he clearly wanted to kill Yi Ling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Everyone\u2019s luck is different. Someone with little luck would be affected by someone else who has more luck. The reason why Yan Chi did not end up loving Yi Ling was because her luck was affected by your World Favourable Impression Achievement. Thus, she no longer carried the incredible luck she once had before. In the end, when you fully activated your World Favourable Impression Achievement, the excess luck within her disappeared, and she was no longer a bug.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cFrom what you\u2019re saying, since the Heavenly Dao could cause a bug to appear just by casually distributing some luck, wouldn\u2019t I be stuck fixing bugs forever? Just how long more must I patch these brain-crippling bugs? I\u2019m not even someone from your plane, so I don\u2019t have any reason to continue working for you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Isn\u2019t this great though, young maiden? The heavens are helping you, in the truest sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho!\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t use such words to deceive me. You wouldn\u2019t drag someone from another plane and drop her into what evidently seemed like a dead loop for no reason. There\u2019s definitely another reason. Be honest now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Young maiden, if you\u2019re so serious, you won\u2019t look cute, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Now is still not the time yet, you still have yet to completely understand everything. However, I can guarantee you that you won\u2019t continue fixing bugs for long.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your guarantee of any use?\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. Back then he even made a promise, yet it still turned out the same. There wasn\u2019t any value in his words at all.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: \u2026 Come on, we\u2019re friends for so many years, give me some face. Life is so harsh, there are things you can\u2019t tear apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur friendship ends here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: \u2026 ORZ</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d Zhu Yao took in a deep breath. If Realmspirit really did not want to talk about it, there wasn\u2019t any use even if she pressed on.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Oh mighty ancestor Zhu. (\u256f3\u2570)</p><br/><p>Countless small flowers instantly flooded the QQ screen, and in a flash, the familiar reincarnation loading screen appeared.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao watched the moving loading bar. After a while, she could not help but raise her head and add on.</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit, to tell you the truth, I really hope you will always remember the friendship we have, and don\u2019t dupe me too miserably. Though I\u2019m not from your plane, I\u2019m still a regular human being.\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving these words, her figure flashed, disappearing amidst the darkness.</p><br/><p>Only a conversation window was left hanging high within that space, and after a moment, it vibrated and disappeared. A moment later, a solemn voice rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao opened her eyes again, her vision was still filled with darkness. If not for a few moving black figures in her line of sight, she would have thought that the reincarnation loading screen had hanged!</p><br/><p>Rubbing her eyes, just as she was about to clear up her vision, an urging voice suddenly sounded from behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you dilly-dallying for? Hurry and catch up!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she turned around, what came in sight was a pale face with fanged teeth. Dressed in white cloth, his hair was dishevelled and his pair of eyes was protruding out. Blood was flowing out from his seven orifices, and his tongue was even stretched all the way down to his chin. He looked extremely like a certain Sadako crawling out from the television.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took in a cold breath, as several hundreds of horror films instantly surfaced in her mind. A scream instantly pierced through the horizon. \u201cGhoooost\u2014\u2013!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sadako covered her ears and floated several meters away. Her eyes protruded out even more, as though she was furiously glaring at her. After sizing Zhu Yao up for a moment, she said. \u201cWhy are you shouting? You sound as though you\u2019re not a ghost yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao refuted on reflex. When she lowered her head to take a look, what she saw was her two floating feet, and then she screamed out once again. \u201cGhooooost\u2014\u2013!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

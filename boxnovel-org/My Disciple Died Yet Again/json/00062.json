How could he think that she was a man!?</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, she used her hands to tidy up her clothes, however, she felt there was something additional in between her legs, and suddenly had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>She turned, and silently pulled out her pants\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No, no, no. There must definitely be something wrong with the way she pulled out her pants. How could she have an additional organ? Let\u2019s try again.</p><br/><p>She pulled her pants out again\u2026</p><br/><p>And closed it! She must definitely be seeing things.</p><br/><p>Rubbing her eyes, she once again pulled out her pants\u2026</p><br/><p>And closed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao screamed out.</p><br/><p>Why!? Why!? Why!? Why!? Why did I change into a man!? This doesn\u2019t make sense!</p><br/><p>The reason why she resurrected next to a rock, was so as to make it convenient for her to knock herself to death?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt terrible, and could deeply sense the evil intentions of this entire world.</p><br/><p>Whoever you are, come out! Let us talk about life!</p><br/><p>\u201cChick?\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of her, a green light flashed, and a green-colored thing leapt out.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at this bonsai which just appeared right in front of her, and it was even not even rooted in soil. It gave a quite a scare.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>That bonsai leapt forward, curled its little branch, and rubbed it against her leg. \u201cChick~\u201d</p><br/><p>This familiar voice\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Wood Spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChick!\u201d The bonsai nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here? And you even grew up so suddenly?\u201d Zhu Yao stared at it a little shockingly. Back then, when it was in that chest, it was still a little beansprout, and it even only had two leaves. How did it suddenly turn into a bonsai?</p><br/><p>\u201cChick, chick chick chick chick chick\u2026\u201d The Wood Spirit strongly waved around its little branches, as though it was explaining to her.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, she did not understand a single thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it! It\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re still alive!\u201d Back then, as she was panicking, she placed it into her divine sense. She did not expect that it would follow her along with her after her resurrection. Zhu Yao stroked its little leaf. It couldn\u2019t really grow into a tree, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cChick!\u201d The Wood Spirit stretched out two little vines, forming two small arcs. Then, it connected them together, forming a heart shape.</p><br/><p>Was this\u2026 giving her praise?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt it was a little funny, and strongly stroked its leaf, yet, she touched something slippery.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeoow~\u201d A little beast head popped out of the leaf, it\u2019s a miniature-sized ferocious face. It was actually that mystic beast.</p><br/><p>Reflexively, Zhu Yao\u2019s stroke turned into a slap, and the slap swung right towards it.</p><br/><p>And then, a \u2018pa\u2019 sound was heard. Gurururu. The mystic beast rolled a dozen of rounds, was sent a good few meters out, and only stopped when it struck onto a tree trunk.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe\u2026ow\u2026\u201d The miniature-sized mystic beast crawled up with a pitiful look, as though it was hurt from the fall, it limped its way back to her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart clenched, and activated all of her defensive mechanisms. She had not forgotten how ferocious this mystic beast was in the Secret Realm. She habitually thought of summoning her own flying sword, only to realize that she did not have a single thread of spiritual energy in her body. The hell, damnable resurrection debuff.</p><br/><p>She turned around and carried up the rock beside her. Even if she did not have any spiritual energy, she still had physical strength. \u201cDon\u2019t come near me! If you come any closer\u2026 I will smash you to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mystic beast was startled. Its pair of black slippery eyes looked directly at her\u2026 looked at her\u2026</p><br/><p>And then, slowly, a layer of mist rose, as though it was about to cry in the very next moment.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao who was carrying the rock: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, you\u2019re the one bullying people. What are you trying to pull here?</p><br/><p>\u201cWuu\u2026 wawawa\u2026\u201d As expected, that mystic beast laid on the ground, pedaled its paws, and began to wail out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop crying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaawaa\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t smash you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaaaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really won\u2019t smash you, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaaaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaaaa\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The crying stopped.</p><br/><p>It just had to make her angry. Zhu Yao felt a terrible headache. Walking over, she squatted next to the miniature-sized mystic beast, and poked its little head. \u201cTell me, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are you planning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow, your ass!\u201d Zhu Yao raised her hand and gave it a slap. \u201cYou\u2019re still acting? Don\u2019t think I\u2019m unaware that you\u2019re able to speak.\u201d That old man in the Secret Realm had already said it, this thing descended from the Higher Realm. Demonic beasts that did not possess the ability to shapeshift, would be able to change its form after reaching the tenth-rank. At the very least, it was an eleventh-ranked demonic beast, so it was impossible for it to be unable to speak.</p><br/><p>The mystic beast used its two front paws to stroke the part of the head she smacked, while it continued to look at her with a pitiful look, and weakly squeezed out a response. \u201cIt hurts~\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. She hugged and cracked her fists, emitting crackling sounds, as she said with a cold smile. \u201cDo you believe that I will hurt you even more?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mystic beast\u2019s expression paled, and instantly properly knelt down. Fearfully looking at her, its little eyes rolled. \u201cI dropped into the Severed Lands as well, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLies!\u201d Zhu Yao once again gave it a slap. \u201cThe number of things that fell into the Severed Lands were many, why are you the only one here then? Are you thinking I\u2019m dumb!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It lowered its head, and looked as though it admitted its mistake. \u201cBefore I fell, I\u2026 I hid inside your divine sense as well, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned, this might be a possibility. Back then, she was only holding onto her last breath, if someone were to take that opportunity to enter her divine sense, it would be absolutely easy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you become like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mystic beast\u2019s tone was filled with even more sadness. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. My cultivation is still present, yet, there\u2019s not a single strand of spiritual power in my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because you did not charge your batteries. Zhu Yao instantly understood that its situation was the same as hers. They just had to get struck by lightning, and the issue would be solved.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you hide inside the Wood Spirit?\u201d Zhu Yao continued to ask. \u201cSince you\u2019re already out here, shouldn\u2019t you take the opportunity when I\u2019m unprepared, and run far, far away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I wish to follow you.\u201d The mystic beast embarrassingly scraped the floor with its claws.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very strong!\u201d Its pair of eyes suddenly looked towards her, as though it had seen its idol, sparkling stars filled its eyes.</p><br/><p>He had never seen anyone capable of reviving from the dead, even if it was in the Higher Realm, he had not seen one either. And at the moment when she resurrected, he could faintly sense the presence of a thread of Heavenly Will. \u201cIf I were to follow you, I will definitely be able to return to the Higher Realm sooner. I can help you, and I can even become your contracted beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao replied it with a simple \u201cHoho!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how friendly he looked, it was still a demonic beast. Earlier, it was still her enemy, and had fought with the intention to kill.</p><br/><p>What she could not forgive the most was, it even injured her master. That was simply unforgivable.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t go!\u201d The mystic beast became a little anxious, and directly hugged onto her legs, as it was dragged along as she walked. \u201cI\u2019m really useful. I\u2019m an eleventh-rank. There\u2019s very few demonic beasts in this world that\u2019s capable of going against me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Continue walking\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMy nose is very sensitive, I can help you find spiritual herbs\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can help you find spiritual weapons\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can even help you rein in demonic beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I can even help you warm up your bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt she had been marked by that mystic beast. No matter where she went, it would follow. And as it followed, it would let out very pitiful \u2018wuuwuu\u2019 sounds. She could not bother to deal with it, in any case, currently, it did not have any spiritual power, so it was unable to hurt her.</p><br/><p>Keeping the Wood Spirit in her divine sense once again, Zhu Yao planned on returning to Jade Forest Mountain first. At the very least, she had to inform her master of her well-being. And, according to her previous experience, another hundred years should have passed again.</p><br/><p>Back then, when she was killed by the fox demon, her master had actually destroyed the entire Silent Melancholy Forest out of anger. This time, she forcefully sent her master out of \u201cTasyoluk\u201d, he might even be more furious.</p><br/><p>What she was even more worried about was Wang Xuzhi. That little wimp had always acted on impulse, without caring about the consequences. She was afraid that if she was not looking, he would run to find Xiao Yi and seek his own death again.</p><br/><p>The more she thought about it, the more worried she became. After inspecting her vicinity, this place should be one of the teleportation formations that were set up by the sect in various locations. The actual distance to Ancient Hill Sect was actually really far. Looking at the three large words \u201cAncient Hill Sect\u201d that were written on the rock, she walked into the teleportation formation beside it.</p><br/><p>With a flash of light, she had arrived on an island in the seas. And in the sky above the island, were several floating mountains. This was exactly the scenery she was familiar with.</p><br/><p>She had returned.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head and looked at the tallest mountain that was floating there, and instantly felt a peaceful sensation. She really wanted to immediately fly over, and hug that stupid and lacking master who had always played a fool out of his own disciple.</p><br/><p>Then here came the problem\u2026</p><br/><p>How was she going to go back? Her Dantian was absolutely empty, and did not have even a single thread of spiritual energy. She was completely unable to fly at all!</p><br/><p>Raising her head, she looked at the disciples flying about in the sky. Zhu Yao felt deeply saddened, as she hoped for a disciple to notice her, and bring her up the mountain, before finding an excuse to return to the Jade Forest Mountain.</p><br/><p>However, she had waited for half a day, although there were many people flying about in the sky, not one of them took a look at the island here. Every single of them was rushing in and out.</p><br/><p>Especially that one who was flying especially fast, with a flash of his white figure, he disappeared without a trace. Not even his figure could be clearly seen, before he disappeared with a whoosh.</p><br/><p>And with another whoosh, he returned.</p><br/><p>Ehhhhhh! The hell! He really came back!</p><br/><p>The white figure flashed, and a figure dressed in snow-white clothes stopped in front of her. That face, which looked as though a thousand years of ice had covered it, was emitting out a cold aura, as though she would obtain frostbites if she were to go take a single step closer.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan stared straight at the unfamiliar youth in front of him, and did not say a single word for a long time.</p><br/><p>Disciple?</p><br/><p>No wait, why is he male?</p><br/><p>However, on his body, there\u2019s clearly the presence of a strand of his own divine sense. His disciple had all along been stupid, and was even specialized in courting death in various ways, it might be just a disguise.</p><br/><p>Master. Zhu Yao felt so moved, she was about to cry. As she thought, her master was reliable, he was here to pick her back again. Her voice choked out, and she was just about to charge forward and hug his legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cMas\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could even finish, Yu Yan suddenly took a few fast steps, and stood a step away from Zhu Yao. He gently reached out his hand to hold onto her collar, and then\u2026</p><br/><p>With a whoosh, it was pulled open. The action was crisp and without the slightest of hesitation.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, whose clothes were pulled apart: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Flat!? Yu Yan felt a little conflicted. He inspected her chest twice, and then, his light of sight slowly moved towards her lower body.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Reflexively, Zhu Yao tightly grabbed onto the top of her pants, and screamed. \u201cIf you dare to take off my pants, I will dare to destroy you, my master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if she had turned into a man, there was no need for him to strip her naked in their first meeting, right!?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned, and only then did he take back his hand. He stared at the unfamiliar man in front of him, and was still uncertain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

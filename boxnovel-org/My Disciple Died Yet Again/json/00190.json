However, this time, the losses made by the God race were miserably heavy. Among the clansmen who were sent by the various races to guard the place, eighty to ninety percent of them lost their lives, and only a small number of them survived. It must be known that those who were qualified to guard the sealing grounds, were clansmen who possessed extraordinary godly powers within their respective clans. This escape made by the Devils had greatly diminished the strength of the God races. If another one were to occur, they wouldn\u2019t be this fortunate to have the seal restored again.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had overexerted her godly energy. Though it was strangely replenished after that, it after all wasn\u2019t her own godly energy. After the activation of the seal, the godly energy disappeared, and she was unconscious for two whole days. When she woke up, she realized she had returned to the straw cottage in the extreme northern lands.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little worried about Little Sixth\u2019s injuries, and had wanted to ask her teacher for a vacation leave. However, when she returned to the Parasol Tree to take a look, she still couldn\u2019t find even Yue Gu\u2019s shadow after searching all around the place.</p><br/><p>Was \u2018occasional disappearance\u2019 a prerequisite skill for every master?</p><br/><p>Without any ideas in mind, she could only meditate and recuperate. When the sun began to set, she finally saw a figure flying back from the far skies. A moment later, he had already descended in front of her, and there was even another person standing next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister.\u201d The person who came back with him was Shao Bai. The moment he landed on the ground, he hastily walked towards her, his expression carried several hints of restlessness. \u201cWhy have you gotten up? How\u2019s your body? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\u201d He pulled her and began to carefully inspect her body.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pressed down his hand. \u201cShao Bai, why have you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did he reveal a light smile, and his expression recovered that familiar warmth. Reaching out his hand, he helped her tidy up her hair. \u201cI have already been here for two days. You\u2019re injured, so why wouldn\u2019t I come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Zhu Yao gave him a relieved smile. \u201cJust that I have overused my godly energy, I will be fine in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOverused your godly energy?\u201d Shao Bai\u2019s expression paled, as he immediately pulled her hand and measured her pulse.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have pretty much recovered.\u201d She had already tested it herself when she woke up. More than half of her godly energy had been restored, at least fifty percent of her battery had been charged.</p><br/><p>Shao Bai measured for a few moments, yet, his brows sunk even deeper, and his expression became even more complicated. The corner of his lips moved, as though he wanted to give her a small lecture, but in the end, he merely let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Nan.\u201d Yue Gu walked over as well, his expression looked stern. With a serious look, he said. \u201cYou have done well for this incident.\u201d With praising intentions, he raised his hand, and gently stroked the head in front of him. \u201cAlthough you were a little slow, you still managed to restore the seal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Gu did not praise people often, at the very least, this was the first time she saw him praising someone so directly ever since she went to the extreme northern lands. Zhu Yao was a little happy.</p><br/><p>If his hand had not landed on Shao Bai\u2019s head, the effect would have been better.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao evidently saw Shao Bai\u2019s face, which was filled with a warm smile, stiffen for a moment. Silently passing Shao Bai an apologetic gaze, she pulled down a certain person\u2019s evil paw. Sorry, he hasn\u2019t taken his meds today.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a good rest these few days, there\u2019s no need to rush in learning your mystic arts.\u201d Yue Gu gave her a few instructions, and then nodded towards Shao Bai. Then, he turned around and left, so that he wouldn\u2019t interrupt these siblings catching up.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Bai. About the Phoenix clan\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao asked a little anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me second elder brother.\u201d Shao Bai flicked his finger on her forehead, before answering. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s manageable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about Little Sixth?\u201d Recalling the prejudice Shao Bai had towards Little Sixth, she could not help but add a few words. \u201cThis time, when I was restoring the seal, I was fortunate to have Little Sixth guard me, otherwise\u2026 He was injured because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, his expression sank a little, though, at the very least, he did evidently frown like before as he stroked her head. \u201cI know.\u201d Taking a deep breath, his smile grew even warmer, as he moved away from the topic. \u201cSecond elder brother has brought you some things.\u201d With a twist of his hand, he summoned a basket. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that you like to eat. If there isn\u2019t enough, second elder brother will get more of them for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, a white figure flashed beside them. Yue Gu, who had yet to walk far away, had made an u-turn, and blew himself back like a gust of wind. He stared deeply at\u2026 the basket in Shao Bai\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Gu: \u201cYou two can continue.\u201d He\u2019s just staring.</p><br/><p>Stare~~~</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. This ancient glutton! Letting out a deep sigh, she took the basket off Shao Bai\u2019s hands. A certain pair of eyes then instantly shifted to where her hands were. Zhu Yao could even feel that her fingertips were turning hot from his stares, and she had no choice but to pass it over to him.</p><br/><p>A certain person took it with a satisfied look, and gave her a \u2018good disciple\u2019 gaze. Casually, he scooped up a dried fruit, and nibbled on it with a noble and glamorous look, while turning his head to look at Shao Bai\u2019s hands, as though he was waiting for him to pull out something again. He no longer brought up any intentions of leaving.</p><br/><p>Teacher, where\u2019s your morals as an ancient God? She really wanted to severe their teacher and student relationship.</p><br/><p>Under these intense stares, Zhu Yao simply could not make small talk with Shao Bai without being distracted, let alone removing the knot in her heart regarding Little Sixth. Shao Bai hastily left her a few words, and then headed off. Before he left, he passed her a wooden carved bracelet. \u201cThis is made by the wood of the Parasol Tree, and it can be used to suppress devillic aura. Remember to wear it at all times.\u201d After saying that, he purposefully moved closer to her ear, and sent a voice transmission. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, second elder brother prepared another bag of them in the bracelet.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he even gave a meaningful glance at Yue Gu, and then reluctantly walked away. Zhu Yao was speechless. Just why did he think that she liked eating snacks?</p><br/><p>Five days later, Zhu Yao\u2019s godly energy had completely recovered, and there was a faint feeling of it increasing in capacity. Just as she was getting pumped up and planning to give everything she had, Yue Gu began to slack off. Not only did he not teach her any mystic arts, he neglected his duties, and brought her on hunting expeditions all around the mountain all day. As long as he spotted a living creature, he would catch it and request her to cook it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, that\u2019s a grasshopper, it can\u2019t be eaten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, that\u2019s a snake. It\u2019s poisonous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, can you let that sparrow go? It\u2019s not even as large as your palm yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, release that panda. You really can\u2019t eat that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, it\u2019s true you can eat apples, but that one has already turned into a spirit. Can\u2019t you see it crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao let out a deep sigh. Resigning to her fate, she took out the bag of snacks from the storage bracelet, and passed it to him with her two hands. I will be honest and turn this over to higher management, alright? So please, conduct your lessons.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu was startled for a moment, before receiving it with a calm look. He took out a dried fruit, and finished it in two bites. \u201cDisciple, from tomorrow onwards, why don\u2019t you teach your teacher how to tie his hair?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Was this for real? Wasn\u2019t he unwilling to learn because he always had clumsy hands?</p><br/><p>Why did he suddenly have a change of mind?</p><br/><p>Yue Gu closed the bag, and placed it back onto her hands. Suddenly, the corners of his lips curved up. \u201cYour teacher suddenly wants to learn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What?</p><br/><p>Yue Gu said with a stern look. \u201cYour teacher has always not mind about things when it doesn\u2019t concern his physical condition. But I can\u2019t always have you help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at the bag of snacks on her hands, and then glanced at his smiling expression. She could not help but reach out to touch his forehead. Her teacher couldn\u2019t possibly this normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you don\u2019t have a fever, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Three days later, Zhu Yao really felt that Yue Gu was having a fever. Not only did he not snatch her snacks out of nowhere, he even took the initiative to learn the various life skills. From hairstyling, to cooking, and to making various living necessities. And she had even recently learnt how to do make-up.</p><br/><p>Although the hair he tied would mostly end up like a chicken\u2019s nest, the dishes he cooked would all turn charred black, the various furniture would be missing an arm or a leg, and the things he sewed would all turn into torn cloth, he seemed to have suddenly understood the importance of life skills, as he was learning them especially seriously.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he was determined in not having her intervene, he had rather have a chicken\u2019s nest on his head every day and have it shake everywhere. No matter what, he was insistent on doing it on his own. This sudden change in personality had made Zhu Yao suspect if his body had actually been taken over, if not for the same, calm \u201cit\u2019s not me who did it\u201d expression he had no matter how many times he failed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao thus spent every day watching him fail on various tasks, and of course, she had put aside the matter of learning mystic arts.</p><br/><p>Just who was the master, and who was the disciple here?</p><br/><p>This situation lasted for a month, and it only began to improve when the three Patriarchs suddenly came to the extreme northern lands.</p><br/><p>The three Patriarchs came this time to first ask about the matter regarding the Revelation that day. Back then, Yue Gu once promised that he would inform the various clans once he made a conclusion. The second matter, however, was a grave matter that was causing everyone to feel great fear and unease.</p><br/><p>For some unknown reasons, ever since the incident where the Devils broke through the first layer seal of the Devil Sealing Grounds, not a single one of those Phoenix clansmen who died on the frontlines had yet to resurrect even till now. Initially, a phoenix whose lifespan was depleted would resurrect from the flames of Nirvana. However, a month had passed, yet not a single one of those phoenixes who passed away had summoned the Nirvana\u2019s flames.</p><br/><p>And not just that, even the children of the Dragon clan had encountered problems. The dragon eggs within the Dragon Mountain had long reached their dates of birth, yet, the little dragons within their eggs still had yet to break out from their shells. And the presences within were growing weaker each day, as though they could disappear at any moment.</p><br/><p>Although the qilins had always been given birth through the mothers\u2019 wombs, and it was still unknown if there\u2019s any birth crisis, seeing that two out of three God races had encountered problems, they could not help but feel flustered as well.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu was the only remaining ancient God in the world. If there\u2019s anyone who could give them answers for this strange phenomenon, it could only be him. Hence, after a lengthy discussion, the three Patriarchs decided to visit the extreme northern lands.</p><br/><p>\u201cHighgod, the bloodline of the God races cannot be severed. Without the protection of the God races, I\u2019m afraid the Devils will no longer have any obstacles once they return to the world.\u201d Qian Yu carried a heavy expression, her brows clearly showed her anxiety.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, even Yue Gu was unable to give them an answer. He simply raised his head and looked into the distant skies, letting out a light sigh. \u201cEverything is dictated by the Heavenly Dao. Even we are powerless to resist it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three Patriarchs could only return with disappointment on their faces.</p><br/><p>Seeing the three ashen figures, Zhu Yao faintly felt a little depressed. Generations of the three God races had guarded the seal for so many years, and in the end, they had to welcome the crisis of the end. No matter who it was, he or she wouldn\u2019t be able to wrap their heads around it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, is there really no way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Gu turned his head, and stared at her for a few moments. He then reached out his hand to stroke her head, and gently said. \u201cThere might be one, and there might not be one\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not understand. However, in the following days, the situation seemed to have grown even worse. The earthshaking situation that happened before, occurred once again. It was as though the entire world was shaking. Back then during such a situation, the Parasol Tree fell, and the Devils even broke out from the seal.</p><br/><p>This time, she still did not know what the consequences were, but evidently, they wouldn\u2019t be too hopeful either.</p><br/><p>However, her teacher was not as anxious as before. Instead, he stayed in the extreme northern lands with a calm look, seriously practicing his messy life skills. And, he even became especially tolerant with her, as though his \u201cdisciple trolling\u201d buff had been removed. Not only had he evidently improved from his studies, he was beginning to worry about her when it came to living necessities. He was becoming more like her actual master Yu Yan.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt that this was a little strange. She had an inkling that there was something wrong with his attitude, but she couldn\u2019t put it into words.</p><br/><p>But she was beginning to grow restless. It was impossible for the Devil Sealing Grounds to be completely intact, and she was worried about Little Sixth and Shao Bai. Thus, she tried bringing up the topic of heading over there to take a look.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu stared at her for a long while, to the point where she thought that he was going to object her decision. However, what she got in reply was a heavy sigh. \u201cDo you truly want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu turned solemn, and the eyes he was looking at her with was mixed with various emotions, which was hard to discern by others. Finally, he still reached out to stroke her head, and said these two words. \u201cGo then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s mixed emotions miraculously calmed down, though, even after flying out of the extreme northern lands, she still could not understand what\u2019s the meaning behind the look in his eyes. Raising her head, she looked at the approaching skies, and for some reason, she suddenly recalled the man who was standing on top of that gigantic tortoise head. Her feet stopped, and then, she turned and headed in that direction.</p><br/><p>She did not know why she wanted to head there either. But she faintly sensed that she would able to obtain the things she wanted over there.</p><br/><p>As she approached that place, all the events that happened ever since she first came into this world suddenly appeared in her mind. When she broke out of the egg shell prematurely, the inheritance stones at the Terrace of Revelations, the earthshaking phenomenon, the gigantic \u2018bug\u2019 on the tortoise\u2019s head, that strangely intimate-looking man, the words in the Revelation, and the pool of godly energy that suddenly came when she was restoring the seal\u2026</p><br/><p>Her mind was in a mess, until the shadow of the gigantic tortoise gradually revealed itself before her eyes, along with the man who was still smiling warmly at her within the fog.</p><br/><p>A \u2018ding\u2019 sound suddenly reverberated in her mind. All the dots had been connected. All of the things that she were confused about and did not understand, were instantly as clear as day.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, who found out the truth, simply wanted to cuss out!</p><br/><p>What the freaking hell!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

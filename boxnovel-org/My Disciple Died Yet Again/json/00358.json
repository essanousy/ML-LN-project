It\u2019s time for you to grow up. I\u2019ve already told you this many times, that it\u2019s time for you to grow up! You must walk out on your own. In the past, I felt that I could pull you out, but in the end\u2026 I\u2019m sorry! There\u2019s nothing I can do now. I can\u2019t forgive your mistakes forever. That\u2019s why, even if you follow me from behind for your entire life, I can never trust you again. It\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid that if I forgive you this time, you will do something that will pierce my heart even deeper next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Yao\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m wrong.\u201d He raised his head, his eyes were filled with anxiety, regret, and even deep despair. He wanted to grab onto the corner of her robe, but he was afraid that it would make her even angrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear this.\u201d Zhu Yao shook her head. \u201cI can no longer distinguish truths and lies from your words. However, Yue Ying\u2026\u201d Her expression turned cold, and in an instant, she released a killing intent which he had never seen being emitted from her before. \u201cIf there comes a day where you do something similar once more, I won\u2019t mind killing you with my own hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>His figure stiffened, as though he could fall at any moment. However, he could not stop Zhu Yao from saying those heartless words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, from now on, I won\u2019t rule out using the most cruelest method to condemn all your actions. You are no longer my little brother, and I don\u2019t want to become your big sister again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis\u2026\u201d His voice was filled with so much despair, that it could scatter with a light breeze.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao let out a deep sigh. \u201cYue Ying, you\u2019ve disappointed me too much, disappointed me to the point of despair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I really know my wrongs now\u2026 Big sis Yao, you must believe me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shook her head. \u201cIf you really know your wrongs, you wouldn\u2019t plead me to believe you, but prove it with your actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>After making it clear to Yue Ying, Zhu Yao no longer paid attention to him. Though, she wondered just what was going through his mind, as he still continued to follow after her without making a sound, like a wandering ghost. However, he was no longer that skinny and frail child, instead, he reverted back to the heaven-defying looks that Shao Bai once had.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao wanted to scratch his face in her anger. However, even if she tried to chase him away, he wouldn\u2019t leave, even if she were to scold him, he wouldn\u2019t refute, and even if she fought\u2026 she wouldn\u2019t be able to beat him. Someone who can only deal five damage can\u2019t hurt a single thing.</p><br/><p>She walked for half a day, and when the sun was right in the center of the sky, she finally stopped. Though she was a Profound Deity and walking did not pose any sort of stress to her, even if she wasn\u2019t tired, she would still get bored of it. After walking in such a mechanical manner for half a day, her lazy bone did not feel like moving any longer. She wanted to hitch a ride with a fellow Deity or a spirit.</p><br/><p>However, before the ride could even come, the ambulance had arrived instead. Looking at the two red and white figures flying towards her from afar, Zhu Yao felt like her body was rejuvenated all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d You\u2019re finally here to pick me up.</p><br/><p>The moment Yu Yan landed, he received her embrace. \u201cYu Yao.\u201d He sized up his stupid disciple for a moment and after realizing that not only was she fine, her cultivation had risen as well, he finally felt at ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, I already told you that nothing will happen to little little grand disciple.\u201d Yu Jin shook the fan in his hand, his brows curved with his smile. \u201cHer body is marked with my tracking art, so how can I possibly lose her? Look at how anxious you\u2019ve gotten, pulling me out here immediately to look for her. Even if we don\u2019t come, she would have returned on her\u2026 Hey, listen to me you, you two.\u201d Do they have to hug that tightly? Can\u2019t they see that there were still two single puppies standing at the side?</p><br/><p>Eh? Wait a minute! Two!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d Yu Jin looked at the black-robed man that was at a considerable distance away, his heart could not help but skip a beat. Just earlier, he actually did not sense his presence at all.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan noticed Yue Ying at the back as well, and he unconsciously hugged Zhu Yao even tighter. His expression instantly turned cold. When did he come to the Higher Realm?</p><br/><p>Yue Ying still stood there in a daze. He neither replied nor moved, simply staring straight at Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao tugged the person in front of her. She had no intentions to explain either. \u201cLet us return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned, not probing any further. With a nod, he rose into the air and carried his disciple back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, wait for me!\u201d The corner of Yu Jin\u2019s lips twitched. What kind of situation is this? Why did then suddenly leave? He once again glanced at the black-robed man. Would it kill you all to explain? Why are the both of them ignoring him?</p><br/><p>Letting out a long sigh, he had no choice but to follow after them with a resentful look.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Yue Ying\u2019s figure instantly disappeared without a trace as well.</p><br/><p>With this extravagant VIP transportation tool that was her master, they arrived back at Lightning Divine Palace in less than a quarter of an hour. Not far away behind them was Yue Ying who had followed after them without making a single sound. Zhu Yao could not be bothered about him either, as she followed her master to the courtyard where the stone chairs were.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan immediately reached out his hand to check her meridians carefully, and then intentionally asked a string of weird questions. Even Yu Jin stepped forward to check her meridians several times.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zhu Yao was a little confused.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was silent for a moment. With a wave of his hand, a divine sword appeared on the table. Strange marks filled the sword, though the blade was on the verge of shattering and divine energy was scattering away from it. It even looked a little familiar. \u201cThis\u2026 Isn\u2019t this the divine sword that I was possessing? Why did its rank drop?\u201d She recalled that it was still a second rank divine sword just earlier. Right now, it could not even be considered as a first rank. It would not take long for it to turn into a piece of scrap metal.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I retrieved this sword from the storage mystic artifact back then, it began to slowly degrade. These strange marks appeared first, and then, divine energy began to scatter as cracks appeared on it\u2026\u201d Yu Yan frowned and solemnly said. \u201cInitially, your soul was the sword spirit of this sword. Your master had thought that\u2026 if a problem had occurred to the sword, something might have happened your own body. Looking at you now, you seemed to be unharmed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d It was no wonder these two were so tensed. Zhu Yao thoroughly sized up her former avatar that was quickly turning into scrap metal, and then flipped over the blade to have a look. On the other side, the marks were rather neatly gathered at the center, forming a small symbol. Squinting her eyes, she took a close look at it, and the corner of her lips began to twitch.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only is she unharmed.\u201d Yu Jin continued. \u201cLittle little grand disciple was just a mortal earlier, and she returned as a Profound Deity Paragon. This is simply miraculous. Though this sword on the other hand is about to be destroyed, as though\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs though the cultivation from the sword is being transferred to me!\u201d Zhu Yao continued in his stead.</p><br/><p>The two of them blanked for a moment.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao placed the sword down with a darkened expression. That\u2019s right, she finally found out the origin of her cultivation and why she had suddenly turned into a Profound Deity. It was all transferred over from this strange sword. Because a string of words were written clearly on the blade: Data is being transferred, please wait\u2026 (70%)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Why was cultivation transferrable? And wireless at that? She was not able to receive a single roaming signal from the Demonic Immortal Continent, so why was she able to receive wireless signals then?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she felt her body turning light, and the sound of something being broken through resounded in her mind. In the next moment, the richness of her divine energy rose by more than twice, and even her Dantian was completely full.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle little grand disciple, you\u2019re now a Gold Deity.\u201d Yu Jin was stunned. What just happened? Why did her cultivation suddenly rise just by sitting there?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently glanced at that sword. As expected, the string of words changed. Data is being transferred, please wait\u2026 (80%)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s actually still transferring! Hey, that\u2019s enough from you. Is the Bluetooth cut now?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to you in the past few days?\u201d Yu Yan asked, his eyes inadvertently swept towards Yue Ying who barely had any sense of presence. \u201cAnd how did you leave Lightning Divine Palace back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI went to the Demonic Immortal Continent.\u201d Zhu Yao talked about her stay in the Demonic Immortal Continent in the past few days, and then added in her guess about why her cultivation had suddenly risen. Naturally, she included the matters about that traitor Sesame.</p><br/><p>After hearing her story, the two were a little dumbfounded. They had heard of sharing cultivation between humans, between Deities, and between humans and Deities, but they had never heard of swords being able to share cultivation with humans.</p><br/><p>Just what is this lady made of?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis incident is strange, but seeing that little little grand disciple now possesses cultivation, her soul must have been stabilized.\u201d Yu Jin said with a serious tone. \u201cIn the future, her soul would not leave her body all of a sudden. However, as preventive measures, you should still carry some soul suppressing tools on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d She did not want to experience switching between two avatars again.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to exploit a few divine artifacts, a figure suddenly came charging in, cutting across her at extreme speeds, and then he picked up the sword on the table. Not staying for a single moment longer, he had already risen into the air and flew in the opposite direction they came from.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. When she regained her senses, that sword burglar had already flown far away. Strangely, that figure even looked a little familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, Aunt Xue, there\u2019s a formation over there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could even finish, dozens of lightning bolts thunderously descended together, immediately blasting him back.</p><br/><p>A fried and crisp fragrance floated in the air\u2026 Mn, and a part of him even looked a little scorched.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Jin: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Didn\u2019t this idiot know that formations would automatically close after entering them?</p><br/><p>She hurriedly walked towards where the charred piece of meat had fallen to. Before she could even approach him, Xue Yi had already regained his senses. He let his charred hair sway, and in a flash, he looked at them cautiously.</p><br/><p>He gripped onto the divine sword tightly with one of his hands, and said a little anxiously. \u201cDivine sword maiden, don\u2019t be afraid! I will bring you out of here. This daddy\u2019s cultivation is incredible, you know? They\u2019re just High Deities, let me show you how I\u2019m going to smack them down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d You have already turned into charred meat, just where are you getting all that confidence from?</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine sword maiden, respond to me? Why aren\u2019t you replying?\u201d Xue Yi\u2019s expression changed. Not caring about the three people in front of him any longer, he shook the sword strongly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, maiden? Don\u2019t scare me, hey! Wake up\u2026\u201d He shook it for a long while, yet when he realized there wasn\u2019t any reaction coming from the sword, his eyes instantly reddened and his face was filled with grief. He began to hysterically roar out. \u201cMaiden! Maiden, what happened to you? You better not die! Didn\u2019t we promised that once you turn back into a human, we will accompany each other to dust, gallop on horses together, and enjoy the extravagance of the Divine Realm with one another?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho promised you that!?\u201d Flips table! Can this idiot\u2019s delusions be cured at all!? \u201cMaster\u2026 Listen to me, I haven\u2019t done anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression turned cold as he silently pulled his disciple into his embrace. He really wanted to throw out lightning bolts out of irritation, what to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine sword maiden\u2026 Sword maiden\u2026 Maiden!\u201d Xue Yi still persisted in shouting at the sword, but it was all a fruitless effort. Instead, as he continued to shake, Zhu Yao felt that her cultivation had risen quite a bit again, rising straight to the level of a mid-stage Gold Deity.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After being kicked away, he still came forward to hug it again. Only when he no longer see the three people who left, did he cry out. \u201cMistress, how can you be so ruthless, and so unfair\u2026 How can you keep other beasts other than Sesame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did I keep?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Didn\u2019t you take in that tenth-ranked beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>I took in your sister. How could he expressed it in the way such that she had taken in a mistress?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Mistress, why did you bring him back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao actually had her own plans for bringing Chen Ning here. It was not easy to raise a Sect, especially for someone like her who was especially affluent, yet, penniless. Although Chen Ning was a demonic beast, he was after all, rich. Building a good relationship to pull in some sponsorship, was a pretty good choice as well.</p><br/><p>So, ultimately, the reason was. \u201cBecause we\u2019re poor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up, I have some matters to ask you about.\u201d This thigh-hugging habit of his, just when could he get rid of it?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao firstly cast a Deep Sleep incantation on Yue Yin, before casting a shielding formation on the Main Hall with hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame, do you know what kind of Mystic Arts, of Mystic Tools, can exist as a shadow?\u201d She wasn\u2019t even able to find a single clue regarding that shadow in Qiwu Pavilion. Most probably, even if she returned to Ancient Hill Sect, it would be impossible for her to obtain results with her investigation. Although Sesame was a demonic beast, after all, he came down from the Higher Realm, so the things he knew were more profound than most.</p><br/><p>\u201cShadow?\u201d Sesame was startled for a moment. \u201cWhat kind of shadow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s able to latch on a human\u2019s body, and on first glance, it looks similar to a ghost.\u201d Zhu recalled the look of that shadow. \u201cThough, it does not have the features of a ghost, it\u2019s as though\u2026 it\u2019s a human shadow, and has a figure corresponding to that of a human\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame sensed the seriousness in her words, and pondered with his head lowered. \u201cI have never heard of a shadow with those features, and I have never heard of any existence of such Mystic Arts. A regular long-term active Mystic Art usually prioritizes latency, if it has a materialized form, then that Mystic Art is considered an irregularity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if the user is unable to see it?\u201d That shadow often crawled up to Mu Meiyan\u2019s ears, and seemed to be conversing with her. However, usually, when one spoke, it was a human\u2019s instinctive behavior to turn to look at the party who was speaking. However, Mu Meiyan did not.</p><br/><p>It seemed like even Mu Meiyan herself was unable to see that black shadow. Other people did not have any sort of reaction either, except her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it possible for it to be related to a possession-type Mystic Art? And that shadow is extremely vigilant. It\u2019s even able to easily sense a Demigod. That shadow seems to be emitting\u2026 a power that makes me feel uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Theoretically speaking, back then, she was already that cautious. Even late-stage Demigods would not have been able to sense her, yet, that shadow managed to realize her. And, she suffered injuries just by its single glance.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Sesame suddenly widened his eyes, and his expression was a little pale. \u201cIn that case, unless it had already ascended\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. \u201cYou\u2019re saying, someone had descended onto the Lower Realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame nodded, just when he was about to add on.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a stream of wind swept past, and Zhu Yao felt a chill running down her spine. Reflexively, she instantly summoned a defensive barrier, however, she was forced back by a few dozen meters by a gigantic force.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt a rumbling in her chest. A strong smell of blood surged up, and she only managed to suppress it down after using all her might.</p><br/><p>A strange laughter suddenly sounded within the room. It felt sinister and dark, and even the temperature had instantly dropped quite a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame instantly reverted to his original form, and at that moment, he filled half of the entire half. Yet, no matter what he did, he could not find the source of that sudden outburst of force.</p><br/><p>He was unable to see it, however, Zhu Yao could. A person was currently standing right at the center of the hall.</p><br/><p>No, that couldn\u2019t be considered as a human, rather, it was just a shadow. That shadow was like a water wave, shaking about. Yet, the aura emitted by its surroundings was especially chilling. Even though she was separated so far away from it, she could still faintly sense a chilling intent that was currently piercing into her bones.</p><br/><p>This was definitely that shadow that had been following Mu Meiyan around. But, why did it make an appearance here? And, the moment it came, it went straight for the kill.</p><br/><p>Sesame was still tumbling randomly around the hall, as though he was trying to find his target of attack.</p><br/><p>That shadow slightly tilted its head upwards. Although Zhu Yao was unable to see its expression, she was still able to sense that it was definitely carrying a mocking expression.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not hesitate in the slightest, and instantly summoned her own Sword Intent. Circulating all of the spiritual energy in her body, she charged straight towards the shadow in the center of the hall. The lightning Phoenix that was summoned, carried the might of a Demigod, and it flew speedily over.</p><br/><p>She was unable to discern the strength of this shadow, so, she could only hope for a one-hit kill.</p><br/><p>The entire hall instantly tilted. The path that the Phoenix had taken, slashed out a huge rift, as the Phoenix instantly penetrated through that shadow.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, however, was stunned. She did not experience even the slightest of feedback that signified that she had struck accurately. That shadow\u2026 did not have a physical form!</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cHohohoho\u2026\u201d That strange laughter, once again sounded out. At the place where the shadow disappeared earlier, a black substance was currently being gathered, instantly restoring the figure of the black shadow.</p><br/><p>The hell, just what the hell is this?</p><br/><p>Before Zhu Yao could even recall her Sword Intent, with a gentle wave of its body, that shadow had actually appeared right in front of her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could only once again bring up a defensive barrier, however, she was unable to completely block its attack. And then, because she even had Yue Yin in her arms, she could only turn her body around to protect Yue Yin, and was struck right in the back by the shadow.</p><br/><p>The True Qi in her Dantian was instantly scattered, and it could no longer be gathered together.</p><br/><p>Yue Yin woke up at this moment as well. As though he had sensed the current situation, his little face was filled with horror. His little hands touched Zhu Yao\u2019s pale face. \u201cAh\u2026 Ah~\u201d He still did not know how to talk.</p><br/><p>Roar~~\u2517|\uff40o\u2032|\u251b</p><br/><p>Sesame reacted as well. After guessing the opponent\u2019s position, he immediately attacked a few inches away from Zhu Yao, only to be immediately sent flying away with a wave of the shadow\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The shadow still emitted out that strange chilling laughter. As though it was curious, it stretched forward, and sized Zhu Yao up. \u201cAs I thought, you can see me, can\u2019t you? Heheheheh\u2026 Then I can\u2019t let you live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao wanted to get up, however, because her Dantian was shattered, she could not even gather the slightest bit of her mystical powers, and could only watch on as that shadow raised its hand.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao even felt like cursing out now. The hell. Just what sort of enmity do we have? Why did you have to kill her just because she was able to see you?</p><br/><p>No longer able to suppress the rumbling blood in her chest, she spat out a huge mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>Momma\u2019s egg, even if I have to renew myself to version 5.0, this old lady here still wants to spit on you in the face before I disconnect.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had believed that this she would definitely not survive after taking this one hit. She was not afraid of death, she was just uncertain if the shadow was here especially to kill her, or this matter would implicate the rest of the Azureflight disciples as well. If the eighty odd little radishes were to be hurt because of this matter, she would not be able to feel at ease for her entire lifetime.</p><br/><p>Just when that shadow closed in, inch by inch, and at that moment when it was about to make contact with her. Suddenly, a glaring golden light emitted out from her chest, forcing the shadow back a few steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d That shadow seemed to be frightened.</p><br/><p>Yet, that light became even brighter, and instantly enveloped the entire collapsing hall. Even that shadow was engulfed by the light as well. Zhu Yao could not help but close her eyes from the eye-piercing light, but for an instant, she lowered her head and squinted her eyes at that thing that was shining in chest.</p><br/><p>It was that black scroll she received from Chen Ning!</p><br/><p>Under the radiance of the strong light, Zhu Yao had to shut her eyes, and she only recovered after a good while.</p><br/><p>Slowly, she opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>Only to realize, that they had actually changed maps, and arrived at a foreign place.</p><br/><p>This seemed to be the depths of a mountain, as there were many humongous trees that shot through the clouds, which she had never seen before.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame!\u201d Zhu Yao looked around, only to realize he was currently lying somewhere not far from her. He was currently adapting to the light, and slowly, he stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cA teleportation formation, is that it?\u201d A cold and sinister voice rang.</p><br/><p>The hell, it\u2019s that shadow again. Why does it appear everywhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t escape, you must die today!\u201d That shadow once again floated over. The few parts of its body that had been scattered from the rays of light earlier, were currently being regenerated at a slow pace. As though it was taking in the spiritual energy from the surroundings, its body became firmer as time went by. Raising one of its hands, a faint purple light gathered in the palm of its hand.</p><br/><p>Sesame flipped up, and leapt over as well. Although he was unable to see the shadow, with such an obvious killing intent, he could still make a rough estimate of its position.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could sense the pressure being emitted out by the purple light, and she had completely no strength to resist it at all. Even after changing maps, she still couldn\u2019t escape the fate of being killed, was that it? If she had known, she would have sent Yue Yin away.</p><br/><p>For the first time, Zhu Yao felt that her speed of cultivation was too slow, to the point where she had completely no strength to resist.</p><br/><p>Just when that purple light was about to strike her, suddenly, a sharp and shrilling noise rang in their ears. That noise was extremely loud, as though it could penetrate their eardrums. Zhu Yao\u2019s ears trembled from the loud noise.</p><br/><p>A snake-shaped demonic beast suddenly popped out of nowhere. Opening its huge mouth filled with sharp razor-like teeth, it bit towards that shadow. Its speed was extremely quick, to the point where it was impossible to be caught.</p><br/><p>The shadow seemed to not have expected that a demonic beast would be present in this place. It hurriedly dodged a few meters away, but a part of its body was still scattered by that demonic beast. The purple light in the shadow\u2019s hand was incidentally thrown to that snake.</p><br/><p>Before that purple light could even land on the snake-shaped demonic beast, that demonic beast suddenly opened its mouth wide, and swallowed that ball of light which had looked pretty incredible.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026 it burped.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao and her little companions were all dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Even that shadow was stunned, as though the words \u201cthis is impossible\u201d had appeared on its face.</p><br/><p>The hell, just what kind of demonic beast was this!?</p><br/><p>Roooar~~</p><br/><p>The snake beast once again emitted out a long cry. As though it had gotten addicted to eating that purple, it began to chase after the shadow attack it. The shadow thus could only continue to dodge, as its Mystic Arts seemed to be completely ineffective against that demonic beast.</p><br/><p>It continued to be chased up and down, and all over the place. Zhu Yao silently felt that, it was time for her to retreat for a moment.</p><br/><p>Carrying Yue Yin, just when she plan on leaving, suddenly, she once again heard another loud roar.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, another demonic beast came flying from the sky. This demonic beast was terrifyingly huge, and that wing it had was actually nothing but a piece of thick white skeletal bone, yet, it was still able to fly stably. Most probably, it was attracted here by the noises of the battle, as it charged straight towards the direction of the snake beast and the shadow.</p><br/><p>The battle that unfolded, could be said to be blazingly catastrophic.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao and the two others, the pond fish that were affected, could only dodge the gigantic trees they brought down, and the flying stones that scattered about from their battle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

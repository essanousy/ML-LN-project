But, with a simple twist of his finger, Yu Jin rooted her to the ground. In a flash, he stood right in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do, grand\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao wanted to shout out, however, with a gentle wave of his sleeves, she could no longer speak either.</p><br/><p>Yu Jin gave a sly smile. The hell, this bastard was doing it on purpose. Her master did not agree to accepting the Hall Master position, so he changed his point of target to her. This savage beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I will simply be inserting a divine imprint. It won\u2019t hurt at all.\u201d A lightning glow flashed in his hand, and then, a strand of flashing red light tangled itself between his fingers.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s even stranger for such a strong might and pressure to not hurt, right!?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s only been a few months since she entered the Lightning Divine Hall, and he\u2019s handing over the role of Hall Master to her just like that? Did he have to play it this way? If she had known of this, she wouldn\u2019t have brought Miao Lin over here.</p><br/><p>Yu Jin raised the hand covered in lightning glow, stretched out two fingers, and tapped them on the center of Zhu Yao\u2019s forehead, directly inserting the divine imprint into Zhu Yao\u2019s body. Before he could even let go, a complication suddenly arose, as the divine imprint was instantly reflected back.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You have another divine sense imprint in your body?\u201d Yu Jin blanked, and his face was filled with disappointment. In an instant, as though he had recalled something, he sized Zhu Yao up for a moment. Then, he powerlessly said. \u201cSo you\u2019re really Yu Yan\u2019s personal succeeding disciple, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes back at him. Who else could she be?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, forget it!\u201d Yu Jin heaved a long sigh, and removed the stationary spell on Zhu Yao. The Hall Master\u2019s divine imprint was a divine sense-related imprint, and everyone could only possess a single type of divine sense imprint in their bodies. Initially, he had thought that his little little grand disciple was merely a rock spirit. Even if she was Yu Yan\u2019s disciple, she would simply be a regular disciple, and would not have the personal succeeding disciple imprint on her. Who would have known\u2026 He had miscalculated. When this strand of divine sense was planted, only the owner of the divine sense could remove it. In other words, unless Yu Yan came over to remove it, he shouldn\u2019t even think about imprinting the Hall Master\u2019s mark on Zhu Yao. Once again, he sized Zhu Yao up. \u201cI say, little little grand disciple, why did your master take in a rock spirit as his personal succeeding disciple?\u201d And before this, she shouldn\u2019t have gained her human form yet, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business!\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. \u201cMy master has great eyes for people, that\u2019s why, among the sea of people, out of the millions of disciples, he chose\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis piece of rock.\u201d Yu Jin continued in her stead.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Can you not bring that up?</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. Let\u2019s head over to that Advent Cloud Hall\u2019s emissary.\u201d Yu Jin, who failed in his assassination, walked towards to the front of the hall with a disappointed look. Zhu Yao had no choice but to follow after him. Hmph, once I return, I will report this to master.</p><br/><p>Miao Lin, however, was waiting rather patiently in the great hall. When he sensed that people were approaching, he turned around. With a joyful look, he started walking towards the direction of the two people from afar. \u201cMiao Lin of Advent Cloud Hall, greets High Deity Yu Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Yu Jin lightly responded. Compared to the previous happy and easy-going look, his current response was filled with unspeakable might and dominance. Even Zhu Yao could not hide her curiosity, and looked over.</p><br/><p>Only to see a white figure walking past her. He stepped into the hall, and sat on the highest seat. White brows, white beard, and white clothes. Though he looked over seventy and beyond his prime, he was filled with unspeakable majesty, causing people to look up in awe.</p><br/><p>This person\u2026 Who the heck is he?</p><br/><p>\u201cHall Master.\u201d Miao Lin, however, looked as though everything was normal, as he respectfully reported to him. \u201cThe reason our Patriarch sent me over this time, is in regards to the name list of the Grand Mystic Assembly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao blanked, and only then did she glance over to that foreign-looking old man at the center. No matter how dumb one was, he would still be able to see that the old man was Yu Jin. Why did he have to change himself to an old man? Was he bored?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was unclear when Miao Lin left, but Yu Jin had not harassed the two of them for several days straight. Most probably, it was related to that Grand Mystic Assembly or whatever which Miao Lin brought up.</p><br/><p>In regards to why Yu Jin wanted to transform into a white-haired old man, Zhu Yao had asked about this as well.</p><br/><p>Yu Jin smiled especially complacently, and he replied with an exceptionally justifying tone. \u201cIf I don\u2019t transform to look a little aged, how will I be able to express the imposing spirit of the Hall Master of Lightning Divine Hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered deeply for a moment. Indeed, with that old man look of his, it was rather intimidating.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore.\u201d Yu Jin added. \u201cIf I were to address others with my former appearance, I will definitely look much younger than the Master of Advent Cloud Hall. Then, how will I be able to scold him, and lead him by the nose with the identity as his elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. As expected, it being all about might and spirit was all a lie. You simply become old for the convenience of scolding others, right?</p><br/><p>Yu Jin did not think it was shameful; instead, he was proud of it. \u201cHaah, human nature is ugly. Hence, as the Hall Master, there will always be such uncomfortable days every year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d You\u2019re treating the Hall Master as an auntie?</p><br/><p>Since the annoying Hall Master had not been coming, Yu Yan began to attentively impart Zhu Yao with divine arts. As a jade spirit, which had even gained its human form with the aid of the Lightning Abyssal Spring, Zhu Yao\u2019s foundation was not stable, hence, she had no choice but to start cultivating from scratch.</p><br/><p>Her master said that the cultivation in the Higher Realm completely depended on divine energy. Cultivation was no longer separated by the five elements, and all living things with spiritual consciousness raise their cultivation level by absorbing divine energy.</p><br/><p>Back then, Zhu Yao had a slight sense for absorbing divine energy, so, to her, it was not really a difficult task. However, after meditating for exactly a month, the divine energy in Zhu Yao\u2019s body was still pitifully little. With her current cultivation level, she could not even be considered an Earth Deity.</p><br/><p>In regards to the bug she needed to fix this time, even till now, she still did not know who it was. Zhu Yao was a little anxious, as she faintly sensed that the bug this time wasn\u2019t that simple. After all, this place was the Divine Realm. Seeing that she was not making much progress with her cultivation, she was a little worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm your inner heart, circulate the energy into your Zhoutian.\u201d Looking at his disciple who was evidently out of sorts, Yu Yan spoke out to remind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still the same.\u201d Zhu Yao instantly turned dispirited, as she let out a long sigh. \u201cMaster, why is my divine energy absorption rate so slow?\u201d It had already been more than four months. Forget about making progress in her cultivation, instead, she felt that the divine energy in her body was becoming weaker.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. He had naturally sensed the situation surrounding his disciple as well. It\u2019s just that he did not know of the reason either. Theoretically speaking, his disciple\u2019s aptitude was not considered poor. Looking at the speed of her human transformation, it was rather rare to see a spirit gaining its human form in the Lightning Abyssal Spring in just ten days. However, ever since she had gained her human form, her cultivation had stagnated. It was as though the divine energy in her body had reached a saturated state, so no matter how she was to absorb even more, the amount of divine energy would not be able to increase.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there any irregularities in your Dantian?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao carefully sensed for a moment, and shook her head. \u201cNone.\u201d The amount of divine energy in Dantian was pitifully little.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan inspected her pulse, and thoroughly checked the meridians in her body. Her meridians were wide and large, without the slightest bit of irregularity. Theoretically speaking, this should be the most perfect aptitude one could have. Then, what in the world was the reason?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I wouldn\u2019t be a jade spirit all my life, right?\u201d In the Divine Realm, the number of figures at the Earth Deity level was the least as well. If this continued, she would simply be cannon fodder at every given moment! Let\u2019s forget about fixing the bug as well.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan pondered deeply for a moment, before grabbing onto her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s try again.\u201d After saying that, he sent a strand of divine energy into her. Zhu Yao concentrated, and as usual, she guided that strand of energy into her Dantian. However, that strand of divine energy became weaker as it flowed. Before it could even enter her Dantian, it had completely dispersed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Just what the hell was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never seen such a situation either.\u201d Divine energy that had already entered one\u2019s body could actually disappear. It was really rarely seen. \u201cFor now, first practice in the various divine arts. After the Grand Mystic Assembly, I will bring you into the tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTower?\u201d Zhu Yao raised her head towards the Lightning Divine Tower, which was as tall as the sky, at the peak of the mountain.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan stroked her head. \u201cWhen the time comes, we can ask my master if he had seen such a situation before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d So he\u2019s calling for reinforcements. Zhu Yao was silent for a moment, before she continued to ask. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Grand Mystic Assembly?\u201d That unfortunate Miao Lin seemed to have come for this matter as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Grand Mystic Assembly is held once every ten thousand years. It\u2019s the day to discuss who shall be selected to enter the tower.\u201d Yu Yan explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter the tower? Aren\u2019t Lightning Divine Hall disciples the only ones able to enter the tower?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan shook his head. \u201cThere are four great continents in the Divine Realm. There are countless Deities, while the Lightning Divine Hall is the one and only path to godhood in the Divine Realm. So naturally, not only Lightning Divine Hall disciples are entitled to enter.\u201d However, only the mark of the Lightning Divine Hall Master could activate the Lightning Divine Tower. \u201cEvery ten thousand years, the Divine Realm will conduct a Grand Mystic Assembly. The High Deities of the four great continents will be qualified to enter the tower to face the trials of godhood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t the cultivation of a Heavy Deity enough to enter the tower?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCountless savage beasts roam the tower, and it is filled with tribulation lightning bolts. Other than the disciples of Lightning Divine Hall who cultivate in the arts of lightning, it\u2019s difficult for other people to sustain themselves. Disregarding the godhood trials, I\u2019m afraid they might even fall in the lower ten floors. Hence, Lightning Divine Hall disciples can enter the tower as Heavy Deities, while others have to be High Deities.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s the case. \u201cWhy is there a need for a selection? Can\u2019t they directly enter the tower after achieving the corresponding cultivation level?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly five people can enter every time the tower is opened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly five?\u201d No wonder. It seemed like this so-called Grand Mystic Assembly, was actually a one-time opportunity in the Divine Realm to rise to greater heights. \u201cThen, after entering the tower, are we not able to return?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the lower ten floors, we will still be able to freely enter and exit the tower. After the tenth floor, there will no longer be opportunities to exit the tower. We will only be able to progress towards the Dao wholeheartedly. Either we turn into Gods, or we fall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeities can die as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeities indeed possess longevity, but it\u2019s not that we can\u2019t die.\u201d The number of Deities dying due to battles, personal feuds, cultivation, and treasure-hunting had long been countless.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head, looking towards the sky-piercing tower. \u201cThen, are there really people who become Gods?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was silent for a moment, before he slowly said. \u201cIt is unknown to everyone. People who have turned into Gods, have detached themselves from the six paths and are no longer influenced by the five elements. No one knows what a true God looks like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao momentarily felt a strange sensation surging from the depths of her heart. After heading above the tenth floor, people could no longer turn back. Could this completely unretreatable, and one-way path really turn one into a God? After becoming a Deity, one would already be bestowed with endless longevity in the first place, so why must they become Gods?</p><br/><p>After understanding what the Grand Mystic Assembly was, the Lightning Divine Hall had evidently become bustling. Usually, other than her master and Hall Master, no other living beings could be seen. However, as though in a single night, a large number of disciples had appeared in the Lightning Divine Hall out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>Men, women, young and old. There were so many of them, it would soon reach an uncountable number. Zhu Yao even suspected if she had actually resurrected and gone to a different map.</p><br/><p>Though everyone\u2019s clothes were different, every single of their sleeves were embroidered with a lightning cloud insignia. This insignia was embroidered on her clothes as well.</p><br/><p>Just where did all these Lightning Divine Hall disciples pop out from? What happened to only having three people?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was extremely puzzled, until one day, when she was practicing her divine arts, one of her lightning ball struck a blue-clothed disciple who was sweeping the floor then. That disciple was instantly set ablaze.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was given a shock, as she hurriedly extinguished the flames. However, what she saw was a piece of burnt paper falling onto the ground. When she picked the paper up, she saw a single word was written on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSweeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 The hell was with this sweeper thing?</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, little little grand disciple, do not play with lightning, alright? Wouldn\u2019t it be bad if you struck someone?\u201d Yu Jin suddenly popped out of nowhere as well. Taking the piece of paper off Zhu Yao\u2019s hands, he reached out his hand to cast an art, and in an instant, the piece of paper once again turned back into the blue-clothed disciple earlier. Other than having a bundle of burnt hair, the rest of him had returned to normal. Without speaking a single word, he picked up the broom that fell onto the ground, and continued to sweep.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Yu Jin, however, had already turned and left. As he walked, like scattering dollar notes, he threw pieces of talismans everywhere. And when those talismans landed on the ground, they turned into varied-looking disciples. As though they had received some sort of command, they turned around and went to work on their own tasks.</p><br/><p>Talismans could actually be used this way as well? How did she not know about it?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

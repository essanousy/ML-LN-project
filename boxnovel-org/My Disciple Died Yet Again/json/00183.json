The moment she stood on it, a white light glowed, as though she had activated some sort of mechanism. In front of her, what seemed to be three pieces of cubes formed by light curtains appeared, and patterns could be faintly seen on them. The first piece was a diagram of a dragon, the second piece was a diagram of a phoenix, while the third piece was a diagram of a qilin.</p><br/><p>It seemed like every piece corresponded to each race.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but look at the empty space at the furthest right, a fourth piece of light curtain was currently rising up at an extremely slow pace, though, it emerged with an ink-black color, as though it had ran out of batteries, looking dimmed and dark. The diagram on it could not be clearly distinguished either. Zhu Yao faintly sensed that it should be where the black tortoise\u2019s position was.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister.\u201d Shao Bai stood at the side of the second piece of light curtain, and waved his hands at her. \u201cCome, place your hand inside, and it will be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can receive the inheritance just by reaching my hand inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao never expected that the procedure would be this simple, as she reached her claw inside with speaking another word. All of the phoenixes present held their breaths, as they excitedly waited to see what second attribute would be triggered by the Phoenix clan\u2019s first egg-born phoenix.</p><br/><p>A few minutes later.</p><br/><p>Nothing happened\u2026</p><br/><p>Mn, most probably, it still needed a bit more time.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later.</p><br/><p>Complete silence\u2026</p><br/><p>It might have been because the method she reached her hand out was incorrect. So, she flipped her hand.</p><br/><p>An hour later.</p><br/><p>A cold wind blew.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond elder brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I really able to receive the inheritance like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a learned person, don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was still unable to clearly discern the current situation, yet, the venue was already thrown into a loud uproar. Various discussions of guesses and suspicions erupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 How is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s actually unable to receive the inheritance. Isn\u2019t this too unbelievable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, there actually wasn\u2019t the least bit reaction from the inheritance stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould she not be a phoenix?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Patriach Qian Yu was dumbfounded, as she took a few steps forward, and stared deeply at Zhu Yao. \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Hence, she pulled her hand, and placed it in the curtain of light once again, yet, there still wasn\u2019t the least bit of reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Could it be that an egg-born phoenix cannot receive the inheritance? The number of phoenix clansmen wasn\u2019t many, and it\u2019s impossible to increase for all eternity. Hence, when she saw that a phoenix was born from the egg, she was that happy. But, if an egg-born phoenix cannot receive the inheritance, this meant that there would be a huge setback to their godly powers. In that case, what\u2019s the point of having their numbers increase?</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch!\u201d Finally, a clansman with an agitated expression stood out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? There\u2019s completely no reaction from the inheritance stone. Isn\u2019t she one of our clansmen? Patriarch, please give us an explanation, we can\u2019t have other races be mixed within us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment his words fell, agreeing responses immediately came from the other clansmen. Their gazes which seemed especially gentle when they were looking at Zhu Yao earlier, instantly turned stern and sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d For a moment, Qian Yu was put in a bind. The God race had always been united, and the more united they were, the more discriminatory they were too. They valued their own clansmen, while they couldn\u2019t stand other races. The rejecting voices in the venue grew louder, and they were gradually going out of control.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was also shocked by this extreme development. Was not being a phoenix that serious? But her original form really did look like a bird. If she wasn\u2019t a phoenix, that what was she?</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, settle down.\u201d Qian Yu tried her best to explain. \u201cLittle Seventh\u2019s original form is indeed of the feathered races.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing one of the feathered races doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s definitely a phoenix.\u201d Someone in the crowd refuted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She might not even be a God.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She\u2019s standing over there, yet, the other inheritance stones aren\u2019t reacting either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChase her out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, we can\u2019t allow her to stay on this tree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChase out the irregularity!\u201d</p><br/><p>The phoenix clansmen grew even more agitated, and the eyes they were looking at Zhu Yao with, looked as though they were about spit out flames. Zhu Yao was speechless, for a moment, she felt like she had been transported into the \u201cAngry Birds\u201d game world. She was the pig that was about to be slammed into.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Seeing that the phoenixes were becoming even more agitated, an angry roar suddenly boomed, boundless pressure came crashing down on the crowd of birds. Shao Bai\u2019s brows were heavily sunken, and his expression was ice-cold. Following after, a resounding phoenix cry rang, only to see a gigantic, sky blue colored, phoenix-shaped illusory image behind him. The illusory image was wavy and filled with watery light, seemingly formed by gathered water. However, it carried a forceful aura, sending chills to anyone that saw it. \u201cNo matter if she receives the inheritance or not, she\u2019s still my seventh little sister, does anyone has any objections?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was as cold as ice, and the illusory image in the sky swept its eyes throughout the crowd. The venue was momentarily completely silent.</p><br/><p>Even Zhu Yao was shocked by his tyrannical and cool actions. This was completely an outright threat. She never expected that Shao Bai, who was usually a soft bun, would look quite the part when he was angry.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2026 he can\u2019t be a sis-con, right?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a little incredible.</p><br/><p>But, what kind of creature was her character this time? She could sense the energy within her body was exactly the same as the one she had while she was a dragon, and it was a lot stronger too. This should be the so-called godly energy. This proved that she should be of the God race. But why was the phoenix\u2019s inheritance ineffective for her?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned and carefully inspected the three inheritance stones. The length and widths of the cubes were very standard, and other than the diagrams being different, they were all rather similar. Even the button at the side\u2026</p><br/><p>What the hell\u2026</p><br/><p>When and where did the button at the side pop out from?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao squatted down to take a careful look. There were even words on the button as well. \u201cPhoenix Inheritance (False)\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked to the side, and as expected, the rest of the inheritance stones had similar buttons as well, though the words on them were different. \u201cDragon Inheritance (False)\u201d was written on the left one, while \u201cQilin Inheritance (False)\u201d was written on the right one.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the meaning of that \u2018False\u2019 word?</p><br/><p>She looked at the Black Tortoise\u2019s inheritance stone furthest away. It was already dark to the point where words couldn\u2019t be seen clearly, so she wasn\u2019t able to confirm if it had a similar \u2018False\u2019 button.</p><br/><p>So earlier, she was operating it wrongly? Then, should she try pressing it?</p><br/><p>No, no, no. Looking at her track record of miserable and immoral trolled experiences, this matter wasn\u2019t that simple. She definitely had to stop her hands from being itchy. It\u2019s best that she maintained a safe distance away from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, don\u2019t be afraid, stand behind me.\u201d Shao Bai, who vented off some steam earlier, worryingly pulled her, with the intentions to guard her. While Zhu Yao who was currently moving in the opposite direction, was unable to maintain her balance, and because of reaction forces, she fell straight to the back where the inheritance stones were.</p><br/><p>She could faintly hear the \u2018beep\u2019 sound.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, as she raised her middle finger with an annoyed expression.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the entire inheritance stone released a flaming red light, radiating throughout the entire Terrace of Revelations.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe inheritance stone lighted up!\u201d Little Eighth exclaimed. Everyone shockingly turned their heads around one after another. Though, their eyes were still dyed with suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt finally lighted up.\u201d Qian Yu heaved a long sigh of relief. \u201cI just knew. I just knew that Little Seventh is a child of the Phoenix clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao expressed that she was lazy to retort.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Bai, hurry and come over. Don\u2019t interrupt Little Seventh while she\u2019s receiving her inheritance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai hesitated for a moment. He smiled at Zhu Yao, told her some encouraging words, before walking down.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhu Yao felt something was plugging her heart. Can I go down as well? Why did she have a premonition of an incoming disaster?</p><br/><p>The inheritance stone glowed even redder, and Zhu Yao faintly sensed that the godly energy within her body was beginning to expand wildly. This feeling was a little similar to the time when she was absorbing spiritual energy in the past, filling her entire body. Only when she was no longer able to contain it, did the red light retract and return to its former state. As though nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s done just like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t there any phenomenon?\u201d The crowd of phoenixes once again sounded their objections.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that she doesn\u2019t have any latent potential?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of an egg-born. She actually doesn\u2019t have any latent potential to tap in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA phoenix like this, is really an embarrassment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan an egg-born phoenix even be considered a phoenix?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, an egg-born should be kicked out of the Phoenix Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, hey, hey. Can you stop with the personal attacks? Be kicked out of the Phoenix Realm? What? Is this the entertainment industry!?</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Although she knew that everyone would have some degree of xenophobia, this crowd of phoenixes was really too much. In the beginning, they were despising her for not being a phoenix, not after receiving the inheritance, they were suspecting her birth.</p><br/><p>She really wanted to slap all of their faces.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao clenched her teeth, and unconsciously tapped on the inheritance stone at the side. Just as she was able to walk away\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud boom sounded.</p><br/><p>A heavenly lightning bolt descended from the skies, striking straight on her head, turning her completely charred black.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao spat out a mouthful of white smoke, and turned to glance at the inheritance stone. I just gave you a light tap, do you have to be this stingy?</p><br/><p>Immediately after, a long cry resounded through the clouds. Zhu Yao reflexively raised her head to take a look, only to see a gigantic phoenix made out of lightning charging into the sea of clouds. In an instant, the colors of the wind and clouds changed, sand and stones flew into the air. The sky which was still brightened by the sun earlier, instantly turned as dark as night.</p><br/><p>The sea of clouds tumbled, several rays of lightning light were currently stretching and rolling about boundlessly in the sky, as though they could strike at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning\u2026 Lightning attribute\u2026\u201d It was unknown who said these sudden words. The angry little birds which were still rowdy earlier, were instantly filled with disbelief and fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 This is impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe actually possesses the lightning attribute\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at that familiar phoenix in the clouds. Wasn\u2019t that her sword intent? When did it become so huge? She habitually raised her hand to circulate the energy within her body, calling out to her sword intent.</p><br/><p>The lightning phoenix let out a long cry, immediately charging downwards. While carrying a lightning radiance that filled the entire sky, it flew straight towards the Terrace of Revelations where they were located at, and then\u2026</p><br/><p>Lightning lights spread throughout all four directions, and crackling lightning sparks, instantly filled the entire Terrace of Revelations.</p><br/><p>The smell of burnt birds faintly floated in the air.</p><br/><p>Other than a ten feet circular radius from where she was standing, the place was filled charred human figures, and miserable cries.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, my buttocks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy feathers, my feathers are burnt off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy pants\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo painful, why did these lightning bolts strike the buttocks specifically?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Will an apology work in this situation?</p><br/><p>Hence, an well organized inheritance ceremony, first turned into Zhu Yao\u2019s criticism conference, and then a face-slapping conference right after.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, with the identity as the first Lightning Phoenix since the start of ancient history, slapped all of the phoenixes in their faces in a sparkling manner, and with the absolute odds from completely burning two-thirds of the clansmen\u2019s feathers, became the nightmare of all phoenixes.</p><br/><p>For a few consecutive months, among all of the phoenixes that see her, none of them wouldn\u2019t hold their buttocks, clench their thighs, break into a small jog and flee. Furthermore, half of the clansmen had turned into neets, swearing that before their feathers grow out, they definitely wouldn\u2019t leave their houses.</p><br/><p>In regards to this, Zhu Yao expressed her deep regrets. Haah, if she had known\u2026 she would have burnt everyone\u2019s feathers! After all, if everyone didn\u2019t have them, then they would definitely get used to it.</p><br/><p>Ah, as expected. She\u2019s still too, too kind.</p><br/><p>Because of her mistake, she had injured the phoenixes. Patriarch Qian Yu expressed that she still had to be punished, but it was met with intense objection by a particular sis-con. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to control one\u2019s first phenomenon in the first place, little sister has already done very well.\u201d In any case, his feathers weren\u2019t burnt.</p><br/><p>Qian Yu was unable to refute in the slightest. Hence, she brought up the second problem \u2013 control. Zhu Yao\u2019s true attribute had already been brought out, now, it all boiled down to how to control her own strength, and use it skillfully. The Phoenix clan had never birthed a phoenix with lightning attribute before, so no one knew how to control it. If her phenomenon were to lose control once again, the feathers of the phoenixes\u2026 would be in peril!</p><br/><p>This was a problem that required solving. In the end, the entire family decided after a long discussion. Send her off to be taught under a teacher.</p><br/><p>Since she was the only lightning phoenix, then naturally, she had to be taught by an awe-inspiring master.</p><br/><p>Far Ancient Highgod of the extreme northern lands. Between the heaven and earth, he was the remaining God of the high ancient times, and had never appeared in the world for hundred thousand years. Legends of him still spread throughout the world. The more important factor was, he was the only God between heaven and earth who was proficient with the lightning arts.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao heard that they were sending her to be taught under a teacher, she rejected the proposal in the beginning.</p><br/><p>Mostly attributed to a huge rejection mentality. She had already turned fearful by the trolls of a certain master. She really wasn\u2019t interested in starting a new game plus.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 her objection was annulled.</p><br/><p>This time, even her revolutionary comrade Shao Bai, was standing on the opposite camp, with the firm decision on sending her to the extreme northern lands.</p><br/><p>What happened to the promised sis-con?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, don\u2019t worry. The Far Ancient Highgod is the God with the most profound cultivation between heaven and earth.\u201d Shao Bai persuaded her with all his might.</p><br/><p>\u201c</p><br/><p>Oh.\u201d Zhu Yao remained skeptical.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only unfallen God of the ancient times, possessing strong mystical powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA few days ago, I had already sent a letter to him, he agreed to taking you as his disciple. And he will treat you very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have known him for a very long time, and if he were to personally teach you, I can feel at ease as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that place is very far away from the Devil Sealing Grounds, and is the safest place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Bai!\u201d Zhu Yao raised her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I successfully get taken in as his disciple, will the Phoenix clan receive a commission?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, be obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to!\u201d Zhu Yao blocked the door tightly. \u201cI\u2019m not a learned person, don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d Masters were all used to troll their disciples. She had experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond elder brother will often come and see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who wants to see you, you traitor! \u201cI don\u2019t want to be taken in as someone else\u2019s disciple.\u201d She already had a master, and he\u2019s already more than enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister\u2026\u201d Shao Bai was a little helpless, his brows were already twisted into a lump. In the end, he still could not bear to lecture her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we first head over there and have a look? If you don\u2019t like it there, you can return then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gave him two words. \u201cHo ho.\u201d Was he really treating her as a three-year-old? In the first place, she was already feeling rather fatigued and depressed by coming into this world alone. Now she even had to be taken in as someone else\u2019s disciple? Not doing it. I\u2019m definitely not doing it. If you force me anymore than this, this lady here will commit suicide, and log into Version 8.0.</p><br/><p>Shao Bai had no other choice. He reached out his hand to stroke her messy hair, and his expression sank for a moment. Then, he lightly sighed. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao blanked. What?</p><br/><p>In the next instant, she simply felt something was directly inserted into her forehead, and with her vision darkening, she fainted.</p><br/><p>The hell. And here I even trusted you so much. You actually played dirty.</p><br/><p>Just you wait.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had always thought that the so-called extreme northern lands would definitely be an extremely cold place. Even if it wasn\u2019t filled by glaciers, at the very least, there would be occasional fluttering snow. So when she was woken up by the heat, for a moment, she didn\u2019t know where she was.</p><br/><p>That was a tree, a regular tree, and she was currently lying within the tree\u2019s shadow. There was even an immensely huge fruit on the tree, and it shaking a lot, looking as though it could fall at any moment\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell, that\u2019s a durian!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao quickly leapt onto her feet and crawled away. With a boom, that shaky durian ruthlessly nailed into the ground next to her back. Zhu Yao patted her chest. She fortunately woke up in time, otherwise, her face would have been ruined.</p><br/><p>Just who would have such tastes to place her under a durian tree?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d Suddenly, a slightly hoarse male voice sounded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao searched her surroundings, however, she didn\u2019t see a single human figure anywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Following the voice, she lowered her head, only to see the durian that just fell down earlier, was trying to pull itself out from the ground with all its might. Most probably because it was such a rough fall, after nudging for a long while, it still couldn\u2019t get up. It then nodded its stem towards her. \u201cLittle lady, help\u2026 help me out a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. Why was there a creature such as a durian spirit exist in this world?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Hearing this question, the durian proudly puffed up its wolf fanged club-like body. \u201cI\u2019m a servant under the Far Ancient Highgod, Durian Child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Far Ancient Highgod? Shao Bai really sent her here? Lowering her head, she glanced at that durian. \u201cEarlier, you wanted to smash me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The durian was startled. Its greenish body earlier, revealed a hint of red. \u201cAhem\u2026 About that. I saw that you have been sleeping for quite a while, so I just wanted to wake you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho.\u201d Was smashing someone\u2019s face its method of waking that person up? \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d He actually admitted it without any shame. \u201cThe Far Ancient Highgod is calling for you! He lives in the mountain peak, as long as you first pull\u2026 Ehhh!! Don\u2019t leave yet! Pull me out first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao ignored his calls, and hurriedly left the durian tree. She\u2019s the type of person who held grudges. Come bite me if you can!</p><br/><p>Along the way, she saw various fruit, vegetable, and herb spirits. They seemed to be extremely curious about her, as they watched her from afar. Though, none of them approached her, as they simply sized her up while discussing among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, look. We have an additional bird here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard she was sent here by the Phoenix clan, and will be taken in by the Highgod as his disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? The Highgod is taking in a disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. And she\u2019s even a female disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo pitiful. I wonder how long she will last?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wager seven days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wager three days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wager\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was going on with the sudden development of a gambling scene? Was that Highgod really that scary? With a stomach full of suspicions, Zhu Yao walked to the peak, while thinking of ways to explain to that Highgod to have him send her back.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had thought that in the place a Highgod reside in, forget about being grand and luxurious, at the very least, it shouldn\u2019t be too shabby. However, she never expected that after climbing to the peak, what she saw was an empty plain grassfield. Forget about a house, there wasn\u2019t even a single straw cottage.</p><br/><p>At the center of the grass field, stood a man. Dressed in white, his long hair touched the ground, and he was standing straight with his back facing her. His figure looked a little familiar. His entire body faintly emitted out a gentle radiance, and looking from afar, it gave an awe-inspiring feeling. He must be the so-called Far Ancient Highgod Shao Bai had spoken of.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to Far Ancient Highgod.\u201d Zhu Yao lawfully bowed.</p><br/><p>Yet, he didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of reaction, his back was standing as straight as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis junior greets the Far Ancient Highgod!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Seventh of the Phoenix clan, greets the Far Ancient Highgod.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Complete silence.</p><br/><p>Alright, it seemed he had resolved himself not to care about her, so Zhu Yao spoke bluntly. \u201cUmm, actually, I don\u2019t want to be taken in as your disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a master, so\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m returning on my own now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFar Ancient Highgod? Are you listening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Mister Far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, mister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, are you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. Just as she was about to turn and leave, she suddenly heard a rhythmic set of breathing sounds\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d This guy is actually asleep. Then don\u2019t blame me for waking you up.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. Picking up a stone, she threw it towards him.</p><br/><p>Dong, bullseye!</p><br/><p>That white figure finally moved, albeit sloppily, as he walked a few steps forward. The hand by his side raised, reaching out to the top of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to Highgod!\u201d She hurriedly nodded and bowed. Mn, she didn\u2019t do anything earlier at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Little Seventh?\u201d That person stroked his head, while turning around. \u201cShao Bai\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t wish to be be taken in\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao raised her head at the same time, but was suddenly stunned with widened eyes. \u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply could not believe her own eyes. She had initially given up, but she never expected that he really came to \u2018pick her up\u2019. Sprinting towards him, she grabbed him by the hand, and for a moment, she had the impulse to cry. \u201cMaster, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He frowned, yet, he reached out his hand, and immediately pushed her a step away. \u201cSince I have promised Shao Bai to take you in as my disciple, then the way you\u2019re addressing me now, isn\u2019t too outrageous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao blanked. This was the first time she was pushed away by him. After taking a careful look, she finally saw that something was strange. \u201cMaster, what happened to you?\u201d Why did he suddenly seem to not recognize her? She could not help but reach out her hands and wave them in front of his eyes. \u201cYou haven\u2019t lost your memories, right? Don\u2019t frighten me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsensical!\u201d His brows sunk even deeper, and they faintly carried slight irritation. \u201cSince you have come under my tutelage, then you\u2019re not allowed to be this unmannerly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She wasn\u2019t wrong, this was his face. But why did he look as though this was the first time he met her? \u201cAre you my master or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression sank. \u201cMy name is Yue Gu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not master? How was that possible? This was clearly his face, and the aura he was emitting, was even completely similar to her master\u2019s. Even the tone he was speaking with wasn\u2019t the least bit off. \u201cMaster, when did you change your name? I\u2019m Zhu Yao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhu Yao?\u201d Yue Gu blanked for a moment. His gaze lightly swept across her face, while he said with the same stern look. \u201cSince you have come under my tutelage, then your past name naturally cannot be used. You shall be surnamed \u2018Yue\u2019, and since you came from the south (Nan), then I shall bestow \u2018Nan\u2019 as your given name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue\u2026 Nan! (t/n: /Yue Nan: Chinese for Vietnam. *coughs*)</p><br/><p>He changed her citizenship just like that. Was it really alright?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a step forward, and placed her hand on his shoulder. She had confirmed it. \u201cGiving a name as nonsensical as this, you\u2019re definitely my master alright.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

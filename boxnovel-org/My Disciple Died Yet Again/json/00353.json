In the next moment, the howling of the winds brushed past her ears. When she raised her head to look, she saw the great blue sky and white clouds were moving behind her at incredible speeds.</p><br/><p>She was flying, and next to her were three pairs of large bat-like wings. Their dullness looked rather familiar. Reaching out beneath her, she felt a leather-like hardness.</p><br/><p>She had initially held her breath on purpose, so that she would not expose herself. Yet, he cautious heart instantly sank right down.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Then she ruthlessly stomped her feet and sat right up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Sesame who was still in the midst of flying was stunned for a moment. Excited, an enormous beast head twisted back and it looked at her with hot and teary eyes. \u201cMistress, you\u2019re finally awake\u2026 Aiyo!\u201d</p><br/><p>As it did not watch where it was flying, it instantly crashed into a cliff with a loud thud and fell down. Fortunately, it instantly remembered about its mistress who was right on its back and curled its body, in order to use its belly to shield Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she had landed on the ground safely, it then flashed with a bright white light and took up its human form. It hurriedly hugged onto Zhu Yao\u2019s legs and cried out loud. \u201cMistress\u2026 You frightened this beastie. The moment I woke up, I saw you lying over there motionless. I searched the entire Lightning Divine Palace yet I was unable to spot the Sovereign at all, so I thought\u2026 Uuuuu, this beastie\u2019s heart received a great shock.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were the one who brought me out of Lightning Divine Palace?\u201d Zhu Yao tried to shake it off her legs, but to no avail.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Beastie\u2019s little heart was this close to jumping out, you know?\u201d It had a pitiful look as it rubbed against her thighs. \u201cDo you know how frightening it was just now? Your heart wasn\u2019t beating and you didn\u2019t carry any aura. Beastie wanted to look for the Sovereign, but I did not find him. I then looked for the Floor Master, but I didn\u2019t see his figure either. I had no choice so I brought you here to look\u2026\u201d It stopped right there, and then cried out even more forcefully than before. \u201cFortunately, you\u2019re awake now, mistress. Otherwise this beastie would have become a child without a master. Uuuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Child\u2026 Am I your mother?</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. It was no wonder Floor Master and her master was unable to find out where her body was. Sesame was her spirit beast, so when it flew out of Lightning Divine Palace with her body, the formation outside naturally did not stop it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of my thighs first.\u201d Why are you, a big man, hugging onto someone\u2019s thighs? Don\u2019t you feel any shame? \u201cLet\u2019s have a proper chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d Sesame shook its head wildly, completely unaware of what shame was. \u201cMistress, don\u2019t you know what kind of shock my frail and young heart has received? You completely frightened this little beastie. Promise me that you wouldn\u2019t let me become a child without a master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d This old lady don\u2019t have such a huge child.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned and looked at the surroundings. The place was covered in huge mountains and dense forests. Huge boulders were erected all around, and the scenery was incredibly mystical. She had never seen such a scenery even after being in the Divine Realm for so many years. Recalling Sesame\u2019s words, she could not help but ask. \u201cWhere is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the continent of Demonic Immortals.\u201d Sesame replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d Demonic Immortal Continent. \u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d It was no wonder that they couldn\u2019t receive any signals from her body on the other side of the Divine Realm then. She had actually stepped out of the map. Without data roaming activated, how were they going to track her?</p><br/><p>Sesame paused for a moment, and then shamelessly continued to tightly hug her thighs, as he rubbed his snot and tears on them. \u201cI couldn\u2019t locate Sovereign and the Floor Master, so I wanted to return to the Demonic Immortal Continent to find out if there was anyone who could save mistress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Zhu Yao became a little confused. \u201cYou mentioned that you woke up in Lightning Divine Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI was in your divine sense the entire time, and had only woken up just earlier. In the end, when I came right out, I saw mistress lying on the bed. I thought that something might have happened to you which caused your resurrection to fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Should she mention about her completely forgetting about Sesame being in her divine sense? She didn\u2019t bring it along for several missions in the past, so she had long forgotten that it was bundled up with her this time. \u201cAhem\u2026 There isn\u2019t anything wrong with my body. The reason why I wasn\u2019t awake was because my soul flew out.\u201d</p><br/><p>She explained to it about the situation of her turning into a second rank divine sword.</p><br/><p>As Sesame listened to her, its expression instantly crumpled. It looked so pitiful, as though it had been abandoned. \u201cMistress actually forgot to let me out\u2026\u201d Its beastie heart shattered. It was angry! It wanted to vent!</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Why did she feel as though she was a trashy woman? She couldn\u2019t help but stroke its head. \u201cAbout that\u2026 It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t let you out. Look, after my resurrection this time, I\u2019m just a mortal. I don\u2019t have divine energy nor do I have any cultivation, how can I let you out of divine sense then? You\u2019re so obedient, the one and only good beastie in this entire world. You definitely understand your mistress, right?\u201d Mistress still loves you~</p><br/><p>Sesame pondered for a moment, its face seemed to have brightened a little. Mn. I\u2019m such a good beastie alright.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas your lack of cultivation truly the reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally really! You must believe me, my good beastie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, its glass heart had been repaired. \u201cThen\u2026 Then what about now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any cultivat\u2026 The hell!\u201d Zhu Yao circulated her divine energy out of habit, and a purple lightning spark actually appeared from her palm. Even she herself was shocked. \u201cHow?\u201d She carefully sensed her body, and realized that the cultivation level of this body had actually risen directly to that of a Profound Deity. This was a little too illogical, wasn\u2019t it? Was sleeping her body\u2019s secret art for cultivation?</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress?\u201d Sesame which was waiting for comfort saw her being dumbfounded all of a sudden, and could not help but nudge her. Continue praising me~</p><br/><p>\u201cI suddenly possess cultivation.\u201d Zhu Yao frowned. When it came to situations like this where a pie had fallen from the sky, she felt that a trap was definitely laid out at the back. \u201cThis matter is too strange. Let\u2019s first return to Lightning Divine Palace and ask my master.\u201d Zhu Yao wanted to fly on a sword out of habit, only to realize that she did not have any transportation tools on hand. Thus, she pulled Sesame up from her thighs. \u201cI don\u2019t have any mystic artifacts so I can\u2019t fly. Turn back into your original form and bring me back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Sesame turned into that six-winged demonic beast in a habitual manner, and with Zhu Yao on its back, it flew up.</p><br/><p>Eh, wait a minute!</p><br/><p>Where\u2019s the promised comfort?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>When it c</p><br/><p>Sesame bringing her out was like kicking an own goal, and she had no idea why her body suddenly possessed cultivation. It was a coincidence that Sesame woke up the moment the unreliable Floor Master was taken away by the Disciplinary Order. Seeing that Zhu Yao stayed unconscious the entire time and there was no one in the Lightning Divine Palace, it grew anxious and called 120\u2026 Ah pui! It brought her to the Demonic Immortal Continent. This matter was really easy to settle. Since she was brought out, then she just had to be brought back.</p><br/><p>However, when they arrived at the borders of the continent, the two of them were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Zhu Yao said as she pointed at the large amount and densely compacted wind blades, that were even more concentrated than infrared sensors. Her face darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cRealm Tide.\u201d Sesame felt like crying as well. \u201cThe Realm Tide will appear once every hundred years between the Demonic Immortal Continent and Deity Continent. Anyone who enters it will be injured by the wind blades and be sliced to the point where their corpses and bones wouldn\u2019t even be left intact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about defensive barriers?\u201d Zhu Yao continued to ask. Since they were wind blades, they could be blocked, right?</p><br/><p>Sesame shook its head. \u201cThese wind blades are different from the rest. They are materialized from the aura emitted by the Presenceless River. Barriers are basically ineffective.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Speak human.\u201d The hell\u2019s the Presenceless River?</p><br/><p>\u201cPresenceless River is the heavenly river that separates the two continents.\u201d Sesame said with a bitter look. \u201cAbove the Presenceless River, all divine arts or divine techniques will disappear, that\u2019s why the wind blades can render divine arts ineffective too. No divine arts can be used against them.\u201d</p><br/><p>That incredible? They\u2019re basically the DEL button.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when will this wind stop?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame raised one finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn hour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame shook its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne day? It can\u2019t be a month, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It still shook its head and weakly said. \u201cOne year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell.\u201d Zhu Yao became irritable. \u201cAs expected, it\u2019s more reassuring to keep you in my divine sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mistress.\u201d Its glass heart shattered once more. \u201cHow can you say that to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Its nose began to itch and its eyes were reddening. The acting skills of a moviestar were unleashed in an instant. Just as it was about to cry and complain, it was startled all of a sudden. Looking towards a certain direction, its expression instantly changed, becoming miserably pale. In a flash, it suddenly returned to her divine sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d It really returned just like that? When did it become so obedient?</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, hurry and retract your aura as a Deity! Hurry!\u201d Sesame\u2019s hurried voice resounded, carrying an anxiety that she hadn\u2019t seen before.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. Though she did not know what was going on, she still retracted it as told. Immediately after, two astonishing pressures came assaulting in an overwhelming manner. Even she could not help but hold her breath, and had almost sat on her butt.</p><br/><p>Two figures instantly appeared before her. After having a closer look on their faces, the corner of her lips could not help but twitch. One red and one yellow. The red one was bright red, and even his hair was red. The yellow one was light yellow, and even his fingernails were yellow.</p><br/><p>These two were Demonic Immortals at the Heavy Deity level.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy a Deity?\u201d The red Demonic Immortal was stunned for a moment. He looked straight at Zhu Yao, his gaze grew even more focused as time went by. The longer he looked, the brighter his eyes grew, and the more he wanted to lean closer to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi~\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but raise her hand and greet them.</p><br/><p>That red Demonic Immortal exhaled a little, and even his face reddened. He awkwardly tugged onto the corners of his robe and then pulled his sleeves a little. His voice instantly turned a little lower, and he even began to stammer. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s even\u2026 a little\u2026 a little sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned to look at the yellow Demonic Immortal at the side and nudged him a little. \u201cHey, what do you think we should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!?\u201d When that yellow Demonic Immortal was nudged, his legs wobbled and he almost fell. Only then did he regain his senses. He suddenly stepped forward and said with a stern look. \u201cLittle sister, hello. I\u2019m Yellow Qi. My original form is the Despis Beast from the feathered races, a Realm Protector of the Demonic Immortal Continent. I\u2019m of the fourteenth rank with the cultivation level of a Heavy Deity. I have three cave residences with beautiful sceneries and boundless divine energy. I can be considered as someone with achievements to my name. I even have the special authority to freely enter the Demonic Immortal Palace. Why don\u2019t we\u2026 first become friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What\u2019s with this feeling of being in a blind date?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Red Qi!\u201d After hearing Yellow Qi\u2019s words, he immediately added. He had a look filled with regrets. Why did he forget to do a self-introduction earlier? What a pity. He actually lost the initiative! He quietly shot daggers at his little companion with his eyes.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. It seemed like the absolutely evil World Favourable Impression ability was effective on Demonic Immortals too!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, you two bitches! Let go of my mistress. She only belongs to this beastie.\u201d Sesame began to wildly scratch on the screen inside her divine sense. \u201cI want to! Immediately! Right now! Beat these two blind beasts up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Come right out then, what\u2019s the point in shouting in my divine sense? Zhu Yao had a dark expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Deity little sister!\u201d Red Qi was still looking at her with a pair of shining eyes. \u201cWhy are you here? Are you lost? Where do you want to go? Do you want this big brother to send you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao quietly took a step back. Please retract that perverse look of yours first, alright? What happened to the promised conflict between Deities and Demonic Immortals? \u201cHoho, fellow great Demonic Immortals. I\u2019m just here to look at the scenery. I\u2019m done now, bye.\u201d</p><br/><p>She raised her leg and was just about to run, when the two Demonic Immortals finally regained their senses. They first exchanged glances, and then in a flash, blocked her paths as expected. \u201cLittle sister, you can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow big brothers, is there anything else?\u201d Zhu Yao tried her best to maintain a friendly expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, I\u2019m sorry for forgetting to mention this. Deities can\u2019t traverse freely on this side. Big brother Red isn\u2019t trying to make things difficult for you.\u201d Red Qi looked at her a little embarrassingly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this is an order from the king. Of course, we are certain that you\u2019re not a bad person. However, we have no choice but to first bring you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Yellow Qi immediately added. \u201cI shall bring you somewhere else to live for a few days, and simply ask you a few questions. Once the questions are done, if you want to see the sceneries, big brother can bring you around.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, they were here to capture her! It seemed like though the effects of the World Favourable Impression ability were incredible, they were still not as effective as the times in the Lower Realm. Though these two people were courteous to her, they were not treating her well for no reason.</p><br/><p>Left without a choice, Zhu Yao could only follow them. She did not dare to do anything in another person\u2019s territory either. Furthermore, she was just a Profound Deity while those two had the cultivation comparable to Heavy Deities. They could turn her into dust whenever they wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. Little sister, have you seen a six-winged Demonic Immortal with a pitch-black body?\u201d Yellow Qi suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned for a moment. Sesame?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks like this when transformed into a human.\u201d Seeing her dazed look, Yellow Qi materialized the man\u2019s image in the air.</p><br/><p>As expected, it was Sesame. Her heart trembled a little, and then she calmly shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve just arrived here, I\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d Seeing the two of their frowns, she casually asked. \u201cWho is this beast? Why are you two looking for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>A disgusted look instantly flashed past Yellow\u2019s and Red\u2019s face, and Red Qi even let out a cold snort as he ruthlessly said. \u201cThis beast is simply the shame of our Demonic Immortal Continent. He\u2019s the model of betrayals! Our princess loves him so dearly so, yet he actually discarded her and fled the wedding in front of everyone. That\u2019s why our great king issued an order to the entire Demonic Immortal Continent to capture him and judge him for his sins!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao nodded, and then she intentionally made her voice heavier. \u201cDiscard huh\u2026 That\u2019s truly a scummy beastie.\u201d She never expected that Sesame had such a honourable status.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Sesame grew anxious, as it began to bounce up and down in her divine sense. \u201cThis daddy here basically doesn\u2019t like her, alright? I don\u2019t want to marry a two-legged beastie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yellow and Red began to exchange condemnations on him as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? Our princess is the number one beauty of Demonic Immortal Continent, you know? Yet he still could make the heartless decision to abandon her. Just by this point alone, we can\u2019t endure it at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right!\u201d Yellow Qi responded as well. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even want the number one beauty. How can single puppies like us live then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes he think it\u2019s easy for beasties like us to find wives!? This daddy here has cultivated for hundred thousand years since my time in the Lower Realm, and I have yet to touch a female beastie\u2019s paw. On what basis did he reject her!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only cultivated for a hundred thousand years. I\u2019ve already cultivated for more than a few hundred thousand years. Let alone a beast paw, there\u2019s barely been any opportunities for me to strike conversations with one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, I really wish to find a female beastie to chat about life and talk about my ideals with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, I really wish to find a female beastie and bring her home for the holidays and the New Year\u2019s!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d So the beast world was actually facing a serious single population problem.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

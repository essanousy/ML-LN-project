She really wanted to give an acceptance speech of some sort. It continued to grow brighter in front of her eyes, and white was the only thing that she could see above her.</p><br/><p>Her master\u2019s figure next to her was growing fainter. Suddenly, he turned around and pressed on her lips. Then, he said with a sunken voice. \u201cReturn to Lightning Divine Palace with haste. Your master shall be waiting for your return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded, and only then did his figure completely disappear. Most likely, he had returned to his main body.</p><br/><p>The light continued to grow brighter, and Zhu Yao\u2019s little heart was beating rapidly. As long as she were to cross this white light, she would arrive in the Higher Realm, and she would then be able to reunite with her master. Finally, she could spend time loving for real. She suddenly felt the world had become even more beautiful than before!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s entire being was enveloped by the white light, brighter\u2026 brighter\u2026 and even brighter\u2026</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>Everything went dark!</p><br/><p>What happened? Was the electricity cut off? Where\u2019s the promised beautiful new world?</p><br/><p>Ting! A conversation window popped out right at this moment.</p><br/><p>You have disconnected. Please choose one of the following options:</p><br/><p>[Login with a new avatar] or [Give up on login] or [Retort]</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-flips table- Realmspirit, wait right there with your neck cleaned!</p><br/><p>The conversation window flashed, and a new row of words instantly appeared. User has chosen [Retort], switching to conversation mode.</p><br/><p>The screen shook, and a familiar QQ chat window immediately popped up.</p><br/><p>Realmspirti: Welcome back! Young maiden, the bug was fixed perfectly! You shall receive a five-star rating, yo!</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Eh? Young maiden, what\u2019s wrong? Why is your face so dark?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Young maiden, why are you taking off your shoes\u2026 Ah! Don\u2019t throw\u2026 Don\u2019t throw it at my face!</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Why are you still throwing\u2026 That\u2019s Bai Yuan\u2019s inner core! Hey\u2026 Young maiden\u2026</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Stop throwing already! If you can, then throw your chest pads at me too!</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: The hell! You\u2019re actually throwing them!</p><br/><p>A moment later\u2026</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Young maiden, I was wrong!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak, what the hell\u2019s wrong with you? Why did I end up in this stupid place when I was ascending so perfectly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: I\u2019m just worried that young maiden might be a little tired. You must watch out for your health and log off on time. It\u2019s work-life balance, you know?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao cracked her knuckles, emitting out resounding crackling noises. \u201cSpeak human!\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: An urgent bug has appeared, that\u2019s why I forcefully disconnected you.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell! So I was murdered by you this time!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Haah, young maiden, I don\u2019t have a choice this time around. You know this, right? Spirits have three urgent needs!</p><br/><p>\u201cPiss off!\u201d There\u2019s something wrong with me if I believe your words! What\u2019s this urgent situation you had to disconnect me for? Do you know how exhausting maintaining this avatar was? Yet, you disconnected me like it\u2019s nothing!\u201d Back then, Cheng Qingdiao had broken her avatar to an incredibly sorry state, yet she was still able to live past that. One will grow attached to an avatar after using it for a long time, you know?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Young maiden, the bug this time is really special. That world is already at the verge of collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what can I possibly do if I were to head\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could even finish, a video player suddenly appeared on the screen. Within the screen, the place was in complete chaos. The earth was shaking and spiritual energy was running amok. It was like an apocalyptic film. Even the practitioners that were flying in the sky were unable to escape. The entire world was enveloped in fear of death.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly recalled the moment when the world of the God races was at the verge of collapse. This was a very similar scene. However, back then she was able to open the World Crossing Door in time, while this world no longer had any presence of life.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the world where the next bug is in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: That\u2019s right! This is a scene from not too far away in the future. Young maiden, if it wasn\u2019t because of an especially urgent matter like this, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to forcefully disconnect you. Please work overtime!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. \u201cAmong the scenarios you have given me, which world wouldn\u2019t have ended up like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Young maiden\u2026 It\u2019s really different this time. This is extremely urgent. Please consider, kajima\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I even have a choice to make here?\u201d Zhu Yao smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: \u2026</p><br/><p>The screen was silent for a moment. After a long while, the next row of words finally showed.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Yaoyao\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize!\u201d Zhu Yao smiled. \u201cBecause I won\u2019t accept your apology.\u201d This time, she was truly angry. In my past reincarnations, at the very least, she got disconnected because of her own fault most of the time. She had always told herself that in a certain sense, Realmspirit was actually saving her each time.</p><br/><p>But what about now? Was he dissatisfied that she was taking too long to die, and thus made the move himself? Then what was he treating her as? A puppet that could be disposed of at anytime? People shouldn\u2019t behave this shamelessly!</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit! You have always told me that we are friends, but does real friends actually act like this?\u201d Zhu Yao took a deep breath, the flames in her heart could not be quelled no matter what she did. \u201cIf things go on like this, I don\u2019t know how far this so-called friendship can truly last.\u201d</p><br/><p>The screen was quiet for a very long time. The next row of words did not appear even after a long while.</p><br/><p>After a long while, the screen flashed and suddenly disappeared. A human figure took its place, and this time it was actually the figure of a woman. The woman\u2019s face was very familiar, because she looked exactly the same as Zhu Yao herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026\u201d She called out.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not have any reaction. She simply turned her head away, and no longer gave her another glance.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit lowered her head, and walked over with a guilty look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you, I won\u2019t accept your apology!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was silent for a moment, and then gently said. \u201cI know you have a lot of questions, and that you\u2019re very angry as well\u2026 But there are some matters that I still can\u2019t reveal to you yet, it\u2019s still too soon for you. I was\u2026 too impulsive this time. I shouldn\u2019t have done this to you, I apologize. I guarantee that this won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked sincere, and the anger within Zhu Yao finally quelled a little.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit smiled, and then, with her eyes looking straight at Zhu Yao\u2019s, she said. \u201cBut, Zhu Yao\u2026 Please believe me. I have never thought of harming you. If there comes a day when you truly do not wish to continue, even if I have to use all of my power, I will send you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao clenched her fists, and finally after taking in a deep breath, she could not help but push her face away. \u201cDon\u2019t say something so disgusting with my face, hey!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho\u2026 Young maiden, you\u2019re clearly enjoying it!\u201d Seeing that her anger was quelled, Realmspirit instantly returned to her rough attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that~ Help me fix this bug of mine again~ Because of the increase in difficulty, I will be providing you with all-round technical support, along with great rewards~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of support specifically? And what are the rewards?\u201d Everything you gave her had always been shocks, alright!?</p><br/><p>She suddenly snapped her fingers, and a screen once again appeared in the air. A certificate could be seen in it. \u201cDo you still remember that Plane Movement Permit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to help my master make one?\u201d After all, she returned to this place because of this exact reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Her face stiffened. \u201cI can help you submit an application to the Plane Transmigration Inspection Bureau!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d One glance and Zhu Yao knew she wasn\u2019t that reliable.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, young maiden, you must trust me! I have a pretty great reputation, and there\u2019s a very huge possibility that the application will be successful. The success rate is as high as 3.8%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d She actually dared to bring up a measly 3.8%.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung maiden\u2026 Don\u2019t be so heartless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going to fix that bug or not?\u201d This person sure had lots of nonsense to talk about.</p><br/><p>\u201cFix, fix, fix, of course! Immediately!\u201d Realmspirit hurriedly nodded. That reincarnation loading bar instantly appeared before her eyes.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit had an unwilling look. Out of nowhere, she pulled out a small handkerchief, and waved it frantically at Zhu Yao. \u201cHurry and come back, dear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, he did not have a physical body, it seemed like he was just a strand of divine power left by the former owner.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d What should she do now?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Zhu Yao returned to lying on the ground, and continued to act dead.</p><br/><p>The white old man stroked his beard, and floated over. After looking on the ground, he was suddenly stunned. \u201cWhy are there three?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man frowned, and seemed to be in a difficult position. \u201cThen let\u2019s choose the one with the best Spirit Vein!\u201d First, he looked at the most left, where Lu Cha was, and muttered to himself. \u201cFire and Earth Duo-Spirit Veins. Although she has qualifications of the upper tier, she\u2019s not suitable for my Arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hence, he shifted his gaze to Xiao Yi, and his eyes momentarily shone, revealing a hint of delight on his face. He then inspected his Spirit Vein, and the delight in his eyes grew even more. \u201cMetal and Wood Duo-Spirit Veins! Good, good, good!\u201d He said the word \u2018good\u2019 three times in a row, his eyes had already narrowed into a pair of lines, and then, finally, he looked towards Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao figured that this old man should be thinking of choosing the disciple with the best Spirit Vein, and he will then pass down his Arts and \u201cWood Spirit\u201d to the selected individual. After all, this was how it always worked on TV.</p><br/><p>She was not the least bit worried of her own qualifications, after all, what she had best was her Lightning Spirit Vein.</p><br/><p>As expected, the old man reached out his hand to inspect her qualifications, and again, as expected, he revealed a shocked expression on his face, and seemed as though he was about to blurt out. \u201cIt\u2019s Lightning\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man looked at her, and then, looked at Xiao Yi who was at the center. Then, he decisively turned and walked towards Xiao Yi. \u201cLet\u2019s still pick this child instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell!?</p><br/><p>Do you have to be that bias?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but jump up. \u201cWhat happened to the promise of picking the best Spirit Vein?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 How are you awake?\u201d The old man was stunned for a moment, and looked disbelievingly at Zhu Yao who suddenly rose. \u201cImpossible. How could an Azoth-stage practitioner defend against my pressure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to care about that!\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but roll her eyes. She had a hot temper in the first place, and hated unfairness the most. Also, he was just a spectre, so he would not be able to do anything to her. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to choose the one with the best qualifications? How can his qualifications compare to mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Kuh kuh!\u201d The old man cough out a little awkwardly. \u201cLittle girly, don\u2019t be agitated. Although your qualifications are good, I\u2019m a little more destined with this boy, so I decided to pass down to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already dead, what do you need destiny for?\u201d Zhu Yao did not believe him in the slightest. Earlier, when he inspecting their Spirit Veins, she had already felt it. Clearly, he very despised both her and Lu Cha, yet, he behaved solely different towards Xiao Yi. It was as though, the moment he saw him, an expression of delight appeared on his face. Unless\u2026</p><br/><p>She looked at the spectre from head to toe. \u201cYou can\u2019t be gay, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGay? What this \u2018gay\u2019 thing?\u201d The old man was startled for a moment.</p><br/><p>The more she thought about it, the more Zhu Yao felt that it was a possibility. \u201cIn other words, you\u2019re into men.\u201d</p><br/><p>When those words fell, the old man was instantly flustered. \u201cY-Y-You\u2026 You\u2019re\u2026 You\u2019re wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why is your face red?\u201d His face had reddened to the point where his white beard could not cover it, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cTh\u2026 Th-The\u2026 The weather\u2019s hot!\u201d The old man used his hand to fan himself in a panic, while he tried to defend himself. \u201cHow could this old man\u2026 this old man\u2026 be interested in this\u2026 this little brat.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not say he was interested in Xiao Yi. Could this could be considered as a confession he made by himself?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was already hundred percent sure. So he was really gay, it\u2019s no wonder he would not pick her nor Lu Cha.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle\u2026 Little girly.\u201d This old man faked out a few coughs. His face was filled with embarrassment from being seen through. \u201cThis old man sees that you possess pretty good comprehension ability. To be able to meet you here, we can be considered as fated as well. Although I\u2019m unable to pass down my Arts to you, I have a few treasures here, why don\u2019t I gift you one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas this a bribe? Incidentally, she did not have an excuse to obtain the \u201cWood Spirit\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s true!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I want the \u2018Wood Spirit\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d The old man was instantly at a loss, and looked even more shocked as he stared at her. \u201cHow did you know I have that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know how I know about it. Just give me an answer. Are you giving it to me or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The old man looked even more hard-pressed, and turned to look at Xiao Yi who was on the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m unwilling to give it to you, it\u2019s just that this spirit of the wood element, does not easily admits someone as its master. Furthermore, this \u2018Wood Spirit\u2019 can assist my disciple in his cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t give it to me, I will tell everyone in the cultivation world, that you\u2019re gay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man instantly softened. \u201c\u2026 We can always talk things out.\u201d Gritting his teeth, he then turned and waved his sleeves. The surrounding fog scattered by a bit, and in front of him, six wooden chests appeared. \u201cLittle girly, this \u2018Wood Spirit\u2019 has followed me for many years, yet, I\u2019m still unable to make it submit. It could be seen that only someone who is fated can wield such a spiritual item. Over here, there\u2019s six chests. Pick one. If you\u2019re\u2026 Ehhhhhh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before waiting for him to finish, Zhu Yao had already walked over, and picked up the one on the furthest right.</p><br/><p>The old man was filled with unretractable shock, as he looked at Zhu Yao was calmly holding onto the chest. \u201cY-Y-You\u2026 How did you know that the Wood Spirit was in that box?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened as well. It was hard for her to not recognize it, alright? Because the two words \u201cWood Spirit\u201d were floating above that chest. And, they were in the same font and same boldness as the word \u201cBUG\u201d on Xiao Yi\u2019s face. Even if she did not want to recognize it, it was difficult for her not to, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that, in this world, there\u2019s really such a person of great luck!?\u201d The old man mumbled to himself, and the eyes he was looking at her with began to be filled with envy and hate.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, however, did not bother to care about him, and opened the chest.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s hilarious was, the chest only had a small tree sapling inside, and it was even bud with only two leaves. It was currently twisting its white and tender branches, twisting it to the left, and then, twisting it to the right, as though it was dancing.</p><br/><p>Probably because it was suddenly interrupted, that small sapling paused for a moment. It slightly raised its head, and then, let out a gentle\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChick?\u201d (With changing tones!)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Are you a chicken?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was speechless. Yet, that little sapling covered itself with its two leaves out of extreme embarrassment, giving a shy look as though it\u2019s dark secret had been exposed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the Wood Spirit?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>Only then did that small sapling slowly unfolded its leaves. Tilting its body, as though it\u2019s to answer her, it let out another sound. \u201cChick\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A little sapling with such good spirituality. Zhu Yao could not help but poke its leaves, and gave it a praise. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>When those words fell, with a \u2018pupu\u2019 sound, between the leaves, a small red flower instantly bloomed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao had a subtle feeling.</p><br/><p>Yet, that little sapling held onto that small red flower in the center with its two leaves, and with a strong pull, it picked the flower out of its body, and then, passed it over to her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Thank\u2026 Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChick~\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did she feel that this \u201cWood Spirit\u201d was a little weird. Was it this friendly to every person it meets for the first time?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had an inexplicable expression as it turned around the little red flower she was gifted with, yet, the old man suddenly moved in, and said with a stern expression. \u201cLittle girly, you have to be careful. This \u2018Wood Spirit\u2019 isn\u2019t as simple as it looks on its surface\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, the little sapling suddenly grew out the leaf on its left, instantly turning it into a size of a palm, and strongly slapped towards the old man\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Before the old man could even cry out, he had already been thrown dozens of meters to the back by its slap.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The little sapling returned to its original size. Twisting its white and tender branches, it acted cutesy towards her. \u201cChick~\u201d</p><br/><p>As though the one who sent him flying was not it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was not responding to it, the little sapling became agitated. It instantly leapt out of the chest, jumped onto the lid of the chest, and even used its two leaves to hug onto one of her fingers, and rubbed her finger with its body.</p><br/><p>\u201cChick~\u201d</p><br/><p>So cute. Alright. She gave in.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to leave with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little sapling tilted its body. \u201cChick!\u201d</p><br/><p>In that instant, Zhu Yao was a little hard-pressed. She had obtained the Wood Spirit, but now the big problem was, where was she going to put it? After all, it was not good to put a spiritual item in her storage bracelet, and the most important was to prevent Xiao Yi from discovering it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girly, you can\u2019t bring this \u2018Wood Spirit\u2019 out.\u201d As she was hesitating, the old man suddenly floated over. The affectionate expression on his face had disappeared without a trace, rather, it was now dyed with a bit of haziness.</p><br/><p>What did the Wood Spirit signify? The control rights to all of the wood spiritual energy and spiritual plants in the world. No one would easily hand such a treasure to someone else, moreover someone who had cultivated for ten thousands of years like him. Although he had already fallen long ago, he was still unwilling.</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hand, the chest in Zhu Yao\u2019s hands instantly closed, and flew into his hands.</p><br/><p>She knew it would not be this simple. Zhu Yao could not bother to speak to him either, and summoned her flying sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even bother to argue with someone like you who doesn\u2019t keep to his words. Show your hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he was alive, this old man might be a famous individual, at the very least, he was a practitioner at the Nascent Soul stage, and he might even be a practitioner of the Ancient Era. However, no matter how powerful he was, currently, he was just a spectre. She just could not believe that she would not be able to beat him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, you\u2019re extremely arrogant for someone of such a young age.\u201d The old man looked at her with belittling eyes. His entire face began to distort, and even his voice began to turn ghastly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how big the world is.\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly did a hand-seal with a single hand, summoning a fire dragon. Zhu Yao was just about to block it head-on, but the old man actually turned, and attacked towards the strange door in the sky above where they came from.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. Why the hell did he not think it through and decide to smash his own door?</p><br/><p>Very quickly, Zhu Yao realized what he was trying to do. Under his attack, the door still looked completely unscathed. However, it was not as quiet as before. The mystic beast on that door, began to struggle out from inside the door.</p><br/><p>He was trying to release that mystic beast!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was extremely shocked. First, a head popped out of the door, immediately after, a large half of its body got out of the door. As it struggled, it roared out with extremely huge force, and with every inch of its body escaping, its figure grew twice as big.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart trembled. Even from such a far distance, she was still able to feel the bloody smell coming from that mystic beast body. It\u2019s ferocity could be clearly seen.</p><br/><p>Finally, that mystic beast broke out of the formation. Facing towards the sky, it emitted out a long roar, and was even more ear-piercing that the previous one it made. Even though she had tried to defend against it will all her might, her blood flow was still scrambled by it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao spat out a mouthful of blood, and was no longer even able to stand steadily. Once again, she fell onto the ground, and pain filled her entire body. She could feel that even her breathing had gotten difficult. This pressure was the same as when she first entered this place. She had thought that this was released by the old man, but it had always been this mystic beast who did it.</p><br/><p>The mystic beast seemed to have discovered her. With a leap of its four legs, it came running towards her.</p><br/><p>The hell, why the hell did animals like to chase after her to play? She hated little animals!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

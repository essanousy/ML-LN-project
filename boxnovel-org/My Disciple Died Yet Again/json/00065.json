Not to mention practitioners who are above the cultivation level of Azoth are unable to enter the place. The way you put it, you\u2019re making things a little difficult for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi tightened his fists, as though he was suppressing something with all his might, and completely did not look as though he bothered about her. After a moment, he hugged his fist and bowed to Yu Yan. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, this disciple is afraid to have offended you. The reason why this disciple has come here is to simply confirm if big sis Zhu Yao had returned. But now it seems\u2026 Since ancestral-grand master does not have a way to enter the Secret Realm, then I will find one myself. This disciple takes his leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>As though he had decided on something, his expression was even more firm, as he turned and left without the slightest of hesitation.</p><br/><p>Seeing that expression, Zhu Yao\u2019s heart shook. This little wimp could not be thinking of forcefully entering \u2018Tasyoluk\u2019, right? The barrier outside the Secret Realm could even block against Demigod-stage practitioner, if an Azoth practitioner like him were to forcefully enter the place, he would definitely be crushed into smithereens.</p><br/><p>As she suddenly had a bad premonition, the words to stop him blurted out just like that. \u201cLittle wimp, you\u2019d better come back here, right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to step out, his feet stopped. He suddenly turned his head over, his pair of eyes stared widely at her, and his expression was filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Uh, is it too late to regret?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis\u2026 Zhu Yao!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, it\u2019s too late.</p><br/><p>A certain master turned his head over as well, and threw a pair of scornful eyes at her, as he shook his head with a disappointed expression.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 Just why could she not change her habits of having a cheap mouth?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, you\u2026 why are you\u2026\u201d Wang Xuzhi, sprinted back like the wind, and swept his gaze at her from top to bottom.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I want silence.\u201d If you ask me who\u2019s silence, I will beat you to death.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi\u2019s eyes fixated on her chest, and he raised his hands as he wished to pressed on it.</p><br/><p>With her palm, Zhu Yao slapped away his claws, and then, she raised her hand and gave him a huge bump on his head. \u201cStinky brat, what are you doing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Nothing. I just\u2026 just\u2026 Big sis Zhu Yao, You\u2026 Why did you turn into\u2026\u201d Probably because of the blow from the truth was too large, Wang Xuzhi began to speak incoherently.</p><br/><p>Did she not just simply switch a character? Was that so hard to accept?</p><br/><p>However, Wang Xuzhi was even more confused, and even more anxious. \u201cI\u2026 I couldn\u2019t find you in the Secret Realm. And after coming out, I still wasn\u2019t able to find you. You\u2026 You returned\u2026 You finally returned\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d Wang Xuzhi hurriedly rubbed his eyes, and he said those words rather smoothly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still denying it!?\u201d Seeing this big youth whose words were becoming messier, and had begun to shed tears, Zhu Yao felt her heart aching a little. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Your big sis is an unkillable machine, I simply changed my form, that\u2019s all.\u201d She stroked the back of head which she had knocked onto earlier. So this little wimp actually returned into the Secret Realm to find her. At least you\u2019re considerate, I didn\u2019t pamper you for so many years for nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cForm? Then, right now, big sis Zhu Yao is really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m a man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wang Xuzhi opened his eyes wide, and his hand trembled as he pointed at her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao patted on his shoulder, and in her heart, the thought of bullying someone had resurfaced once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I have turned into a man, will you despise me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Wang Xuzhi loudly answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still the best.\u201d Zhu Yao acted like she was moved, and rubbed the corner of her eyes, as she threw a flirtatious look at him. \u201cLittle wimp, do you still remember what you said when you were little? That you will definitely marry me. I believe we have all grown up, and it\u2019s about time to fulfill your promise. Take me as your bride then. If not, I\u2019m fine with taking you as my bride too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi suddenly took a step back, and looked at her with a conflicted expression. His face turned from red, to white, and then green, it was so fascinating, she could not shift her gaze away at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d As though he was unable to endure this irritating thousand-mile reunion, a certain master was in a bad mood, as he coldly stared at Wang Xuzhi. \u201cYou have trespassed into the Jade Forest Mountain. I will not fuss about this matter. Leave!\u201d Someone else\u2019s disciple, hurry and scram! Don\u2019t teach my disciple bad things.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi looked at Zhu Yao, and his expression was conflicted. As though he had encountered a huge problem, he could not bear to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we get the opportunity in the future, I will discuss with you about it again in detail\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao narrowed her eyes, approached the side of his ear and said with emphasis of each and every word. \u201cThe. Things. Regarding. Our. Marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d His legs turned limped, and left Jade Forest Mountain like he was flying.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s stomach began to ache from laughing. He really could not handle scares. Was her turning into a man something that he could not accept that much? Look at how calm her master was\u2026</p><br/><p>Not only did he not despise her, he even stripped off her clothes directly the moment he saw her.</p><br/><p>==</p><br/><p>No, wait. That was not something that she should be happy about.</p><br/><p>The second day after her return, a certain master, so as to prevent other disciples from suddenly trespassing and teaching his disciple bad things, silently activated the formation of Jade Forest Mountain. Wang Xuzhi was completely unable to enter, and Zhu Yao\u2019s only entertainment had disappeared as well.</p><br/><p>However, the heavens seemed to be purposefully not allowing her to stay idle, as she felt strange in the early morning. The sky above the entire Ancient Hill Sect was a little dark, which seemed to be a precursor for a huge storm. Even the heavenly cranes on the Jade Forest Mountain began to cry out crazily.</p><br/><p>As though something had brought about their uneasiness.</p><br/><p>The pressure of the air was very unbearable, and Zhu Yao felt strangely flustered, and kept feeling as though something was about to happen. Raising her head, she looked at the sky, only to see the tumbling dark clouds, and something seemed to be brewing inside the layers of clouds.</p><br/><p>Normally, the Ancient Hill Sect was a blessed land, and would always be bathed by spring sunshine, a large-scaled gloomy weather like this rarely happened. The more Zhu Yao stared at those clouds, the more muffled she felt her heart was. She kept feeling as though something was in the middle of the clothes, something that she felt very intimate to.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s forming his Nascent Soul.\u201d Yu Yan frowned as he looked at the tumbling lightning clouds in the sky. \u201cWith such a huge heavenly might, it seems like the Lightning Tribulation will be falling soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning Tribulation?\u201d Could it be Xiao Yi? However, he had only formed his Azoth Core not too long ago. Even if he had hidden his cultivation, it could not possibly allowed him to reach the level of an Azoth Paragon in just a single month. Unless\u2026.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly recalled that berserk Metal Spirit. Although the Metal Spirit stopped its disturbance, it had taken in a huge amount of metal spiritual energy. If it had returned to Xiao Yi\u2019s side in that state, it was not impossible for him to instantly form his Nascent Soul. So the one forming his Nascent Soul was really him?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt a little depressed. She seemed to have unconsciously helped him out.</p><br/><p>Raising her head, she looked at the mass of black clouds, and suddenly recalled back then when Xiao Yi was forming his Azoth Core. She thus made a joke. \u201cMaster, do you think the Heavenly Lightning this time, will come zapping at us again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was startled, as though he had thought of something, he suddenly turned towards his own disciple, and his eyes instantly shone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d What happened to him now?</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d Yu Yan summoned his flying sword. Turning to look at his stupid disciple who had yet to understand, as though he seemed to despise her slow movements, he picked his disciple up by the collar, and rose into the air. His figure flashed, as they flew towards the eastern direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, we can always discuss things first.\u201d Was there a need to pick her up this way?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not say a single word, he simply flew towards the very edge of the Tribulation Clouds, and stopped at a small island far from the Ancient Hill Sect.</p><br/><p>Placing Zhu Yao down, he did not explain, and simply, like a hard-working little bee, began to set up various formations on the island. Although Zhu Yao was not very familiar with formations, she could faintly see that, the formations he had placed down were all concealment-related formations.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Give me an explanation!</p><br/><p>After a few minutes, Yu Yan finally stopped, and threw a bombshell. \u201cYou shall form your Nascent Soul here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d What kind of situation was this? Forget about lightning spiritual energy, the amount of spiritual energy on this island was very sparse as well. What kind of national level joke was this?</p><br/><p>Stupid. Yu Yan shook his head, and pointed to the Tribulation Lightning up in the sky. \u201cCan you sense the lightning spiritual energy within those lightning clouds?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded. Not only was she able to sense it, she had a feeling that the thing inside the clouds were especially trying to come to her, yet, they seemed to be restrained by something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the bolts of Tribulation Lightning descend, you shall do your best to guide them to this island.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat master means is\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao finally understood. His intention was to have her form her Nascent Soul by taking in the lightning spiritual energy from the Tribulation Lightning. What else could have more abundant lightning spiritual energy than Tribulation Lightning? Her master was very smart, and she gave him a thumbs up. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master will use the Lightning Guiding Art as well, to aid you in guiding the Tribulation Lightning over. You shall form your Nascent Soul with all your might.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly sat in a lotus position, closed her eyes, and calmed her emotions. She attentively sensed the Tribulation Clouds over there, and could faintly see the sparks within the layers of tumbling clouds.</p><br/><p>The sky had completely turned dark, and suddenly, a thunder roared, and a bolt of white lightning flashed from within the layers of clouds. Hurry, over here. Hurry, over here. Hurry, over here. Zhu Yao silently thought.</p><br/><p>That bolt of lightning struck down, and just when it looked as though it was about to land on the person in Ancient Hill Sect who was facing the Tribulation, it suddenly did a curve, headed straight for the little island, and impartially struck onto Zhu Yao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A large amount of lightning spiritual energy instantly poured into Zhu Yao\u2019s body. An indescribable pain ached through her entire body, to the point where she could not even straighten her hips. Especially the place where her Dantian was, as it looked as though it was about to be shattered apart.</p><br/><p>Only then could Zhu Yao really feel what it felt like to shatter her Core. This pain was exactly the same as how she felt right before she died at Tasyoluk. After resurrecting, she did not have any spiritual energy, so naturally, she could not feel the pain of her shattered Core. Now, the pain, as though it had suddenly fragmented, came attacking once again, and she seemed to be unable to hold on, as the pain she was experiencing was as though her heart was crumbling down.</p><br/><p>\u201cPay attention, and guide the spiritual energy into your divine sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s words sounded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly regained quite a bit of consciousness, and instantly used all of her might within her body, to guide the lightning spiritual energy particles that was going rampant in her body, into her divine sense, however, this brought about an even more unbearable pain. If the pain of a shattered Core could be taken as a pain on a physical level, then this time, it was her soul which was in pain. However, she simply could not stop, and could only continue to guide the spiritual energy and refine her own divine sense. Zhu Yao even began to have thoughts of swearing.</p><br/><p>She was actually still clearly conscious right now, it was definitely a miracle. Just when she thought that she was able to hold on, even without her guidance, the second bolt of Heavenly Light actually came striking towards her, and the spiritual energy in her body increased explosively.</p><br/><p>The hell, was there a need to be this quick?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had no choice but to crazily guide the lightning spiritual energy into her divine sense, causing the sense of pain to intensify. Immediately after, the third bolt, the fourth bolt, every bolt was stronger than the previous one. Those bolts of Tribulation Lightning seemed to have grown eyes, as every bolt struck was smoother than the one before. In the end, they even saved the step of making a curve from Ancient Hill Sect, and directly zapped towards her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

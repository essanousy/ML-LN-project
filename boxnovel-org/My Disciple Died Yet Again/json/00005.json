You did something wrong, yet you still do not attempt to amend your mistakes. You actually made the same mistake of cutting into someone\u2019s conversation twice. Did your mother not teach you the word \u2018etiquette\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yo! Such bad temper! Do you think you\u2019re the only one who knows how to scold someone\u2019s mom!?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where did your mom learn her etiquettes from? Before talking about others, has she ever looked at herself in a pool of her own piss?\u201d Balls. I have never gotten this angry ever since I was born.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d She began to flare up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis red-clothed miss.\u201d Zhu Yao did not give her the opportunity to talk back. \u201cIf interrupting someone\u2019s conversation, is considered to be a lack of etiquette, then, earlier, when you interrupted my question to the Sect Master, doesn\u2019t that mean you lack of etiquette as well? As strangers, asking each other\u2019s names is a usual thing to do, yet you suddenly cut in and scolded me for being audacious? I was curious, so I simply asked. How was that audacious? Then, may I ask, where did your etiquette go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The face of the red-clothed lady turned green. \u201cYou\u2026 As a disciple who has yet to officially enter the sect, you actually directly asked for our Sect Master\u2019s name. If that\u2019s not audacious, what is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was the one who first asked for my name. Before asking for someone\u2019s name, one should introduce himself first, isn\u2019t that proper manners? And you have already said it yourself. I\u2019m a disciple who has not officially entered the sect, and since I have yet to join your sect, I\u2019m still not one of your disciples. I\u2019m just a third party, someone that\u2019s completely unrelated to you people. What does he being a Sect Master has to do with me? Why can I not directly ask him of his identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 What fallacy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling my words a fallacy when you don\u2019t have the ability to rebut them. When you\u2019re able to rebut my words, you call me audacious. May I ask, miss, how did your mom teach you about \u2018etiquette\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow me to give you a piece of advice, miss. Do not take yourself too seriously. Not all people will simply go along with you. Do you think everyone in this world is your mom!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudent!\u201d The red-clothed lady seemed to have flown into rage. Summoning a ball of flames with her hand, she then threw it at her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, this is what they call turning someone\u2019s feelings of shame, into anger. A fight is about to break out, yo.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister!\u201d At the key moment, the Sect Master uncle intervened. Summoning a flow of water, it extinguished the ball of flames. \u201cDo not be rash.\u201d</p><br/><p>The red-clothed lady took in a few deep breaths, and finally calmed down. However, she was still staring daggers at Zhu Yao, looking as though she could pounce at her and eat her at any moment.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao feel a little afraid. The hell, how could she forget that this was a Xianxia world? These people were all existences capable of killing her with a snap of their fingers. But how could she scold her mom the moment she started talking to her? In which child\u2019s heart, is his or her parents not a taboo? Furthermore, she was someone who had crossed into another world, and she might not be able to see them for the rest of her life. And that lady just had to cross the line, so why would she not bite her to death!?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle miss, you have to calm your emotions as well. I believe you\u2019re able to guess that your potential is unordinary as well.\u201d The Sect Master began to act as the middleman. \u201cIf you enter our sect, you will have to give your utmost to train yourself. Are you willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot willing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh kuh kuh\u2026\u201d The Sect Master almost choked himself. \u201cWhat.. What did you say?\u201d With her potential, she would definitely enter the Jade Forest Mountain. Everyone in the entire cultivation world would rack their brains for every method possible to be a part of that place. Even though her current age was indeed a little over the prime, with that person\u2019s capabilities, there should be completely no problems in having her to reach Azoth before her lifespan ends.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know that, the place you\u2019re about to go, is Jade Forest Mountain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know!\u201d What did it have to do with her?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao courteously gave the uncle a pair of rolling eyes. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m dumb? I have offended this junior-martial sister of yours today, if I were to really join your sect, wouldn\u2019t she be able to torture me to death!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sect Master uncle\u2019s face distorted a little. Although what this miss said was not impossible\u2026 Did she not put it out too bluntly? He glanced at his junior-martial sister, whose face was already pale and dark. Was it really alright to say such words out loud? Was it really alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh kuh, do you really not want to cultivate as a deity? This is a great opportunity, you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s just leave it at that\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao shrugged, and said. \u201cI will go back to where I came from. Bye bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026 Wait a minute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the Sect Master could stop her, Zhu Yao had already happily begun to run out of the hall. This lady, why did she not follow the standard procedure?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a fierce gale blew, and a white-clothed man suddenly appeared at the entrance. Before Zhu Yao could even see him clearly, she smashed head on with him.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026 A bun grew. Flames of anger welled up inside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you not open your eyes when you walk!? Move away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The entire hall was instantly filled with silence.</p><br/><p>Only a moment later, did the man who had collided with her, slowly take a step to the side.</p><br/><p>Only after that did Zhu Yao go out of the entrance. Before walking away, she did not forget to give him a pair of rolling eyes. So what if you have muscles? Hmph!</p><br/><p>\u201cAncestral Grandmaster, that miss has the Lightning Spirit Vein!\u201d The Sect Master called out immediately.</p><br/><p>When the man at the entrance heard this, he instantly grabbed onto the person who just left. Zhu Yao was walking really hastily, so, when she was suddenly pulled, naturally, she once again collided with the man. Hence\u2026 another bun grew.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stroked the two bumps which suddenly grew on her head, raised her head, and looked at the man, who had a cold look. \u201cI say, bro\u2026 Do you have something against me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was startled for a moment, and then, he replied with absolute seriousness. \u201cNone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, they why did you pull my yarn for!?\u201d Are you picking a fight!?</p><br/><p>The man lowered his head and pondered for a moment. And then, he replied with even more seriousness. \u201cI did not pull any yarn. What I pulled was your hand.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Take a deep breath\u2026 Don\u2019t be angry, don\u2019t be angry. The sky looks so wonderful today, it\u2019s not good to be angry like this!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will just treat it as my bad luck. I have to trouble you to move away by going around there. Don\u2019t block my path, alright? Thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man frowned, and rejected her request decisively. \u201cCan\u2019t do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what the hell are you planning?\u201d So, causing her to have two big lumps on her head was not enough, he was planning to add a few more lumps?</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel! Accept me as your master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me kneel to your sister instead!\u201d Who said she was going to be his disciple?</p><br/><p>The man frowned even more deeply, and still said with the same cold tone. \u201cI\u2019m the one who will be your master, I don\u2019t have a sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Bro, you win. Just which planet did you come from? I can\u2019t communicate with you at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

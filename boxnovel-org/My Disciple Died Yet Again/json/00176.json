After a moment, she sensed that the three\u2019s presences had already left Fluorescent Wind Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have let them go.\u201d Yu Yan frowned, as he greatly disapproved of her actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Zhu Yao sat right onto the bed. \u201cNo matter how stupid Mo Xianxian is, after the incident today, she will no longer seek revenge on Fluorescent Wind Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dimensional space in that jade\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat piece of jade is merely a tool, a human\u2019s heart is what\u2019s truly dangerous.\u201d Zhu Yao explained. \u201cMo Xianxian offended Fluorescent Wind Sect that day, and now, she had even been expelled from Advent Cloud Hall. Even if my mother does not pursue this matter, there\u2019s no guarantee that someone else wouldn\u2019t target her. That piece of jade is her life-saving celestial tool. If I were to take it away, most likely, she wouldn\u2019t be able to survive. So why don\u2019t I take this opportunity to earn a favor from her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu Yan did not speak any further, however, his frown deepened. When he recalled that piece of jade was initially his own disciple\u2019s body, and it was now even in someone else\u2019s hands, for some reasons, he felt a little displeased. As expected, that Goudan person, he should have been killed right from the start.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, master.\u201d Zhu Yao suddenly recalled something. \u201cI feel a little strange, as though I\u2019m suddenly able to control fire\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could even finish\u2026 poof!</p><br/><p>The entire ceiling was suddenly lighted up by an intense fire, instantly burning the ceiling into a clean crisp, as ashes fell and covered her entire face.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like that.\u201d She pointed to the ceiling. She was suddenly more proficient in fire-based arts than lightning-based arts.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank. It sure was rare to see fire-based arts being cast so quickly. \u201cWhen did you realize this?\u201d He silently cast a water-based art, extinguishing the fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday, when Mo Xianxian snuck up on me.\u201d Initially, she had only thought that the flames had a certain degree of intimacy with her, and that it was unable to harm her in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan reached out his hand and cupped her wrist, inspecting her meridians. After sending in a strand of divine sense to investigate, he realized that his disciple was as normal as ever. He had always known that his disciple possessed heaven-bending affinity with lightning spiritual energy, so when did she become so affinate with fire as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour current body carries too many mysteries, your master do not know of the reason either.\u201d Yu Yan released his hand, and then moved to stroke her head. \u201cThe Hall Master has always possessed deep understanding in regards to many strange matters. Tomorrow, I will make a trip back to Lightning Divine Hall. While you\u2019re here at the Fluorescent Wind Sect, do not take any rash actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao put down his hand which was destroying her hairstyle, and she was startled when she heard his words. \u201cMaster, you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Yu Yan took the opportunity to hold onto her hand. Learning from what she did before, their fingers intertwined. \u201cWhile I\u2019m not here, you must be extremely careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Zhu Yao weakly responded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my mother\u2019s here! Although my current body has yet to officially begin cultivating, but even with Mo Xianxian\u2019s Profound Deity Paragon\u2019s cultivation was unable to defeat me. There\u2019s no problems, no worries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan blanked for a moment, as though he suddenly thought of something. After sizing his disciple who was in front of him, a strange thought suddenly popped in his head. \u201cYu Yao, what\u2019s your current level of cultivation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Why did he suddenly bring this up? \u201cAren\u2019t I a middle-stage Profound Deity? Oh wait, I changed my character, and I have yet to begin cultivating. So I can\u2019t even be considered an Earth Deity\u2026\u201d As she said that, she herself was startled as well. Earth Deity? Then why was she able to defeat Mo Xianxian?</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s voice deepened. \u201cI can\u2019t make clear of your level of cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>When someone was unable to see through a person\u2019s level of cultivation, there would be two likely scenarios. First, the person of interest did not possess any cultivation. Second, the level of cultivation of the person of interest was much higher than oneself, and hence, was unable to be seen through. She had always thought that she belonged to the first category, but earlier, she had clearly defeated Mo Xianxian, a Profound Deity, to the point where she was unable to fight back. So, Zhu Yao basically did not seem to be cultivation-less.</p><br/><p>If she belonged to the second category\u2026</p><br/><p>Her master was already a High Deity, the highest level of cultivation which one could reach in the Divine Realm. Yet, he was unable to see through her own cultivation level. If that\u2019s the case\u2026</p><br/><p>Her level of cultivation was higher than a High Deity?</p><br/><p>This was simply unbelievable.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not that she had never tested her own level of cultivation. Her master was a High Deity, and his divine sense could envelop a large half of the Divine Realm continent. However, her divine sense could only allow her to clearly see objects in a hundred kilometers radius. So how could her level be higher than his?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute. A hundred kilometers. Her activity range seemed to be limited to a hundred meters as well. Could this be the reason?</p><br/><p>Master returned to Lightning Divine Hall on the second day. All of the questions could only be answered once he returns.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao spent most of her time staying in Dawnfall Peak, and occasionally, she would visit her cheap mother. Yin Shi, however, no longer brought up Xu Nuoyan. Most probably, she had already begun to guard against him. Zhu Yao did not mind helping her putting more eyedrops.</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan possessed a deep scheming mind, and he contemplated a lot as well. Zhu Yao guessed that his final objective was to obtain Fluorescent Wind Sect. Although Mo Xianxian had already let go of him, it did not mean that he wouldn\u2019t find another opportunity to make a reversal. Zhu Yao was uninterested in power-struggling affairs like this, but Yin Shi was after all, her mother, so naturally, she couldn\u2019t side with a stranger.</p><br/><p>The investigation on Xu Nuoyan conducted by her cheap mother did not end, though Zhu Yao wasn\u2019t sure if she had confirmed that Xu Nuoyan\u2019s words were all true. These days, even if she was the one who bring up the topic of Xu Nuoyan, her tone would always carry an unconcealed anger. Initially, even though he was the former Sect Master\u2019s personal succeeding disciple, a large half of the sect affairs had to go through his hands. Currently, Yin Shi was slowly retrieving such responsibilities. If not for the reputation of her cheap husband, who had already entered the Lightning Divine Tower, most probably, Yin Shi would have already expelled him from Fluorescent Wind Sect.</p><br/><p>For a moment, Zhu Yao felt that the mission this time around was unexpectedly easy. Looking at it now, there\u2019s no longer a need to fear that Fluorescent Wind Sect would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>But, she suddenly recalled something. Just who was the bug this time?</p><br/><p>No matter was it Mo Xianxian, or Xu Nuoyan, the word \u2018bug\u2019 did not seem to be present on their faces. In the beginning, she had thought that it was that piece of celestial jade. However, she had already looked over it clearly. The two letters \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018u\u2019 were indeed present on that remaining half piece of jade, but it definitely couldn\u2019t be termed as a bug.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the loophole this time wasn\u2019t physical?</p><br/><p>Just when Zhu Yao was pondering about this, Xu Nuoyan came to visit her himself. Even after a long while since they met, he was still the scumbag who carried the same elegant demeanor. He completely did not look dispirited from being pressured, and the gaze he was looking at her with was still giving her goosebumps.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister. Long time no see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, fellow deity Xu.\u201d Zhu Yao really did not want to deal with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister, why did you decide to call me \u2018fellow deity\u2019 again?\u201d Xu Nuoyan did not look bothered in the slightest. \u201cBack then, didn\u2019t you already call me senior-martial brother? Why the sudden change?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was my mother who reminded me. I have already admitted into the Lightning Divine Hall. So, I\u2019m not a disciple of Fluorescent Wind Sect, naturally, we can\u2019t refer to each other as martial brother and sister.\u201d Back then, it was merely to get you talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Xu Nuoyan was unexpectedly conversational this time. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then I won\u2019t be courteous around junior-martial sister either. Why don\u2019t I call you by your Daoist name, Yu Yao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 This sure was hard to refute. \u201cFellow deity Xu, is there something you need from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan did not mind her coldness in the slightest, as he grinned from ear to ear. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I simply thought that you will definitely feel bored by staying on this Dawnfall Peak all day. Coincidentally, Sect Master has dispatched me to deal with a small affair in Cloudhold City a few tens of kilometers south from here, so I\u2019m here to ask if you\u2019re willing to go there together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Only a ghost would go out with a scumbag like you. \u201cIt\u2019s best if I stay here and cultivate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao sure is diligent.\u201d Xu Nuoyan continued. \u201cBut, you have only just awoken not too long ago, so you should be rather unfamiliar with everything in this world. Yet, you\u2019re not even curious about the outside world, that sure is a rarity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart clenched for a moment. She seemed to have really been performing a little too calmly. Though, in the beginning, she was not worried if the matter of her becoming Yin Xin was exposed, after all, she had confessed directly to her cheap mother. But, even if Yin Shi accepted her, it did not mean that someone else wouldn\u2019t be suspicious.</p><br/><p>This scumbag sure was scheming alright.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the closest and luxurious city from Fluorescent Wind Sect, it shouldn\u2019t take that long to arrive. And, auspicious clouds seemed to be gathering there today, most probably, someone from the lower realm is ascending. It\u2019s a rare opportunity, are you sure you\u2019re not going?\u201d Xu Nuoyan continued.</p><br/><p>Fine then, if she were to really reject him, with a heart as scheming as his, he might really grow suspicious of her. And\u2026 She really was a little curious. As someone who had snuck into the heavens, she was rather interested in matters such as ascension.</p><br/><p>In the end, Zhu Yao still accompanied him there. That Cloudhold City was only about fifty kilometers away from Fluorescent Wind Sect, so she wouldn\u2019t possibly faint because of leaving too far from it like before.</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan was heading there for a mission this time. He was going there to welcome the deity who was ascending to the higher realm, and to persuade him to join Fluorescent Wind Sect. For a Gold Deity to be dispatched for such matters, it could be seen how afraid Yin Shi was of him.</p><br/><p>Before setting off, she went over to where Yin Shi was to let her know. Initially, she had wanted her cheap mother to stop her. In the beginning, Yin Shi was indeed a little unhappy, however, after Xu Nuoyan spoke a few words, she actually agreed to it. She had even joyfully contributed a celestial sword to be used as a transportation tool. Mother, am I actually your biological daughter?</p><br/><p>With nothing else to refute, Zhu Yao could only resign herself to fate, and headed off.</p><br/><p>Along the way however, Xu Nuoyan did not behave like before, where he would make use of every opportunity to make talk with her, and demonstrate his utmost faith. Other than the way he was looking at her, which was still causing her goosebumps, he did not bring up the matter about Mo Xianxian in the slightest. Even if she had the intention to bring it up, and wanted to throw some sarcastic remarks, with a good temper, he did not reply, and instead lightly chuckled.</p><br/><p>Had this Xu Nuoyan changed his ways? Or had he been broken by Yin Shi?</p><br/><p>With such an irregular Xu Nuoyan, Zhu Yao could not help but raise her guard. Only a ghost would know what kind of thoughts he had in his head, it would be best for her to be a little more careful.</p><br/><p>They were flying at an extremely slow pace, as Zhu Yao was intentionally appearing as though she possessed a low level of cultivation. Xu Nuoyan coordinated with her speed throughout the entire journey. Flying at a position a step away from her, which was neither close nor far, he looked rather gentlemanly. It seemed that Mo Xianxian falling for him was not without reasons. At the very least, he did put in effort in the way he presented himself.</p><br/><p>Just like that, they slowly flew for an hour. Just when they were about to reach their destination, she suddenly heard a familiar voice from below.</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn Rock Spirit to me, otherwise I will show you what I\u2019m made of!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately stepped on the brakes, stopped mid-air, and looked down below.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

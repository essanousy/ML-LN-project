What\u2019s the meaning of hers being stuck right in the middle?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this period of time, refrain from taking in spiritual energy to recover your cultivation.\u201d Yu Yan instructed with a stern look.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happens if I recover my cultivation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your body possesses spiritual power, you will definitely be forced to form your Nascent Soul. When that time comes, your spiritual power will be insufficient. If you were to take in spiritual energy then, it will cause a spiritual energy disturbance, but if you don\u2019t take in spiritual energy, your Nascent Soul formation will fail.\u201d When that time came, she would definitely die from her Core being destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what am I supposed to do?\u201d Zhu Yao felt like crying. She had the cultivation, yet, not the spiritual power. Did she have to quietly become a cripple for the rest of her life?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to worry.\u201d Yu Yan stroked her head. \u201cWait out as I find a place with abundant lightning spiritual energy, you can directly nourish your Nascent Soul then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although that was the case, Zhu Yao knew her situation wasn\u2019t optimistic. The spiritual energy in this world all followed a certain rule. For example, water spiritual energy was abundant at the waterside, wood spiritual energy was abundant in forests, fire spiritual energy was abundant in volcanoes, metal spiritual energy was abundant near mines, while earth spiritual energy, even more so, was everywhere.</p><br/><p>Yet, she just had to be a Lightning Spirit Vein Holder. She had never known of anywhere abundant with lightning spiritual energy, and a place like that was simply only found in legends. Of course, other than this method, it could be possible with having the various Spirits by the person\u2019s side as well. An example would be Xiao Yi\u2019s Metal spirit. As long as he willed for all of the metal spiritual energy in the world, he would be able to use it. However, in this world, there were all five of the different Spirits of metal, wood, water, fire and earth, yet, the Lightning Spirit simply did not exist. Isn\u2019t this a complete bullshit setting!?</p><br/><p>\u201cChick~\u201d As though it had sensed her depressed feelings, the Wood Spirit leapt out of her divine sense. Stretching a soft green vine, as though it was to console her, the vine wrapped around her wrist. \u201cChick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 the Wood Spirit?\u201d Yu Yan looked at the little tree which suddenly leapt out.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao realize that she had yet to tell her master about the things regarding the Wood Spirit. \u201cI encountered it in Tasyoluk. Back then, it and Sesame hid in my divine sense, and when I resurrected, they came over as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Yu Yan nodded. Actually, he had already guessed most of it. His disciple had changed her look, yet, that mystic beast could actually appear instantly by her side, so it had definitely came along with her. If it had hid in her divine sense back then, then it could be understood completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I have something that I need to tell you.\u201d Zhu Yao pondered for a moment, and decided that it was still best to clearly explain everything to her master. When she hid the truth from him, it had always caused her to feel a deep guilt and remorse. And, it was not like it was something shameful, so why could she not talk about it? \u201cActually, I\u2019m not a person from this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yu Yan calmly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d Oh? Just an oh, and that\u2019s it? This reaction wasn\u2019t right. \u201cMaster, I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m not a person of the cultivation world. I came from another world, a place completely different from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Ah!?\u201d What did you know? \u201cWhen did you know about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan turned his head and pondered for a moment, before answering. \u201cThe first day when you climbed the mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but swear. The hell was this? Then why the ass was she so anxious earlier for?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour words and actions are different from ordinary people.\u201d Yu Yan calmly analyzed. \u201cBack then, I guessed that you came from a certain unknown place, and adding your affinity towards Lightning Spiritual Energy that exceeds ordinary people, I\u2019m even more sure about it. Not to mention that you have resurrected twice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Why did she feel like she was the only idiot in this world?</p><br/><p>Resentment\u2026.</p><br/><p>Raising her head, she shot a resentful lightwave at her master.</p><br/><p>However, Yu Yan calmly continued to mess up her hair persistently. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Do not speak to me, I\u2019m very sad now. With my IQ, I might as well catch chickens!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I know of this, do not speak of this easily to anyone else. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh no, why did she suspect that she was really an idiot!?</p><br/><p>A certain master continued to stroke her head.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao might as well tell her master about everything. Beginning from her work in the modern era, to the irregularities after she crossed into this world. However, they had a generation gap of an entire world, so, a lot of effort had to be put in to fill in the gaps.</p><br/><p>Hence, the main point had completely derailed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a computer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 A tool used to calculate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people of your world isn\u2019t able to count?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that using a computer is much faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s koukou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s QQ, a tool used to chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people need to use a tool to chat? Are your bodies naturally crippled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c==, no. It\u2019s just that it can be used to send messages through long distances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSound Transmission Talisman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what\u2019s a net game?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn online game that allows people from all around the world to play as a pastime, at the same time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn line? A game that connects lines together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLine is just a metaphor. Generally speaking, it\u2019s a game that allows people from all around the world to play together, even without leaving their own homes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA large-scale Sound Transmission Talisman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d\u201cMn, something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people of your world, used so much effort to make such a large Sound Transmission Talisman, just to play a game as a pastime?\u201d Yu Yan calmly looked at her, and gave her a \u2018are there huge pits in your brains\u2019 look.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d What to do? Why did she feel that the people of her world was very silly?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what happened to Wang Xuzhi?\u201d Zhu Yao decided to change the topic. She really worried that without her around, that little wimp had did something stupid again.</p><br/><p>The hand on her head stopped, and a certain master\u2019s expression sank. \u201cTasyoluk has already been closed, naturally, he\u2019s on his way back here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTasyoluk!\u201d Zhu Yao was a little shocked. Was it not supposed to open once every five hundred years? Could it be that, this time, her resurrection has costed her five hundred years of time? \u201cWhen did he set out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan looked at her strangely. \u201cNaturally, he went with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith me?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled, and suddenly had a guess. \u201cThen master, the place you were heading to earlier\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf of the divine sense that I left with you was forcefully ousted from \u2018Tasyoluk\u2019.\u201d Yu Yan looked at her with a slightly furious expression. \u201cHence, I decided to rush over to take a look. I did not expect that, the moment I left Jade Forest Mountain, I would sense you on that island.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was thinking of rushing over to save her, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI admit my mistake.\u201d Zhu Yao hurriedly admitted her wrongs. The moment she recalled that punishment earlier, her buttocks ached. Deep in her heart, she was a little moved, but happiness filled most of it. She did not expect that her resurrection this time would be so timely, and there was basically not any difference in time. She gave a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan rose. Walking away a few steps, he reached out his hand and chanted an incantation. Not a moment later, a white light flashed, and a white jade pendant laid on the palm of his hand. It was exactly the jade pendant in Tasyoluk he hid his divine sense in. Since his disciple had returned, naturally, his divine sense did not need to be left inside any longer.</p><br/><p>He gripped his hand, and the pendant instantly shattered. A white light floated out, and slowly returned into his body.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao went forward to look, and did not see any difference. Originally, she had wanted to learn this sort of cloning technique, however, her master did not have any intention to teach her. He then explained the situation of nourishing a Nascent Soul in detail, various methods to react to them, and his experiences. After pondering for a moment, he explained the various states of a Demigod as well, while he was at it.</p><br/><p>Although the time spent from the Nascent Soul stage to a Demigod would take at least a thousand years, or even a few thousand years, this disciple of his had always skipped levels. A month ago, she had just stabilized herself at the early Azoth realm, yet, now, she was beginning to form her Nascent Soul. This speed of skipping three levels, it was still best for him to make early preparations.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao became a little dizzy from his words. The so-called Nascent Soul formation her master spoke of, was actually to use her spiritual energy to refine her divine sense, to the point where her divine sense could be firmly congregated, and also to the degree where it could leave her body. Her master\u2019s divine sense clone, was actually the result of his divine sense refinement.</p><br/><p>Back then, when she stopped the Metal Spirit in Tasyoluk, she brought about a spiritual energy disturbance. The expanding spiritual energy instantly shattered her Azoth Core, causing her to not be able to form her Nascent Soul. So it was because she did not guide the spiritual energy into her divine sense. As expected, there was a mistake in the way she handled it.</p><br/><p>Divine sense was a person\u2019s most important part, and was an existence equivalent to a soul, so it could be imagined how much pain one had to endure when one had to refine his or her soul. Zhu Yao silently lit a candle for herself, who was about to form her Nascent Soul.</p><br/><p>With this single lecture, it lasted until evening, and only then did her master released her. As someone who had no ability to defend herself, naturally, she was confined by her master. This time, she herself was willing.</p><br/><p>She did not know where Sesame ran off either, as it had never returned.</p><br/><p>Just when she was about to sleep, suddenly, she heard a familiar voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSword Mountain\u2019s Wang Xuzhi, wishes to meet ancestral-grand master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little wimp was back!</p><br/><p>Before waiting for the person inside the cottage to respond, Wang Xuzhi who was wearing the sect\u2019s uniform flew down. His figure was a little fatigued, and his clothes were still stained with blood that he had yet to clean off. His hair was in a mess, and what he now lacked was just the word \u201cexhausted\u201d on his face. However, his pair of eyes was exceptionally spirited as he stared at Yu Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disciple greets ancestral-grand master.\u201d Wang Xuzhi gave Yu Yan a bow.</p><br/><p>Yu yan frowned, and was clearly a little irritated. Only after he sat down on the stone chair, did he finally nod expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi glanced at Zhu Yao who was at the side, and suppressed the curiosity in his heart. \u201cThis disciple has something to ask ancestral-grand master about. Ancestral-grand master, please solve this disciple\u2019s confusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not reply, his line of sight was not even directed over at him. He never had any patience towards other people.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi could only grit his teeth and continued asking. \u201cThis disciple wish to know about the little infant Little Bun you brought back ten years ago, whom you had taken as a disciple. Was she actually your previous personal succeeding disciple, Zhu Yao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was shocked. It seemed like the last call she gave him back then at Tasyoluk had exposed her. It was good that she had currently changed into another character.</p><br/><p>\u201cAncestral-grand master, please tell this disciple the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with you?\u201d Yu Yan raised his head, and cast an expressionless look at him, and replied with this sentence, as though he was asking for a beating. As expected, he hated other people\u2019s disciples the most.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi choked, and a hint of anger surfaced on his face, yet, he was unable to let it out. Gritting his teeth, he took a deep breath. \u201cThis disciple simply wish to tell ancestral-grand master, your second disciple is currently trapped in the \u2018Tasyoluk\u2019 Secret Realm. I request ancestral-grand master to land a helping hand, and tell this disciple if there\u2019s any other way of entering the Secret Realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not answer. He simply turned his head and stared at Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>The spectator is innocent.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The surrounding scenery however, grew even more familiar. Only when she saw that familiar huge tree, did Zhu Yao recall the place. Wasn\u2019t this the place where the Phoenix Clan was living in?</p><br/><p>However, the huge tree that penetrated through the clouds and touched the sky before, currently had already been bent and torn apart. Only half of the tree trunk still stood erect, while the air was concentrated with the sand and dust that swirled up from the collapse of the huge tree.</p><br/><p>Seeing this scene, Zhu Yao and Yue Gu were both startled for a moment.</p><br/><p>The Phoenix clan\u2019s Parasol Tree, the Dragon clan\u2019s Dragon Abyss, and the Qilin\u2019s Sky Supporting Pillar, were unique existences in the world, divine structures birthed and nurtured by the heaven and earth. Theoretically speaking, a place like this, no matter how big a disaster were to happen, it would be impossible for a collapse to occur. However, right before their eyes, the Parasol Tree had fallen.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao grew even more worried. Earlier, just what in the world was that earthquake? To actually bring about such an outcome\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s first head to the Terrace of Revelations.\u201d Yue Gu frowned. After giving the half remaining Parasol Tree a glance, he flew straight towards the skies above. Above the sky, a gigantic pillar of colorful light was emitting out its radiance. And at the center of the pillar of light, was exactly the place which she had received her inheritance from \u2013 the Terrace of Revelations.</p><br/><p>When they arrived, the Terrace of Revelations was already filled with the various Gods that had rushed over. Dragons, phoenixes, and qilins. Not a single one of them were missing. Without exceptions, every single one of them was looking at the pillar of light in the sky with astonished looks.</p><br/><p>Bringing her with him, Yue Gu directly descended at the most center position.</p><br/><p>The crowd was first startled, before giving their greetings one after another. \u201cGreetings to the Highgod.\u201d Even Patriarch Qian Yu was respectfully bowing towards him.</p><br/><p>Her gaze landed on Zhu Yao who was by his side, and her eyes instantly brightened a little. Zhu Yao waved her hand, as a way of greeting her. After a careful look, probably because it had only happened just recently, most of the Phoenix clansmen had arrived, but Shao Bai was still nowhere to be seen. It seemed he was still at the Nether Abyss.</p><br/><p>\u201cHighgod, a Revelation has suddenly appeared in this world. Do you know of the reason?\u201d The Dragon Patriarch took a step forward and asked.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu raised his head, and looked towards the pillar of colorful light. Yet, he did not answer his doubts, instead, he took a step forward, and stood at the center of the formation. \u201cWe will know after looking at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A red glow once again lighted up within the formation. Four inheritance stones corresponding to the different races once again appeared at the sides of the pillar of light.</p><br/><p>Just like before, the former three inheritance stones were still emitting light like a curtain of light, and the diagrams on them still remained the same. While the fourth inheritance stone was also\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell. Why did words suddenly appear on it? And they were even neatly printed in a row\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPress me, press me, press me, press me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She weakly took a step back, and calmly continued to watch the pillar of light. Pressing it would definitely lead to bad outcomes. Only someone silly would press it.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu suddenly raised his hand, and slammed onto that piece of black stone.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What happened to the promised tacit understanding between a master and his disciple?</p><br/><p>The moment he slapped onto it, the ink-black stone earlier, suddenly lighted up with a green glow. As though it had been activated, the black color completely disappeared. What\u2019s mysterious was that there still wasn\u2019t any diagram on it. The glow grew even brighter, and it finally gathered into a sphere. Like a projection, it struck straight towards the pillar of light in front of it.</p><br/><p>In an instant, rows of what seemed to be runes that were alive, slowly revealed themselves. Those were words in a language she had never seen before. They looked like the oracle bone scripts she once saw in a museum, but\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell, she was actually able to understand them.</p><br/><p>Just like having a translator suddenly being installed in her brain, even though they looked foreign in her eyes, in her mind, the correct meaning of the words automatically appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cBearing the will of the lord, the Gods and Devils will arrive, the golden age of the Ancient Era will open, responsibility of the Three Realms will be taken, and an eternal sacred ground will be created.\u201d Someone softly said the words written above.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Earlier, she didn\u2019t really feel it, but after it was said out loud, she suddenly recalled. Weren\u2019t these the words Realmspirit told her before? Could this be the Revelation Realmspirit was talking about?</p><br/><p>\u201cNirvana and rebirth. Banishment and return. Everything will begin with a profound beginning. Everything will end with a profound end.\u201d That person continued.</p><br/><p>The latter few words sounded a little foreign. Zhu Yao, who had switched away from her occupation as a literature teacher, pondered. What does this mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cHighgod, what does these few words mean? Is it related to the unnatural movements earlier?\u201d Someone expressed his doubts.</p><br/><p>Knowing that she wasn\u2019t the only one who was illiterate on site, Zhu Yao calmed down.</p><br/><p>The Qilin Patriarch asked with a pleading look. \u201cI wonder what the warning the Heavenly Dao have given us this time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Gu frowned even deeper. Turning around, he swept his eyes at the three Patriarchs, and after awhile, he said with a solemn voice. \u201cThe will of the Revelations this time, is something I\u2019m unable to interpret either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three faces instantly turned a little pale, and they evidently looked a little anxious.</p><br/><p>Qian Yu: \u201cThen what\u2019s the best course of action now? Even the Parasol Tree has fallen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qilin Patriarch: \u201cYes, even the Sky Supporting Pillar has suffered heavy damages, it won\u2019t last for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dragon Patriarch: \u201cOur Dragon Abyss as well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s supposed to come, will always come in the end.\u201d Yue Gu suddenly added these words. \u201cEveryone, it\u2019s best to put safeguarding the Sealing Grounds as priority. In regards to the will of the Revelations, once I have interpreted it, I will inform your various clans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHighgod\u2019s words are right.\u201d The three let out long sighs, before nodding one after another.</p><br/><p>A fire phoenix suddenly flew over, charging straight towards the Terrace of Revelations. For unknown reasons, that fire phoenix came flying over in his original form, and when he descended, he did not take up his human form, but collapsed right onto the Terrace of Revelations.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a rich smell of blood filled the entire Terrace of Revelations.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Ming!\u201d Qian Yu recognized this phoenix from her clan, and took a few steps forward to aid him in returning to his human form. However, the blood on his body was still flowing like free money. \u201cWhy are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch.\u201d He grabbed onto Qian Yu\u2019s arm, completely ignoring his own injuries, and heavily panted. \u201cThe seal\u2026 The seal of the Devil Sealing Grounds has already been broken through\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of everyone present instantly changed.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu was the first to react. Picking up Zhu Yao beside him, he galloped towards the southern direction, his speed was so quick, the scenery next to them turned into streaks of broken images.</p><br/><p>Only after a few moments later did Zhu Yao finally regain her senses. He was heading towards the Devil Sealing Grounds at the extreme southern lands. Earlier, that phoenix said that the seal has been broken? Could it be the seal used to seal the Devils? Her heart instantly clenched. Does it have to be this violent? That place is where all the Devils between the heaven and earth are sealed in, if all of them were to be released, wouldn\u2019t that be bad?</p><br/><p>But why did her teacher bring her along? Although she did not mind fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Phoenix clan, she seemed to have trained in her mystic arts for only a few months. What\u2019s the use of someone as half-baked as her? She was rather professional at holding people back though.</p><br/><p>Teacher, are you in need of a cannon fodder?</p><br/><p>Yue Gu simply had no time to care about his disciple\u2019s frustrations, as he flew even faster. Zhu Yao had never experienced such terrifying speed. If Gods did not possess an innate godly radiance that protected their bodies, she would have long been pressed into a pie by the air pressure. Let\u2019s not forget about the countless flashes of broken images in their surroundings.</p><br/><p>She felt that she was a little motion sick. Urgh\u2026 I feel like vomiting.</p><br/><p>Fifteen minutes later, Yue Gu finally stopped. Before Zhu Yao could suppress the disgusting feeling in her mouth, she was dumbfounded by the tragic scene in front of her eyes. Fresh blood flowed like river all over the place. No matter was it the sky, or the earth, the place was filled with the figures of various God races. Qilins, dragons, and phoenixes.</p><br/><p>Every single one of them were already in their original forms, using all their might to attack the dancing darkness in front of them. There were even some whose godly energy had been depleted, and were unhesitatingly using their own bodies, directly making use of their God\u2019s bloodline that had innate suppression effects against their opponents.</p><br/><p>In front of them, within a boundlessly large curve-shaped curtain of light, countless of dark shadows wanted to charge over, only to be blocked by the curtain of light. Occasionally, they would reveal several terrifying distorted faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cHighgod!\u201d Someone noticed Yue Gu who suddenly appeared, and exclaimed out. Expressions carrying hints of excitement and hope surfaced in this tragic-filled place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the situation?\u201d Yue Gu cast an art. The curtain of light that had formed cracks from the clashes with the Devils earlier, instantly restored to its former look.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Devils have already broken through the first layer seal. The second layer seal doesn\u2019t seem like it can sustain much longer either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Gu frowned deeply. Looking at the realm in front of him that had already turned into complete darkness, he tightened the grip in his hands, and said with a stern look. \u201cThe seal must be restored. All of you, safeguard this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he charged right into the large base of the Devils, who were crazily crashing themselves into the curtain of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao tapped on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu turned around, he first had a surprised look, followed by a furious expression. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you pull me in?\u201d She did not even have the time to react, alright?</p><br/><p>He was startled for a moment. Lowering his head, he looked at the two interlocked hands, and sank into silence for two seconds. \u201cMn, work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d \u2018What the hell\u2019 was written all over Zhu Yao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The moment they entered, she felt a sinister cold instantly enveloping her entire body. Anger began to surface in the depths of her heart out of nowhere, as though she had encountered her mortal enemy, and could not suppress the intentions to attack them. Was this a God\u2019s instincts?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? There\u2019s actually still more who dare come to court death?\u201d A sharp, surprised voice suddenly sounded beside her ears, yet, she couldn\u2019t find a physical body, and could only see a dancing black shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch bravery. It seems we have to give a proper welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho\u2026 How are we going to kill them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s a phoenix? Why don\u2019t we first pluck out all her feathers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell! Zhu Yao instantly felt her violence meter surging right up. Raising her hand, she swept it in all directions, releasing countless of lightning lights, crackling without limits. This old lady here hates others bringing up the matter of her feathers the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning! She actually possesses the lightning attribute.\u201d</p><br/><p>An exclamation sounded from within the darkness, and it faintly carried a cry of misery.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu did not idle as well. The moment the lightning lights appeared, with a twist of his hand, a golden light emitted out from his body, dispersing throughout the surroundings. The realm which was pitch-black earlier, was instantly brightened up by a golden radiance. Even that sinister cold feeling had dispersed quite a bit as well.</p><br/><p>A distorted black shadow came attacking towards them, and with another twist of his hand, that black shadow instantly turned into black mist.</p><br/><p>Only then did Yue Gu have the time to care about the disciple whom he accidentally brought in. \u201cSince you have already entered, then accompany me in restoring the seal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhu Yao blanked. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hoho, you must be joking. \u201cTeacher, I don\u2019t know how though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOffering Seal Art. That\u2019s the first layer seal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Offering Seal. An incantation, and the corresponding method of evoking it surfaced in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you recall now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zhu Yao nodded. \u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCoincidentally, there\u2019s two extreme points to the seal. I will head left, and you will head right. Go on then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhhh\u2026\u201d Let her finish, hey. She knew the method, but that mystic art could only be cast on a squared meter area each time, at the very most, it could only seal a single Devil. The one in front of her eyes was evidently a mass production, she couldn\u2019t handle something like that!</p><br/><p>But, a certain figure had already disappeared in front of her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

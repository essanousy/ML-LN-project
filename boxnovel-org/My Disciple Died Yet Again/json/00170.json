Other than the Black Tortoise which was an existence acting as the cornerstone of the world, and had only appeared once at the world\u2019s beginning, the other three God races had formed their own clans. Among them, only the Dragons were given birth through eggs, and the Qilins were viviparous. As for Phoenixes\u2026</p><br/><p>Hoho, they did not give birth.</p><br/><p>The reason why Phoenixes were called immortal birds, were because at the moment of their deaths, their bodies would turn into flames, and then, they would resurrect from the ashes. Hence, they basically would not have problems such as lack of population, after all, they couldn\u2019t die. However, with every rebirth, the Phoenixes would lose their former memories, and revert back to chicks. The parent-child relationship among the Phoenixes, were determined by the first person they see right after their resurrection. In other words, it\u2019s the so-called imprinting phenomenon.</p><br/><p>When the Dragon clan informed the Phoenix clan, the Patriarch came over really quickly. Zhu Yao had thought that the person would be an uncle, but it turned out to be an auntie.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the auntie did not look at that shaky egg, but instead, instantly went to hug onto the bony child, and began to cry her lungs out. As she cried, she called out. \u201cShao\u2019er, Shao\u2019er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So it turned out that this child was actually her second son, Shaobai! Two years ago, he fell into the Nether Abyss, and never did she expect that he would reappear here.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao evidently sensed that there was something off with everyone\u2019s expressions when the auntie spoke of the Nether Abyss, as they looked at the child in disbelief. As the auntie was able to find back her son, she was really happy. However, the child was evidently unappreciative of it. Under the giving her a single glance when she appeared, no matter what she said after that, he didn\u2019t budge, and continued to hug onto Zhu Yao tightly.</p><br/><p>Only then did the auntie notice the egg. However, even after discussing with the Dragon clansmen, no one knew just what kind of egg was she.</p><br/><p>The Dragon clan felt that among the four great God races, only the Dragon race were hatched through eggs, so inside the egg, it should undoubtedly be a Dragon. However, the Dragon clan always had difficulties with giving birth, hence, they would always pay utmost attention to every single Dragon egg. And, with every production of a Dragon egg, an mystic phenomenon would definitely occur between the heavens and earth. In these recent ten thousand years or so, there had only been twelve of such mystic phenomenons. In other words, the number of eggs that should exist, should only be twelve. A situation where one was being left out was basically impossible.</p><br/><p>The auntie of the Phoenix clan felt that this was a Phoenix egg. Although they had never laid eggs, that did not mean that, they wouldn\u2019t be able to, right? If all Phoenixes had all relied on resurrecting from the ashes to live on, then, where did the first ever Phoenix in the world come from? Not to mention, among the bird-type creatures and clans in the world, didn\u2019t all of them lay eggs?</p><br/><p>Not only was this a Phoenix egg, there was a possibility that this was an opportunity bestowed to the Phoenix clan by the Heavenly Dao. An opportunity for them to procreate like the other races other than by resurrecting from the ashes.</p><br/><p>And there was a portion of them who thought that this might be an egg of a Black Tortoise. Although no one had actually seen a Black Tortoise clansman, it was still one of the four God-beasts along with the other three. This sounded logical, and most probably, it\u2019s an opportunity for the Black Tortoise to make a reappearance.</p><br/><p>Everyone believed that their own words were logical. The God race had always found difficulty with procreation, every child was extremely precious to them. Hence, both parties wished that this egg which had suddenly appeared was their own clansman.</p><br/><p>As for the Qilin\u2026</p><br/><p>In any case, they weren\u2019t here right now, so there\u2019s no need for them to be part of this. The two clans ignored them in a very understanding manner.</p><br/><p>In the end, after a long discussion, investigation, and argument between the two Patriarchs, they came into an agreement. The decision would be made after it hatches. No matter was it a chicken egg, a duck egg, or a century egg, after looking at the child after it hatches, then it would be entirely clear.</p><br/><p>In regards to who would be in-charge of hatching the egg, the Dragon clan was unable to compete for it. Because at that point in time, they did not possess this skill. The eggs of the Dragon race had always been placed in the volcano, allowing them to hatch under the natural high temperatures. Because the hatching territory was specifically chosen by the Dragon clan, and each of their babies had its own settings targeting its needs, there were formations that increased the temperatures purposefully laid there.</p><br/><p>Because the content within this egg was still unknown, this method evidently could not be used.</p><br/><p>Hence, the egg-hatching work was handed to the Phoenix clan.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, auntie was planning to bring the egg home to hatch it.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao imagined herself being sat on by a huge Phoenix\u2019s buttocks every single day, she felt uncomfortable all over.</p><br/><p>At the key moment, it was still her little friend Shaobai who made a critical impact. Because\u2026 He wouldn\u2019t let go!</p><br/><p>No matter who it was trying to persuade him, be it uncle, auntie, bros, oh, they were her little friend Shaobai\u2019s father, mother, and big brothers of course, in the end, even when his little brother, who was said to be two hundred years younger than him, came, he still tightly hugged onto the egg without letting go.</p><br/><p>Auntie had inspected her little friend Shaobai\u2019s injuries while they were at the Dragon clan\u2019s territory back then, and his injuries were very severe. His fundamental core was damaged, and the Devil\u2019s miasma had already infiltrated his divine sense region. Logically speaking, in such a state, it would have been impossible for him to stay alive. Yet, her little friend Shaobai still pulled through. However, he still refused to being healed, as though other than the egg in his embrace, he couldn\u2019t hear the voice of anyone else.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. Her little friend Shaobai\u2019s wounds, were not just limited to his physical body. The injury to his heart was even more serious.</p><br/><p>In the end, auntie had no choice but to treat his wounds while he was hugging the egg. After a few days of recuperation, hint of redness finally returned to her little friend Shaobai\u2019s face. However, Zhu Yao simply felt even more tired as time went by. The egg shell which was still able to glow like a light bulb before, could no longer emit out even the slightest bit of light.</p><br/><p>Even her consciousness was becoming a little blurred. Initially, she had only been worried about her little friend Shaobai\u2019s injuries, and had been forcing herself to wait till his injuries were completely healed. However, nothing could stop her eyelids from becoming heavier and heavier.</p><br/><p>Faintly, she heard auntie talking to her little friend Shaobai in a very flustered manner.</p><br/><p>And then, Shaobai transformed into his original form. His figure, compared to the time at the volcano, was more beautiful than before, and even his rainbow colored tail was emitting out a gentle glow. Spreading out his pair of wings, he embraced Zhu Yao under his gigantic wings. It was as though her body was soaked in hot water, and she felt exceptionally warm.</p><br/><p>She could no longer endure her sleepiness, and finally, she completely sank into darkness.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao opened her eyes, she saw a face beaming with smiles right above her head. That was a middle-aged uncle, and he was no more than a palm distance away from her. His expression was very gentle, just like a stream of water, causing people to unconsciously relax their guard.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she had opened her eyes, the uncle\u2019s smile grew even deeper.</p><br/><p>She was a little dumbfounded, as she realized that she was no longer in that egg. Raising her hands, her sleeves were embroidered with the Phoenix insignia which was characteristic of the Fluorescent Wind Sect. Just what was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d She had never seen the person in front of her before, however, she could sense the immense amount of goodwill coming from his body.</p><br/><p>The uncle smiled. He did not reply, and instead, hinted her to reach out her hand.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stretched out her accordingly. The uncle bluntly cupped her wrist and carefully inspected her pulse for a moment, before he satisfyingly nodded. Then, he reached out his hand towards her head, and gently patted on it with a loving expression.</p><br/><p>As though he was quietly consoling her not to be afraid.</p><br/><p>Look at his expression that was as benignant as that, Zhu Yao recalled a proverb. \u2018A father\u2019s love was comparable to a mountain.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDad\u2026 Ah, pui! Senior, mind if I ask something? Where is this place?\u201d Zhu Yao inspected the room for a moment. Other than a table and the bed she was lying on, there wasn\u2019t any other furniture. This setup was rather familiar.</p><br/><p>The uncle did not answer, instead, he suddenly passed over a cup of water.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s throat was dry in the first place, so she accepted it. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guruguru, she finished it with a few gulps. Just as she was about to continue with her questions.</p><br/><p>That guy once again passed her a fruit. That fruit was entirely red like an apple, yet, it emitted out a dense amount of divine energy, looking absolutely delicious.</p><br/><p>Hence, she did not hesitate to receive it either. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>He still simply gave the gentle smile. The fruit was absolutely juicy, and the moment she bit into it, the taste gushed out.</p><br/><p>The uncle then kindly passed her a piece of cloth.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Thank you.\u201d Zhu Yao simply took it, and she seemed to have only been saying this same line the entire time.</p><br/><p>After finishing the fruit, he then passed a plate of dessert, which was more fragrant than the fruit.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not hold back and received it.</p><br/><p>After that, were various preserved fruits, candied fruits, and sweets that she had never eaten before\u2026</p><br/><p>When she regained her senses, she was already bloated.</p><br/><p>Yet, the uncle still continued to feed her various types of delicacies. For every single dish she ate, his eyes would brighten a little more.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao recall something important.</p><br/><p>Uncle, who are you?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d A white figure suddenly appeared at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d The person who entered was none other than Yu Yan. Her master finally thought of picking her disciple up? This time, he was so late! I\u2019m giving you a poor review!</p><br/><p>With quick steps, he walked over. Sitting by the bedside, he grabbed onto her hand and began to check on her pulse. It was unknown if it was an unconscious act, but the instant he sat down, he seemed to have pushed that uncle to the side, instantly squeezing him towards a corner.</p><br/><p>After checking for a while and confirming that there wasn\u2019t any problems with his disciple, Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. Turning around, he looked at the man with the same gentle smile, who had been squeezed to the other side of the bed.</p><br/><p>Frowning, he said with extreme unwillingness. \u201cThank you, teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d It can\u2019t be!</p><br/><p>So he wasn\u2019t an uncle, nor was he her dad. He was actually her grandmaster. Shouldn\u2019t her grandmaster be white-haired and more sage-like? For example, the look the Hall Master used for official purposes?</p><br/><p>Was it really alright for him to be this lovable and cute?</p><br/><p>The uncle stood up, and did not reply to Yu Yan either. He looked at the two people with the same face that was filled with smiles, and then, he reached out his hand to pat on Zhu Yao\u2019s head. In a flash, his figure disappeared, leaving behind a pile of snacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Was this person who was enthusiastic in feeding his juniors, really her grandmaster? It\u2019s definitely because of a mistake with how she woke up, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour injuries were overly serious, and you were unconscious for three months.\u201d Yu Yan gently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cInjuries?\u201d Wasn\u2019t she just asleep? She clearly remembered turning into an egg, and then, sleeping in someone\u2019s embrace while waiting to be hatched. Just when was she injured?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned, before he gently said. \u201cBack then, when we left. Your organs were unknowingly damaged, and your meridians were severed. Even your divine sense region was just about to collapse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d \u2018When we left\u2019? Where were they headed to? Zhu Yao was a little confused. Suddenly, she made a daring guess. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe place where you had me bring you. This is naturally Fluorescent Wind Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluorescent Wind Sect?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour body seemed to have been cast with an unique binding art, forbidding you from leaving Fluorescent Wind Sect.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s expression was a little sunken. Back then, when he brought his disciple away, her divine sense was an inch away from collapsing, injuries strangely appeared all around her body, and they were even worsening as time went by. However, the moment they returned to Fluorescent Wind Sect, this situation stopped.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao blanked, and she instantly summoned a water mirror. In the mirror, what reflected was a girl with the looks of a teenager, and was quite similar to a person she recognized.</p><br/><p>Yin Xin. She actually turned back to her Version 6.0 Yin Xin! Wasn\u2019t she dead?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

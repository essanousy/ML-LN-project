It was not her prone-to-death physique, nor was her avatar which was actually another person\u2019s body, and nor was it turning into cannon fodder. It was actually\u2026 the fact that more than half of the scenario had already been gone through, and the cannon fodder was about to lose her life!</p><br/><p>She looked at the scenario again, and then only found this out after carefully piecing the timeline together. Momma\u2019s egg! The scenario has already begun playing, and the female lead Fan Zhishan\u2019s harem had already been officially established since ages ago. That Hall Master Cao of Spirit Heaven Palace was beginning to get rid of this cannon fodder called Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Those formations and traps outside her house back then were all placed by them.</p><br/><p>She finally understood why she would wake up on the ceiling supporting frame. The girl hid up there because she was afraid!</p><br/><p>Then what\u2019s the point of passing this scenario to her!? She had lost the initiative completely, alright? When she thought about how the girl Ling Yian was just a fodder with Foundation cultivation level, she suddenly felt her organs were aching with pain.</p><br/><p>Since Realmspirit was able to reverse five minutes of her time, why didn\u2019t he return her back to fifty years ago at one go!?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! If she were discovered by others when she left her closed-door training site earlier, wouldn\u2019t that mean\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately woke up from her inner view, and then released her divine sense with all her might to investigate the area. As expected, there were presences of practitioners nearby, and she were unable to discern their cultivation levels. Most likely, their power towered over hers, and from the direction they were heading, they were clearly coming straight towards her.</p><br/><p>It was already too late for her to run now. What should she do? Was dying once more the only option left? The hell, what happened to the promised all-round technical support?</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian girly, other than this projector, did Realmspirit give you anything else?\u201d Zhu Yao calmed down, and then she sent a voice transmission to the former owner girl within her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit said that this was everything you need.\u201d The girl replied, and she had even kindly brought the ball out of the body, making it appear in Zhu Yao\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of a ball!?\u201d -faints-</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that simple.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit said that he would provide all-round technical support. She didn\u2019t believe that a five minutes time reversal skill and a projector were all he had prepared. With that trolling mind of his, he definitely still had something up his sleeves.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao carefully inspected the ball in her hands. Could this projector possess several features as well? For example, turning into a mass murdering machine or something similar. After willing it, that ball actually began to light up. Unlike the projection earlier, it actually emitted a green light like a fluorescent ball this time, and it\u2019s shape began to change right after.</p><br/><p>This is actually electrocardiographic!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao grew a little agitated, and she began to be more cautious while holding onto the ball. She silently hoped for the weapon that was about to appear to be easy to wield, and it would be even better if it was a peerless godly artifact. Oh right, it must not have any level restrictions either. A safe-to-use, ultimate universe-class slaughtering weapon fit for all ages and gender. Only a weapon like that could enable her to retreat safe and sound.</p><br/><p>The light grew brighter, and the ball began to stretch out as its shape constantly changed. With a final sizzling sound, it seemed to have completed its transformation, revealing a snow-white cube. On it, there was a neatly written word \u2013 Vinegar!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why vinegar!? Do you think we\u2019re in an anime!? This old lady here is encountering a pursuer, not SARS! What\u2019s the use of vinegar here!? No wait, vinegar is useless against SARS too, alright!?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit, your sister! Why don\u2019t you just give me a brush, so I can just write us off as dead!?</p><br/><p>The vinegar cube that that had been splattered all over the ground flashed with a green light\u2026 and turned into a brush!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Give me a moment to think of where I should begin retorting in order to make it sound classier.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit definitely wasn\u2019t sincere about wanting to save this world, definitely!</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Saintess, there\u2019s wordings on the brush.\u201d Ling Tian girly\u2019s voice suddenly resounded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao picked up the brush. With one glance, it could seen how cheaply made it was. It was covered in dark spots, and the tip of this brown brush was not even sharp to begin with. On its shaft, two words were printed on it in Times New Roman font \u2013 Magical Brush!</p><br/><p>Hoho, and I\u2019m Ma Liang!</p><br/><p>\u201cSaintess, they\u2019re here.\u201d The girl once again called out.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gritted her teeth. Whatever, let\u2019s do this! Using the dew on the leaves from the tree next to her, she wrote two words on her body \u2013 Passerby A!</p><br/><p>In the next moment, five Azoth disciples suddenly appeared in the sky above her. Dressed in blue and white uniforms, they looked at her with arrogant faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Zhu Yao tremblingly raised her hand. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Ma Liang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you trespass into our Spirit Heaven Palace\u2019s Misty Forest?\u201d The disciple asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m lost.\u201d Do you believe me?</p><br/><p>\u201cLost?\u201d The disciple frowned. \u201cTo actually be lost in a place like this. As expected, wandering practitioners sure are stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, he actually believed it! Is your surname Stupid?</p><br/><p>That disciple seemed to be extremely impatient. Just as he was about to repulse her, he was stopped by the other disciple next to him. \u201cSenior-martial brother, why the need to waste so much of your breath on a wandering practitioner? Looking at him, he most likely wishes to come under our Spirit Heaven Palace. No need to care about him any further, we have to find Sect\u2026 that demonic woman, that is our main priority.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did that disciple calm down a little. He glanced at Zhu Yao below and said. \u201cHey, the one surnamed Ma!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Surnamed Stupid, is there something you want from me?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see a Foundation female practitioner pass by here? She dresses\u2026 in a white robe with a green top.\u201d He asked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tugged her own white robe with green top a little uneasily, and wildly shook her head. \u201cNope! Definitely not!\u201d</p><br/><p>The disciple frowned, whispering. \u201cStrange, she shouldn\u2019t have run far, why haven\u2019t we found her yet?\u201d He once again looked at Zhu Yao with a scornful glance, and coldly said. \u201cSpirit Heaven Palace does not welcome outsiders, you can leave by heading east. Hurry and leave, otherwise, I won\u2019t be courteous again the next time we meet.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he spoke with the other martial brothers, before leaving in a mighty manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hands at the crowd. \u201cHave a safe trip\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Only when she no longer saw their figures did she pull out the first rank mystic artifact she just refined. With trembling hands and legs, she crawled on top of it and flew wildly to the east. In a few moments, she had already exited the forest.</p><br/><p>Phew~ That was close!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pulled out that cheap and dirty brush. She never expected that it was actually an actual godly artifact! She wrote \u2018Passerby A\u2019 on her own body, and those people actually treated her as a passerby! It was as if the possibility of her being Ling Tian had been automatically removed from their brains. Realmspirit was finally reliable for once!</p><br/><p>\u201cSaintess, we managed to flee. That\u2019s wonderful! You\u2019re so incredible!\u201d Ling Tian girly excitedly said. \u201cWith this item, we no longer have to be worried about being discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might not be the case!\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at the three words that were about to dry on her body. She added a little more water to the brush and then patched it up again. If her guess was right, the effects of this brush should be similar to Word Enchantment which Qu Qu had mentioned before. However, the scope of the Word Enchantment brought about by this brush was a little broader. \u201cThose few people earlier are just at the Azoth cultivation level, I can\u2019t guarantee that people with higher cultivation levels will be fooled by this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian girly was silent for a moment, before gently speaking up. \u201cAt the very least, Saintess and I are safe right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me Saintess?\u201d Zhu Yao had wanted to ask her this for a long while, though she did not manage to find the opportunity earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came here especially to save me, so naturally you\u2019re a Saintess.\u201d The girl happily said.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust call me by my name. I\u2019m Zhu Yao.\u201d When called a Saintess, Zhu Yao automatically thought of its nearest synonym \u2013 virgin!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Saintess! Then where are we going now, Saintess? Do you have any other plans, Saintess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt that the final goal of this mission was to protect Ling Tian girly and prevent her from dying. As long as the girly\u2019s alive, this world would not collapse, and there would not be many similar incidents happening after that. However, looking at the present situation, this goal was difficult to accomplish.</p><br/><p>Firstly, that Hall Master Cao of Spirit Heaven Palace would not let her go, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have sent such a large number of disciples to capture her. Clearly, he had already torn down his entire face for this.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, Zhu Yao could not help but look down at the girly a little for her management skills. She was being abused by her subordinates, yet she did not have the strength to fight back. It sure was saddening to see how bad she was at her job as a Sect Master. Zhu Yao wished that she could get Zi Mo, who had abundant experience as a Sect Master, to give her some lessons on how to become an incredible leader.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, looking at the scenario, the female lead Fan Zhishan became the new Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace, so how could she possibly let former owner girly off? With the vast number of men on her side, and every single one of them was an elite with huge forces backing them, a Foundation fodder who had just came online was basically the chopping block. She basically had no strength to retaliate at all.</p><br/><p>So, the most important thing to do right now was to power up. Only the strongest fist could beat sense into others.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was filled with confidence. To her, cultivation was just a matter of time. However, when she tried drawing in spiritual energy into her body, she realized she was simply too naive.</p><br/><p>She could not draw in spiritual energy!</p><br/><p>Earlier, she clearly could control the spiritual energy inside her at will and use arts, but when she tried guiding spiritual energy into her body, there was not a single reaction coming from the spiritual energy in the surroundings!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d This was illogical.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaintess, that\u2019s because\u2026 this is my body.\u201d The girl\u2019s voice weakly resounded. \u201cThough you can control it at will, but\u2026 my soul is still present. You are unable to help me raise my cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. \u201cIn other words, it will only work if you cultivation on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, how long have you cultivated for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFive years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFi\u2026fty years!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, she wanted to cuss out at her mom. This speed was simply too slow.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaintess\u2026\u201d Ling Tian suggested a little guiltily. \u201cWhy don\u2019t\u2026 we seek help from Grandhall Sect? Grandhall Sect and Spirit Heaven Palace has always been on good terms, furthermore, Reverend Fa Yu and I are old acquaintances. If I inform him of the matter concerning Hall Master Cao\u2019s betrayal, he will definitely exact justice for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Why did Zhu Yao feel that this was a little unreliable? \u201cYou must think this through. That one surnamed Cao and the female lead from Sleipoup Sect\u2026 that Fan Zhishan, they are already hooked up together. Will Grandhall Sect really go against Sleipoup Sect for your sake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian grew a little hesitant after hearing that. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work either\u2026 We will have no choice but to go to Itshavenwill Secret Realm. I heard from rumours that there\u2019s an ancient technique there that can instantly raise someone\u2019s cultivation to that of a Demigod, though it is surrounded by danger. Even its borders are being guarded by tenth rank mutated beasts, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us talk about seeking help from Grandhall Sect then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In the end, Zhu Yao decided to head over to Grandhall Sect. From what she heard from the girl, the relationship between Grandhall Sect and Spirit Heaven Palace is indeed far from shallow.</p><br/><p>The Spirit Heaven Palace in the early ages was the strongest deity sect in this world. Because of the reincarnation of the Heaven\u2019s Pillar, every generation of Sect Masters was someone with extraordinary aptitudes, and all of them were called Ling Tian. However, the Heaven\u2019s Pillar was a patch for this world in the first place. Following the subsequent reincarnations, the patch upload was beginning to near its completion. Thus, the aptitude of the reincarnated Sect Masters began to worsen, with every subsequent generation growing weaker than before. The Ling Tian girly now was the final one, which was akin to the patch upload from the previous Sect Masters totaling to ninety-nine percent, while Ling Tian girly was that final one percent.</p><br/><p>Thus, Spirit Heaven Palace no longer enjoyed its former glory. Furthermore, compared to other sects where power was revered, Spirit Heaven Palace neither chose their Sect Masters through popular vote nor through judging of one\u2019s strength. Instead, at the moment of each Sect Master\u2019s lifespan was about to be depleted, they would first prophecise where and when the next Sect Master would appear, and have the sect disciples look for him or her. Thus, Ling Tian girly was already a Sect Master at the moment of her birth.</p><br/><p>Of course, in the cultivation world, no matter how great someone\u2019s status was, it was all but a false image without absolute strength. The past Spirit Heaven Sect Masters were revered in altars by the masses, and this could be understood due to their incredible aptitude and future impressive cultivation levels. This was why the masses accepted Spirit Heaven Palace\u2019s method of passing down leadership back then. Not to mention, it faintly added some flavour akin to legends. However, as the quality of the Sect Masters continued to dip in a straight line, this method naturally began to garner suspicion from the rest. This was especially so for people with actual strength, and division was something that was bound to happen.</p><br/><p>Grandhall Sect was once one of Spirit Heaven Palace\u2019s branches. Later on, it slowly grew larger and stronger, gaining independence. However, it still had a subtle relationship with Spirit Heaven Palace. The Reverend Fa Yu that the girl spoke of was presently the Sect Master of Grandhall Sect. From what Zhu Yao heard from the girl, he was also her childhood friend, though it had been a long time since she they last met. However, they seemed to be the type with a tight relationship.</p><br/><p>When the girl spoke of this, even her tone had become rather spirited, carrying a flavour of pride that even she didn\u2019t realize herself.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. That unreliable feeling grew heavier. Speaking from her experience, childhood friends would all die and all that would be left were memories of them.</p><br/><p>Thus, when they finally managed to infiltrate into Grandhall Sect and saw that man conversing happily with the female lead Fan Zhishan in the hall, Zhu Yao did not feel shocked in the least at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will entrust this task to Sect Master Fa Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister Fan is too courteous, this one naturally believes little sister. To tell you the truth, I had long seen through that demonic woman Ling Tian. She\u2019s dangerous and sly, possessing a deep scheming heart. She has been acting for these few years. This one has never understood how such a person is worthy of becoming the Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace. I have to thank little sister Fan for the reminder, as thanks to you, I was able to receive an enlightenment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Fan Yu, you\u2019re too courteous! I just find it unbearable to see the masses being lied to, so I came here especially to inform you. I was born at the same time as her, so it is understandable that the entrusted Elder that came to pick me up took someone else by mistake. Big sister Ling Tian can\u2019t be blamed for this\u2026 I had been wandering outside for many years, and I finally\u2026 I have never resented big sister Ling Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah! You\u2019re just too kind-hearted. You\u2019re actually still speaking on her behalf. If not because she deliberately concealed this fact, why would I only find this out now? You\u2019re the true Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace. If not because you incidentally awakened the Spirit Guiding Beast, no one would have been able to expose that fake. Don\u2019t worry. Everyone knows about that poisonous woman now. My Grandhall Sect will also use all available resources to aid you in capturing her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Fa Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister Fan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. It was as if she could hear an in-game announcement:</p><br/><p>Congratulations, Female Lead has received Number Nth Male Lead x1</p><br/><p>Harem Members +1. Current Total: **</p><br/><p>The life of a R-18 female lead sure was blinding to the eyes!</p><br/><p>It seemed like this help-seeking route was a dead end. Just as Zhu Yao was about to retreat, she felt a chill on her cheeks, as water began to flow out of her eyes. The water droplets dripped straight onto the \u2018transparent\u2019 word written on her chest, instantly smudging the stains. \u201cThe hell, Ling Tian girly, don\u2019t cry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it!?\u201d A loud roar sounded from the hall.</p><br/><p>We\u2019re doomed!</p><br/><p>1. The name Ling Tian is actually the same as the sect (Spirit Heaven Palace) itself.</p><br/><p>2. Ma Liang is actually the main character in an old stop-motion film named \u2018Ma Liang and his Magic Brush\u2019. Basically, whatever he draws with the magic brush, it would come to life.</p><br/><p>3. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, many people in China believed that vinegar fumes were able to disinfect the virus. The price of vinegar surged due to panic buying, going up to about 200 to 300 yuan per 200g bottle, when it\u2019s usually about 6 yuan (USD$1) for one.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

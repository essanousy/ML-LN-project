She then turned to look at Little Bai at the side, a little dissatisfied that he merely possessed cultivation at the tenth level of Essence. However, after seeing that his sleeves were embroidered with the mark that only elite disciples could have, she was startled for a moment. In the end, she did not express any disapproval, and said with a sigh. \u201cSince she\u2019s here, then let\u2019s go. We have already wasted quite a bit of time earlier. We have to rush there by noon.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she instructed everyone to fly on their swords and head northwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle tyrant, lend me a flying sword!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately snatched a flying sword from little tyrant and used it as her own transportation tool. Then, she followed right after them. </p><br/><p>Bai Zhiyuan sighed. He did not retaliate, instead, he took out another mystic artifact and caught up to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, there\u2019s so many mystic artifacts in Skybond Peak, why do you have to use mine?\u201d he could not help but retort through voice transmission.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao made an awkward look. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Grandma has very expensive tastes!\u201d Use the artifacts in Skybond Peak? She did not wish to cuss out \u2018bitch\u2019 all day long.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, if you slip out of Skybond Peak like this, Sect Master master will be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no choice. I have matters to attend to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how huge the matter it is, you can\u2019t slip out like this.\u201d He said with a disapproving look. \u201cWhat if you encounter something dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will protect you well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d This was not what he meant! Haah, whatever. He just had to watch over grandma a little. Once an opportunity were to arrive, he would still inform the Sect Master.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sized up the group of people. Ye Qingcang was very easily recognizable. The person with the poorest cultivation was him, at the first level of Essence. Like little tyrant, he was around fifteen to sixteen years old. He had very average and common looks, belonging to the category where if she were to throw into a large crowd, it would be impossible to distinguish him from the rest.</p><br/><p>If not for the clear \u2018bug\u2019 wordings on his face, she really would not have connected him with the past bugs she encountered. There was not the slightest of indication on him that showed that he was a main protagonist.</p><br/><p>The group flew for about half an hour before arriving at the edge of the forest.</p><br/><p>The leading girly was surnamed Qin, and she possessed cultivation at the late stages of Foundation. The other girly was at the mid stages of Foundation, while the other two male practitioners were also at the late stages of Foundation as well.</p><br/><p>Group Leader Qin gathered everyone together, and explained the situation surrounding that demonic beast in detail. It was a fourth rank Concealed Rock Beast, and it had the dual attributes of metal and earth. It was extremely capable in concealment, and it lived in one of the caves in the edge of the forest.</p><br/><p>The terrain of the cave was very complicated. If one were to enter it by mistake, it would most likely be impossible for that person to find his way bag. This was also why the best plan was to lure the Concealed Rock Beast out. Naturally, she had already prepared the male protagonist as bait.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Firefly Scent Lure.\u201d The girly Qin passed Ye Qingcang a green stone. \u201cTake this and enter this cave. Within six hours, the path you tread will glow with white firefly lights. If you happen to lose your way inside, you can come out by following the lights.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang took it, and nodded with a heavy expression. His eyes, however, were unexpectedly firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we use a Positioning Talisman?\u201d Little tyrant interrupted. \u201cIf we use a Positioning Talisman, we can immediately position it at the entrance. Isn\u2019t that better?\u201d</p><br/><p>When his words fell, one of the male practitioners glared at him, and said with a sarcastic tone. \u201cHmph! Positioning Talisman? Do you know much does one Positioning Talisman costs? Catching one fourth rank demonic beast isn\u2019t even enough to buy two Position Talismans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Bai\u2019s expression paled, a hint of embarrassment flashed past his face. He was indeed unaware of this fact.</p><br/><p>That male practitioner however grew even more tactless. \u201cYou elite disciples simply do not know of the pain of regular disciples. Do you really think the streets are filled with talismans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. These words were indeed a little too much! This person was surnamed Zhao was dissatisfied with the newly joined Zhu Yao and Little Bai ever since the very beginning. Along the way, he had not given them even the slightest smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Group Leader Qin\u2019s expression sank as she glared at Zhao Li. \u201cIt\u2019s already pretty late. Before dark, we must lure that Concealed Rock Beast out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhao Li shut his mouth.</p><br/><p>The group walked to the entrance of the cave. The cave was really huge, similar to a gigantic highway tunnel. A few low growls of demonic beasts could be faintly heard from within, accompanied by the whistling of the wind. The sounds were not exactly clear.</p><br/><p>The girly Qin cast a glance at Ye Qingcang. He took a deep breath, before walking into that cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Zhu Yao took a few steps forward. A white light flashed in her palm, and she slapped him at the back. She said with a chuckle. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang had a confused look, but he still gave her a nod before walking in. In just a short few moments, his figure was no longer in sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister, just how confident are you with subduing this fourth rank demonic beast?\u201d Profiteer asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Though her World Favourable Impression was really convenient to use, there was still that bugged main protagonist at the side. She was truly worried that something might happen. \u201cWe can talk about it again after seeing the demonic beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Profiteer nodded as he pointed to the entrance of the cave. \u201cWith how huge the cave is, most likely, that junior-martial brother might not be able to return that quickly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, a loud roar could be heard from within. The entire cave entrance began to rain down shattered rocks.</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned. None of them had expected that Ye Qingcang would encounter that demonic beast so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cScatter, be prepared to battle!\u201d The girly Qin shouted out with a sunken voice. The group did not have time for idle chatter either, as they hurriedly scattered and summon their weapons.</p><br/><p>In just but a few moments, running footsteps could be heard from the entrance. Ye Qingcang sprinted out, and though his hair was slightly dishevelled, he was not injured at all. Before the group could even feel joyous, a gigantic figure suddenly appeared behind him, and it was charging out of the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet down!\u201d Zhu Yao shouted.</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang hurriedly rolled in response, as he exited the cave.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, the sharp howl of a beast reverberated. The loudness of its voice resounded through the clouds. Probably due to the echoes in the cave, even the entire ground seemed to be shaking a little.</p><br/><p>With a bang, a demonic beast which had rocks grown all over its body appeared before their eyes.</p><br/><p>It seemed to be extremely furious. After its howl, it faced the nearest Ye Qingcang and slammed its claw towards him.</p><br/><p>Though he had rolled quite a distance away, it was still impossible for him to dodge and the sharp claw was about to reach his body. In the scenario, Ye Qingcang was heavily injured because of this claw, and he had almost lost his life in result. However, it was different this time.</p><br/><p>An earth wall suddenly erected in front of his body, blocking that ferocious claw. He felt a little heat on his back, as an earth-type defensive talisman flew out. He was stunned for a moment. Suddenly, he recalled that right before entering the cave, that newly joined granny had slapped him on the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny?\u201d He turned back to look at her, flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? Hurry and run!\u201d Zhu Yao glared at him. You\u2019re a granny. Your entire family is made of grannies!</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang rolled and crawled out of the demonic beast\u2019s attack range.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle tyrant, look after him!\u201d Zhu Yao turned around and instructed Little Bai. With a flick of her hand, the earth wall summoned by the earth-type defensive talisman earlier instantly expanded, blocking the demonic beast\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>The demonic beast\u2019s eyes grew crimson red, evidently, it was enraged beyond compare. Zhu Yao had planned on first restricting its movements and have it calm down before chatting with it.</p><br/><p>Who would have known that in a blink of an eye, the gigantic figure of the demonic beast that was surrounded by the earth wall, would disappear without a trace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt disappeared!\u201d Zhao Li said with a startled look. He searched around, before glaring at Zhu Yao. \u201cOld woman, you can\u2019t possibly have scared it back into the cave, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The flames in Zhu Yao\u2019s heart instantly erupted.</p><br/><p>Group Leader Qin\u2019s expression changed. \u201cStay focused, the demonic beast is still here!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment her words fell, that demonic beast suddenly appeared right above Zhao Li, and it was pouncing straight at him. Zhao Li quickly dodged, but he was still slammed head-on by the demonic beast\u2019s claw. Though he had long erected a defensive barrier, he still received some injuries. He was thrown a few dozens of meters away as he puked out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial brother Chen!\u201d The Qin girly cried out. She instantly summoned several dozens of spiritual swords and threw them at the demonic beast.</p><br/><p>However, a scene that could shock everyone occurred. The body of the gigantic demonic beast began to turn transparent in a blink of an eye, disappearing from its spot in an instant. The spiritual swords struck the trees behind it one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe demonic beast can conceals itself!\u201d Profiteer shouted out loudly. \u201cBe aware of your surroundings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the group calm themselves down and focus their senses at the movements in the surroundings. Unfortunately, because they were merely practitioners at the Essence and Foundation level, they were unable to expand their divine sense. They were basically unable to see through the demonic beast\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, that demonic beast once again appeared next to the male and female Foundation disciples. They were practitioner-pair husband and wife, and they had been both slammed onto the ground, watching as the demonic beast bite towards them. At this moment, Profiteer summoned hundreds of icicles and threw them at the demonic beast.</p><br/><p>That demonic beast dodged to the side, jumping up from the spot it was from, its figure once again began to turn transparent. Right before it disappeared, it faced the sky and let out a suppressed growl.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heard it clearly this time. The meaning behind that growl was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment, a thought instantly emerged in her mind.</p><br/><p>Before she could piece everything up, that demonic beast instantly appeared right behind her.</p><br/><p>\u2517|\uff40o\u2032|\u251b Oouu~~ As it roared, it pounced at her.</p><br/><p>However, at the moment it was about to land on her, it blanked for a moment. Unable to stop the momentum on its feet, it bent its knees and ended up twisting itself, smashing onto the ground right in front of her.</p><br/><p>Then, it simply laid there in a daze.</p><br/><p>That pair of crimson red eyes grew a little clearer, as it mumbled in front of her. \u201cIt hurts~~\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao asked on reflex. \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>It suddenly voiced out \u2018ah\u2019 in front of her, opening its large mouth. It was even larger than her entire body. Zhu Yao simply felt a fishy stench pouring towards her, its heaviness made her feel dizzy.</p><br/><p>Ugh\u2026 Such heavy bad breath!</p><br/><p>Even if you\u2019re a beastie, please take care of your hygiene, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma!\u201d Little tyrant was frightened. Just as he was about to charge out, he was stopped by Profiteer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d He pointed to Zhu Yao and said. \u201cShe\u2019s presently taming that demonic beast. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d He had experience with something like this. Back then when she tamed that fifth rank demonic beast, she was also standing unmoving like that.</p><br/><p>Mn. Junior-martial sister Yu is not dodging. She\u2019s definitely using that unique beast taming technique of hers. She definitely is.</p><br/><p>The group exchanged glances, a hint of hesitation appeared on their faces. Little Bai\u2019s heart was even clenched tightly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at that beastie closing ts mouth in front of her, and it was still crying out with a teary voice. \u201cIt hurts\u2026 It hurts so much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust where in the world does it hurt?\u201d If you don\u2019t say it, how would I know? Zhu Yao pinched her nose. The spiritual intellect of a fourth rank demonic beast was very limited. Though it had already calmed down, she really could not figure out from its answer for a moment.</p><br/><p>That beastie however grew even more depressed. Tilting its head, it signalled with its paws. \u201cIt hurts\u2026 It swelled. It hurts so much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Swell? Zhu Yao was stunned a little. She took a closer look at its lips, and only then did she realize that there was indeed a lump on its lips. However, because its entire body was made of rocks, the swelling was not very obvious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver here?\u201d She touched the lump.</p><br/><p>The beast jolted, as if a sore spot had been touched. Tears began to flow out, drenching Zhu Yao\u2019s entire body, as though she was bathing in a warm bath.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts\u2026 It\u2019s stuck. It hurts\u2026 A bad guy threw it in. Beastie hurts so much\u2026\u201d It grew even more depressed, as it told her in a complaining tone.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao begin to understand the situation. \u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026 Something is stuck in your mouth?\u201d That\u2019s why it\u2019s swelling!</p><br/><p>The beastie nodded.</p><br/><p>Her face darkened. \u201cOpen your mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>With another \u2018ah\u2019 sound, it opened its mouth. Pinching her nose, Zhu Yao carefully inspected its mouth which looked like a mountain cave itself. As expected, she saw a trident hook on the right of its sharp teeth. The circulation of spiritual energy could be faintly felt from it as well. It was actually a low rank mystic artifact.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, I will help you get it out.\u201d Zhu Yao leapt up and entered the demonic beast\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>This scene had completely frightened the group behind who could not hear their conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma!\u201d Little Bai simply felt a bell ringing in his mind, and everything was blank. That demonic beast actually ate grandma!</p><br/><p>Profiteer was dumbfounded as well. Though he had once seen junior-martial sister Yu tame a demonic beast, he had never seen such a situation where she was obviously serving herself as food!</p><br/><p>Little Bai pulled out his sword and charged towards the demonic beast.</p><br/><p>Before he had even reached the demonic beast, he heard the demonic beast letting out a cry of pain! A pillar of blood was shot out from the corner of its mouth like a geyser. In the next moment, Zhu Yao walked out of that demonic beast\u2019s mouth, in her hands were a trident hook mystic artifact and\u2026 a white tooth!</p><br/><p>Little Bai\u2019s feet stopped, his face was filled with shock. He could faintly hear grandma speaking to that demonic beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I used quite a bit of force, and ended up pulling too much.\u201d In truth, she was dizzy from its bad breath, and for a moment, she could not clearly see that she actually pulling onto a tooth as well. \u201cYo, little tyrant, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Zhiyuan: \u201c\u2026 Grandma.\u201d Why did he feel as if he was being played for a fool?</p><br/><p>With the thorn\u2026 and tooth gone from the beastie\u2019s mouth, the pain instantly dissipated. In an instant, the beast felt refreshed.</p><br/><p>It excitedly bounced around, shaking the earth. Then, it showed Zhu Yao a grin, revealing a beautiful hole in its set of teeth. Lowering its head, it rubbed against Zhu Yao, letting out the signature cutesy sound in the beast realm. \u201cMeow~~~\u201d</p><br/><p>Mn. If not because air was slipping out of its teeth, its intonation would have been more perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has tamed that demonic beast.\u201d Profiteer said with an excited look.</p><br/><p>The group then heaved a sigh of relief, before carefully approaching Zhu Yao. Even Zhao Li who was on the ground began to crawl up, and he looked at Zhu Yao with a greedy look. \u201cJunior-martial sister Yu\u2026 Hurry, hurry and have this demonic beast enter the spiritual beast pouch. With it captured, the rewards we receive will most likely double.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned, as she looked towards Profiteer. \u201cYou guys want to bring it back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Profiteer was a little awkward as well. \u201cThe mission simply stated to deal with this demonic beast, and prevent it from harassing the nearby practitioners again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a fourth rank demonic beast!\u201d Zhao Li continued. \u201cThe disciples who bring it back to the sect will be heavily rewarded. Even if we don\u2019t bring it back now, since it\u2019s already tamed, anyone can form a contract with it. It will definitely sell for a good price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. Why did she feel so irritated?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

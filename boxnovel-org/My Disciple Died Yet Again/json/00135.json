Of course she wanted to return. Her parents, her friends, and everything that she was more familiar with were there. Initially, she couldn\u2019t wait to return to that place, but when that moment truly arrived, she suddenly hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really able to send me back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Nope.</p><br/><p>Then why the hell did you ask!? She had almost begun to frustrate about her decision.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: It\u2019s not possible now, but in the future, it might be possible.</p><br/><p>What did he mean? A change in taste?</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to ask, Zhu Yao suddenly saw the chat window vibrating for a moment. And then, on the right of the window, an \u2018A document has been sent to you.\u2019 section appeared. The document was labelled \u2018Welcome Back Gift Package\u2019. Below it, there were four options: [Receive], [Preview], [Save As], [Cancel].</p><br/><p>Did it have to be so professional? Just how much endorsement fee did the Penguin Group\u00b9 pay you?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: I\u2019m not lying to you. I have already made all the preparations needed for your return, it\u2019s just that currently, I\u2019m unable to send you back.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao hesitated for a moment, before tapping on the additional [Preview] button. In an instant, another screen appeared next to her. A block of ice, the size of an average adult, was shown on the visuals of the screen. And inside that block of ice, a woman was sealed inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that me?\u201d The woman who was sealed in ice, actually looked exactly the same as her original look.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Your body was destroyed, so I prepared a new one for you. Of course, as a gift package, I removed some minor problems from the original body. For example, breast hyperplasia, irregular periods, acne\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Just how many problems did her former body have?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Whatever the case, when you return, you will definitely feel extremely wonderful!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath. Calm down, calm down. \u201cTell me honestly. Just what are you planning? Who are you? Why do you want me to fix these bugs?\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly turned silent. For a long while, there weren\u2019t any new words popping up on the chat window. Just as she was about to think that he would be staying silent for the entire time, finally, the next sentence popped up.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: I can\u2019t say it now. But, in the future, you will naturally understand everything.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that bullcrap?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen will I get to meet you in the future? And I\u2019m speaking about the true you.\u201d Even if she had known him in the modern era for several years, they had never met face-to-face. Her master had said that the person capable of resurrecting her endlessly, was most probably a powerful expert in the Higher Realm. But, till now, she still did not know even the slightest thing about him.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Yes, you will.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how many more bugs do I have to fix?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit, however, did not give a direct answer.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: There\u2019s a limit to these bugs. The more bugs you fix, the more power I will be able to recover. And, you will be closer to getting home.</p><br/><p>Seeing his tone, most probably there wasn\u2019t merely just one or two more. However, it\u2019s great that there was a definite number. She was really afraid that these matters would continue without end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, are you able to tell me what I will turn into in my next version?\u201d First it was a baby, and then, a man. In her previous one, she wasn\u2019t even human. \u201cSeeing that we can be considered to be good friends, can you give me a better character?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Of course, no problem. I guarantee that your next character will definitely be unprecedented. You will definitely be loved by everyone. Flowers will bloom when they see you, and cars will go boom when they drive pass you. No matter if they\u2019re man or woman, old or young, they will be unable to escape from your charm, and treat you as treasure. They will never give you up, or leave you.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d Why did that sound so much like Mary Sue?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: You have to trust me, dear friend.</p><br/><p>Trust my ass. It was because she trusted him by mistake, which caused her to arrive at this freaking place. She died, only to die again. When she got back up, she died again. And after dying, she continued to die once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, hurry and send me to the next stage then.\u201d Seeing how tightly sealed this person\u2019s lips were, must probably, she wouldn\u2019t be able to receive any results even she were to continue with her questions. Zhu Yao reached out her hand, and cancelled that \u2018Welcome Back Gift Package\u2019 send request.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Have a pleasant trip.</p><br/><p>He sent a \u2018goodbye\u2019 expression, and in the next instant, the loading screen once again appeared. Just as it was about to reach the halfway mark, Zhu Yao finally could not endure it any longer, and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit, Wang Xuzhi\u2026 Is he fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>The chat window was silent for a moment. Just as the loading bar was about to finish, finally, a picture was displayed on the chat window. It was a screenshot.</p><br/><p>In the screenshot was a foreign-looking man. She had never seen him before, but she knew that he was Wang Xuzhi. He was currently wearing a wedding garment, looking at the other woman, whose head was covered, with a smile. Looking at this, it seemed to be a wedding ceremony.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gently let out a sigh of relief. The moment she entered this space, she recalled everything. Her feelings which had been heavy the entire time, could finally relax a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I really wish, that I can see him again.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a \u2018Ting\u2019 sound, that loading bar finally finished. Zhu Yao instantly felt a ray of light enveloping her entire being.</p><br/><p>And inside the black space where Zhu Yao\u2019s figure was no longer there, two final words popped up in the chat window.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: You will.</p><br/><p>The moment Zhu Yao woke up, she saw a blue sky. It was so blue, there wasn\u2019t even a single bit of impurity, and not even a single cloud could be seen. Whoever seeing this definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to help but sigh at how great the weather was. There\u2019s definitely a need to stretch her lazy waist\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell!?</p><br/><p>Why wasn\u2019t she able to move?</p><br/><p>No matter how her brain willed herself to get up, she was still lying on the ground, not being able to move a single inch. She wanted to call for help, only to realize that she was unable to let out her voice either. Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She couldn\u2019t have become a cripple, right?</p><br/><p>But, even if she was crippled, why was she unable to move her head either? She couldn\u2019t sense a single thing from her entire body.</p><br/><p>What happened to the absolutely unprecedented character that\u2019s beloved by everyone? Zhu Yao suddenly had the urge to pull Realmspirit out and give him a thorough bashing.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t do anything right now, except stare at the unchanging azure-colored sky.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026</p><br/><p>It rained.</p><br/><p>And it was even a huge downpour. However, she, who had completely no senses at all, could not even feel the water or dampness.</p><br/><p>The rain poured for more than an hour, and after it stopped, a flood actually happened.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt as though the entire world was shaking, and only then did she guess that she was currently being washed away by the water stream. A huge amount of water filled her entire vision, and she understood that she was currently moving about while sinking.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s strange was, she did not have the slightest feeling of suffocation. However, the water did not rise for too long either, as after a few minutes, the trembling caused by being washed away finally stopped. The rain stopped as well, and she once again saw that blue and cloudless sky.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt that she had to ponder about her life a little.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, before she could finish pondering, a doubtful female voice was suddenly heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fast approaching footsteps could be heard. In the next moment, in her line of vision, a giant appeared. In her point of view, that giant was as tall as the sky, and was even female. Zhu Yao was so frightened, her heart was about to jump out.</p><br/><p>No matter who it was, if they were to suddenly see someone\u2019s eyes which were even bigger than their own heads appear in front of them, they would definitely be frightened. Furthermore, this giant had clearly already spotted her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s first reaction was to run.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Momma\u2019s egg. Run my ass. She was basically unable to move at all. Even in a crisis like this, she realized that she still had no sensation of her own body at all.</p><br/><p>She could only stare blankly at that giant, as that giant reached out her gigantic hand, and grabbed her up.</p><br/><p>She sized Zhu Yao up for a moment. \u201cSo dirty!\u201d That face which was as huge as a basketball court, revealed a disgusted frown. And then, raising her other hand, she reached out to fiercely rub Zhu Yao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The hell. Was she using her as a washboard?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly felt like crying, however, no matter how much she retorted in the depths of her head, she was still unable to let out a single sound. Only when that female giant was satisfied, did she finally stop the rubbing. Zhu Yao felt that she was a little fortunate that she could not feel anything right now. Otherwise, with that female giant\u2019s method of rubbing, a layer of her skin would have definitely been peeled off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter rubbing it clean, it looks rather chic.\u201d That female giant muttered to herself, as she grabbed Zhu Yao and placed her close to her basketball court-sized face, as though she wanted to take a closer look.</p><br/><p>Those water well-sized eyes could already reflect her entire body. That square-ish, clear, snow-white\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>The moment she saw her own reflection in the female giant\u2019s eyes, Zhu Yao finally understood why she couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Unknowingly, she suddenly recalled the first words she said at that moment when she saw her master after he descended upon the Lower Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh hero, do you still need something to hang by your thigh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Back then, she only said that because simply wanted to hug his thigh. However, never did she expect that\u2026</p><br/><p>She would really turn into an accessory that could hang by his thigh!</p><br/><p>And it was even a piece of rectangular, clear-white jade, without the slightest scar on it.</p><br/><p>Flips table!</p><br/><p>Realmspirit, come out! I guarantee I won\u2019t bash you to death!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly comprehended what the biggest evil intentions of the world were.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Why do I feel that this jade is a little darker than before?\u201d With a doubtful expression, the woman held onto the pendant which she had unexpectedly picked up, and flipped it about. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a divine jade, so why is its divine aura so weak?\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, I\u2019m just an inferior product, hurry and shatter me apart, so that I can continue with version 6.0. Zhu Yao silently chanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, whatever.\u201d With an unmindful expression, the woman stuffed the jade pendant next to her waist. \u201cIt\u2019s also a form of fate for me to have picked it up. It might have its uses in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t hesitate to shatter me, please.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the woman could not hear the pleas in Zhu Yao\u2019s heart. Patting the side of her waist with a peace of mind, she confirmed that it was placed nicely. Only then did she turn around, and was just about to leave this place.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao was able to see clearly that the place she was laying on earlier, was merely a small ditch that wasn\u2019t even the size of two hands.</p><br/><p>After picking up a divine jade, the woman was evidently really happy, as even her footsteps were a little lighter than before. However, after walking for a few moments, her face suddenly paled. As though she had realized something, she hurriedly raised her head to look towards the sky.</p><br/><p>In the next instant, a white figure suddenly appeared three steps away from her. That person was a man. His exceptionally handsome face was a little cold. Although he had retracted it, his entire body still carried a trace of a higher being\u2019s aura, and his pair of especially clear eyes was staring straight at the woman in front of him.</p><br/><p>Master!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was so excited, she even felt like pouncing towards him. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t even move the slightest bit.</p><br/><p>The woman did not move, as she raised her guard while looking at the person who was suddenly blocking her way. Carelessly, her line of sight fell on that unique inscription drawn on his sleeves, and her eyes instantly widened. That mark was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao.\u201d Yu Yan called out, his voice was still without any warmth. Zhu Yao however, could faintly hear the rising fluctuation in his tone. \u201cYou\u2019re finally here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master. Zhu Yao suddenly had an urge to cry.</p><br/><p>However, she suddenly heard a response from a female voice. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, that woman who picked her up, took a step forward and stood next to Yu Yan. While the master whom she cared deeply about, was currently reaching out his hand, and placing it on that woman\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The hell, you little bitch!</p><br/><p>\u00b9Penguin Group: A large trade book publisher.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zhu Yao had lived for twenty eight years, yet, this was the first time she had ever seen such a gruesome sight. And, the person within the pool of blood was a child of only about ten years old.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fatty Zhao!\u201d Little Wang immediately recognized the person on the ground, and exclaimed. Only then did Zhu Yao regain her senses, and with her hands, she covered Wang Xuzhi\u2019s eyes. Little wimp struggled for few moments, and then, he stuffed his head into her embrace, no longer making any sound. It seemed like he was frightened quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was afraid as well, and she recalled the person on the ground was the little fatty she saw when she was receiving her identity jade tablet. She did not expect that, in just a single month, he would lie unconscious on the ground in front of her. She carelessly raised her head, and she actually saw another kid standing about ten steps away. He was a familiar face as well, the little beggar Xiao Yi with the Duo Spirit Veins. Currently, he was panting loudly as he stared at the unconscious little fatty Zhao on the ground with widened eyes. His white robe was already terribly torn, and his body was filled with numerous wounds which blood were still oozing out from. His eyes were still filled with hostility, and the main point was the longsword in his hands, as there were still wet bloodstains on the sword. It went without saying what he just did.</p><br/><p>The commotion drew the attention of many people, and numerous disciples had already began to approach and form a circle around the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat audacity, you actually dare to harm your brother of the same sect.\u201d Du Yuanchen was the very first to react. With a single leap, he arrived before Xiao Yi, and kicked away the longsword in his hands. Summoning his own flying sword, he restrained him, turned to face the disciples who were running towards them, and instructed. \u201cHurry and notify master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi did not resist, or most probably, he no longer had the strength to resist, and was easily squashed onto the ground by Du Yuanchen. However, in his clear eyes, unyieldingness still shone within them.</p><br/><p>More and more disciples crowded over, and began to softly discuss about the scene in front of them. Appearing in a scene like this, Zhu Yao was a little confused as well. She simply covered Wang Xuzhi\u2019s eyes tightly, not allowing him to see the gruesome sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with this commotion!\u201d A loud and clear voice sounded, and it seemed to have come from the sky. A white figure flew over from the Main Hall, and that person was the Sect Master of Ancient Hill Sect, Zi Mo. The scene which were still noisy earlier, instantly quietened down.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo\u2019s gaze swept across little fatty Zhao on the floor, and his expression turned cold. Squatting down, he checked his body. Then, with a wave of his hand, he cast an art, and instantly, a curtain of light enveloped the bloody person on the ground. His head which was still bleeding earlier, instantly stopped, and his wounds were closing at a speed unclear to the naked eyes. After the curtain of light dissipated, Zi Mo fed him a pellet. A moment later, the little kid once again regained his breathing, and then, he turned to question the people in the vicinity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis cultivation has been crippled, who was the one who dealt such a deadly hand?\u201d Zi Mo knew this little kid who was injured. He was the son of Yuan Xiu, the first disciple under Reverend Zi Yuan, the Lord of Weapon Mountain. He had heard that his talent was pretty good, so how was he injured to this extent?</p><br/><p>\u201cReplying to master.\u201d Du Yuanchen forcefully pulled up the person beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Mo looked at Du Yuanchen, and then, his eyes landed on the little kid in his hands. His expression momentarily turned utterly cold. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Du Yuanchen bowed towards Zi Mo, and continued. \u201cLittle junior-martial brother, junior-martial sister Zhu and I passed by earlier, and coincidentally saw him dealing a heavy blow to junior-martial brother Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Mo turned, looked towards Zhu Yao who was currently hugging Wang Xuzhi, and was momentarily stunned. Little martial-aunt, why are you here!? Unless\u2026 Out of reflex, Zi Mo tightly held onto his own storage pouch, glanced at his surroundings, and only when he realized that person, whose body constantly emitted a chilling air, was not here, did he finally heave a sigh of relief. Fortunately, ancestral-martial uncle isn\u2019t here.</p><br/><p>After covering up his earlier actions with a cough, he instructed to one of the disciples beside him. \u201cHead over to Weapon-Refining Mountain and notify Reverend Zi Yuan and Yuan Xiu. Have them make a trip to the Main Hall.\u201d After giving a glance to Du Yuanchen, he hesitantly peeked at Zhu Yao. \u201cThe four of you\u2026 Follow me to the Main Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he carried the little fatty, and headed to the Main Mountain using a flying sword. As one of the witnesses to the incident, Zhu Yao had no choice but to follow after Du Yuanchen and the little kid called Xiao Yi, and headed to the Main Mountain together using the teleportation formations.</p><br/><p>Only after reaching the entrance of the Main Hall, did Zhu Yao think of releasing her hands from Little Wang\u2019s eyes. It was rare for Little Wang to not throw a tantrum, most probably, he was truly frightened by that earlier scene. His eyes lacked the luster of high spirits back in the courtyard, and his little hands unconsciously grabbed onto the corner of her sleeves.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart softened from the sight of this. The scene earlier even frightened an adult like her, let alone a little kid like him. Stroking his little head, she said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, big sister is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi was startled for a moment. Raising his head, he looked at her. Only a moment later did he nod his head, and immediately after, he shook it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed, and then, pulling his hand, they entered the Main Hall.</p><br/><p>Inside the Main Hall, other than Zi Mo, there were two other people. One of them looked rather aged, and his entire body was emitting out an unyielding aura. He should be the Weapon Mountain Lord Zi Yuan. As for the other person standing behind him, he must be the father of that little fatty Zhao, Zhao Yuanxiu. However, little fatty was not in sight, most probably, he had already been sent away for his wounds to be tended to.</p><br/><p>Du Yuanchen who had arrived before Zhu Yao had already explained to them about what happened earlier. As for Xiao Yi, some sort of mystic arts seemed to have been cast on him, as he was restrained by glowing ropes at the side. </p><br/><p>Zi Mo\u2019s expression seemed to be a little heavy. His frown was deep, and no matter how much he pondered, he was not exactly sure of how to deal with the matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt such a young age, not only did he disregard the sect\u2019s rules, his attacks are even heavy and ruthless. Punishment must be dealt.\u201d Zhao Yuanxiu was already unable to control himself, his two eyes stared ruthlessly at the restrained little kid. \u201cSect Master martial-uncle, please uphold justice for my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Mo raised his hand, signaling him to not rush the matter. Taking a few steps forward, he looked towards Xiao Yi, whose body was filled with wounds, and asked. \u201cSpeak, why did you deal such a heavy hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a body filled with wounds, Little Xiao Yi looked at him stubbornly, and replied with emphasis on every single word. \u201cHe. Deserved. It!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Xiu flared up at that very moment, and rushed over. \u201cEven now, you still do not repent on your actions. What do you take the sect\u2019s rules for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi simply snorted coldly, and rebutted. \u201cAnd when did your son ever take the sect\u2019s rules seriously? Bullying brothers and sisters of the same sect, using his status to oppress people, I simply took the heavens\u2019 place to punish him by beating him up. I only regret that my blows were too light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Yuanxiu was about to act against him due to anger, however, he was stopped by his own master, Zi Yuan.</p><br/><p>Zi Yuan simply looked coldly at the boy on the ground, and turned to speak to Zi Mo. \u201cSenior-martial brother, the current matter has already been made clear. Our sect has rules in place, I hope senior-martial brother can deal with this matter fairly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial brother Zi Yuan, how do you think we should deal with this matter?\u201d Zi Mo asked.</p><br/><p>Zi Yuan stroked his white beard, although he looked like he did not really mind, his words were filled cold intentions. \u201cAccording to the sect\u2019s rules, he should be expelled from the sect after having his cultivation crippled, and his Spirit Veins removed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment those words fell, everyone in the Main Hall was startled. Lying on the ground, Xiao Yi\u2019s expression was filled with a certain degree of despair, he tightly gripped his pair of small hands, and a hint of blood oozed out from his fists. However, he still gritted his teeth, and did not make any sound.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo frowned ever deeper. Crippling his cultivation was still considerable, however, the moment his Spirit Veins were removed, he would never be able to cultivate again. This disciple called Xiao Yi was a rather good seedling, it would be a pity to destroy him as such, however, he was unable to not give face to his junior-martial brother. For a moment, he was in a dilemma. He glanced at the surroundings, and then, the moment his eyes landed on the person holding onto his little disciple at the entrance, his eyes momentarily shone. Following the rules, he bowed towards the person at the entrance, and spoke with a respectful tone. \u201cI wonder if little martial aunt has any wise opinion on this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? What the hell?</p><br/><p>For a moment, Zhu Yao felt as though she had been struck by a ball.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

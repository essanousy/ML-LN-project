Are you really not allowing her to see him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai frowned, his face was filled with disapproval. Picking up the fruits, he fed them to Zhu Yao one at a time. He did not reply, as though he was giving a silent refusal. It felt as though the word \u2018oppressive\u2019 was floating in the air.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently swallowed the fruits, her head was filled with cold sweat. Hey, if you two are fighting, there\u2019s no need to pull me into this as well, right? If you feed me anymore, I\u2019m going to explode!</p><br/><p>Also, who the hell is that Little Sixth? He actually angered the good tempered Shao Bai. Such talent!</p><br/><p>Even after a long time, Qian Yu did not receive his answer, and was gradually turning a little disappointed. After a while, she sighed. \u201cForget it, then have Little Seventh have a look at her eighth little brother, he\u2019s already here.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Shao Bai did not reject it.</p><br/><p>A moment later, a tall man, with a muscular build, entered the door. Being carried in his arms was a child of about three to four years old, and as he walked, he heartily smiled and gave his greetings. \u201cHello, Little Seventh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Little Third!\u201d Zhu Yao faced the person who was said to be her third elder brother, and once again waved her wings. Unfortunately, she could only voice out: \u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, second elder brother.\u201d Little Third nodded to the two people, and placed the little child in his arms next to Zhu Yao. \u201cHey Little Seventh, this is your eighth little brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao begin to size this child up. He was also a boy as well, and his round little face looked very cute. Currently, he was looking entirely serious, and even after being placed on the bed, he did not speak a word. He simply sized up Zhu Yao, who was still in her bird form, with a serious look.</p><br/><p>The parental relationships within the Phoenix Clan, was determined by the first person one saw after resurrection. And whenever a phoenix was being reborn, the clansmen would all sense it, which caused the relationships within the clan to be extremely complicated, and generally, most of them would have more than a single child. Just by the patriarch\u2019s family alone, there were nine of them.</p><br/><p>The child in front of her eyes, should be the youngest phoenix.</p><br/><p>After Little Third placed him down, he seemed to have some matters to discuss with Shao Bai and Qian Yu. After leaving behind a few words to the two of them, they went out. In the house, only Zhu Yao and the person who was said to be her eighth little brother, were left looking at each other.</p><br/><p>After a while, that child coldly snorted. \u201cTch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She was being scorned, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you!\u201d The little wimp rolled his eyes widely at her.</p><br/><p>You think knowing how to roll your eyes is incredible? I even know how to do a cross-eye! She gathered her two pupils at the center, and stared back at him.</p><br/><p>The little wimp\u2019s little face frowned, as he began to scorn her even more. \u201cYou\u2019re ugly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d A blade stabbed into her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even have a tail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Uh, she simply had yet to grown one out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually still dare to run about with those naked buttocks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Where did he see her run about? She clearly suppressed herself from doing so already.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to play with you.\u201d He sized her up with a glance, and then added. \u201cYou naked buttocks person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt a few blades being penetrated straight into her heart. As expected, she hated little children the most. Every single one of them was the type where they wouldn\u2019t learn without a beating.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking?\u201d Seeing that she wasn\u2019t replying, the little wimp was furious.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She had to be capable of speaking first, little bastard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because you know you\u2019re too ugly, that\u2019s why you don\u2019t dare to speak up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, you\u2019re aware of your ugliness, you can still be saved!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, you forced me.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao became furious. Her claw stretched towards the pouch at the side, grabbed onto a handful of golden melon seeds, and scattered them below the bed.</p><br/><p>The little wimp\u2019s eyes instantly widened, as he let out an excited \u201cChi!\u201d. In an instant, he turned into a golden phoenix the size of a table, got down from the bed, and began picking up the melon seeds.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao coldly smiled. An idiot that could be settled with just a handful of melon seeds, how could he possibly have the qualifications to scorn her?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>Why was she having a dispute with a little wimp?</p><br/><p>Where did her logic and reason as a matured person go?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao hugged her head with her wings, and sank into a deep self-reprimand state\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at the little phoenix which was about done cleaning up the melon seeds on the ground, she could not help but casually grab another handful of them. Ah, is there anyone here who can stop this evil claw of mine?</p><br/><p>Hence, when the three matured old phoenixes returned, what they saw was a scene of a \u201cgood elder sister and little brother relationship\u201d. One of them was calmly sitting on the bed spreading melon seeds, while the other was excitedly picking up the melon seeds on the ground.</p><br/><p>From that day on, Little Eighth no longer came to see her. An awe-inspiring godbeast phoenix, was fed like a chicken. Zhu Yao wondered, once he regained his senses, just what kind of shadow of a past would it leave behind during his childhood? However, Shao Bai did not blame her, and simply smiled with a face filled with warmth, as he once again prepared another two bags of melon seeds.</p><br/><p>Mn, as expected of a good brother, great work.</p><br/><p>Her feathered tail had still yet to grow out, and her body did not grow either. She was beginning to feel that she wasn\u2019t a phoenix, but rather, a close relative of a phoenix\u2026 a chicken. Every single time she saw that bare and naked back of hers, she would feel deep sadness. In the past, she wasn\u2019t really concerned of it. After being called out in such a manner by Little Eighth, she no longer dared to leave the house with naked buttocks. Otherwise, she would feel that she was really lacking of morals.</p><br/><p>As time went by, she was beginning to think of her master. Logically speaking, he couldn\u2019t have possibly thrown her aside and not care about her. But after such a long time, not even his shadow could be seen. Actually, ever since she saw that huge tree, she was faintly beginning to guess that this place basically wasn\u2019t the Divine Realm. The reason why her master had yet to find her, was most possibly because he couldn\u2019t reach this place. They were simply not in the same realm.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little saddened. This was once again another time, other than the time when her master ascended, where she and he were separated between different realms. And this time, she most probably wouldn\u2019t be able to contact him.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhu Yao did not even know what the actual bug was, which caused to feel like going on a strike.</p><br/><p>Even Realmspirit could have a vacation, why couldn\u2019t she have time to properly make love, bastard!</p><br/><p>During days without her master, time passed very slowly.</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>A conversation window suddenly appeared in front of her.</p><br/><p>Dear, are you still frustrated about time moving too slow? Are you still sighing about the pain of cultivation? Have you ever felt hateful because of a painful experience during your past cultivation? Then leave it to the Time Adjustment Device. It allows you to gain the experience of passing ten thousand years in an instant, speedily achieving your target. Finishing one\u2019s cultivation in a single minute is not a dream! Not a dream!

If you use it now, you can even personally choose the amount of time to adjust, without the slightest of flaw. What are you waiting for? Hurry and raise your little claws, and make haste to click on \u2018confirm\u2019!</p><br/><p>Choose: [One Hundred Years] or [One Thousand Years] or [Ten Thousand Years] or [Random]</p><br/><p>Where did this immoral advertisement pop out from? Do you believe I will head over to Consumers Association to launch a complaint on you!? And what\u2019s this Time Adjustment Device? Does it allow me to adjust time? You watched too many sci-fi movies, didn\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>The ten second countdown for this selection shall begin. If user does not choose an option by the end of the countdown, the [Random] option will be selected.</p><br/><p>7, 6, 5, 4\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell, this was forced purchase of goods! Recalling the [bi-gender] option back then, she hurriedly raised her wing and pressed on the [One Hundred Years] option, but even after pressing on it consecutively, there wasn\u2019t any response. The countdown continued.</p><br/><p>Are you kidding me? She basically wasn\u2019t able to choose at all. It was evidently trolling her.</p><br/><p>3, 2, 1.</p><br/><p>Ting! Time allocated to make a choice is up, we will now proceed with the [Random] option. ps: These buttons make use of the most advanced fingerprint recognition technology, and can be used to recognize any form of fingerprints. pps: A friendly reminder, feathers cannot be recognized.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao lowered her head and looked at her own wings. Flips table! Realmspirit, you best get your ass here right now!</p><br/><p>The screen in front of her flashed, and a screen similar to a lottery slot game suddenly appeared, and the five rows began to start spinning.</p><br/><p>The first number that appeared was a \u2018zero\u2019. Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. Luckily, she wouldn\u2019t instantly skip through more than a ten thousand years.</p><br/><p>The second number was similarly a \u2018zero\u2019. It seemed like at the very most, only more than hundred years would pass. Good, good.</p><br/><p>The third number was a \u2018four\u2019. Four hundred odd years. Alright, it was acceptable.</p><br/><p>The fourth number was a \u201cthree\u201d. Zhu Yao had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>The fifth number spun a few rounds, before stably stopping at the number \u2018eight\u2019.</p><br/><p>(t/n: The syllables for number \u2018438\u2019 in chinese, sounds like , which means: dumb bitch. :D)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao instantly felt like exacting revenge on society.</p><br/><p>She took a deep breath. She thought for a moment, just what kind of method would allow her to vent off her anger a little bit better?</p><br/><p>The hell! Dumb bitch, who the hell are you cussing at!? You\u2019re playing me for a fool, right? If you have the guys, come out right now. I shall give you a free ticket back to your mother\u2019s womb for deep reform.</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>The screen flashed, and the lottery slot disappeared. However, the scenery in her surroundings, began to start changing, as though she was walking through a revolving door. Similar to pressing the \u2018fast forward\u2019 button, different human figures passed by. The speed grew even faster, and not long after, she could only see the colors of flowing light.</p><br/><p>This was time adjustment?</p><br/><p>The flowing lights moved for about half a minute, before beginning to slow down. Gradually, she could see human figures. People she were familiar with, and people whom she were not familiar with, were walking in and out the house, and the person whose figure appeared the most was Shao Bai. It then finally stopped.</p><br/><p>Four hundred and thirty-eight years passed by just like that?</p><br/><p>Regaining her senses, there were only Shao Bai and her in the room. He still looked the same as before, although there seemed to a hint of maturity added between his brows. Yet, he still carried a warm expression, coaxing her with a gentle voice. \u201cLittle sister, this is very simple. As long as you follow my instructions, you can immediately attain a human form.\u201d</p><br/><p>Attain a human form? Zhu Yao frowned. Suddenly, a large amount of memories flowed into her mind, and they were events that happened in these four hundred odd years. She actually spent four hundred odd years, and she was still a bird! The only difference was that she was now a little bigger than before, and her tail had still not grown out yet either. Although she knew that the lifespan of a god was limitless, it was growing a little too slow, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>\u201cBe obedient. Haven\u2019t you been wanting to change your feathers? After transforming into your human form, you will be able to change them then.\u201d Shao Bai continued to coax her.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. What\u2019s with this tone that sounded similar to coaxing a child? After thinking carefully for a moment, within those additional memories\u2026 Alright, during the past four hundred years, she had indeed led a very childish lifestyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, can you repeat the method of transforming into a human again?\u201d After crossing through time, the only thing she was happy about was that she could finally speak.</p><br/><p>Seeing her open her mouth, Shao Bai heaved a sigh of relief. He then told her the method once again, and he even grabbed onto her claws to demonstrate the method of circulating godly energy as well.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao carefully sensed it, and realized that this method was similar to the way she transformed while she was a dragon back then. Looking at it this way, she was a little experienced with it, it seemed.</p><br/><p>Hence, she hustled a few steps forward, arriving at a place that was a little wider. After taking a deep breath, she began circulating the already dense amount of energy within her body. In an instant, her entire bird body emitted out a red light, enveloping her entire being within, and slowly, she gained the look of a human figure.</p><br/><p>After about an hour, that red light finally faded, revealing a girl wearing a rainbow-colored feathered dress. Zhu Yao moved her hands and legs, and the clothes followed her movements, as though it was flowing, looking really beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Zhu Yao wasn\u2019t able to see her own look, so she could only waved her hands at Shao Bai. \u201cDo I look beautiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, very beautiful.\u201d Shao Bai\u2019s smile looked like the warm sun on a winter day, nodding.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was satisfied. The phoenix was the most beautiful bird in the world, so she believed her human form wouldn\u2019t be that ugly. These clothes on her especially, should have been formed by her feathers. In the past, when her body was filled with feathers, she didn\u2019t really feel it. But now that they had turned into her clothes, they looked unexpectedly beautiful.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tugged onto the corner of her dress, and lowered her head and inspected it, looking very satisfied. She then turned her head around to look at her back.</p><br/><p>Only to see between the rainbow-colored feathers, were two pieces of snow-white\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mn, it\u2019s definitely her seeing things.</p><br/><p>Hence, she closed her eyes, and opened them again\u2026</p><br/><p>A moment later.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d She let out a miserable cry that rang throughout the clouds.</p><br/><p>Why was her back naked!? And it\u2019s even at the position where her buttocks were. Were the clothes of the ancient era this trendy?</p><br/><p>She suddenly recalled that she was lacking her feathered tail.</p><br/><p>And she was even streaking with her buttocks bare the entire time!!!!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister!\u201d Shao Bai was shocked from her sudden miserable cry, as he asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He heart-achingly put her in his embrace, and his line of sight naturally landed on\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease me!\u201d Zhu Yao then realized this, and pushed him away, and her two hands were placed behind her back, onto the two naked cheeks, that were starting to feel chilly from the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister\u2026\u201d In an instant, Shao Bai\u2019s face turned bright red. Approaching her was wrong, and not approaching her was wrong too.</p><br/><p>He saw it, right? He definitely saw it, right? Although she no longer had much morals left, streaking was something she really wouldn\u2019t do. Don\u2019t stop me. I want to die now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d Shao Bai coughed a few times, forcefully calming himself down. Though, his face was still fiery hot, as he stretched out a hand, and chanted out a piece of white long cloth, passing it to her. \u201cFirst, use this to cover it up! Your feathered tail has yet to grow out, so with your feathers transforming into clothes, it will naturally\u2026 ahem, don\u2019t worry. No one else saw it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you see it?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pulled the piece of cloth over, and then, circled it around her waist, making a total of three knots. Only after making sure it was deadly tight, did she then release her hands.</p><br/><p>Shao Bai sized her up for a moment, and the redness on his face subsided. Recalling the look she had earlier while she was jumping around, and could not help turning around, his shoulders intensely trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to laugh, then laugh!\u201d Zhu Yao glared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahaha\u2026\u201d Shao Bai really began to unceremoniously laugh out loud, his hands pressing on his stomach.</p><br/><p>She had simply forgotten that she had yet to grow out her feathered tail, yet he was laughing to that extent. He\u2019s not giving her face at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really that funny?\u201d Zhu Yao suddenly felt her teeth itching, as she coldly snorted. \u201cWhen your buttocks were naked, I saw them too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai was startled. He stopped his laughter, and looked over to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot just your naked buttocks, back then, with just your ragged cloth, I saw them all.\u201d Zhu Yao gleefully said. \u201cAlthough you were just a little wimp back then, but I guess it\u2019s evened out now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was a child?\u201d Shao Bai\u2019s eyes brightened for a moment, and a hint of something seemed to have flashed past his face. Very quickly, it disappeared again, and what replaced it was a hint of sadness. Sighing lightly, he then said. \u201cLittle sister, you\u2019re making up nonsense. How could you possibly have seen how I looked when I was younger? You, after all, have spent two thousand years to hatch from your egg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s making up nonsense!\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. In any case, it was something that had already happened before, so she wasn\u2019t afraid of him knowing. \u201cBack then, when you were that young, I was still in my egg. Oh right, I even brought you out of that ghostly place.\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly widened his eyes, and his face was filled with disbelief. \u201cYou remembered!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zhu Yao nodded.</p><br/><p>Shao Bai suddenly revealed a gentle smile, it was as though at that moment, a hundred flowers bloomed, and rays of light filled the entire sky.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was an irregular in the Phoenix Clan. Phoenixes were able to transform the moment they were born, while she was the only phoenix in history who had to spend more than four hundred years before she could succeed in transforming into her human form. In regards this point, to someone like Zhu Yao who had always been reinforced by cheats, and completely did not have to waste any effort in cultivation, she was very depressed. There was this sour feeling of a school tyrant falling from grace\u2026</p><br/><p>And during her first transformation, her morals had already completely fallen off. She really did not hold any expectations on her looks and figure of her own human form. Until the moment she first saw her face in the mirror, she barely held her jaw in place from shock.</p><br/><p>She wondered if Realmspirit had gathered all of her points of beauty during her several resurrections and added into the character this time. The reflection in the mirror, was simply too beautiful to the point of being impossible to look straight in the eyes in. Every single piece of her figure seemed to have been carefully crafted, an additional point would be too much, while if there was anything less, it would have been too lacking. It was beyond perfect.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt that the morals she dropped in the afternoon earlier, had been picked right back up. She could not help but sigh at how the genes of phoenixes were simply too wonderful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, are you done?\u201d Shao Bai opened the door and entered, his smile was filled with gentleness. \u201cWe should get going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at him, before immediately shifting her line of sight back to the mirror. Just why was she this beautiful?</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, to the Terrace of Revelations. What? You don\u2019t want to go?\u201d Shao Bai asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d Zhu Yao raised the mirror in her hands. \u201cRight now, I just want to quietly marvel at my beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai shook his head. Stepping forward, he took away the mirror in her hands, and grabbed onto her hand while he was at it. His smile turned even gentler. \u201cLittle sister, be obedient. Once a Phoenix clansman attains his or her human form, he or she must definitely head to the Terrace of Revelations to receive an inheritance. This concerns the matter of your future, you can\u2019t not go. And little sister, even without looking at the mirror, you will still be the world\u2019s most beautiful phoenix.\u201d</p><br/><p>With narrowed eyes, Zhu Yao glanced at his face which carried a five-star grade soft light effect, and then turned to look at herself in the mirror. In an instant, she felt she had dropped by a few levels. Haah! As expected, she really wanted to disfigure him!</p><br/><p>\u201cInheritance?\u201d Zhu Yao pondered. \u201cIsn\u2019t inheritance carried within one\u2019s bloodline, and wouldn\u2019t that mean one would have it once he or she is born?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai lightly tapped on her forehead. \u201cWho told you inheritance is carried within the bloodline? No matter if it\u2019s the Dragon or Phoenix race, or even the Qilin, if one had to receive the inheritance, he or she must head to the Terrace of Revelations, and commit to the Heavenly Dao.\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s actually a procedure like this. Her teacher did not teach her that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, second elder brother did not bring you over, was because you were still too young, and I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t be able to take in the power of the Heavenly Dao.\u201d Shao Bai continued to explain. \u201cNow that you\u2019re capable of attaining a human form, naturally, this shouldn\u2019t drag on any longer. As long as you receive the inheritance, the latent potential in your body will be stimulated. When that time comes, you will know your true attribute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAttribute?\u201d Zhu Yao latched onto this unknown term.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, have you not realized that your original form is different from the rest of us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy naked buttocks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of awkwardness flashed past Shao Bai\u2019s face for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about that. Although phoenixes are able to control fire the moment they are born, there is still another form of inherited attribute. It\u2019s one of the five elements other than fire \u2013 metal, wood, water, and earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d I still don\u2019t understand!\u201d \u201cThen what\u2019s your attribute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai smiled it off, and did not continue explaining. Pulling Zhu Yao, they left through the door, as though he was saying he would bring her there directly to make clear of it herself.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not express any objections, and followed him out of the door. Though, she faintly felt that the word \u2018revelations\u2019 sounded a little familiar, but she couldn\u2019t recall where she had heard of it before.</p><br/><p>She had thought that the Terrace of Revelations would be very far away, but Shao Bai simply brought her up the giant tree. They flew for more than an hour, and they reached the top of the gigantic tree, which was hidden behind layers of clouds. A white lotus, the size of three football fields, was floating above, colorful flowing lights were flashing above the petals, circling around with the lotus as their center.</p><br/><p>At the center of the lotus terrace, it was already filled with people, with a rough estimate of more than a hundred people. Zhu Yao was dumbfounded. The entire Phoenix Clan was here. Was this inheritance that important?</p><br/><p>Shao Bai brought her along as they descended at the very center. Stepping up front was Qian Yu and three other familiar faces \u2013 four men, and three women. She flipped through her fast-forwarded four hundred years of memories, and only then realized they were all her own cheap brothers and sisters. Though, the man beside Little Eighth seemed to look a little foreign. He was about as tall as Shao Bai, but he did not look as white and clean as the rest. His skin was a healthy wheat color, making him feel a little more masculine than the rest. She suddenly had a feeling that she had seen him before somewhere.</p><br/><p>Seeing her appearance, Little Eighth first came over. After four hundred odd years, he had already begun to grow from a little wimp, to a youth. \u201cNaked buttocks, you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao almost slipped, as she turned her head to glare at him. As expected, his mouth was as foul as before. Because of his curse, she hadn\u2019t been able to grow her feathered tail. You\u2019re the one with naked buttocks, your entire family have naked buttocks!</p><br/><p>Eh? His entire family seemed to include her as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up, and receive the inheritance!\u201d Little Eighth however did not sense her resentment in the slightest, as he excitedly said. \u201cHurry and receive it, and let me see what kind of bird are you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did she feel like he was cussing at her?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd just what kind of bird are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Eighth pridefully raised his head, and patted his chest. \u201cMy attribute is \u2018wood\u2019, I\u2019m a wood bird.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao meaningly swept her eyes at him, and purposefully paused for a second. \u201cSo you have a wooden bird down there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Eighth: \u201c\u2026\u201d Although he couldn\u2019t understand, why did he feel that his seventh elder sister was cussing at him?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Seventh.\u201d Qian Yu walked over as well, and said with patting on Zhu Yao\u2019s head, as she looked at her with a pleased look. \u201cYou\u2019re finally able to attain a human form as well, your mother here can finally heave a sigh of relief. Come, you haven\u2019t met your sixth elder brother before, he\u2019s the one.\u201d She pointed to that man with the wheat-colored skin at the side. \u201cYour sixth elder brother made a special trip back in order to watch your inheritance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned to look at the man at the side, his smile was extremely awkward, yet, it carried an expression that she couldn\u2019t understand, as though he was both a little agitated and guilty. The corner of his lips moved, and only a moment later, did he speak up. \u201cSeventh little sister, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s about time.\u201d Shao Bai suddenly stepped forward and interrupted his words, pulling Zhu Yao along. \u201cLittle sister, go on then!\u201d His gaze, either intentionally or unintentionally, glanced at Little Sixth, as though he was giving him a faint warning.</p><br/><p>Little Sixth\u2019s bright eyes, instantly dimmed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao seemed to be being pushed forward, and she was a little curious about Shao Bai\u2019s attitude. She quickly flipped through her fast-forwarded memories, and only then did she recall who this sixth elder brother was. Speaking of which, he was even the first person she met when she resurrected this time. That\u2019s right, it was that little wimp who directly pushed her onto the ground, and caused her to be born prematurely.</p><br/><p>No wonder Shao Bai did not like him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

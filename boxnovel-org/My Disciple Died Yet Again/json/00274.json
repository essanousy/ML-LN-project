The faint thought of simply switching to a new avatar rose in her mind. Mn, before that, I should first bash Realmspirit up.</p><br/><p>Just when her consciousness was about to completely disappear, the transparent spiritual energy which had been quietly staying in her meridians and could not be easily arranged, began to swim about in her meridians.</p><br/><p>What was even more mystical was, everywhere it flowed, the surrounding spiritual energy would quieten down and would automatically begin to separate itself by colour.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. All she could do was watch as that transparent spiritual energy calm down the raging spiritual energy in the meridians, like a group leader. Even the disturbance in her Dantian had also ceased as well.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, she simply felt as if something had rung in her mind, as though something had broken through. Her Foundation establishment was successful.</p><br/><p>Such a godly turn of events!</p><br/><p>Just what kind of divine power was that transparent spiritual energy?</p><br/><p>After the establishment of her Foundation, the transparent spiritual energy did not stop. Instead, it began to slowly flow within her meridians. Wherever it flowed, the meridians which were damaged by the spiritual energy began to recover, while the separated spiritual energy entered her Dantian in an orderly manner.</p><br/><p>After a long while, the meridians in her body had all been completely restored, and her meridians had also grown wider after the rise of her cultivation. She even felt that her old bones had gotten a bit stronger.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath and sensed the unprecedented vigorous energy that was in her body. Just as she opened her eyes, she was faced with a pair of fish\u2019s buble eyes that were welled up with hot tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d Little tyrant sniffled, as he forcefully rubbed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re finally awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like she had frightened him bad. Zhu Yao\u2019s heart softened, as she stroked his little head. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, you have already slept for an entire day and night.\u201d He said pitifully. \u201cI didn\u2019t even dare to look for Qu Yi to play with. Fortunately, you\u2019re awake. I can head out again now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d So the thing you were about was actually this, hey!?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Only then did she notice her surroundings. This place was a regular room. There were not many things around, but they were really neatly arranged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my home.\u201d Little tyrant replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour home?\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Little Tyrant was a practitioner, then his house should be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNess Cesary Sect!\u201d Little Tyrant proudly raised his chest.</p><br/><p>Your sister!</p><br/><p>She was a dandelion demon! Furthermore, the relationship between demons and the practitioners of this world was not even the slightest of harmonious, alright? He actually brought her openly into a sect of practitioners. Zhu Yao felt her heart clenching.</p><br/><p>She stood right up. \u201cNot good. I have to leave quickly.\u201d Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t even know when she could die.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bai!\u201d An heavy male voice sounded from outside, and the door creaked open from the outside.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s finished!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will you\u2026\u201d A stern-looking man dressed in an azure robe entered the building, and was stunned!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The man was dumbfounded, as he looked straight at Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart was in a fluster, as the depths of her mind began to flash out several vegetable dishes. Stir-fried dandelions, steamed dandelions, boiled dandelions\u2026</p><br/><p>She wondered just how she should run in order to make her escape look a little more convincing?</p><br/><p>Let me go! \u201cOh hero\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What? What did you just call me?</p><br/><p>\u201cWife!\u201d The man\u2019s demeanour suddenly changed, as he pounced towards her and hugged onto her thighs. Sniffling and with tears in his eyes, he cried out. \u201cYou\u2019re finally willing to see me. This husband has waited you for such a long time. You\u2019re finally out here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-Flips table- What kind of scenario is this!?</p><br/><p>\u201cDear gentleman, who are you? You picked up the wrong script, didn\u2019t you?\u201d This person here has a girlfriend, hurry and let my thigh go, hey.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife.\u201d However, he was like an octopus, clinging tightly onto her thighs. \u201cI was wrong, I really was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have despised that graceful body figure of yours. Neither should I have despised your ecstatical creases and sexy skin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019re so ugly to the point where your human- I mean, dandelion features can no longer be seen, I will still love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain you\u2019re not being sarcastic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn to my side, my wife. I will no longer be angry at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGhosts are about to return to the surface, I tell you. Who the hell are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t acknowledge me. I will continue to wait for you. I love you, my wife!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s your wife! Who the hell is your wife!? Let me go, hey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will no longer leave you. My heart is a rock that cannot be easily turned by others.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cA rock cannot be turned, but it can roll!\u201d She could not endure it any longer, as she raised her leg and kicked.</p><br/><p>That man however still had the same determined look, as he looked at her affectionately. \u201cHit me then, my wife. As long as it can make you feel better, please feel free to ravage my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Who wants to ravage your body? Don\u2019t speak of something so immoral in such a righteous tone, hey. What if someone misunderstands?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial uncle?\u201d Little tyrant looked at the man dumbfoundedly, and then glanced at Zhu Yao. \u201cGrandma?\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on either? Why isn\u2019t there an explanation of this present scenario at all?</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial nephew Bai.\u201d The man crawled up from the ground, and patted on the little tyrant\u2019s head as he spoke in a grateful tone. \u201cYou have done very well. At first I had thought that you would only be able to take away my wife\u2019s umbrella. Never did I expect that you would bring her directly out here. You sure are senior-martial uncle\u2019s good nephew!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tyrant\u2019s face reddened. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually do anything. It was Grandma who\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, in the future, you have to call her senior-martial aunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey hey\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao pulled the little tyrant back. I\u2019m still alive and well, don\u2019t make decisions on your own! \u201cJust who in the world are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy wife\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s eyes reddened. \u201cAre you still not willing to forgive me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tyrant raised his head as well. \u201cSenior-martial aunt, forgive senior-martial uncle already!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive my ass. I don\u2019t even know him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked even more pitiful. \u201cMy wife, as expected, you still aren\u2019t willing to forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d How can you be so heartless and cruel?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what was this sense of defeat she was feeling for being unable to clarify herself? She would have rather been stir-fried, steamed or boiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Zhu Yao heavily slammed onto the table. With a bang, she directly smashed the table into pieces.</p><br/><p>The two others were stunned for a moment. The place instantly quietened down.</p><br/><p>She took a deep breath, cleansed herself from the irritable thoughts of wanting to kill people, and earnestly said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we settle down and talk things out?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of the man\u2019s lips twitched, as if he wanted to say something. \u201cWife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d He immediately knelt back down.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was feeling a slight headache, as she took a deep breath. \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t know you, and neither have I met you before. So, I can\u2019t possibly be your wife. Secondly, I already have a man. That person isn\u2019t you. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was startled, and instantly, his face turned as pale as snow. With a expression of disbelief, he said. \u201cYou\u2026 You got yourself another man behind my back?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tyrant looked over with a dissatisfied expression as well.</p><br/><p>Behind your back, your sister! Don\u2019t automatically ignore the first point, hey.</p><br/><p>For the first time in her life, Zhu Yao felt communication was such a difficult skill. \u201cAlright, I shall ask in another way. What\u2019s the surname of your wife, and what is she called? How did you two know each other?\u201d No matter what, she would not believe that Realmspirit would give her a wedded avatar, otherwise, she was going to spit all over his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, what\u2019s wrong? Are you perhaps injured? You have even forgotten your own name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay the counter defendant please directly reply the question!\u201d Do not diverge away from the question!</p><br/><p>The man was stunned for a moment, before replying. \u201cNaturally, you\u2019re surnamed Zhu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sucked in some air. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt her vision darken.</p><br/><p>The man nodded with certainty. \u201cZhu Yaoyao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Do you know how scary an unfinished sentence can be!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. Thinking back on the dandelion family\u2019s naming sense, it was completely normal for her to have a sister with completely identical looks or something, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain now that you have mistaken me for someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d He said with a determined look. \u201cEven if I do make mistakes in recognizing some people, I won\u2019t ever mistake you for someone else. Your entrancing creases and slightly hunchbacked figure makes up the one and only beauty in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Creases! Hunchback!</p><br/><p>Old Woman Zhu Yao \u2013 was stabbed twice!</p><br/><p>\u201cI must thank you, really!\u201d She had only heard of pedophilia. This time, she had actually seen for herself a gerontophile!</p><br/><p>\u201cWife\u2026\u201d He looked like he was about to burst into tears. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m your beloved husband, Qu Qu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qu Qu (Cricket). Why not Guo Guo (Grasshopper)?</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, Guo Guo!\u201d Zhu Yao stepped forward and patted on the infatuated man\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI understand your feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Qu Qu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, they\u2019re both the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. Let us talk about life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao spent three hours explaining in various angles. From science, to technology, and to feelings. She spoke of the trait of the dandelion family, discussed about how a peapod could have several seeds, talked about the genetic traits of twins and of multiple births. She explained that given how huge the world was, there would definitely be a few idiots who would look exactly like him. She had even brought up about the research of the diversity of appearances of elderly as verification. The conclusion she was trying to make was: You mistook me for someone else. I\u2019m a pure young maiden. Don\u2019t look at me with eyes that looked as if you\u2019re looking at your wife. Go back to where you belong.</p><br/><p>And, the conclusion the student Qu Qu gave was, \u201cImpossible. Wife, you must be lying to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u2018\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If not because you looked handsome, I would have bashed you right here and now, do you believe it?</p><br/><p>In the end, Zhu Yao had no choice but to bring up about how the Qianqianqianqians looked identical as well. With the little tyrant as witness, his determined expression finally loosened a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 really not my wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, really!\u201d Zhu Yao nodded.</p><br/><p>He looked as if he had suffered the most painful blow in his lifetime, his entire being was in gloom. Raising his head, he glanced at her old face. \u201cThere are actually still other demons who look just as divine as my wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Please stop using the word \u2018divine\u2019, it\u2019s already outdated.</p><br/><p>With the misunderstanding cleared, Zhu Yao found out that the reason Qu Qu had Little Bai head to Tranquil Valley was all in order to search for his wife. That special thin veil was part of her original form \u2013 a transportation tool used by dandelions to float around. It was actually really an umbrella.</p><br/><p>She had planned on returning, but the barrier of Tranquil Valley was too strange. When she crossed it back then, she had almost lost her life. If she were to return this time, she wouldn\u2019t know what would happen. Suddenly, she realized that she had no home to return to.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this, dear maiden?\u201d Qu Qu suggested. \u201cThough you are not my wife, you are still greatly related to her. Don\u2019t worry, I will take care of you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why did she feel even more uncomfortable than before?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It clearly did not like Gong Lan, yet when it saw her return the dimensional space that its mother had given her and then leave without a single shred of hesitation, its heart felt numbed, sour, and it even ached a little.</p><br/><p>It completely did not understand this situation at all, not to mention it had no experience on this either. It thus decided to seek Zhu Yao, its mistress who had abundant experience, for guidance. However, its mistress, who had always been considerably kind and reasonable, was looking at it with scornful eyes. For a short while, her glare made the hair all around its beastly body to stand. She then chuckled with an ambiguous smile, and patted strongly on its head. With a solemn voice, she said. \u201cSesame, male chauvinism is a disease which must be cured!\u201d</p><br/><p>What is male chauvinism? Why are mistress\u2019s words always so deep and profound? I can\u2019t understand at all, hey!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. Looking at how Sesame wouldn\u2019t understand even if it scratched its head off, she said. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way then. Why don\u2019t you want to marry her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, it\u2019s because our races are different. How can we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak the truth!\u201d Zhu Yao interrupted it. Don\u2019t even think about using the matter of having two legs and four legs to fool me. Even the Demon King doesn\u2019t believe such words, alright?</p><br/><p>Sesame lowered its head, and after a while, it said with a low voice. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m a little\u2026 afraid of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d Now this is fresh and new.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how scary she can be.\u201d Sesame complained. \u201cWhen my mother picked her up, she scratched and tore my face. Because she was a rank higher than me, she bullied me since we were young. When I was young, I was always beaten and injured by her. After that, when I finally managed to ascend, the moment I make a mistake, she would still beat me up. Just because her cultivation is higher than mine, she thinks she\u2019s incredible! Hmph! I don\u2019t want to marry a female beastie like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. You can\u2019t even beat a woman, and you\u2019re trying to reason with it?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen she doesn\u2019t have anything good points?\u201d Zhu Yao felt doubtful. \u201cHas she never helped you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever!\u201d He said angrily. \u201cShe would only complain about me in front of my old man, and then they would beat me up together. Yet, both father and mother like her, and pays more attention to her. She\u2019s simply sinister, sly, and shameless\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain!\u201d Sesame gritted its teeth. Suddenly, as though it had thought of something, it muttered. \u201cUnless\u2026 her preventing others from beating me counts as a good point.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOthers? What do you mean?\u201d Oh, juicy details. Let\u2019s take out a chair.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case\u2026 In any case, not only does she beat me up, she beat up other beasts too. She doesn\u2019t allow other beasts to cause trouble for me either.\u201d He frowned and said. \u201cShe made everyone afraid of her, and I end up not having a single friend, no matter if it was in the Higher Realm or the Lower Realm. It\u2019s all her fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sized Sesame up for a moment, as though this was her first time seeing such a wonderful piece of work.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a brain?\u201d That was clearly a protective behaviour, alright? Didn\u2019t he know how cruel the world of demonic beasts in the Lower Realm was? Because of the lack of sentience, beasties would always fight each other for territories and power. With just the slightest bit of discord, it would be a fight to the death, alright? Yet it still wanted to make friends with other beasts. You\u2019re an idiot, aren\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>You have a good girl that protects you wherever you are, and you still have the face to despise her?</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame, I think we should just cancel our pact! I\u2019m afraid that a beastie like you will influence my intelligence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress\u2026\u201d Sesame made a distressed look. \u201cThis one is truly pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram.\u201d Trash, don\u2019t infect my master. \u201cAren\u2019t we going to the south to find your friend?\u201d She diverted the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d He helplessly responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t figure out this matter within a short time, and when it comes to feelings and relationships, outsiders can\u2019t interfere. Why don\u2019t we instead make a move while you think things through?\u201d Zhu Yao looked at it and said. \u201cBut you must figure it out yourself. Do you really hate that Gong Lan that much? To the point where you don\u2019t want to see her at all? You need to understand this\u2026 There are some things that can\u2019t be found again after missing it once.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not know about Sesame\u2019s thoughts, but that handsome woman earlier did not look like a beast that would treat feelings that casually. She must actually liked Sesame very much, which was why she wanted to marry Sesame. However, with its continual rejections of their marriage, Zhu Yao was afraid that it had already harmed her deeply. One\u2019s heart was not invulnerable after all, it could not endure damages over and over again. If Sesame were to miss this opportunity, even if it were to turn back in the future, it would most likely be too late.</p><br/><p>Sesame was silent for a while, and then, as though to evade the topic, it turned away its eyes. \u201cMistress\u2019s matters are more important. Let us head south.\u201d As it said that, it turned into its original form and lowered one of its wings, hinting her to climb onto its back.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed and climbed up. Right after, Sesame rose into the air. However, it was clearly a little absent-minded this time. Though it did not slow down, it had clearly activated auto-pilot mode.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame, there\u2019s a stone wall in front. If you continue in this direction, we will crash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame, there are lightning clouds up front. Do you want to be fried?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame, there\u2019s a Demonic Immortal ahead. Do you want to be involved in a car crash?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with her constant reminders, it could not stop its death-courting heart. Fortunately, she still had the concealment hack which prevented her from being discovered by the Demonic Immortals. Otherwise, she would have long been caught several times over. Sesame was absent-minded the entire journey, stumbling towards their destination.</p><br/><p>She wondered just how incredible its friend was, but in the end, they stopped next to a straw cottage. There was a courtyard in front, and it was entirely empty. Not even a single strand of weed could be seen either. The door of the straw cottage creaked as the wind blew, and the word \u201cpoor\u201d could only be used to describe the place.</p><br/><p>Though the surroundings were surrounded by mountains and rivers, divine energy was in abundance as well. The environment was pretty decent.</p><br/><p>Sesame landed on the ground and took up its human form. It then directly pushed the door open and entered. Zhu Yao followed behind it, but the house was empty without a single figure in sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d Sesame looked around, a little disappointed. However, when it turned its head, it saw a black club on the table. \u201cEh? This is\u2026 Mistress, mistress. Come and take a look.\u201d It suddenly said with an excited look. \u201cWith this, you will be able to cross the Realm Tide and return to the Deity Continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at the object in its hand. It was metallic and had a cylindrical shape, however, it did not have any divine energy circulating around it. It did not look like a divine artifact, and was rather normal without anything unique about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an ancient mechanism formation.\u201d Sesame glanced at the club as it focused its senses on it. It then made a few creaking sounds, as though something had been activated. With a swoosh, the cylindrical object that was still just an arm length earlier, suddenly began to pull open. In just a few moments, it wrapped Sesame up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame!\u201d Zhu Yao was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d It responded. The creaking noises sounded once more, and then, that black sheet once again returned to its cylindrical shape. \u201cMistress, with this, the wind blades of the Realm Tide can be shielded against, and we can return to the Deity Continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know that this object is useful?\u201d Sesame sized up the club for a moment. It sure looked like a mechanism technique and not constructed by divine arts. It was no wonder it did not have any divine energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw my friend use it once.\u201d Sesame explained. \u201cThis thing is really sturdy, the wind blades basically aren\u2019t able to damage it at all. Also, it\u2019s not a divine artifact, so it wouldn\u2019t be dispelled by the Presenceless wind blades.\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded really incredible. \u201cThen what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pulled Sesame out of the door.</p><br/><p>Eh! Wait a minute.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good to just take it away like this, right?\u201d Why did she feel a little guilty as though she had stolen something?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d Sesame patted on its chest and guaranteed. \u201cIn any case, he has a lot of things, so he won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d To actually make friends with someone like Sesame, it sure is that person\u2019s three lives\u2019 worth of misfortune!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

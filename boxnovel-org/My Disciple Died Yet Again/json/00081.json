With her mouth opened up wide, she looked at the shy Feng Yi, and in an instant, she felt entirely uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Big sis, don\u2019t scare me!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not willing?\u201d Feng Yi\u2019s expression instantly turned pale, and the luster of tears seemed to have surfaced at the corner of her eyes, as she took a step forward. \u201cWhy? Is there anything bad about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was frightened to the point she suddenly leapt up, and she immediately fell off the stone chair. Only after a long while, did she finally crawl back up. \u201cNo, no, no. I\u2026 Haah! I think you must have misunderstood. I\u2026 What\u2019s there that\u2019s good about me? Why did you fall in love with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Please, although he had the shell of a male, she was still a genuine woman, and a straight one at that.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi circled around, looking as though she wanted to step forward to hold her up, yet she firmly replied. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will change, alright?\u201d Zhu Yao took a big step back, and she felt like crying. Big sis, don\u2019t make such a world-class joke, hey.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really hate me that much?\u201d Feng Yi instantly showed a face of despair, the tears at the corner of her eyes began to fall down in streams.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d Zhu Yao was suddenly filled with a heavy amount of guilt, and at that instant, she felt as though she was no longer human. \u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way. Haah. We\u2026 We won\u2019t be blissful if we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Feng Yi\u2019s face was filled with accusations for Zhu Yao, and she completely looked like a little girl who had submerged herself in her own feelings. Not even the slightest bit of her noble and icy demeanor was left. \u201cSince you hate me so much, then why did you risk your life so many times to save me, and even think of me always?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I ever think of you?\u201d She admitted to saving her, but thinking of her always? Where did that come from?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou helped me save my disciple, and whenever I look for you, you had never rejected or evaded me as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because, she wanted to loaf on the job.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 Sometimes, I look for you deep in the night, yet, you would still listen to me patiently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please. That\u2019s the basic code of conduct of a good girl friend. In the modern era, whenever her girl friend broke up, she would always like to call her late in the night as well, and she had never felt like strangling her either.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not in your heart, then why did you treat me so well till now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Zhu Yao took a deep breath, and stopped her brain from functioning. \u201cSovereign. I really do not have any unnatural thoughts towards you. Really!\u201d</p><br/><p>You must believe me!</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Feng Yi instantly shattered her expectations, as she looked at her with a hurt expression. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, then, since we\u2019re in the same sect, why have you never called me senior-martial aunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Because she was her junior-martial sister, could she tell her this?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have to deny it? If you think that it\u2019s not the right time yet, I can wait.\u201d Feng Yi looked at her with an unregretful expression. \u201cHowever\u2026 please do not push me away. If you don\u2019t give me a reason today, I will never believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reason. Reason. The hell, where was she going to find a reason? She\u2019s currently a man. Even if she were to take off her shirt for Feng Yi to look at it, she wouldn\u2019t believe it either, would she?</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao took a deep breath, and with great effort, she squeezed out a very serious expression. \u201cI already have someone I like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi trembled, and took two consecutive steps back, as she looked at him with an ashen face.</p><br/><p>When his disciple came rushing in, Yu Yan was meditating. After sensing his stupid disciple\u2019s presence from afar, in the next moment, she had already came charging in like a bull. \u201cWuwuwuwu.\u201d Lying in his embrace, she began to cry out crocodile tears.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan stiffened for a moment, hesitating how he should throw his disciple out, so that she would become less stupid when she falls.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026 I don\u2019t want to live anymore.\u201d Zhu Yao rubbed her head messily, attempting to rub off her tears and snot on her master\u2019s white clothes. She could not be the only one frustrated about this, right? \u201cWuwuwu\u2026 I hurt a girl\u2019s pure and innocent heart earlier. But I was really shocked. She actually wanted me to marry her, no, she wanted to wed to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when Yu Yan wanted to push her hand away, anger began to well up inside his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Which daredevil was trying to steal his disciple away again?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important.\u201d Zhu Yao was getting over her head. \u201cSee here, I only saved her once, and treated her a little better, how did that cause her to fancy me? I don\u2019t want to steal someone else\u2019s harem, you know.\u201d Even if Xiao Yi\u2019s harem was huge, and would not mind losing one or two.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned, as he made guesses on who the person his disciple was referring to. He was considering if he should remind that person, not to have any ideas of getting his disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I really want to turn back, my current identity is too ridiculous! I only realized this now, and my future looks bleak.\u201d Zhu Yao said with teary eyes and snot coming out of her nose. \u201cSee here, if I\u2019m together with her, then it will be yuri. If I were to go with a man, then it will be yaoi. It seems like, no matter which route I take, I can\u2019t get out from being gay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. What yuri yaoi?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, tell me honestly!\u201d Zhu Yao wiped her face bitterly. \u201cDo you also think that my current form is exceptionally abnormal, and exceptionally perverse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan looked at her from top to bottom. Her chicken\u2019s nest-like hair, eyes that were swollen like blisters, and that red nose which was constantly sniffling. No matter how he looked at it, she looked really terrible, however, he still calmly said. \u201cYou\u2019re decent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d As expected, he was a great master. She was touched.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan however, suddenly raised his head, looked outside, and said with a frown. \u201cThe person you were referring to, is it her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. She turned to look, only to see Feng Yi, who had followed her without her noticing. Currently, she was standing outside, looking disbelievingly at the two people who were hugging each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person you like, could it really be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A light bulb flashed in Zhu Yao\u2019s mind. She suddenly had an idea that could eliminate all troubles, as she strongly nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>So as to give a stronger effect, she even hugged onto her master\u2019s head, and with a \u201cpachi\u201d, she kissed on it.</p><br/><p>The person below her instantly stiffened into a stone statue.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi looked as though she had been dealt by a serious blow, as her body wobbled. She then once again took another glance at the two people. As glistening tears flowed down her cheeks, she flew away.</p><br/><p>Done. Zhu Yao silently gave herself a \u2018Yes!\u2019 in her heart. Although she felt a little sorry for Feng Yi, rather than suffering for a long time, it\u2019s best to settle the issue as fast as possible. Instead of allowing her to cling onto hope, it\u2019s best that Zhu Yao could wake her up sooner than later.</p><br/><p>As Feng Yi was such a prideful person, if Zhu Yao were to look for a regular person, a girl especially, she would definitely not believe it. As the only Demigod-stage female practitioner in the cultivation world, naturally, there\u2019s no other female practitioner that could compete with her. However, it would be different if it was a man, especially a man like her master who was much stronger than her.</p><br/><p>Of course, she had to thank her master for his good performance. Turning around, she gave Yu Yan a huge hug. \u201cThank you, master! The matter has been dealt with. I\u2019m taking my leave first. I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao return to Beast-Taming Mountain.</p><br/><p>While a certain person, was still maintaining that stiff posture, not a single muscle was moved for a short while. Subconsciously touching his lips, that numb feeling, momentarily caused him to be at a loss. Even his heart was in a state of confusion as well. Just what was going on? Could it be that his disciple had cast a strange mystic art on him? However, his disciple was stupid to such an extent, how was that possible?</p><br/><p>If that really was the case, then what sort of mystic art, could allow someone to feel something this strange? And that earlier scene even continued to flash repeatedly in his mind, like a demon\u2019s illusion.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 He did not hate it.</p><br/><p>Once again, he touched his own lips. Faintly, in his heart, a strange heat was surging up as well. Yu Yan recalled everything he had seen and heard in the past ten thousand years, yet, he still was unable to find a reasonable answer.</p><br/><p>As expected, he had no choice but to ask his disciple.</p><br/><p>Ever since Feng Yi ran out of Jade Forest Mountain in tears that day, Zhu Yao no longer saw her. Zhu Yao reflected on herself, yet, she was still unable to think of how she gave Feng Yi the hint that she had some interests towards her.</p><br/><p>Although her current form was a male, she had always thought that, other than not having scruples during the times she interacted with Wang Xuzhi and her master, she didn\u2019t treat the rest of the people any different than she usually did.</p><br/><p>After pondering for a moment, Zhu Yao determined that it must be the time in the Desolate Ground. So as to heal her injuries, Zhu Yao seemed to have pulled her clothes off. In her precognitive dream, Feng Yi seemed to have half-heartedly submitted to Xiao Yi after their naked bodies were facing each other when she was healing Xiao Yi. It\u2019s just that this time, Zhu Yao was swapped in to fill the role.</p><br/><p>The more Zhu Yao thought about it, the more she felt this was plausible. It was no wonder she gave her the Water Spirit that easily, without the slightest bit of hesitation back then. So it was actually because of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, big sis Zhu Yao!\u201d Wang Xuzhi stretched out his hand and waved it in front of Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Did you hear what I said?\u201d This was already the third time she had lost focus, did something happen to her?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi sighed, and then, repeated his words. \u201cI said, Sect Master\u2019s wife is pregnant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Who did it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi\u2019s face was completely dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, it was conditioned reflex.\u201d Zhu Yao scratched her head embarrassingly. \u201cIs it true? I never expected that your master, at his age, would still be so\u2026 gallant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Can the word \u2018gallant\u2019 be used this way? Wang Xuzhi shook his head, showing a helpless face. \u201cMaster told me personally. Most probably, not long later, I will have a little junior-martial brother, or little junior-martial sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi was really happy. Among the inner chamber disciples under the Sect Master, he was the youngest. This time round, he could finally be a senior-martial brother. And, the higher the cultivation a practitioner was, the harder it was for that practitioner to bear children. The chance for a Nascent Soul practitioner like this old man Zi Mo to have descendants, was basically smaller than striking a lottery.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen is it due? I want to join the crowd as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early!\u201d Wang Xuzhi said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been three months for master-aunt, so we have to wait till next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? The pregnancy period is only a year?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi looked at her strangely. \u201cA pregnancy period is usually ten months. It\u2019s common sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Sorry, she was taking Nezha as reference. Since a practitioner\u2019s lifespan was long, she was thinking that the pregnancy periods would be as long as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuzhi, you can\u2019t have ran over here to find me today, just to tell me this piece of news, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>A few days ago, he even threw a fit. Why did he look as though nothing had happened today?</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi\u2019s expression changed, a moment later, he silently pulled out a stack of files and passed it to her. \u201cThe documents you wanted me to arrange, I have already settled them. So\u2026 I came here to pass them to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao glanced at him. So the reason why he did not visit her in the recent few days was because he was busy with these? And here she thought he had lost his temper!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

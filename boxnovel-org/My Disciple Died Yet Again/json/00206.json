She was even secretly celebrating how lucky she was, when suddenly, a white light flashed in her surroundings. Spiritual swords appeared in mid-air one after another, and they flew towards her.</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge them this time.</p><br/><p>In the nick of time, the Risefire Beast which had been quietly hopping the entire time, leapt forward and shielded Zhu Yao. Those spiritual swords clattered as they struck its scales, and then, they disappeared after falling onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~~\u201d The Risefire Beast was filled with a prideful look. When it lowered its head, it realized that the paw which it had been carefully protecting was placed onto the ground, and its ears drooped down in an instant. As though it had received some sort of damage, it began to weep. \u201cPaw\u2026 My paw\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d It\u2019s not even broken, did it have to be like this? \u201cEnough, once we get out of here, I will hold onto all four of your paws, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Its eyes instantly brightened up again.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao began to carefully inspect the corridor. At the moment those spiritual swords appeared, she clearly sensed the fluctuations of a formation. She searched her surroundings for a moment, and realized that an offensive formation was engraved on the left stone pillar. It was exactly the formation, which gathered spiritual energy to spiritual swords, that hit her. However, the runes on the formation were a little ancient, and did not look like the runes that were used in the present. Rather, they looked a little similar to the sealing runes which her teacher taught her back then.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. It seemed like this place wasn\u2019t really safe either. As she pressed inwards, her vigilance rose by a little. As expected, another different formation was spotted on a pillar in front of her. The further she went, the more complicated those formations became. She carefully detoured around every one of them, and things grew quite tense.</p><br/><p>She walked for about another hour and finally reached to the end. A gigantic stone door appeared right in front of eyes. Seeing the realistic-looking gigantic demonic beast on the door whose eyes were closed, Zhu Yao could sense the vile intentions of the entire world.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, master, master\u2026\u201d The Risefire Beast excitedly hopped up and down in front of the door.</p><br/><p>A blinding white light was suddenly released from the door, and that terrifying demonic beast that was engraved on it turned alive. A horrifying pressure came spreading all around in an overwhelming manner, and even the entire ground was shaking. That gigantic demonic beast suddenly opened its eyes widely, revealing a pair of blood-red eyes which were several times larger the Risefire Beast\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho has come?\u201d That beast spat out the language of humans, and its voice was resoundingly loud, its echoes endlessly rebounded back and forth the surroundings. An incredibly rich smell of blood suffused into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao did not reply.</p><br/><p>That gigantic beast on the door glanced at its surroundings, and its line of sight fell on Zhu Yao, killing intent filled the place. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a practitioner. A mere Foundation practitioner is actually capable of reaching here as well, then\u2026\u201d The killing intent suddenly turned stronger, and the pressure grew even more overwhelming. Its blood red eyes gradually narrowed, and it said with a heavy voice. \u201cI will eat you to my heart\u2019s content.\u201d</p><br/><p>That terrifying beast head suddenly reached out from the door, and opened it\u2019s mouth wide in front of Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, as she gathered the spiritual energy she managed to accumulate earlier, and sent a slap towards it.</p><br/><p>A \u2018pa\u2019 sound lightly resounded.</p><br/><p>The gigantic beast was instantly enraged.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar~~~\u201d Opening its mouth, it aimed to bite her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. At the moment it was about to reach her, she shouted. \u201cSesame!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The beast head was stunned, and its eyes suddenly widened to the extreme. It tensely stared at the person in front of it, and even blinked its eyes in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Zhu Yao felt a slight headache.</p><br/><p>\u201cMis\u2026 Mistress?\u201d The demonic beast\u2019s voice instantly toned down quite a bit, and its pair of blood red eyes began to turn misty. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s really you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at her surroundings. \u201cWhy are you imprisoned in a door again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress\u2026\u201d As though Sesame had finally confirmed the person in front of its eyes, tears began to fall. One drop, two drops\u2026 In just a few moments, like a faucet being opened, its tears flowed outwards. It wailed out loud, as though its liver and intestines were being sliced into pieces. \u201cWuaaah, mistress\u2026 You finally came to look for this beastie. Wuaaah\u2026 This beastie thought that I\u2019m no longer able to see you, mistress\u2026 Mistress\u2026 Wuaaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, enough, stop crying!\u201d It was such a huge beast, if it cried any more than this, a flood would occur, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cWuaaah\u2026\u201d Sesame however selfishly began to announce his grievances, crying to the point of being out of breath. \u201cMistress\u2026 You don\u2019t even love this beastie at all, only now did you decide to come and find me. Wuaaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh, could she reveal that she wasn\u2019t here to find it?</p><br/><p>Glancing at its unrestrainable saddened look, in the end, Zhu Yao decided not to tell it this cruel truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Aren\u2019t I here now?\u201d She stroked the beast head. \u201cTell me, just what happened? Didn\u2019t you return to the demonic continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Sesame stopped its weeping. As it sniffled its nose, it spoke with a complaining tone. \u201cMistress\u2026 The beasties of the demonic continent bullied me. They despised me for once signing a contract with a human practitioner, and carrying the scent of a human practitioner on me. This beastie has once returned to look for you, but mistress couldn\u2019t be found anywhere. After that, this beastie had nowhere else to hide, was captured, and was then thrown down to the Lower Realm again by the Palace Master. And he even said never to ever return.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was pretty sure that he was chased down here because of his own fault. Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Zhu Yao caught onto this keyword. \u201cYou have some old grudges with that so-called Palace Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Sesame\u2019s face stiffened, and his eyes began to swim around.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression sank. \u201cSpeak the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame\u2019s huge mouth flattened, and she looked at her with a pitiful look. \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 There is a little misunderstanding\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most important point is because this beastie is simply too handsome.\u201d It shook its head. \u201cI accidentally caught the sights of a princess. The Palace Master forced me to marry her, and I was unwilling, so he chased me down to the Lower Realm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cAre you certain that it\u2019s someone else admiring you, and not because you\u2019re conspiring against them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible!\u201d Sesame said with a stern look. \u201cWhy would I like her? You don\u2019t know this, but although she\u2019s a princess, she\u2019s a beastie with only two legs. I\u2019m a handsome beast with four legs, so I won\u2019t ever marry two legs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What did this have to do with legs? \u201cAre you certain that you didn\u2019t fool around and let her down, hence leading to her father sticking up for his own daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have only seen her once.\u201d Sesame said with an unfortunate look. \u201cAnd that time, because I fled from the wedding, I was sealed in that mustard seed dimension and thrown to the Lower Realm. I never expected that even after so many years have passed, she still covet my charm\u2026 Wuuuuuu, mistress, this beastie has such a hard life!\u201d</p><br/><p>You Godzilla, just which part of you look charming!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed, pointed to the place he came out from, and continued to ask. \u201cAnd then? Why were you sealed in this door again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Sesame shook his head. \u201cWhen I came to the Lower Realm, I simply felt something was guiding me towards it, and then I found myself in this door when I woke up. I have tried several times, but I\u2019m only capable of sticking my head out. I\u2019m not able to escape at all. So, I wanted to gather several demonic beasts of my species to help break this seal. In the end, I waited for two hundred years, and only managed to encounter a Risefire Beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~~\u201d The Risefire Beast obediently responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, I planned on luring human practitioners over, and see if they have any methods to help me escape. In the end, mistress came.\u201d The longer it spoke, the sadder it became, and tears seemed to begin welling up in its eyes again. \u201cMistress, this beastie is so pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have yourself to blame for this?\u201d Back then, it would have been better if it stayed in the Lightning Divine Hall, but it just had to return to the demonic continent to seek a beating.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis beastie knows its mistake. Mistress is so incredible, you definitely know how to remove this formation. Mistress, save me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head and looked at those circulating words on the door. Sesame sure guessed right, she really knew how to remove this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a formation.\u201d Zhu Yao frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a seal.\u201d Those familiar words were seal characters. With this arrangement and aura fluctuation, it was evidently a \u201cDevil Restraining Seal. This is a low-grade sealing art used to restrain Devils.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDevils?\u201d Sesame was stunned for a moment, and then it twisted about. \u201cBut beastie is of the Beast Race.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also something she couldn\u2019t understand. Though the Devil Restraining Seal was low-grade sealing art, it would only respond to Devils, unless\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame, when you were sealed within, you have yet to fully recover from your previous injuries, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame nodded.</p><br/><p>As expected. Back then, it suffered heavy injuries from Yue Ying. Yue Ying was a Devil, and its wounds naturally contained remnants of a Devil\u2019s aura. And this coincidentally was a low-grade sealing art, so it immediately recognized it as a Devil and sealed it within.</p><br/><p>Sesame, such a hard life, you have!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will release you now, retract your head back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, meow~ I just knew that mistress is the best, meow~\u201d Sesame happily retracted its head.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sat cross-legged, and took a deep breath. During the time she spent walking here, the spiritual energy in her body had already recovered a little, yet she had to release them all over here again. She circulated the spiritual energy, and turned them into thread-like spiritual strands. They wrapped around those sealing characters, and then intertwined along the flow of the seal. After that, they dragged in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the door began to release a white light, and it grew brighter and brighter. The circular formation, like a projection, suddenly revealed itself from the door and constantly rotated. When those characters could no longer be seen, a ray of light flew out from inside, and the circular formation slowly dimmed, until it disappeared.</p><br/><p>A doll-faced male youth appeared before Zhu Yao. On the sleeves of his white robe was a familiar auspicious cloud diagram, it was exactly the uniform of the past Ancient Hill Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress\u2026\u201d The youth leapt up, and pounced towards her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sent a slap straight to his face. Exerting some strength, she stood up.</p><br/><p>Sesame slammed onto the ground with a \u2018pa\u2019. As though he had already gotten used to her violence, he changed to hugging her thighs, and began to rub them with a satisfied look\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m finally out. As expected, mistress loves beastie the most. Ouuu~~~~ This beastie wants to bear monkeys with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao kicked away this idiot, and took a careful look. The door earlier had disappeared, and two pillars similar to those in the corridor appeared in its place, along with six forked paths in front of them. Every path was unfathomably deep, and it was unknown where they lead to.</p><br/><p>Was this, the part where she would head into a dungeon?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

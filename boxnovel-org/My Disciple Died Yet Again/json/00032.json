She\u2019s my responsibility, I have to take care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying! What childhood friends? Evidently, you\u2019re in love with her.\u201d Su Zi cried a fountain of tears.</p><br/><p>Heh? It\u2019s actually a love triangle. Zhu Yao immediately activated her drama-watching mode, she then turned to glance at Wang Xuzhi beside her, and silently patted on his shoulder. Don\u2019t worry, you will have your own fans, and you will have your own girls as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, do you want her, or do you want me?\u201d Su Zi interrogated him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister Su.\u201d Xiao Yi did not answer her directly, rather, he pulled Su Zi by the hand, and pressed her against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand my heart at all? Ever since I first met you at the square that day, my heart had fallen for you, and it will never return to its former calm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Xiao Yi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour every word, your every movement, and even your every smile, move my heart. I\u2019ve almost forgotten, if there\u2019s no you, how would my heart beat once more? I want to treat you well for my entire lifetime. Do you really not believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yo, it\u2019s a pity that this Xiao Yi isn\u2019t acting in the dramas which old aunties watch. Zhu Yao silently took out two steamed buns, she handed one over to Wang Xuzhi beside her, while she nibbled on one herself.</p><br/><p>As expected, the girly\u2019s fury extinguished in a second, and felt entirely moved. \u201cBig brother Xiao Yi\u2026 I, I do. I do believe you. I\u2019m just envious, envious that the person who was by your side for so many years was her, and not me. I\u2019m the one who loves you the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister Su\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Xiao Yi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them got closer to each other, finally, their bodies made contact, and then, they tumbled around.</p><br/><p>The bun in Zhu Yao\u2019s hands instantly fell onto the ground. This\u2026 This development is a little too quick. Why did it suddenly jump from lovetalk mode to meal-eating mode? And the first dish that comes up is the main dish! You two are only in your early teens, and not adults yet, hey!</p><br/><p>In front of her eyes, Xiao Yi had already begun to cleanly strip off every single one of the girly\u2019s clothes. His pair of big hands swam up and down her body, causing the girly to continuously moan seductively.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Xiao Yi\u2026 Ah, I\u2026 I, Xiao\u2026 Big brother\u2026 Please, give it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi smiled sinisterly. While using his tongue to trace the girly\u2019s figure, he replied charmingly. \u201cLittle sister Su, don\u2019t be anxious. Big brother will give you the best.\u201d And then, he slowly took off his own clothes.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao was watching the situation intensively, her vision blackened, a hand had covered her eyes. The hell, what are you doing, little wimp? We\u2019re about to see the main event, and you actually turned my lights off.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi\u2019s voice was husky, having an indescribable awkwardness. \u201cGrand-martial aunt, do not watch such indecent things!\u201d</p><br/><p>Do not watch, your sister! Zhu Yao\u2019s inner heart was roaring. This damn little wimp, only in times like this when he would never compromise, would he call her grand-martial aunt. In the modern era, she was considered to be someone who had went through all sorts of large scaled films, a rare opportunity to watch it live was right in front of her, and he actually prevented her from watching it.</p><br/><p>However, although her eyes were blinded, she could clearly hear every single thing that was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 Mn. Big brother Xiao Yi\u2026 it feels good, more\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, my little cutie-pie, I will make you feel even better.\u201d Uh\u2026 It seems like I can never see the phrase \u2018little cutie-pie\u2019 in the same light from now on.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Xiao Yi\u2026 Please\u2026 Give it\u2026 Give it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDont\u2019 be anxious, You. Little. Demoness. Of. The. Devil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Xiao Yi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister Su\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was fiery hot on that side, while it was actually awkwardly dead silent on Zhu Yao\u2019s side. The voice in Zhu Yao\u2019s inner heart was roaring and requesting for the pictures. No matter how perfect the sound effects were, without the motion pictures, it would still be a lousy movie. I want to watch. I want to watch. I want to watch. I want to watch. Yet, Wang Xuzhi\u2019s hand was covering her eyes ever so tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle wimp, take your hands away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand-martial aunt, it\u2019s indecent, do not watch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy ass. Aren\u2019t you watching it too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I turned my head away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I will only believe you if you release your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister Zhu Yao, I won\u2019t fall for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou single little bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt went in!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d Zhu Yao forcefully pulled down his hands. \u201cHow many inches was it? Was it huge!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere around them was dead silent for a moment, and only an inharmoniously unlawful sound could be constantly heard from afar. Papapa\u2026papapa\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi sighed deeply, as though he had given up, and pointed to the cottage furthest away from them. \u201cEarlier, I saw a red figure entering that house. The figure was extremely quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao recalled the business they were here for. \u201cLet\u2019s go and take a look.\u201d The fish finally took the bait.</p><br/><p>The cottage seemed to only have a single resident, as it only had a single room. Since there was still light inside the house, Zhu Yao and Wang Xuzhi carefully approached it, and listened in while holding their breaths. Because they were still not clear with the situation inside, Zhu Yao did not dare to release her divine sense to investigate.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, why don\u2019t this humble lady service you?\u201d An extremely bewitching female voice could be heard from inside the house.</p><br/><p>And then, it\u2019s the sounds of clothes being stripped off.</p><br/><p>What the hell, again!? What day is it today? Why did everyone suddenly feel like getting things moving? Could it be that having an affair was trending now? She recalled a certain saying in the show \u2018World of Animals\u2019, \u2018Spring has come, it\u2019s mating season again!\u2019</p><br/><p>But it\u2019s currently the winter season, hey!</p><br/><p>It seemed like they were not able to find anything today. Zhu Yao tugged onto Wang Xuzhi, and was planning to leave. However, Wang Xuzhi did not move, and even gestured her to keep quiet. Yo, this brat, he\u2019s actually addicted to it. And earlier, he even denied that he was watching them!</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi, who had realized that her thoughts had once again drifted somewhere else, pulled her hand over, and gently wrote three words on her palm. \u201cThere\u2019s demonic aura!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes widened, and calmly sensed her surroundings. As he had said, she caught an irregular aura, which carried a dark feeling. This is demonic aura?</p><br/><p>The two of them carefully took a few steps forward, and appeared before the window. Then, they stretched their necks and looked inside the house.</p><br/><p>In the house, there were a man and a woman. The man was lying on the bed, while the other extremely bewitching lady was currently sitting on the man, moving up and down. The two of them were completely *****. Before Zhu Yao could even gasp out of shock from their cowgirl position, layers of black miasma began to circle around the lady, and they fluctuated with her every movement.</p><br/><p>A while later, a red light flashed in the lady\u2019s eyes, and the surrounding miasma became thicker. As for the man below her, he was slimming down at a speed that could be seen with the naked eye. She was absorbing his essence. The lady emitted a long howl, and three long tails suddenly emerged behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cA fox demon!\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but utter out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d The fox demon felt movements, and ruthlessly pushed out her palm. With a bang, the wall in front of them instantly collapsed. If not for their great speeds, they might have been trapped under the rubble. The female figure flashed, and had already walked out of the house with her clothes over her. However, the clothes she was wearing, was just a piece of thin red chiffon, it basically had no concealing function, thus, her attractive body was clearly shown.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao and Wang Xuzhi did not move. They had the Presence Hiding Talismans on them. As long as they did not make any sound, people who were below the cultivation levels of the Azoth-stage, would basically not be able to find them. And this fox demon, if she was not wrong, should be a fifth-grade demonic beast, which was comparable to a practitioner at the elementary Azoth-stage.</p><br/><p>As expected, after the fox demon looked around for a while, and did not see anyone suspicious, her expression suddenly turned cold, as she flew towards the small forest nearby.</p><br/><p>Crap, I forgot about that pair of wild mandarin ducks!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

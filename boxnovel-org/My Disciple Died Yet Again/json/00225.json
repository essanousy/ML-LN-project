A powerful might was faintly emitting out from within. It began to shake, as though something was about to break out of the shell.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the Devil\u2019s devillic aura exploded forth, releasing out a large mass of devillic energy that was targeted at Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d Yu Yan turned around and rushed over, sweeping his sword across the devillic energy. However, he was unable to shield himself in time, as a long sword formed by devillic energy immediately pierced through his figure.</p><br/><p>As it was just an illusory form in the first place, it merely shook for a moment. However, small stains of blood began to appear on the robe that was as white as snow.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Zhu Yao widened her eyes, and her heart clenched in an instant as she held onto him. That familiar feeling of anger once again poured out, and for an instant, she wanted to step forward and exterminate that Devil.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s figure shook for a moment. Pulling onto Zhu Yao\u2019s hand, he said in a sunken voice. \u201cI shall hold this Devil back. Bring the egg and return to the mustard seed dimensional space through that passageway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut master!\u201d That egg was so huge, how was going to bring it through the passageway, hey?</p><br/><p>\u201cBe obedient!\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank. \u201cI will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only a ghost would believe you! There were already bloodstains on his body, which proved that her master who was in the dimensional space was similarly injured as well. He basically wouldn\u2019t be able to last long.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of you will be able to escape!\u201d The Devil coldly smiled. In an instant, icicles numbered in the high hundreds appeared, and they flew straight towards the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and go.\u201d Yu Yan swept his sword and instantly blasted a passage open. Then, he went to meet with the Devil\u2019s attacks head on.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath, and suppressed the seemingly uncontrollable anger within her heart. She knew that this was the effects of the Ruling Plume and had to calm herself down. Thus, she increased the output of the flames next to the Dragon egg.</p><br/><p>Glancing at the two people in the air, she gritted her teeth. It\u2019s all or nothing!</p><br/><p>Even if she went back in the direction they were from now, she might not be able to escape. Rather than that, she might as well make a gamble.</p><br/><p>Calming herself down and taking a deep breath, she circulated her spiritual energy. As the output of spiritual energy increased, the egg began to shake and looked like it was about to hatch at any moment. The Devil\u2019s expression sank, and it suddenly split into two. Another illusory form was summoned, and it came flying straight towards Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>The hell, she had no choice but to endure this the hard way!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao circulated the spiritual energy in her entire body, and wildly summoned flames in the direction of the Dragon egg. She must make it in time!</p><br/><p>The Devil was approaching fast, and just as it was about to strike her body\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a crack sounded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt completely relieved at this moment.</p><br/><p>Following after, a draconic roar resounded through the clouds.</p><br/><p>A golden light pierced through the skies, instantly breaking through this gigantic space and the ceiling began to collapse. Solidified lava fell off, and not even a moment later, as though the entirety of the ceiling had been dug apart, the blue sky was revealed. The Devil\u2019s illusory form had also disappeared at the moment of the draconic roar sounded.</p><br/><p>This place was about to collapse!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao grabbed onto Lin Qi in passing and flew out while enduring the pain that felt as though her entire body was about to be torn apart. After exiting the place that was filled with magma did she realize that they were beneath the ruins her master was residing in. In other words, that place earlier was most probably the third level of the ruins.</p><br/><p>That draconic roar grew even louder. In the sky above, a giant azure dragon was circling around. The Devil began to tremble and his expression was especially twisted, as he stared straight towards the sky.</p><br/><p>The body of the gigantic dragon flashed, instantly turning into a purple-robed man, carrying an unconcealable air of royalty. He looked at the Devil with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cAojiang. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still alive.\u201d The Devil coldly snorted, and his eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the Devils aren\u2019t exterminated, how can I of the God race pass on!?\u201d Aojiang released a mighty pressure from his body and fiercely glared back. \u201cYan Chi, the ancient Devils are destined to never be allowed into this world. This is the Heavenly Dao, and neither you nor I am able to fight against it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Chi\u2019s expression twisted even further, and he said with a cold smile. \u201cYou think you\u2019re capable of being my opponent right now? Even if you had hidden yourself in your egg shell and regained your former godly powers, what of it? Aojiang, you couldn\u2019t beat me in the past, and you won\u2019t be able to beat me now either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether I can beat you or not, I will know if I try!\u201d Aojiang\u2019s figure flashed, and he turned back into a gigantic dragon in an instant as he flew straight towards the Devil.</p><br/><p>These two people actually knew each other? She had thought that it was a young Dragon in the egg, but never did she expect that it was an old Dragon nursing his injuries in his egg shell. No wonder it was so huge.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Zhu Yao found a safe spot on the ground and placed Lin Qi down. Then, she flew over to Yu Yan.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan raised his head and looked towards the ruins that was about to collapse completely, and said with a sunken voice. \u201cYu Yao, shatter that pearl within your divine sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment, and then understood a moment later. She instantly retrieved that pearl and tightened her grip on it, causing the white pearl to shatter into pieces. Yu Yan\u2019s illusory form shook for a moment, before turning into a ray of light that flew back in the direction of his main body.</p><br/><p>The battle between the Dragon and Devil was exceptionally intense, collapsing mountains and fissures on the earth were barely enough to describe it. Zhu Yao was only able to stay away from the ripples of the battle after being doubly cautious. However, even in the present situation, that Devil did not lose the upper hand in the slightest. Instead, it was that Dragon which was in a difficult position.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was feeling worried, the sky suddenly turned dark. Several bolts of heavenly lightning descended from the sky, striking directly in the direction of the Devil.</p><br/><p>The Devil Yan Chi dodged them with all his might, but was still affected by the lightning sparks. Quite a bit of his devillic energy from his body scattered off, and his aura was beginning to destabilize as well. Evidently, he suffered a heavy injury.</p><br/><p>Her master\u2019s figure instantly appeared in the sky. This time, it was not just half of his divine sense, but his main body.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently gave a thumbs up in his direction!</p><br/><p>\u201cFar Ancient Highgod!\u201d Aojiang was stunned for a moment as he looked at Yu Yan with widened eyes. He had a face of complete disbelief. \u201cWhy is the Highgod\u2026 No, you do not have the God\u2019s imprint on you, just who in the world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan had no time to care about him, as he once again summoned heavenly lightning bolts and sent them towards Yan Chi. He did not have much time. The tribulation clouds were already beginning to gather in the sky. Once the Ascension Lightning Tribulation descends, he would have no choice but to ascend into the Higher Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Zhu Yao suddenly received a voice transmission.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me the method you used to seal the Devil earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeal\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was startled for a moment, and then she shook her head on reflex. \u201cNo way master. The sealing arts are arts belonging to the God race, and they must be activated through godly energy. If you were to forcefully activate it with spiritual energy, you will suffer a rebound. So you can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Wang!\u201d His voice sank, and he said with a lecturing tone. \u201cSince you\u2019re able to do it, why can\u2019t your master? Believe in your master just once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What he said made a lot of sense.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gritted her teeth. This was the only way left. Thus, she chose the safest and also the most effective seal \u2013 the Offering Seal Art. Then, she explained to her master the art\u2019s incantation, the critical points of its formation, and also the method of circulating spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan listened to the explanation seriously, and he subconsciously frowned. Normally speaking, a sealing art that was similar to formations such as this would be extremely hard to enact without practice. Strangely however, when he heard her disciple\u2019s explanation, a depiction of the basic structure of the seal automatically appeared in his mind, as though he knew these arts in the very beginning.</p><br/><p>The tribulation had already descended, and eighty one heavenly lightning bolts constantly struck him without pause. Yu Yan guided the heavenly lightning bolts with all his might, and attacked in the direction of the Devil while coordinating with the Dragon.</p><br/><p>That Devil seemed to have fallen into a difficult position. Be it the heavenly lightning bolts or the Dragon\u2019s attacks, none of them missed their mark. However, the other party was like an unkillable cockroach, and would revert back to his original look in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d He suddenly let out a wild laugh. \u201cAojiang, it\u2019s no use. I\u2019m a Devil. I can\u2019t die, nor can I be exterminated. No matter how powerful you people are, it\u2019s basically impossible to kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aojiang\u2019s expression sharpened, as his gigantic head went pouncing in his direction.</p><br/><p>However, Yu Yan circulated that sealing art at the exact same moment, and finally at the moment the final heavenly lightning bolt descended, the seal activated.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a gigantic runic diagram appeared in the sky, and it descended like a large cage.</p><br/><p>\u201cOffering Seal!\u201d Aojiang was startled, and a moment later he looked pleasantly surprised. Reverting back to his human form, he looked towards Yu Yan with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible? Why is there a human capable of using the ancient sealing arts?\u201d Yan Chi\u2019s face greyed from defeat as stared at the seal in the sky. He wanted to escape, but the light from the seal isolated him from within, and he was unable to break free.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Chi, I have already told you, this is fate. The ancient Devils are destined to perish.\u201d Aojiang however had a calm look, and seemed to have heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou and I have fought for so many years, you should have seen through the Heavenly Dao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not content, I\u2019m not content!\u201d The seal pressed down even further, and Yan Chi began to struggle even wilder than before, even his scream was beginning to turn piercing to the ears. His face seemed to have been pulled or something, as it began to change in shape. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Devils exist in this world? This world is just unfair! In a state like this, the Three Realms should be destroyed. What Heavenly Dao? Even if it\u2019s the Heavenly Dao, I will still push on and bend the heavens! Destroy\u2026 I will destroy this world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he continued on, he grew even wilder than before. Finally, it was no longer able to see his human shape, and he seemed to have turned into a mass of black mist that only knew how to vent his anger, as he clashed and collided with the seal. He had completely lost his reason. Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank for a moment. Was this the Devil\u2019s main body? A mass of resentment that only knew how to slaughter, destroy,and throw itself into a bloodthirsty frenzy. However, no matter how he struggled, he was unable to escape the seal. That golden formation came crashing straight down.</p><br/><p>Yan Chi instantly disappeared within the bottom of the seal, and not even a hint of his presence could be felt any longer. An additional round formation appeared on the surface.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan focused and retrieved the spiritual energy, but in the end, he was still unable to sustain himself from the rebound. His body shook for a moment, and a scarlet red stream flowed out from the corner of his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Zhu Yao flew over on her sword and held onto his body. Her heart was clenching ever so tightly. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan shook his head, and habitually stroked the top of her head. \u201cNo matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just that his blood is flowing in the reverse direction, his Dantian has shattered, and almost all of his meridians had been destroyed. It\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d That purple-robed Dragon came over with a leisurely look.</p><br/><p>Blood flowing in the reverse direction, Dantian had shattered, and his meridians were destroyed, and he was saying it was nothing serious!? Zhu Yao turned to glare at him. Say one more word, and I will strangle you to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Aojiang was startled, and he unconsciously took a step back. Why was this little lady so fierce? He did not say much though? Injuries like these were really nothing much to the Dragon race. Hesitating for a moment, he still reached out his palm towards Yu Yan\u2019s back and sent some godly energy over, restoring his Dantian. \u201cEarlier, it\u2019s thanks to the both of you that the Devil is now sealed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, though it\u2019s true it\u2019s something you should be thanking us for.\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hands.</p><br/><p>Aojiang: \u201c\u2026\u201d This little lady was really blunt.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

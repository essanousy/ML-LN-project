I really want to bite him!\u201d With its mouth opened wide, it aimed to bite Yue Ying.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame!\u201d Zhu Yao grabbed onto its tail, and pulled it back. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame was stunned for a moment, before it bared his teeth at Yue Ying again. After a short while, it said. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I just want to bite him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop fooling around, he\u2019s Yue Ying.\u201d Zhu Yao frowned.</p><br/><p>Sesame was startled, and after pondering for a moment, it said. \u201cYue Ying? That little twerp from back then? Why is he here?\u201d</p><br/><p>So it wasn\u2019t because it had recognized Yue Ying. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, I will tell you later.\u201d Zhu Yao placed Sesame on the table, separating the two of them. \u201cHurry and speak, did you find out anything about Yi Ling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d Sesame honestly replied. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on her body, even that intimate feeling I had when I first saw her had disappeared as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>How was that possible?</p><br/><p>Could it be that her Mary Sue cheat could only take effect on the same person once? But in the great hall earlier, clearly the rest of the men still had the sense of longing in their eyes when they looked at Yi Ling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, what about you?\u201d Zhu Yao turned towards him. \u201cDo you feel anything out of sort with Yi Ling\u2019s body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying tilted his head, unclear of the meaning behind her question.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could only add. \u201cI\u2019m saying, do you feel your heart racing, or are there feelings of fondness towards her when you see her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying only likes Big Sis Yao.\u201d Yue Ying smiled even more innocently. \u201cI\u2019m fine with just Big Sis Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, it seemed Yue Ying was completely immune to her.</p><br/><p>Just what was going on? Or was there something wrong with her hypothesis? There were finally some developments, but the clues suddenly got cut off again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress\u2026\u201d Sesame tugged onto her sleeves, and eagerly said. \u201cPlease let me bite him? Just one bite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d That\u2019s enough of you! Was this really the time to play?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026\u201d Yue Ying pitifully tugged onto her as well. \u201cIt hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Hurt my ass. It hadn\u2019t bite you yet, okay?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately kicked the two of them out. She required a world without jokers in order to calmly ponder about this matter.</p><br/><p>She felt like she had missed something out. If she had to point out a difference between the two times Sesame had met her, then there was one. The first time, it was in its human form, while it was in its beast form in the other. Could it be that the Mary Sue cheat was only effective on humans?</p><br/><p>Sesame said her Mary Sue cheat was similar to dragon\u2019s might. She carefully recalled the time when she was in her dragon character, but those beasties\u2019 willingness to submit were not based on their forms either.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, even though she wasn\u2019t a dragon, she was still quite similar to one, right? That Risefire Beast seemed to like following her too. Could it be that there was something different with her character this time?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately formed a water mirror of her height, and carefully inspected this current character of hers.</p><br/><p>A young girl of about eighteen years old immediately appeared in it. Looks very normal though? There\u2019s no special wordings on her face, and her hair was jet-black and beautiful as ever. Above her head, there\u2019s also that\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell. What\u2019s with that drop down arrow that suddenly appeared above her head?</p><br/><p>Why did such a thing suddenly appear on her character?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao waved her hand, only to have it pass through the drop down arrow. It seemed like this was similar to the word \u2018bug\u2019 she was familiar with, and it was something only she could see.</p><br/><p>Gritting her teeth, she could not help but tap on that drop down arrow. And then, like a sliding screen, a row of words appeared.</p><br/><p>World Favourable Impression: [On] or [Off]</p><br/><p>Why did something like this appear?</p><br/><p>And what\u2019s this world favourable impression about!?</p><br/><p>This was an online game right? It definitely was, right?</p><br/><p>She suddenly recalled Realmspirit\u2019s last words right before her resurrection, he seemed to have said\u2026 that he was going to gift her an achievement!</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be this thing, right?</p><br/><p>She suddenly had a feeling that she got played. After hesitating several times, she decided to tap on that \u2018On\u2019 button with her shaky hand.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao held her breath as she waited for three seconds!</p><br/><p>Nothing happened.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Eh, could it be that it was really just a simple achievement, and did not have any use at all? Just like those awards for lifetime achievements, this was the type of achievement where she could just have it on display to feel good?</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was thinking it was strange, suddenly with a loud crash, the door was kicked open by someone.</p><br/><p>Sesame who had taken up its human form came charging like a rocket launcher, and hugged her leg. With a low and obsessed tone, it said. \u201cMistress\u2026 I just came into realization of how \u2018divine\u2019 you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>She stomped her foot right onto its face. \u201cGet away! What\u2019s with your sudden change of attitude?\u201d Don\u2019t use that word to describe me, hey.</p><br/><p>Sesame immediately crawled back, and continued to hug onto her thigh. \u201cMistress, your kick is so \u2018divine\u2019 too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, the way you\u2019re scolding me is so \u2018divine\u2019 too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you believe that I will smack you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, mistress\u2026\u201d Sesame actually laid on the ground in a shameless manner. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pity me, smack me hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Had Sesame gone crazy? Although it was very shameless in the past as well, there was a limit to how shameless it was. Wake up, hey. You\u2019re very scary this way, alright?</p><br/><p>She still had yet to consider the cause of Sesame\u2019s irregular behaviour, when a few crane cries and the sounds of various animals suddenly resounded outside her home.</p><br/><p>The moment she stepped out of the door, what she saw was a darkened sky, filled with the silhouettes of birds of various kinds. The forest in front of her was suddenly filled with clouds of dust and dirt, and various kinds of small animals were running towards her direction. Even the plants in her courtyard were instantly thrown into excitement, as they began to tweet and chatter loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOooouu\u2026 I suddenly like her very much, what should I do? Although I already like her in the past, I like her even more now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, I really wish she could stroke my leaves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to bloom a flower for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to bear a fruit for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to bear a little tree for her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, among the plants and trees in her courtyard, those which could bloom flowers, bloomed flowers, and those which could bear fruits, bore fruits. There were even some which grew fresh saplings, as though they had suddenly been injected with hormones. Zhu Yao was dumbfounded from this scene.</p><br/><p>Just as the situation in front of her eyes were about to spiral out of control, with quick hands, she immediately tapped on the \u2018Off\u2019 button above her head.</p><br/><p>All of the irregular behaviour finally stopped at this moment. The large crowd of birds circled around the sky for a short while before flying off in separate directions, and the small animals scattered as well. Other than the plants that went amok regardless of the four seasons, and Sesame which was still hugging onto her thigh without letting go.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly felt her head aching, as she finally understood just what this achievement was all about. The so-called \u2018World Favourable Impression\u2019, was truly the world\u2019s favourable impression towards her in the most literal sense. Though this cheat was incredible, it would definitely incite chaos if it was activated. Then what\u2019s the use of it then? And this thing did not seem to be effective on humans.</p><br/><p>And also, this heavy weight on my leg, are you done hugging? Do you believe I will kick you!?</p><br/><p>She immediately cast a water-based art, and drenched a certain beast with cold water.</p><br/><p>Sesame was shocked. Standing up, it looked at her with a pitiful look. \u201cMistress, how can treat beastie this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to you earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarlier?\u201d Sesame was startled, and then it once again thought of coming forward to hug her thigh. \u201cBeastie wants to bear monkeys for mistress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis beastie is speaking the truth real though?\u201d Sesame weakly twiddled with its fingers. \u201cBeastie really, really likes mistress. I like mistress the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like how you first met Yi Ling?\u201d Momma\u2019s egg, Realmspirit couldn\u2019t have gifted her a Mary Sue cheat, right!? (ps: animal and plant based)</p><br/><p>Sesame shook its head. \u201cDifferent, of course it\u2019s different. The feeling mistress gave me just now\u2026\u201d He was in a daze for a moment, and then suddenly, its body shook. It slowly widened its eyes, and said in a slight befuddled tone. \u201cIt was very intimate. Naturally, it also carried an indescribable might and was irresistible, as though it was\u2026 the Heavenly Dao. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Ling\u2019s Mary Sue cheat had yet to be dealt with, and Zhu Yao seemed to have landed herself with a strange cheat herself. She really wanted to ask Realmspirit what was his purpose for gifting her this achievement. The more she thought about it, the more uneasy she felt. In the past, she was toyed badly by him, and nothing he gifted her was good.</p><br/><p>Speaking of this, she suddenly recalled the sidequest. That bugged god\u2019s artifact had turned into her master\u2019s Life Artifact. Then her sidequest was considered complete, right?</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>With a look filled with expectations, she grabbed onto her own chest, only to make contact with a familiar flat surface.</p><br/><p>The hell, what happened to the promised long-lasting cup increase after completing the sidequest?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit, you best come out now!</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a screen of scattering fireworks appeared before her, and a familiar conversation window floated in front of her.</p><br/><p>Sidequest 1 \u2013 Complete.</p><br/><p>Handing out reward\u2026</p><br/><p>Data transfer \u2013 10%\u2026 20%\u2026 30%\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh yeah~~\u2517|\uff40o\u2032|\u251b</p><br/><p>Was he handing out the reward? Zhu Yao was instantly excited. Holding on her chest with her two hands, she stared intensely at the constantly increasing numbers, as she silently chanted:</p><br/><p>Big\u2026 big\u2026 big\u2026 big\u2026</p><br/><p>The numbers in front of her eyes rose with increasing speed.</p><br/><p>80%\u2026 90%\u2026</p><br/><p>And finally!</p><br/><p>100%!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately held her breath, as she focused her entire mind and soul to feel the changes in her chest.</p><br/><p>The conversation window flashed and suddenly released a ray of white light which begun to twist and spiral, forming something similar to a white transfer portal.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026</p><br/><p>With a plop, something fell out.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao reached out her hand to grab it out of reflex. Raising it up to take a look, what she saw was a pair of small pink cloth with a curved design. A small paper tag hanged on the cloth, and written on it were simplified chinese characters: A City\u2019s Pretty Underwear, Size: 70A</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt as though she had received the evil intentions of the world.</p><br/><p>Flips table!</p><br/><p>This lady here wants a cup! Why the hell did you give me a breast cover!? And it\u2019s even A-cup! Do you really think that just by switching the order of the words it\u2019s considered done!?\u00b9 You\u2019re bullying me because of my poor language skills, aren\u2019t you!?</p><br/><p>This lady wants to go on a strike! I\u2019m definitely going on a strike! Realmspirit, just you wait!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was listless for a number of days. When she suddenly felt that her chest was small or something, her entire world turned grey. What Mary Sue? What bug? Hoho! That doesn\u2019t concern me! I\u2019m no longer going to love anymore!</p><br/><p>She was depressed for a good couple of days, until Lin Xiang paid a sudden visit, and informed her that the rumor of the ruins containing treasures was spreading like a wildfire. Presently, the various clans and sects had suddenly gathered at that forest, wanting to force their way through. Furthermore, Blue Parasol Sect was no longer able to sit back, and wanted to head over for a share of the cake.</p><br/><p>The moment Zhu Yao heard this, she was instantly furious.</p><br/><p>The hell, those bunch of greedy beasts! Release my master, take me instead!</p><br/><p>\u00b9Cup Size: , Breast Cover: </p><br/><p>Just by switching the order of the two words makes everything different. :&gt;</p><br/>\n</div>"}

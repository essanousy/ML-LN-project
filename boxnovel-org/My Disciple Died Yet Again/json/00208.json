With a solemn voice, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much spiritual energy in your body, you have to make preparations to form your Azoth Core.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Form her Azoth Core? She was only at the entry-level of Foundation, why must her level be raised in such a forceful manner!? The surrounding thunders roared even louder, and the sword, which was even taller than a mountain, was filled with lightning sparks in an instant, as though it carried a might that could destroy the entire world.</p><br/><p>The lightning spiritual energy in the air grew even richer, carrying a oppressive force that made it hard for people to breathe.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm your inner thoughts, and focus on forming your Azoth Core.\u201d Yu Yan placed down several formations used for stabilizing spiritual energy, and sat next to her. Behind him, an illusory image of a white dragon was summoned. It circled around the two of them, and aided her in restoring her damaged meridians.</p><br/><p>The lightning spiritual energy in Zhu Yao\u2019s body was running wild, to the point where it seemed as though they wanted to break out from her body. Her present character merely possessed the Wood Spirit Vein, so if she wanted to absorb these wild spiritual energy to form her Azoth Core, she would first have to convert the lightning spiritual energy into wood spiritual energy, before guiding them into her Dantian.</p><br/><p>But it was exactly because the lightning spiritual energy had barged in so suddenly, her conversion speed was far behind the rampant speed of the spiritual energy within her body. The moment she converted some into wood spiritual energy, before she could guide them into her Dantian, they would already be dispersed by the rest of the lightning spiritual energy. She could feel the meridians in her entire body were about explode from the abundant lightning spiritual energy, and blood was even constantly trickling down the corner of her lips.</p><br/><p>The hell, did these lightning spiritual energy have some grudge against her? Why were they so uncooperative every single time?</p><br/><p>If this continued, even if her master was aiding her next to her, her meridians would still be destroyed by these rampant lightning spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gritted her teeth. Giving up on her initial plan, she no longer cared about converting them, and instead directly guided lightning spiritual energy into her Dantian.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a heart-wrenching pain spread across her entire body, and Zhu Yao\u2019s entire body began to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d Yu Yan sensed her sudden action as well. Just as he was about to stop her, he was suddenly thrown into a shock. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rampage of the lightning spiritual energy had stopped!</p><br/><p>The moment lightning spiritual energy entered her Dantian, the spiritual energy that had been attacking her meridians had finally settled down. As though they had received some sort of order, they began to smoothly flow into her Dantian.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. He did not try to stop her again, but instead retracted the avatar of his cultivation, and began to seriously watch the changes in his disciple.</p><br/><p>Though, Zhu Yao was not feeling that well off. Though her meridians were now fine, her Dantian was about to explode. Because foreign spiritual energy had intruded in, she was experiencing pain to the point where her senses were shut off. She could only guide them in a mechanical manner. Her Dantian which was initially soft and smooth, began to slowly turn hot and agitated, looking a little like the time when she possessed the Lightning Spirit Vein.</p><br/><p>Could it be that Spirit Veins were convertible?</p><br/><p>This thought suddenly occurred in Zhu Yao\u2019s mind. With the attitude of \u2018treating a dead horse like a live one\u2019, she accelerated the guidance of spiritual energy into her Dantian. Suppressing her heart-wrenching pain, she tried moving the lightning spiritual energy inside. Unexpectedly, there was really a reaction from them. The spiritual energy which had entered her Dantian were obediently circulating under her thoughts.</p><br/><p>She instantly enveloped these spiritual energy around her Dantian, slowly converting them into something she was familiar with. Then, she guided the remaining spiritual energy to envelop the various meridians in her body, forcefully expanding them to absorb the spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, the damage to her meridians was immense, but gradually, the lightning spiritual energy that were enveloping her meridians automatically began to restore her meridians. When the spiritual energy had all been consumed by the Dantian, her meridians were as good as new. And, the lightning spiritual energy that had been giving her a oppressive feeling earlier, turned incredibly intimate in an instant.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan then removed the surrounding formations.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a large amount of lightning spiritual energy, as though they had finally received an order, wildly poured into Zhu Yao\u2019s body. In just a moment, her Dantian which was completely emptied earlier, was filled up once again. This time, when the lightning spiritual energy entered her body, she no longer felt that heart-wrenching pain. Instead, she felt a sense of comfort.</p><br/><p>However, with the increase in spiritual energy, a swelling sensation rose once again. She was very familiar with this sensation, it\u2019s the sign of making a breakthrough in her cultivation. She did not stop either, and continued to guide the spiritual energy into her body. In just a few minutes, a ground-breaking sound could be faintly heard, and her meridians expanded twice their former size.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, her cultivation was rising at a speed visible to the naked eye. From the second level of Foundation, to the third, fourth, fifth\u2026 all the way to the Paragon level. The bottleneck grew even clearer, and the spiritual energy in her entire body was full to the point where they seemed like they could leak out. Finally, the moment where she could form her Azoth Core had arrived. Forming her Azoth Core again was very simple to Zhu Yao. Following the method in her memories, she circulated and condensed the spiritual energy in the same way.</p><br/><p>Just by merely using six hours, her Azoth Core was formed. However, the surge in her cultivation did not stop there. First level of the Azoth stage, second level, third level, fifth level\u2026 and her cultivation finally stopped when she reached the Paragon level of the Azoth stage.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath and stopped guiding spiritual energy into her body, before opening her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Yu Yan responded. Pulling onto his disciple\u2019s hand, he cupped her wrist and checked her pulse. Then, he sent a strand of spiritual energy into her body, and heaved a sigh of relief only after he realized that she was perfectly fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress.\u201d Sesame pounced onto her as well, as it rubbed his snot and tears onto her body. \u201cWonderful, you\u2019re alright! You worried this beastie to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pressed her palm right onto his face, and pushed him back. \u201cGet away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuuu\u2026 Mistress, how can you be this heartless.\u201d It showed a grieved look.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram, search for your four-legged beastie.\u201d This old lady only likes my two-legged Master.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, my Spirit Vein\u2026\u201d She recalled the changes in her body.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan nodded. \u201cYou currently possess the Lightning Spirit Vein.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, she really made the right bet. \u201cMaster, can all Spirit Veins be changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInitially, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d Yu Yan frowned. Spirit Veins were all innately birthed. Although there there were mystical earthen treasures which could wash away one\u2019s Spirit Vein, he had never once heard a Spirit Vein could be changed out of nowhere. \u201cMost likely, because you have always been familiar with the Lightning Spirit Vein, you were barely able to pull this off. It might not be possible for anyone else.\u201d His own disciple seemed to always discover things which no one else would know, was this good or bad?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered deeply for a moment. Indeed, earlier, she was just following her memories when guiding the lightning spiritual energy to convert her meridians and Dantian. If it had not been lightning spiritual energy which she was drawing in, she would most likely already turn into minced meat.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan then asked about the current situation. Zhu Yao clearly informed him about her encounter with the Risefire Beast, her fall into these ruins, and then her encounter with Sesame.</p><br/><p>Just when the two of them were deep into their conversations, no one noticed that the mountain-tall sword behind them had suddenly stopped its thundering cry, as it gradually rose upwards. Suddenly, its blade straightened itself, and flew towards their direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s heart clenched. He carried his disciple and was just about to dodge, but was a step too late. In a blink of an eye, that sword turned into a ray of white light, and flew right into Yu Yan\u2019s forehead. Zhu Yao merely saw the after-images in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s heart tightened, as she tugged onto her master. She felt as though her heart was about to burst out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster. Master\u2026\u201d She once again felt that sense of fear and anxiety. That feeling as though the sky itself had collapsed when she found out about little wimp\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>Nothing, nothing must happen to you!</p><br/><p>Yu Yan gently lowered his head, his face looked a little dazed. \u201cYu Yao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you feeling? Are you hurting anywhere?\u201d She checked his body in a fluster. The only thing left now was to pull his clothes apart and check if he\u2019s injured under them?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he possibly be fine? She clearly saw that sword turn into a flowing light and pierce right through his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao\u2026\u201d He stroked his disciple\u2019s head, and pondered for a moment. He then pulled her into his embrace, feeling a little astonished that his disciple who had always been unafraid of even death itself, was actually trembling. \u201cTrust your master, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao finally calmed down, and her senses began to return. \u201cThat, earlier\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She turned around to take a look. The giant sword that was still floating in the air earlier had already disappeared. Even the rich amount of lightning spiritual energy in the air had disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned, as he looked at his own palm dazedly. A moment later, he spoke up with a hint of curiosity. \u201cYu Yao, your master\u2019s cultivation, seemed to have recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d What did he mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cI recovered my former cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re currently?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA Demigod.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d That\u2019s too quick!</p><br/><p>\u201cNot just that.\u201d Yu Yan reached out his hand, and opened his palm in front of her. A white light flashed, and suddenly, a small sword enveloped in sparks of lightning appeared in his hand.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes suddenly widened. \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Wasn\u2019t this that sword which was a huge as a mountain? Why was it here? And it turned into such a miniature size. Even the word \u2018bug\u2019 had disappeared from its blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m unclear of the reasons.\u201d Yu Yan frowned, and explained. \u201cEarlier, this object flew directly into my divine sense, and stayed within it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour divine sense, then isn\u2019t that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan nodded. \u201cIt had become my Life Artifact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Weren\u2019t it said that Life Artifacts had to be nourished in the divine sense when one reached the Azoth stage? Master, is it really alright to suddenly to take in a foreign sword? Will you suffer from indigestion, hey?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Spirit Vein has converted as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cI recovered my former Lightning Spirit Vein.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d He nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d -Flips table- Why did she had to suffer from such tormenting pain to convert her Spirit Vein, while her master could recover his cultivation with such ease?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could sense all of the evil intentions that filled this world.</p><br/><p>The amount of shocks she received today were one too many, Zhu Yao felt that it was about time she returned for a rest. However, she recalled that her master\u2019s cultivation had been recovered and Sesame had returned. With two weapons of mass destruction by her side, no matter how incredible that Beast King was, they could bully him with numbers- ah pui, they would still have the advantage in numbers, so they would obtain a smooth victory.</p><br/><p>She suddenly had the urge to find trouble in the demonic beasts\u2019 territory, what to do? \u2517|\uff40o\u2032|\u251b</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao, I can\u2019t return with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. Kajima!\u00b9 Your disciple still need you to bully people!</p><br/><p>Yu Yan sighed, as he stroked his stupid disciple\u2019s head. \u201cThat sword, has recovered your master\u2019s cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d Didn\u2019t you say that earlier? \u201cIsn\u2019t that better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan shook his head, revealing a look that seemed as though he was disappointed in his disciple\u2019s intelligence. Reaching out his hand to carry his disciple, he planned to demonstrate it to her first-hand.</p><br/><p>In a flash, the two of them had already left the underground ruins, and returned to the forest.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not even react at all. Just what was he trying to prove by doing this?</p><br/><p>The entire sky suddenly darkened, as layers of tribulation clouds instantly filled the entire sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lightning Tribulation of Ascension.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Why were they here?</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao, I recovered my cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that, you already said that thrice\u2026\u201d Wait a minute, he couldn\u2019t have\u2026 \u201cYou recovered your cultivation as a High Deity!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe laws of the Heavenly Dao is restraining my cultivation, so I\u2019m presently a Demigod. But, I\u2019m after all a High Deity. There\u2019s an ancient formation based on the law of evasion within that mustard seed dimensional space earlier, so I wasn\u2019t found out. If I were to head outside\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his head to look towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao followed his gaze and looked towards the clouds as well, only to see the sky turning pure white in an instant, as a bolt of tribulation lightning flashed in the sky.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan released her. \u201cI will be forced by the Heavenly Dao, and I will have to ascend into the Higher Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, intense heavenly lightning bolts descended in Yu Yan\u2019s direction. Carrying sky-filled might, with a boom\u2026</p><br/><p>They struck Zhu Yao!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao who instantly turned charred black from the zap, puked out a mouthful of black smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, can I discuss something with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen lightning strikes next time, don\u2019t pull me over to spectate it, can you do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Would it kill you to not troll your disciple!?</p><br/><p>In order to prevent himself from ascending, her master had no choice but to stay behind in that mustard seed dimensional space where that God\u2019s Artifact was stored. Zhu Yao had thought that once her master recovered his cultivation, she could walk around with her head held high. She didn\u2019t expect that it was basically all for naught.</p><br/><p>This setting where he had to ascend the moment if he were to head out, was simply beyond sad, alright? If she had known, she would have rather he stayed at the Azoth-stage!</p><br/><p>After all that, she still had to clear the bug on her own.</p><br/><p>Her heart ached\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, someone is coming.\u201d Sesame nudged Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Oh, right, she still had a beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we have to find her.\u201d A somewhat familiar voice sounded from afar.</p><br/><p>Only to see five figures walking over from afar. Three men and two women, they were exactly Yi Ling\u2019s bunch. However, other than the four people she recognized, there was a man who was foreign to her. Similarly, he was of the Azoth-stage. With a divinely handsome look, the might of someone in a high-standing position could be seen from between his brows, and presently, he was looking at Yi Ling with an infatuated look.</p><br/><p>Did her harem grow again?</p><br/><p>As expected of Mary Sue, pulling in rich handsome men from everywhere.</p><br/><p>They seemed to be still in conflict about something.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Lin Xiang.\u201d Qi Ping stepped forward and spoke to Lin Xiang. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we are unwilling, but we have already searched for two days, yet we have yet to see her figure. Furthermore, the dungeon underground has a complicated terrain filled with mechanisms and traps. Searching any longer will just be a waste of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, senior-martial sister Lin.\u201d Yi Ling gently said. \u201cI\u2019m also anxious about senior-martial sister Zhu\u2019s disappearance, but\u2026 senior-martial brother Qi\u2019s injuries are not completely healed yet. How can you just care only about your own wishes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy own wishes?\u201d Lin Xiang laughed out from anger. \u201cYi Ling, you must be blind, right? If not because she had lured away that demonic beast, do you think you people can still be standing here unscathed? Now that she has disappeared, you people are not even willing to search for her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Lin\u2026\u201d Yi Ling\u2019s eyes reddened, looking as though she was about to cry from being wronged. \u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way. It\u2019s just that we have searched for long\u2026 Also, if she had told us earlier that it was a sixth-ranked demonic beast, we wouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Lin Xiang was instantly enraged. \u201cDidn\u2019t she tell us? You simply didn\u2019t believe her. Furthermore, she saved you, saved all of us, yet you actually dare say such words. Where the hell is your conscience?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Lin\u2026\u201d Tears began to drip down from Yi Ling\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The three men present on site instantly showed a heart-ached expression. \u201cEnough, junior-martial sister Lin. This isn\u2019t Ling\u2019er\u2019s fault either.\u201d Lan Qi glared at Lin Xiang a little angrily.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiang scanned her eyes at the three people, and snorted. \u201cIf you people aren\u2019t going to search, I will search for her myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was all to search for her!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gave Lin Xiang a thumbs up. Such righteousness! It seemed like there weren\u2019t just a morons and Mary Sue in this world. There were still people who possessed normal three views.</p><br/><p>She was a little pleased. Just as she was planning to step forward, suddenly, Sesame who had been standing next to her, muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s actually a woman who possess such otherworldly beauty in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tripped.</p><br/><p>With a plop, she fell flat on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u00b9Kajima [\uac00\uc790\ub9c8]: is Korean for \u2018don\u2019t go\u2019. The author was probably in a Korean drama phase while writing this. *coughs*</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although he was still pressed onto the ground, he struggled out a reply. \u201cYan\u2019er\u2019s name is Mu Meiyan, and is the eldest disciple of Azure Melancholy Sect, which Azureflight Sect was formerly known as. Back then, she was chased after by heretic practitioners, and finally managed to return to the Sect after a narrow escape from death. She\u2019s not the person from Celestial Indus Sect you mentioned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zhu Yao coldly laughed. Earlier, when she heard Wu Song call her Yan\u2019er, she had already guessed that Mu Meiyan did not use the former identity of the girl she had taken over. However, she never expected that she was actually expelled from the Celestial Indus Sect. It seemed like in these thousand years, her battle with Yue Hanxin had been really intense, huh. And, she was even in a disadvantageous position. \u201cIn regards to whether it\u2019s true or false, why don\u2019t we invite the Sect Master of Celestial Indus Sect over? We will know the truth then. I think that our Ancient Hill Sect still hold enough reputation to invite him over.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Mu Meiyan\u2019s expression instantly paled. A glow flashed in her eyes, as she immediately interrupted. \u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan\u2019er?\u201d Even Wu Song had guessed that this could be true, and his face was filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>Mu Meiyan gritted her teeth. Naturally, she herself was very clear of who she actually was. However, currently, her body was indeed Rulu\u2019s. This was a fact which she could not deny.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, she kept all of her emotions, turned her head and glanced at Wu Song. In an instant, tears began to fall, and her face was filled with endless innocence and sadness. \u201cBig brother Wu Song, I\u2019m sorry. In the past, I\u2019m indeed called Rulu. But, I have never done anything like what the rumors have said. I was framed for them. Please believe me. Little sister Meiyan and I have known each other since we were young, and we\u2019re as close as real sisters. You have all mistaken me as her\u2026 I\u2026 I simply wanted to do something for the deceased Meiyan as well, so I have never denied it. For so many years, have I ever done anything to upset you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words were very skilfully crafted. Firstly, she overthrew the rumors of her being a traitor of Celestial Indus Sect. And, in the past, Azure Melancholy Sect and Celestial Indus Sect were indeed related to a certain degree. She knowing Mu Meiyan, the former eldest disciple of Azure Melancholy Sect, was thus something she could use. Then, she expressed that she was actually doing good deeds for her good sister\u2019s sake. Hence, she had gained a complete upper hand in terms of sentiments and virtue.</p><br/><p>As expected, the moment she said those words, Wu Song\u2019s heart immediately softened. With a pained face, he looked towards her.</p><br/><p>The hell, this green tea bitch.</p><br/><p>Wanting to make a turn-over? That would still depend if Zhu Yao was willing to give her the chance. Although she had that almighty shadow as her cheat, currently, Zhu Yao did not see the appearance of the shadow. She could guarantee that shadow was currently not here. It had most probably suffered heavy injuries from the scroll and was unable to reveal itself. Hence, Mu Meiyan had been in such a terrible state in these few years, and was even chased out of Celestial Indus Sect. However, Zhu Yao had never expected that she would hook onto Wu Song.</p><br/><p>Recalling the entanglement between Wu Song and Mu Meiyan in her dreams, Zhu Yao felt completely frustrated. Could it be that it was impossible to alter the scenario? Even without her saving him in the past, could it be that Wu Song would still come to love Mu Meiyan?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Wu Song, please believe me.\u201d Mu Meiyan was still trying to garner Wu Song\u2019s trust with all her might. She was no longer compatible with Yue Hanxin, and currently, only Azureflight was her safest haven. She definitely could not let it go.</p><br/><p>Glancing at Zhu Yao at the side, she could not help but secretly hate her in the depths of her heart. She had long known that this person was her biggest obstacle, hence she attacked Zhu Yao preemptively. She had sent the \u201cPhantom\u201d to kill her, however, she never expected her to be this hard to kill.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan\u2019er\u2026\u201d Actually, Wu Song\u2019s heart had already softened. He would definitely even break decorum with Ancient Hill Sect for her. It could be seen that he was really sincere towards her. \u201cI believe you. Of course I believe you. Don\u2019t worry, I will definitely protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When his words fell, the faces of the few Radishes at the back instantly darkened a little, and they even secretly cast awkward expressions at Zhu Yao. Let\u2019s first put aside the question of whether her words were true, just by her identity as a traitor of Celestial Indus Sect alone would bring about a huge trouble for Azureflight Sect. Azureflight Sect possessed a Great Mountain Barrier Formation protected by countless high-ranked demonic beasts. Currently, it\u2019s being titled the strongest Great Mountain Barrier Formation of the cultivation world. They were not afraid of other Sects assaulting them, however, there would still be a degree of influence to their reputation.</p><br/><p>Recalling that Great Mountain Barrier Formation, the Radishes present could not help but glance at Zhu Yao. No one else knew, but they knew it all too clearly. That exact formation was something she had laid down herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign.\u201d Wu Song pulled Rulu to her feet. Although Zhu Yao had already retracted her pressure, he was still feeling a little guilty towards this Sovereign. Though, he did not think there was anything wrong with choosing his true love. \u201cThe reason why we\u2019re here today, is to simply cancel my engagement with Miss Yu Luo. I\u2019m indeed the one at fault, so I will do my utmost to provide compensation for her.\u201d Wu Song took out a storage pouch, and handed it to Yu Luo. \u201cI believe these can compensate you a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompensation?\u201d Yu Luo was already trembling. With a pained expression, she looked at his face. \u201cWu Song, what are you treating me as?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Luo\u2026\u201d Wu Song\u2019s hand trembled. He did not have the intention to shame her, but his action had essentially revealed this point. After all, Yu Luo had stayed by his side for so many years, so he would still harbor some feelings for her. Looking at her saddened expression, his heart could not help but start to ache as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Wu.\u201d Mu Meiyan called out.</p><br/><p>Only then did Wu Song resolve himself, and place the storage pouch at the side. \u201cNo matter what, our engagement shall end here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEngagement? When has my disciple ever had an engagement with you?\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but speak up, and laugh coldly.</p><br/><p>Wu Song blanked, as though he did not know why she would ask such a question?</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master Wu. You have never come to my Jade Forest Mountain for her hand in marriage, so when did this matter about an engagement come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 asked Sect Master Zi Mo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao interrupted instantly. \u201cYu Luo is my personal succeeding disciple. In regards to the rules of the cultivation world, as a Sect Master, you shouldn\u2019t be unaware of it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Wu Song\u2019s words were stuck in his throat. Indeed, according to the rules of the cultivation world, since Yu Luo was her personal succeeding disciple, thus she should have the last say in everything in the first place, especially when it came to a great matter like practitioner-pair companionship.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have never come to ask for her hand in marriage, and I have never agreed to it, where does this talk about cancelling an engagement come from?\u201d He was the one who cheated on Yu Luo, yet he still wanted her to shoulder a part of the blame? How could there be such a favorable situation in the world? \u201cCould it be that Sect Master Wu wishes to act out a complete scenario of asking her hand in marriage now and cancelling the engagement right after? Heh! Sect Master Wu, from the way you\u2019re trying to play a fool out of me in such a willful manner, what kind of place do you take my Jade Forest Mountain for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean it that way?\u201d Wu Song started to become anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cSover\u2026\u201d Mu Meiyan seemed as though she wanted to say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Zhu Yao, however, instantly attacked her with her pressure. \u201cWho do you think you are? Do you think you have a say here?\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of blood had already appeared from the corner of Mu Meiyan\u2019s lips from her attack. Although Wu Song was worried, he did not say anything about it, and simply tried to explain with everything he could think of. \u201cSovereign, you did not return for so many years. I simply thought\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you think.\u201d Zhu Yao immediately interrupted his words. Picking up that storage pouch from the table, with a frown, she tossed it back. \u201cTake away your belongings. I don\u2019t agree to this engagement. The successor of Jade Forest Mountain cannot be afforded by just anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Wu Song thus had a flea in his ear. Initially, he had come to cancel his engagement, yet, the entire situation had been overturned by Zhu Yao, causing his proposal to be rejected instead. He was thus hugely embarrassed for nothing, and for a moment, his expression was ugly to see as well. But in the end, the person in front of him was his benefactor. And he had indeed done something dishonorable while she wasn\u2019t here. Hence, he did not rebut her. Instead, he simply bowed depressingly and turned to leave.</p><br/><p>As for Radish Number One to Four, they gave Zhu Yao a huge bow as well. Though, their feelings were still rather complicated. Although Wu Song was already the Sect Master, and was recognized by them as well, Zhu Yao was after all, still the founder of Azureflight. Back then when she was missing, the situation was still manageable. However, now that she had suddenly appeared again, their standing had instantly turned awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHalt.\u201d Right before they left, they were once again stopped by Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Wu Song and the rest paused their steps, and turned their heads around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a matter I wish to consult the Sect Master of Azureflight Sect.\u201d She purposefully emphasized the two words \u2018Sect Master\u2019, and with a tone which could not be determined if she was joking or not, she spoke. \u201cI wonder if this esteemed Sect has any plans of changing its name to Azure Melancholy Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words fell, not only Wu Song\u2019s, even the faces of the few Little Radishes at the side, had turned a little ugly.</p><br/><p>Earlier, Wu Song had explicitly said that she was saved because Mu Meiyan was the eldest disciple of the former Sect Master. And after finding out her true identity, once again, with the identity of the friend of the former eldest disciple, he continued to cover for her. However, he had forgotten a single point. Right now, they were a part of Azureflight Sect, and not the former Azure Melancholy Sect.</p><br/><p>So how could his excuse possibly work?</p><br/><p>In regards to the fact that Mu Meiyan was the eldest disciple of Azure Melancholy Sect, actually, Zhu Yao had already faintly guessed it. In the past, she did not especially recall that precognitive dream of hers, after all, ever since she had taken Yu Luo as her disciple, the entire scenario had already been distanced away from the original timeline.</p><br/><p>And, back then when she saved those eighty-two little radishes, she simply felt that the name \u2018Azure Melancholy Sect\u2019 sounded a little familiar. However, she had never expected that Azure Melancholy Sect was actually the resurrected female antagonist\u2019s former home, which was exterminated in her past life. She only recalled this matter all of a sudden when she saw Mu Meiyan by Wu Song\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>In the female antagonist\u2019s previous life, her home was exterminated, and thus, she sought refuge in Celestial Indus Sect, and was taken under Qi Han\u2019s tutelage. And when she resurrected, and returned to the past, because of the laws of time and space, two people with the same soul could not exist in the same timeline. Hence, in this timeline, she had actually died while escaping.</p><br/><p>While she, who had already cultivated to Nascent Soul in her past life, thus gained the opportunity to take over and possess someone else.</p><br/><p>In actuality, back when she saved those little radishes, she had wondered why there were only low-grade disciples whose Spirit Veins were only so-so among them, while there wasn\u2019t even a single elite disciple to be seen.</p><br/><p>When she looked at it now, she realized it wasn\u2019t because this small Sect had no elite disciples, rather, all those elite disciples, including Mu Meiyan, had already escaped long before. The little radishes she had saved were actually just sacrifices for the Sect, and they were simply waiting for their deaths in the seal. Back then, she had thought that this Sect was rather humane, but looking at them now, they were sure as selfish as ever.</p><br/><p>Most probably because that shadow had suffered heavy injuries in the scroll, in these thousand years, it did not provide her that much aid, and hence, she was forced to leave Celestial Indus Sect. Most probably, she had simply followed her memories, and wanted to return to the former destroyed Azure Melancholy Sect, only to find out that her own Sect still existed.</p><br/><p>And the reason why Mu Meiyan stayed, was because the current Azureflight possessed the Great Mountain Barrier Formation maintained those several high-ranked demonic beasts, which could protect her from being discovered by Celestial Indus Sect. Hence, she stayed in the Sect using her former identity, Mu Meiyan.</p><br/><p>Actually, if she had simply stayed in Azureflight Sect, Zhu Yao wouldn\u2019t have said anything about it. After all, that place was once her home. However, she shouldn\u2019t ever have messed with the relationship between Wu Song and Yu Luo.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

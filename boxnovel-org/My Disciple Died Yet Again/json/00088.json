What did he mean? Speak clearly, hey.</p><br/><p>Just when she was about to ask for a clarification, right after the cawing at the Main Mountain, the continuous cries of various demonic beasts sounded from the entire Ancient Hill Sect. Even some of the celestial cranes in Jade Forest Mountain were emitting that same sorrowful cry.</p><br/><p>She wondered if it was because she had turned to a beast as well, as the depths of her heart began to feel stifling. And, it was even worsening, it was hurting so much she could not even let out her voice. Yet, she completely could not think of the reason why she was feeling this way.</p><br/><p>Really? What\u2019s wrong with her?</p><br/><p>This feeling lasted for an entire day, and she simply sat on the stone table in her master\u2019s courtyard, hearing the cries of the various demonic beasts for an entire day. And she only managed to regain her senses when the sun set.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao regained her senses, she wondered if it was because she did not take her medicine, as she actually sat like this for an entire day. Her master seemed to have left quite some time ago, and even Sesame had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently retorted this master of hers, who had a secret crush on her, but was completely oblivious of it. He actually left her (it) there just like that, it was no wonder he was still single after ten thousand years. After pondering for a moment, she decided to return to the house and wait for her master. First, she had to restore her human form.</p><br/><p>Sesame said she was currently a Demigod, so she was equal to a tenth-ranked demonic beast. The race of dragons had already disappeared from the world for a very long time, so she was unclear if they had an innate transformation ability, but tenth-ranked demonic beasts were all capable of transforming.</p><br/><p>Just as she crawled up from the table, she saw a little head suddenly popping out from the bushes outside the courtyard. She was looking around, as though she was looking for something. Wearing a small white coat, from the looks of it, she seemed to be a four or five year old little brat.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt it was a little strange. It was very rare for Jade Forest Mountain to have outsiders, and even if the Sect Master had some matters for Yu Yan, he would only dispatch inner chamber disciples to send the message. Just where did this little pudding come from? And looking at how she was being so sneaky, evidently, she did not have any experience in doing bad things. Otherwise, why would she be wearing white in the middle of the night? Wasn\u2019t she clearly telling others that she was hiding there?</p><br/><p>At this moment, the little devil in Zhu Yao\u2019s heart had raised its trident, and with a leap, she flew.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, she had just remembered that dragons could fly.</p><br/><p>Flying back to the house, she lighted up the oil lamp, before flying towards that little pudding.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The child who had just crawled out from the bushes, was startled by her. She instantly stuffed her little head back into the bushes, and her little figure began to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cBao Bao admits her mistake, Grandmaster, please do not punish me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She had yet to say anything, was it really alright for her to be frightened to this extent? Zhu Yao\u2019s heart instantly softened a little, and she no longer held the intention to scare her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle friend, it\u2019s already so late in the night. Why did you run to this Jade Forest Mountain for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little buttocks that were exposed outside moved, after twisting about a few times, she once again popped her head out. After looking around, she realized a long snake-like creature was currently floating and coiling around above the oil lamp in front of her. At that moment, she heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t him. You scared me. Little worm, are you a demonic beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re the little worm, your entire family is made up of little worms!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle friend. Why are you here in Jade Forest Mountain? What are you here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be living here sooner or later anyway.\u201d The little girl tilted her head, and said while blinking her eyes.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhu Yao felt her heart going \u201cbadump\u201d. \u201cWhere do you live? Here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI live there!\u201d The little girl pointed to the straw cottage at the other side, but after pondering for a moment, she added. \u201cBut father and mother said that I\u2019m still young, and forbid me from living there. When I\u2019m older, I\u2019ll be living there every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle friend, it\u2019s bad to tell lies, you know.\u201d That straw cottage was clearly her own residence, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cBao Bao has never told lies.\u201d The little girl instantly made a goldfish-face, as she protested angrily. \u201cI\u2019m really living over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression sank, as a guess surfaced in the depths of her heart. And she did not like this guess at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle friend, you can\u2019t be a disciple of Jade Forest Mountain, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d The little girl nodded her head strongly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, however, felt extremely uncomfortable, as she felt her heart began to ache. So her master had taken in another disciple, and it was not her, but another person.</p><br/><p>Master, you can\u2019t be a lolicon, right?</p><br/><p>After pondering for a moment, she became very sure of this thought. For someone as incredible as her master, how could he just take in a single disciple? Look at the rest of the Mountain Lords, just counting the inner chamber disciples alone, there were dozens of them. Even the three Demigod Sovereigns had taken in a couple of disciples when they were at the Nascent Soul stage. It\u2019s just that they had simply fallen much earlier.</p><br/><p>It was completely understandable for her master to take in another disciple.</p><br/><p>However, even though this was understandable, why was she feeling so irritated by it? Understanding it was one thing, but accepting it was another matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did your master take you in as a disciple?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>The little girl was startled, and then, she lowered her head and began to count using her fingers. \u201cOne day\u2026 Two days\u2026 Three days\u2026 It\u2019s been many days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed, and at that moment, she no longer have the mood to tease her. \u201cOh well, I will send you back then. In a few days, I will introduce your senior-martial sister to you.\u201d She had to change back to her human form first.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister?\u201d The little girl was dumbfounded for a moment. Suddenly, her eyes reddened, and she looked at Zhu Yao with an accusing look. \u201cYou liar. My father said this before, that master only has a single disciple, and that\u2019s me. I\u2019m the only one. Bao Bao doesn\u2019t have other senior-martial sisters. You\u2019re a bad person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. Little brat, don\u2019t go overboard, I\u2019m already giving you half of my master, why are you crying? I\u2019m the one who wants to cry!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying to you, you indeed have a senior-martial sister.\u201d It was her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuuuu\u2026\u201d The little girl finally could not hold it in any longer, and water beads began to fall, as she stared ruthlessly at Zhu Yao. \u201cI don\u2019t care, master only needs me as a disciple! When master comes back, I will tell master, that I don\u2019t want a senior-martial sister! I don\u2019t want one!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she kicked her feet off the ground, and ran. Sprinkling little beads of water along the way.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Momma\u2019s egg, she really did not want a junior-martial sister now.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart was boiling with rage, this sudden appearance of a little junior-martial sister made her feel like scratching her master\u2019s ice-cold face. She hadn\u2019t been here for just a few days, and her master had already brought back a little junior-martial sister. Didn\u2019t he know that in every novel\u2019s settings, little junior-martial sisters were always used to develop adultery plot lines?</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to be someone else\u2019s senior-martial sister, she simply wished to become someone else\u2019s master-aunt, dammit!</p><br/><p>Oh right, wasn\u2019t there still this master-aunt setting?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly found a bit of consolation. Lowing her head, she once again looked at that long body of hers, and suddenly, all her anger dampened.</p><br/><p>On the morning of the second day, the moment Yu Yan returned to the house, he was pestered by his stupid disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I want to restore my human form, I want to restore my human form! Roar~~ \u2517|\uff40o\u2032|\u251b\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan lifted his hand, and made it convenient for his stupid disciple to crawl onto his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour current situation is unclear, it\u2019s inappropriate for you to restore your spiritual energy too quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m slow, it will be too late.\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at him with an inconvenienced look. Who could be sure that he wouldn\u2019t bring back a few more little junior-martial sisters, or little, little junior-martial sisters, or even little, little, little junior martial sisters.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s possible for Lord to restore your spiritual energy now.\u201d Sesame suddenly popped out, shrank itself to about Zhu Yao\u2019s size, and looked at the dragon-formed Zhu Yao with sparkling eyes. With a single leap, it jumped onto the stone table. Then, it bounced about, as though it was trying to crawl onto Yu Yan\u2019s shoulder as well, in order to approach Zhu Yao. However, with a single stare by Yu Yan, it was stopped from doing so.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord is of the dragon-race.\u201d Sesame said with an envious look. \u201cThe bodies of dragons are innately strong and sturdy, and even if a problem were to occur during the advancement process, their bodies can completely endure it.\u201d</p><br/><p>So the dragon-race had such a benefit as well. Zhu Yao instantly looked at her master with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>Help me, help me, help me!</p><br/><p>Yu Yan sighed. After pondering for a moment, he agreed. Bringing his disciple back to the bottom of the cold training lake, he renewed the reinforcement of the formation under the lake, casually threw Sesame out, and then, took out a few purple lightning bolts.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can first try absorbing a part of the lightning spiritual energy. If you experience any anomaly, do not force yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded, closed her eyes, and began sensing the lightning spiritual energy. The moment she willed it, she felt a warm streamflow passing through the depths of her heart. There was now an additional strand of familiar spiritual energy, however, the amount of spiritual energy was pitifully small. It had only stayed in the Dantian for a short while, before disappearing completely.</p><br/><p>While that purple lightning bolt which her master had taken out, had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, the spiritual energy, disappeared.\u201d Zhu Yao a little stunned. Dumbfoundedly, she raised her head. This sort of situation had never happened before, in the past, when she absorbed spiritual energy, they would always stay inside her body. However, the moment she absorbed them this time, they actually disappeared in a flash.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. \u201cYour Dantian is unable to store spiritual energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression instantly turned exceptionally ugly. If her Dantian could not store spiritual energy, it was clearly a sign where her Spiritual Vein was destroyed. However, she could clearly still absorb the lightning spiritual energy, and her cultivation was at the Demigod-stage as well. So, why?</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than not being able to store spiritual energy, are there any anomalies with your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao focused and sensed for a moment. \u201cNo!\u201d Other than being a little hungry, there was no other problem she was aware of.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry again!\u201d Yu Yan said.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao obediently closed her eyes again. The bolt of lightning outside, was instantly absorbed by her. However, just like before, the moment that strand of spiritual energy entered her body, it instantly disappeared without a trace. Zhu Yao felt like crying. Could it be that she had to be a finger-sized dragon her entire life?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was unable to come up with the reason as well. In the beginning, he was worried that, since she had just entered the Demigod-stage, if she was unable to stop taking in spiritual energy, it might bring about a spiritual energy outbreak. It was better this way, she wasn\u2019t even able to store her spiritual energy, let alone cause a spiritual energy outbreak.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s return first.\u201d Yu Yan opened his palm, hinting her to crawl onto his own palm. \u201cYour master will think of another way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao glanced at his palm, she didn\u2019t why, but she once again recalled that little junior-martial sister she saw last night, and the depth of her heart was flooded with sorrow. Currently, she did not have a human form, and there wasn\u2019t hope for her to restore her cultivation either. As expected, it would save some worry for her master if he were to look for another disciple.</p><br/><p>She knew that she was partly the blame for it, but she just could not control herself. She needed to calm down for a while.</p><br/><p>Hence, she did not climb onto his palm, instead, she turned her head away and moved her claws to the side, as she began to crawl back the route they came from on her own.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was startled for a moment. He did not say anything, and silently followed her at the back.</p><br/><p>The further Zhu Yao crawled, the sadder she became. Probably because her mood was terrible recently in the first place, at this moment, she was especially sad.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

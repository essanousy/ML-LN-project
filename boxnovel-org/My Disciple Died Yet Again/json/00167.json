Fluorescent Wind Sect was destroyed. A former flourishing celestial mountain with blessed lands, had turned into scorched earth. Beautifully designed structures were destroyed and ruined, and a burnt smell permeated in the surrounding air. I\u2019m sorry, cheap mother, I have prodigal habits.</p><br/><p>The more important point was, she suddenly recalled the the ending in her precognitive dream. It seemed like due to Mo Xianxian and Xu Nuoyan destroying half of Fluorescent Wind Sect, it brought about the phoenixes, which then proceeded to raze the Divine Realm completely into the ground. However, she had now destroyed the Fluorescent Wind Sect much sooner than predicted.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>She seemed to have smashed this event. I wonder if an apology works?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao weakly turned around. \u201cLet me ask you a very stern and serious question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d Yu Yan turned to face her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf\u2026 I\u2019m saying if, alright? If we have to fight against God-beasts, more specifically, phoenixes, what\u2019s the chances of victory?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGods?\u201d Yu Yan frowned. Although he did not know why his stupid disciple would ask something like this, he still replied sternly, and seriously. \u201cNo chances of victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Police officer, please, listen to my explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin\u2019er!\u201d Sect Master Yin Shi, who finally realized she had thrown aside something, had returned. While she was still on her sword, she had already pounced towards Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>At the moment she was about to come into contact with her, Yu Yan, while hugging his disciple, shifted, and in a flash, they had appeared a few dozen meters away. Yu Yan\u2019s brows furrowed. Where did this human trafficker coming to steal his disciple pop out from? A moment later, a cold aura began to spread from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Yin Shi was shocked at the other party\u2019s level of cultivation. However, worrying about the safety of her own daughter, she coldly said. \u201cRelease her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold aura emitting from Yu Yan\u2019s body became denser. He was not the type to have a good talk in the first place. Now, there\u2019s actually someone else trying to steal his disciple away from him, this sure was a serious matter. With a wave of his hand, he was about to summon a bolt of heavenly lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Zhu Yao leapt out in time, and hugged onto his hand which was about to cast an art. I\u2019m already unfortunate enough today, could the rest of you please stop making it worse? \u201cShe\u2019s my mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan blanked. He looked at her a little strangely, then turned to look at Yin Shi, before turning to look right back at Zhu Yao. You have a mother?</p><br/><p>Hey, hey ,hey! What\u2019s with those eyes of yours? Who doesn\u2019t have a mother of her own?</p><br/><p>\u201cXin\u2019er, come here quickly.\u201d Yin Shi worriedly shouted out, and she began to feel even more worried in her heart. Looking at this situation, it seemed that the person who was facing the tribulation earlier was this man. \u201cThis person came to our Fluorescent Wind Sect to face his tribulation on purpose, bringing the tribulation lightning bolts along with him. Who knows what ulterior motives he may have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Mother, this is a misunderstanding.\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. Looking at situation earlier, the tribulation lightning bolts seemed to be\u2026 as though\u2026 alright, they were definitely charging right for her. Her master was clearly chasing the tribulation lightning bolts from behind. Heaving a sigh, she nudged a little, motioning to her master to release her. Yu Yan tightly knitted his eyebrows, and only released her a while later.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao said as she walked over. \u201cMother, this is\u2026 my master whom I had just admitted under tutelage to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just? Yu Yan turned his head, and the layer of frost on his face thickened a little.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao trembled. A unique situation calls for unique measures.</p><br/><p>Yin Shi pulled her daughter over and inspected her from head to toe. Only then did she drop her guard a little. \u201cXin\u2019er, how are you? Are you hurt anywhere? Child, why are you so muddle-headed? With such an intense lightning tribulation brewing over us, why did you still stay here?\u201d</p><br/><p>But she would have to be able to run away first, right? Why didn\u2019t you give her a transportation tool to use then?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s admitting under a master\u2019s tutelage, you have to discuss it with mother first, right?\u201d Yin Shi had already guessed that he was definitely the master her daughter spoke of, who had protected her during the lightning tribulation, which resulted to her being unscathed. Hence, the anger she had earlier had dissipated, and she bowed towards Yu Yan. \u201cThank you, High Deity, for saving my daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not reply, instead, he simply nodded. Seeing that she was still holding onto his own disciple without letting her go, his heart was filled with dissatisfaction. With his arms working faster than his brain, he instantly pulled his stupid disciple back to his side. Mn, satisfied!</p><br/><p>Then, taking this opportunity, he sent a strand of divine sense towards her, allowing the mark on his disciple\u2019s forehead to reveal itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cA personal succeeding imprint!\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of the mark on her own daughter\u2019s forehead, Yin Shi was startled. She had no objections to her daughter going under a master\u2019s tutelage. After all, her daughter had only just woken up, and did not have any foundation. An additional High Deity as her was master could be considered as another form of guarantee. However, her daughter had never cultivated since young, and even if she possessed a divine body due to being deity-born, she was still not really sure of her aptitude. To accept her as his personal succeeding disciple just like that, wasn\u2019t it too hasty? \u201cI wonder which continent High Deity comes from, and how I should address you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan tightly cupped onto his stupid disciple\u2019s wrist. He recalled that when his disciple took the first tribulation lightning bolt earlier, her meridians were injured. Although it wasn\u2019t very serious, he still inserted a strand of divine energy into her, wanting to restore her meridians. Hence, he answered a little unmindfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning Divine Hall, Yu Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d This time, Yin Shi was really startled. \u201cLightning Divine Hall? Is\u2026 Is it that Lightning Divine Hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Yu Yan finally placed his line of sight onto Yu Shi, and then, with the same extremely cold tone, he asked. \u201cAre there two Lightning Divine Halls in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he swept a glance at Zhu Yao. It was already enough for his disciple to be stupid, why was her mother too\u2026</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Hey, hey, hey. What\u2019s with that crooked expression of yours?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s actually a High Deity from Lightning Divine Hall.\u201d Yin Shi was in absolute joy. Her own daughter had actually been admitted into the Lightning Divine Hall, wasn\u2019t that a little too fantastical? Wasn\u2019t it said that the disciples of Lightning Divine Hall had always been selected from the Lower Realm, and they had never taken in disciples from the Divine Realm?</p><br/><p>In an instant, she felt as though her Fluorescent Wind Sect being destroyed was no longer a big deal. Wasn\u2019t it just a few buildings? The disciples under her sect did not suffer any injuries, and they could always rebuild them in a blink of an eye. For her daughter to be able to enter the Lightning Divine Hall, it could be said to be heavenly fortune. \u201cI am grateful that High Deity fancies my daughter. From today onwards, I hope that High Deity will take great care of my daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d She indeed needed to be taken care of greatly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom this point on, she will be my personal succeeding disciple.\u201d Yu Yan said with a solemn voice. Since his disciple wanted to express that she was newly admitted, then he had no choice but to repeat the words he said back then when he first took her in. \u201cEntering under my tutelage, you will succeed the Daoist name \u2018Yu\u2019. From this moment onwards, you will be called Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With fast reflexes, Zhu Yao quickly covered his mouth, gritted her teeth and said. \u201cYao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan pulled down her hand, and instantly, his expression sank a little.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that regretful look of yours? As I thought, the name \u201cDesire\u201d was something you came up with on purpose, right!?</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh Deity\u2026\u201d Naturally, Yin Shi saw that impolite action from her own daughter. For a moment, she was a little embarrassed. However, seeing that the person in question did not look as though he minded, for a moment, she did not know what she should say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Zhu Yao took a step back, tidied up her clothes, and then, recalled the serious matter she had to take care of. \u201cI have a very important question to ask. Is there any unique artifact within the Fluorescent Wind Sect?\u201d If her guess was correct, there would definitely be something that the Phoenix race needed in Fluorescent Wind Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnique artifact?\u201d Yin Shi blanked, as she did not understand why her daughter would suddenly bring this up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, like for example\u2026 an object related to the God race?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Shi shook her head. \u201cThe God race has long been extinct. Currently, in the Three Realms, the shadows of the God race had long disappeared. And, when a God Artifact emerges, there will naturally be the occurrence of an abnormal phenomenon. If our sect possesses a God Artifact, how can it be possible for it to be unknown to everyone else? Why did you bring this up?\u201d</p><br/><p>To save the world! Zhu Yao felt like crying. \u201cI naturally have my own thoughts. Mother, can you think about it a little more? Is there really nothing at all? Especially if it\u2019s\u2026 related to phoenixes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhoenixes?\u201d Yin Shi pondered deeply for a moment, before answering. \u201cThe only thing our sect has that is related to phoenixes, is our sect\u2019s insignia.\u201d She pulled up her own sleeves, and pointed at the design printed on it. \u201cOur Fluorescent Wind Sect\u2019s insignia, is the outline of a phoenix.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pulled up her own sleeves to take a look. As she had said, her own clothes were embroidered with a simplified diagram of a phoenix as well.</p><br/><p>Then what was the Phoenix race looking for? Zhu Yao was confused. As she pondered deeply about the large masses of questions in the depths of her heart, she was worried that the Phoenix race would slaughter their way towards the Divine Realm at any given moment.</p><br/><p>Because the disciples that had scattered all over due to the lightning tribulation earlier had all flown back one after another. All of them gathered themselves at the center of the charred piece of land where the ruins of the former Fluorescent Wind Sect was. Yin Shi had already begun to instruct the disciples to clean the debris.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time High Deity is paying a visit. However with the current situation\u2026 For our Fluorescent Wind Sect\u2019s bad reception, I seek High Deity for your forgiveness.\u201d Yin Shi courteously said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d Yu Yan completely lacked the self-consciousness that he was also one of the culprits behind this miserable state, as he calmly said. \u201cI\u2019m bringing her back to Lightning Divine Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Yin Shi was unable to react at all. She did not have the intention to chase him away at all.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan, however, had already turned to look towards Zhu Yao who seemed to be thinking of something still, as he called out. \u201cYu Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Zhu Yao habitually reached out his hand.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan lightly held onto it, and then, grabbed onto Zhu Yao as they flew into the air. Just as they were about to leave, a man dressed in wedding attire came flying towards them from the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Xin\u2019er.\u201d Xu Nuoyan stopped in front of them with a worried expression, and looked at her from head to toe. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re alright. I have been worried about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. In an instant, a strange sensation rose from the depths of her heart. This Xu Nuoyan was a little too passionate towards her, right? They seemed to have only met for the second time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn\u2026 Fellow deity Xu.\u201d Since she had already entered Lightning Divine Hall, naturally, she couldn\u2019t address him as senior-martial brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Xin\u2019er\u2026\u201d The smile on Xu Nuoyan\u2019s face stiffened, and his eyes sank a little. Glancing at Yu Yan next to her, his face revealed a slightly heartbroken expression. \u201cIn regards to the matter earlier, does junior-martial sister not believe your senior-martial brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhu Yao blanked. What are you talking about?</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan\u2019s expression turned even more bitter than before, as he said with an anxious tone. \u201cJunior-martial sister, listen to me. That person and I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMove!\u201d Before he could even finish, he was interrupted by Yu Yan\u2019s cold voice. The eyes he were looking at his disciple with, he didn\u2019t like them at all.</p><br/><p>Hence, after his voice fell, the pressure of a High Deity came pressing down towards him. Xu Nuoyan\u2019s figure flashed, as he instantly fell off from his divine sword, and landed straight into the charred land below. Due to the suppression in ranks, he even sank deep into the soil. Like a stamp pressing down on an inkpad, a perfect human structure was formed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, has your menopause arrived?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d A cold aura emitted from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Nothing. Master, you\u2019re heroic, domineering, a unifier of the continent spanning over a thousand generations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She\u2019s spouting nonsense again.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not stay any longer. As he flew in the direction of the Lightning Divine Hall, he asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter regarding the Phoenix race?\u201d</p><br/><p>And Zhu Yao was here waiting for him to ask about it! Just as she was about to tell him about the bug this time in order to have him help analyze this problem, an intense pain suddenly came from her chest. As though her organs were being ripped towards a particular direction by someone, she could not bear the pain at all, as she puked out a large mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao?\u201d Yu Yan stopped, as he was frightened by his disciple\u2019s sudden situation.</p><br/><p>The ripping sensation on Zhu Yao\u2019s body felt even more intense, and her vision began to blur. Not to mention, the direction of this ripping seemed to be coming from\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026 Return\u2026 Return to Fluorescent\u2026 Wind Sect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, she had already completely submerged into darkness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The contract inscriptions in the middle began to float up as well, shooting straight into her core, as if it wanted to forcefully infiltrate her divine sense.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. She instinctively wanted to resist it, but she was simply unable to stop the inscription from entering. Just as that inscription was about to enter her divine sense, a gold ray of light suddenly flashed from the depths of her divine sense, instantly scattering that inscription.</p><br/><p>She suddenly recalled the new divine sense mark which her master had placed on her back in the Netherworld. The Floor Master Yu Jin once mentioned that one could only possess a single divine sense mark.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d The child was stunned for a moment, as though he had not expected that the contract would be scattered apart.</p><br/><p>The flames in Zhu Yao\u2019s heart surged. This unbearable child actually dared to use such a forceful method. If a tiger does not display its might, you\u2019re treating it as a sick kitten, is that it!?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle one, come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re willing to become my pet now? Then why haven\u2019t you knelt down yet?\u201d He pointed at the ground haughtily.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She dragged the child over, pressed him against her thigh, and cast an art to restrict his movements. Aiming straight at his small buttocks, she threw slap after slap at them. Pak! Pak! Pak!</p><br/><p>A small child like you is not being taught well! Coming out here to play with fire and everything! Do you know that it will cause a forest fire? Not to mention, you still want me to become your pet!? Do you know what are manners? Do you know how to respect your elders?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little one blanked for a moment, before beginning to desperately struggle. \u201cRelease me, you old demon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Haah, look at my temper. Zhu Yao began to put even more force into her smacks.</p><br/><p>After seeing that he was unable to break away, the lips of the unbearable child curved downwards, and began to cry out loud. \u201cWuuaah, you bully! You baddie! Wuaaahhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, who\u2019s the one who started the bullying first? \u201cStop crying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I will cry all I want! I will cry till you become my pet!\u201d He began to put more force into his cries.</p><br/><p>Your logic sure is flawless!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. Just who in the world raised such a little tyrant?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you continue to cry, I will continue to smack you!\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hands and materialized a blade of wind. She threw it at a gigantic rock several meters away, and instantly sliced the rock into half. After that, she coldly glared at him.</p><br/><p>The little tyrant stopped. As expected, he was frightened. Looking at her with a fearful look, his tears stopped flowing, but continued to well in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao retract her hand and pulled the little tyrant up. With a sunken look, she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak, who are you, and where did you come from? Why do you want to burn down my house?\u201d When dealing with a little tyrant like him, one naturally had to be more tyrannical tham him. \u201cYou better give a good explanation, otherwise I will make sure your buttocks bloom red.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuu\u2026\u201d His expression paled. Tightly biting his small lips, he looked like he wanted to cry, but did not dare to do so. \u201cM-mas\u2026 ter, save me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can save you. Hurry and speak!\u201d This unbearable child needed to be lectured.</p><br/><p>Only then did he begin to speak in bits and pieces. \u201cXiao\u2026 Xiao Bai, junior-martial sister\u2026 Qu Yi likes. So I\u2019m here to look for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell is this mess?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you\u2019re called Xiao Bai? There\u2019s something here which that whatever junior-martial sister of yours like? So you\u2019re here to look for it?\u201d Zhu Yao guessed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d He nodded, desperately holding back his tears.</p><br/><p>Yo, that\u2019s unexpected. Just how young is he right now? He already knows about sending gifts to please a girl.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed, as she then squatted down and looked at his small face at his eye-level. \u201cLittle one, it\u2019s not wrong for you to look for gifts for your little companion, but why did you want to set a fire? Fortunately, the house you wanted to burn down was mine. If it was anyone else, what if there\u2019s a little child like you inside it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 But you are all demons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, we are demons, but do demons deserve to die?\u201d There were many problems with this child\u2019s education, huh. Zhu Yao really wanted to have a chat with the adults in his family.</p><br/><p>His little brows furrowed as he weakly refuted. \u201cBut master said\u2026 demons are not humans, and they are all very weak. Their deaths are of\u2026 no concern.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you find me weak?\u201d</p><br/><p>He strongly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, I\u2019m a demon as well.\u201d Zhu Yao said in a sunken voice. \u201cThe strong and the weak do exist in this world, but being weak does not mean one can determine that person\u2019s life and death. We have already cultivated a human form, which means we\u2019re people like you. We cry, we laugh, and we can feel pain as well. If being strong means he or she can bully others, then if I kill you today, does that mean it\u2019s well-deserved?\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression instantly turned as pale as snow. No longer able to contain his large drops of tears, they began flowing down. He was young, so he was unaware of the concept of death. However, the moment he recalled about the stone that was sliced into half earlier, he began to shiver from fear.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly softened a little. No matter what was being said, he was still a child. As long as he were to be taught well, his mindset could be fixed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, stop crying!\u201d She reached out her hand to stroke his head. His entire body was already stiffened straight. Only when he realized that she was not making any other movements, he began to relax. Zhu Yao helped wipe away his tears. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t harm you. I was just giving an example.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRe\u2026 really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t smack my buttocks either?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did he smile with snot coming out from his nose. He strongly rubbed his nose, and said. \u201cThen\u2026 Then I won\u2019t capture you and make you my pet either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen will you still kill demons in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d He shook his head strongly. \u201cMy buttocks will hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d After everything she said, he only remembered about his buttocks.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 What am I supposed to do about junior-martial sister Qu Yi\u2019s gift?\u201d His small face frowned again. \u201cIf I don\u2019t find it, she won\u2019t play with me either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yo, it seems like he has pretty deep feelings for that little childhood sweetheart. He\u2019s already crying in such a manner. He sure thinks about her a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA treasure of Tranquil Valley.\u201d He said sternly. \u201cJunior-martial sister says that there\u2019s a treasure in Tranquil Valley that she really wants. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d This can\u2019t be his only clue right? \u201cWhat\u2019s that treasure called? Where is it located? And what is it used for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tyrant pondered for a moment, and then shook his head. \u201cJunior-martial sister did not mention them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then why the hell are you looking for it!?</p><br/><p>Alright, as expected of a child. \u201cThen find out more about it before looking for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut junior-martial sister Qu Yi\u2019s birthday is tomorrow.\u201d He said with an anxious look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can give her another present.\u201d Zhu Yao suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat present?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered for a moment. \u201cGirls usually like flowers. She will definitely like it if you give her some.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!?\u201d The eyes of the little tyrant shone, and then he suddenly turned to face that Little Nthqian. \u201cAre dandelions considered flowers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Nthqian trembled. She was about to burst into tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you that those who have turned into demons can\u2019t do it!\u201d Zhu Yao pinched his little cheeks. \u201cAfter leaving the valley, find ones that are in full bloom. You can pick up those of various colours, and then gather them into a bundle. She will definitely like it if you give that to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little tyrant pondered for a moment before nodding his head. He looked eager to try. \u201cAlright, I will listen to your suggestion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry on then!\u201d Zhu Yao nudged his hand.</p><br/><p>Only then did the little tyrant pull out the feather mystic tool and fly up high in the sky. Just as he was about to float away, he turned around and waved his hands at her. \u201cGrandma, I\u2019m leaving now. Thank you. Although you\u2019re ugly, you\u2019re a good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Ugly!</p><br/><p>You unbearable child, if you have the guts, come back here.</p><br/><p>After that little tyrant left, Little Nthqian was frightened for a good few days. Everytime Zhu Yao saw her, she would cry and speak of how terrifying humans were.</p><br/><p>Mn, she agreed.</p><br/><p>After this incident, Zhu Yao realized that the defensive abilities demon had were too weak. She had to find a way to raise everyone\u2019s battle capabilities. Thus, she passed on the cultivation methods to the eldest Little Qian. She ordered Little Qian to tell all of the demons to cultivate according to the methods she were taught in. </p><br/><p>Probably because for the mighty respect for the creases on her face, the demons did not actually suspect her in the least, and immediately followed her instructions. However, there was little success. The spiritual energy in this place was incredibly scarce. Zhu Yao felt that there was a problem with this so-called Tranquil Valley. However, she could not find a single thing that was amiss after looking around. </p><br/><p>On the third day, little tyrant returned. Compared to how he arrogantly set a fire the other time, he had much more manners this time. He had even begun to wave his tiny hands at her from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma!\u201d He excitedly ran over, his eyes were filled with stars. \u201cI followed your instructions and gave junior-martial sister Qu Yi flowers. She really liked it! Grandma, although you\u2019re ugly, you\u2019re really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Can you please not mention the word \u2018ugly\u2019!? If not because you are a child, I will really get pissed, hey.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d His joyful look retracted a little. \u201cJunior-martial sister says that she still like the treasure here more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what kind of treasure is there over here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial uncle Qu mentioned as well\u2026\u201d He sternly said. \u201cHe said that there should be a mystic tool here, it\u2019s like\u2026 an umbrella. It\u2019s really, really huge. He witnessed it last year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Last year\u2019s umbrella? The hell? She even bought a watch last year, hey?</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d The little tyrant tugged the corner of her clothes with a hopeful look. \u201cWhat else\u2026 do you think I can give junior-martial sister Qu Yi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to give her more presents?\u201d You\u2019re not a tyrant, but a tycoon right? \u201cHasn\u2019t her birthday already passed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 But\u2026\u201d He twiddled his fingers, and said with a complicated look. \u201cJunior-martial sister says that she really likes the gift I gave her, and hopes to receive more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, you\u2019re not a tycoon. You\u2019re an idiot!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you planning to give?\u201d Haah, she could not shatter apart the pure friendship between children.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have lots and lots of peachwood swords.\u201d He said with a serious look.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t do.\u201d Little girls should like more delicate gifts, right? She took out a wooden hairpin from her home, and passed it to him. \u201cGive her this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving this to me?\u201d He said, a little dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zhu Yao nodded. \u201cGo on then.\u201d Hurry and deal with your childhood sweetheart, don\u2019t bother me anymore. She still had to bring the dandelion family over to shine under the sun.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d The little tyrant suddenly had reddened eyes. Like a little bull cow, he charged right into her embrace. \u201cOther than master, Grandma treats me the best. Little Bai will always remember Grandma. Even if I\u2019m turned into ashes, I will remember Grandma.\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with that last bit? That\u2019s too frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, hurry on then. In the future, introduce me your junior-martial sister Qu Yi.\u201d Zhu Yao stroked his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn!\u201d Little tyrant said with a confident look, and only then did he get on his feather and float away.</p><br/><p>Phew. He was finally settled with. She had to continue supervising the self-improvement programme of the demon world.</p><br/><p>However, she did not expect that the little troublemaker would float back the next day.</p><br/><p>This time, he was pulling a long face. His little hands were holding onto his chest, as he pitifully floated towards her.</p><br/><p>Was she stuck with this unbearable child now?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Furthermore, in order to become a well-fledged Ma Liang, she even tested the effects of the magical brush at a practitioners\u2019 town nearby. After ascertaining that Nascent Soul practitioners were unable to find her out either, she then headed towards Grandhall Sect. She never expected that even the most perfect of plans could be rendered useless in the face of a single piggish party member.</p><br/><p>She was captured, firmly tied up like a large dumpling. The female lead Fan Zhishan and Sect Master Fa Yu were presently looking at her coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected you would actually be so stupid to send yourself here.\u201d Fa Yu coldly snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected that either!\u201d Zhu Yao felt like crying. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me go now, so that you can capture me again in the future? You might feel a sense of achievement that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet you go?\u201d Fa Yu\u2019s face stiffened, and he instantly raged. \u201cI have yet to make you pay the price for harming little sister Fan, and you want me to release you? Are you taking me as stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Fine then, I now know you\u2019re not the slightest bit stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I let you off now, when your cultivation improves in the future, wouldn\u2019t you seek me out for revenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words had so much sense in them, she actually had nothing to refute with.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Fa Yu\u2026\u201d Fan Zhishan gently spoke up, carrying a tone filled with endless sadness. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry! Little sister Ling Tian actually came back on her own, as long as she apologises to me, I can let bygones be bygones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister Fan.\u201d Fa Yu\u2019s face softened, and then he said in a pampering manner. \u201cYou can\u2019t be this kind. You have already suffered for so many years, and everything was because of her. If you forgive her here, aren\u2019t you just fueling her arrogance? We finally managed to capture the culprit, so we can\u2019t let things slide just like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan had a complicated look. \u201cI know big brother Fa Yu is doing this for my sake, but she is after all my biological sister\u2026 How can I possibly be this heartless?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, how can you think that way? You treasure your sibling love, but have she ever thought about you in the slightest? No matter what, I will have her held accountable today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Fa Yu\u2026 I believe she didn\u2019t do this on purpose.\u201d Fan Zhishan suddenly began to cry like rain droplets falling off pear blossoms. Turning around, she walked a few towards Zhu Yao and said with a regretless look. \u201cBig sister\u2026 This little sister has no other request. As long as you apologise, I will forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was startled. She looked at the female lead in front of her who was crying her lungs out. \u201cAuntie, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female lead\u2019s face stiffened a little, but she quickly regained her composure. Turning around, she pounced into the Reverend Fa Yu\u2019s embrace, and cried as if she had suffered a heartbreak.</p><br/><p>Nth flower guardian instantly exploded. He pointed at Zhu Yao\u2019s nose and reprimanded. \u201cAs expected, you have a poisonous heart. Little sister Fan is willing to let go of the past, yet you actually do not know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Please. I just asked her who she was, how is that poisonous at all? Why don\u2019t I know what\u2019s good for me?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you guys want to pour dirty water on my name, at the very least, let me know what\u2019s going on, right?\u201d Please stop with the wilful double act, alright? \u201cI have never met your little sister Fan, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two were stunned for a moment, and they only regained their senses a short while later. Fa Yu\u2019s fury grew fiercer. \u201cYou still dare to lie even now!\u201d Fa Yu glared at her and said. \u201cLittle sister Fan and you were born under the same mother. Little sister Fan was supposed to be the Sect Master selected by Spirit Heaven Palace, yet you posed as her and become the one who entered Spirit Heaven Palace instead. Not only are you but a dog in the manger, but you have also suppressed her with your evil doings! You made her youth miserable, and when before she was six years old, she was even treated as a mentally ill child! With a poisonous heart such as yours, you\u2019re simply not worthy of being a Sect Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was dumbfounded for a moment. She faced the female lead Fan Zhishan and carefully inspected her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Fa Yu, there\u2019s no need to go any further\u2026\u201d Fan Zhishan however turned her head away, the tears on her face flowed even more than before. She looked as though she could no longer bear to bring the subject up again, and was willing to keep all her sadness in her own heart.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but praise her acting skills! She had finally encountered a bug of the highest level. In order to become the Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace, she sure had gone all out. She was actually able to come up with such an absurd story. Not to mention she did not hesitate to forsake her own identity and become the twin sister of Ling Tian girly. She came up with a drama of a child being mistakenly carried away, and wanted to take up the position of Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace right and proper. It was truly a shame that this lady was not in showbiz.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 Sect Master Fa.\u201d Zhu Yao sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re saying, I intentionally posed as her back then, so that I can become the Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace and harm her at every possible moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fa Yu frowned. He did not reply and simply let out a disdainful snort.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cThen, may I ask, how old was I when I arrived at Spirit Heaven Palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fa Yu said impatiently. \u201cThe Sect Master succession of Spirit Heaven Palace has always been done swiftly. Naturally, it\u2019s on the day you were born.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, in other words, I was in Spirit Heaven Palace right after I was born?\u201d Zhu Yao said in a sunken voice. \u201cYou\u2019re saying, when I was still a baby, I intentionally swapped with her? You sure think highly of my intelligence!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fa Yu\u2019s face stiffened, as though he had just thought of this point as well. \u201cThen what about the pain she had suffered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes. \u201cShe was unable to retaliate when she was being harmed before she was six years old, are you saying that I knew how to dispatch people to harm her when I was six years old? Even if my IQ is off the charts and am truly smarter than all of you, if I truly wanted to pose as her from the very beginning, since we are born on the same day, I would have to concoct this scheme in my mother\u2019s womb!\u201d</p><br/><p>Where are your logic and reason? Have they all disappeared from the \u2018papapa\u2019?</p><br/><p>The two of them were stunned from this line of questioning! Fan Zhishan\u2019s face had especially turned miserably pale for an instant, a hint of fluster flashed across her eyes. Immediately after, she regained that gentle and frail flower look, looking as though she was suffering from grievances, yet tried her best to squeeze out some words of goodwill. \u201cBig sister\u2026 It\u2019s alright. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t admit it. It\u2019s my fault\u2026 It\u2019s all because of me. I shouldn\u2019t have gone to Spirit Heaven Palace, I shouldn\u2019t have awakened the Spirit Guiding Beast, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The suspicion on Fa Yu\u2019s face was instantly swept away. He held onto Fan Zhishan and said with an even angrier tone. \u201cLing Tian, you can stop lying now. Little sister Fan treats you so well, yet you actually still wish to frame her! Putting aside the past incidents, from the fact that little sister Fan was able to awaken the guardian beast of Spirit Heaven Palace, the Spirit Guiding Beast, it\u2019s sufficient to prove that she\u2019s the true Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell. Zhu Yao could not be bothered with these illogical people. Looking at them, they were definitely not going to let her go today. Zhu Yao began to calculate as she wondered if that \u2018Five Minutes Timed Trial\u2019 passive skill was still in effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Fa Yu\u2026\u201d Fan Zhishan glanced at Zhu Yao, her eyes were completely red. \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026 No matter how big sister treats me, I won\u2019t ever blame her. Let the Hall of Law of Spirit Heaven Palace\u2026 judge her sins! I shall bring her over now.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she walked towards Zhu Yao who was bound tight.</p><br/><p>Fa Yu however suddenly stopped her tracks and sighed. \u201cLittle sister Fan, I know you are soft-hearted, and that you\u2019re still trying to protect her even now. However, your kind deeds might not be rewarded. Since you are unwilling to do it yourself, I shall be the one to judge this vile person. Let me handle her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Fan Zhishan blurted out, a hint of fluster flashed across the depths of her eyes. She immediately regained her composure, and then, she spoke with the same gentleness and frailness. \u201cShe\u2019s a member of my Spirit Heaven Palace, and according to the rules, she has to be handled by Spirit Heaven Palace. I have already owed big brother Fa Yu so much, how can I trouble you even further than this?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister Fan!\u201d Fa Yu however suddenly became angry, and he looked at her as though she was being stubborn. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of letting her go secretly, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Fan Zhishan was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Fa Yu frowned deeply. \u201cLittle sister Fan, you can\u2019t be too kind, you must make your decision decisively!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to speak further. I will definitely not let you bring this person back. You will definitely release her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat settles it then. Since you cannot bear to judge her, I shall do it myself. I will definitely exact justice for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Filled with indignation, Fa Yu did not wait for Fan Zhishan\u2019s reaction and had already called over two disciples. He pointed at the \u201cDumpling Yao\u201d on the ground and said. \u201cThrow this person down to the lowest pits of prison, and put her on a strict watch. understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The two disciple nodded in unison. Before Fan Zhishan could even regain her senses, they had already dragged Zhu Yao out.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently turned to look at the speechless Fan Zhishan\u2019s miserably pale face. See, this is what you get for acting too far! He truly sees you as a gentle and frail flower who can\u2019t bear to make a move on your enemies now!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was imprisoned in Grandhall Sect\u2019s prison. She spent more than two hours to release herself from the mystic arts that sealed her movements. She wondered if it was because of their confidence in the prison\u2019s formation, as there was only a single restriction placed in the cell. She tried to condense the gather energy within her body, attempting to break out of the formation, only to realize that she was simply unable to circulate them at all. It seemed like this formation comprised of something that could restrain spiritual energy, preventing one from breaking it.</p><br/><p>Recalling Fan Zhishan\u2019s earlier attitude, most likely, she was not going to have Zhu Yao killed here, and Zhu Yao felt that she had a goal in doing so. She seemed to have other plans other than snatching Ling Tian girly\u2019s Sect Master position. Otherwise, why would she still anxiously wish to capture her after she had already obtained Spirit Heaven Palace, and even bring her back?</p><br/><p>No matter what, Zhu Yao had to make her escape first.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pulled out the brush which she had been hiding all this while. Just as she was about to play the character of Ma Liang again, tears began to fall uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry already\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao simply felt a deep sense of helplessness. Isn\u2019t it just falling out of love? And the girl is even going out of hand with her tears because of it. Her eyes are all swollen now, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 Little Yu wasn\u2019t like that in the past.\u201d Ling Tian weeped as she spoke. \u201cHe was so obedient in the past\u2026 and so cute. No matter what\u2026 he would always listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Obedient? Cute? Recalling the female lead fanatic Fa Yu\u2019s look earlier, the corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips could not help but twitch. She only had a single thought in mind\u2026 Ling Tian girly, you sure was blind in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe even said that he won\u2019t ever allow anyone to bully me. But now\u2026 Just from listening to her side of the story, and not listening to my explanation, he\u2026 Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018why\u2019 for such things!\u201d Zhu Yao said in a sunken voice. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t like you anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Ling Tian girly turned silent, though the tears on her face were flowing even fiercer than before.</p><br/><p>Feeling helpless, Zhu Yao had no choice but to let her cry it out. Dipping the brush gently on her own tears, she planned on activating Ma Liang mode.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the restriction on the cell\u2019s exit shook for a moment, as the sound of footsteps grew closer.</p><br/><p>The hell! People were already coming for her. Zhu Yao immediately hid the brush.</p><br/><p>A moment later, someone walked in. As if it was not unfortunate enough, it was actually Fa Yu himself. With a dark look, he walked straight towards the pillar of light in front of the cell, and stood there! He glared at her with a ruthless expression. He did not move, and simply stood there. Yet, his expression continued to grow colder by the minute, and even his eyes were beginning to glow bloody red.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat as a chilling intent rose. This grandson\u2019s expression isn\u2019t right at all. Compared to that brain-dead fanatic she saw in the hall earlier, he basically looked like a different person now. He couldn\u2019t really be thinking of killing her for Fan Zhishan\u2019s sake, right?</p><br/><p>Her heart was instantly sent into a fluster as she thought of ways to escape this place. Suddenly, he reached out his hand and opened the prison cell\u2019s door. Before she could even react, the black figure in front of her flashed, and a hand was already grasping on her neck in the next moment.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao wanted to retreat on reflex, but he simply dragged her all the way to the wall. Furious and crazed light could be seen flashing in his eyes, as though he truly desired to tear her into pieces.</p><br/><p>The hell, this crazy brain-dead fanatic! He\u2019s actually truly thinking of killing her!</p><br/><p>Her breathing was stopped at that moment. Just as she thought it was about time for the passive resurrection skill to activate, his hand suddenly loosened a little, allowing her to catch her breath. His eyes however grew even colder and fiercer than before, and even his voice was filled with chilling intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak! Who the hell are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh!?</p><br/><p>Before Zhu Yao could even gasp for air, she was stunned by his question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Ling Tian, who are you?\u201d The redness in his eyes grew denser, as though he was sinking into madness. \u201cWhere\u2019s Tiantian? What did you do to her? Why are you possessing her body!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell! How did he see through her? Could it be that he knew she wasn\u2019t Ling Tian right from the start?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ling Tian?\u201d He placed emphasis on every word, as a few strands of black wisps faintly appeared around his body. \u201cYou best speak the truth, otherwise\u2026 I will scatter your soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, his grip once again tightened.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao slapped on his arm heavily. The hell, are you going to let me speak or not? I\u2019m about to suffocate here!</p><br/><p>Fa Yu\u2019s face was quickly turner darker by the second. After taking a deep breath, as though he was trying to suppress the madness in his heart with all his might, he flung her onto the ground.</p><br/><p>She coughed out coarsely a few times before she was able to catch her breath. As she glanced at Fa Yu who seemed to have suddenly turned into a different person, she pondered about the situation. From his looks, it seemed like he was extremely concerned about Ling Tian\u2019s whereabouts. Then who was that brain-dead fanatic in the hall earlier?</p><br/><p>\u201cSaintess\u2026\u201d Ling Tian suddenly spoke up. \u201cLet me speak with him, is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Ling Tian was a frail girl. Facing this Fa Yu who seemed to have activated his tyranny mode, Zhu Yao could not help but worry.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian girly\u2019s voice sank a little. \u201cThere\u2019s something I wish to ask him personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Zhu Yao still agreed to her request. Relaxing her mind, she suddenly felt her entire being was sucked out. In a flash, she arrived in that snow-white space where the girly was staying before. Releasing her will, a large screen appeared in front of her eyes, and the situation outside was being shown.</p><br/><p>Seemingly in an instant, the atmosphere surrounding Ling Tian on the ground changed. Zhu Yao had to admit that, Ling Tian girly was more elegant and refined, a true beauty that could topple countries, while Zhu Yao herself was at most a clown that could topple countries.</p><br/><p>o(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl lightly called out. When her voice fell, it was as if Reverend Fa Yu, who seemed to have activated his tyranny mode with his pair of scarlet red eyes and a body covered in killing intent, had a bucket of water poured over him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could faintly hear a sizzling sound in the air, as if something was extinguished.</p><br/><p>\u201cTiantian\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What disciple?</p><br/><p>Miao Bo frowned. He was extremely furious at this reckless chap who suddenly appeared. His mind was filled with revenge, and when his enemy was just right in sight, he was stopped by someone unrelated to this entire situation. It was natural for him to be enraged.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does your disciple have to do with me!? Scram!\u201d He charged out. \u201cThose who stop me, shall die!\u201d Without even thinking, he flung out a mystic art. He was a Heavy Deity, and yet there was actually someone who was blind enough to dare stop him. He needed to let this chap know his place.</p><br/><p>In the next instant, he truly understood his place.</p><br/><p>Before Miao Bo could even react, he was bombarded silly by the tribulation lightning bolts that rained down from the sky. Like fried fish, he was zapped at the front and the back, three hundred sixty degrees with no dead angle to escape to. His entire body was completely numbed. When he regained his senses, he, a Heavy Deity, was zapped back to his original form \u2013 an Earth Deity. Like a pile of carbon lying on the ground, he no longer had the strength move.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t the saddest person here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh Deity\u2026\u201d Thisthower Mountain Sect Master Feng Jin hugged onto Yu Yan\u2019s leg with tears and snot coming out from his nose. \u201cWhat happened to the half of the mountain that you promised not to touch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Yu Yan stop the tribulation lightning bolts that filled the sky. With the same icy tone, he asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s my disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The moment she was flung out, Zhu Yao finally understood what the idiom \u201ctearing the bridge apart after crossing it\u201d meant. When Miao Bo was still an idiot back then, he would still bring her to look at the stars and moon, and even call her little sweety. Now that he had become successful and rich, he actually threw her away without a shred of hesitation. Thinking about this, Zhu Yao\u2019s sword heart received ten thousands damage.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had already made the preparations to enter the waters. Just as she was falling straight down and nearing the surface of the sea, she heard a dull thud. That\u2019s right, it was not the splash from entering waters, but a thud.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo!\u201d Immediately after, a pained cry sounded. \u201cWhich bastard threw at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? It\u2019s a divine sword.\u201d In the next instant, she was grabbed and raised in the air. The person who appeared before her was a blue-robed man wearing a jade crown on his head. His face was presently filled with anger. He looked up into the air and searched around. Then, he immediately cussed out. \u201cYour granddaddy! Which bastard schemed against me and dared to assassinate me with a sword? If you have the guts, come and fight this granddaddy here in a fair match. What kind of a man are you by hiding yourself? Come right out here! Scram out in front of this granddaddy! Don\u2019t you hide and keep your mouth shut. I know you\u2019re there! Come out, come out, come out here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell. Are you Aunt Xue?\u201d His lines were exactly the same.</p><br/><p>The man was stunned for a moment, and then he stared at the sword in his hand. \u201cYou can talk? There\u2019s actually a divine sword that can talk? It can\u2019t actually be the true form of some sort of spirit, right? Oh right, how did you know I\u2019m Xue Yi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, you\u2019re really called Aunt Xue, hey!?\u201d Zhu Yao and her avatar were utterly stunned. \u201cWait a minute, you can hear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis daddy isn\u2019t deaf, so why wouldn\u2019t I be able to hear you?\u201d Xue Yi glared at her, and then shook her about by the hilt. \u201cHurry and speak, who\u2019s your owner? Why did he throw you at me? Hurry and call him out. If he has the guts, then come and fight me in a fair match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d This guy is actually a violent maniac. \u201cIt\u2019s not that someone threw at you, rather, I was thrown away by someone. When I fell, I bumped into you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLies!\u201d Xue Yi instantly flared up. \u201cThis daddy has been in closed-door training for several hundred years, and I have never been discovered before. How could there be such a coincidence where you could land on me in a single throw?\u201d He snorted, looking all cool and tyrannical. \u201cHmph. A second rank divine sword like you actually thinks of tricking me? Furthermore, a barrier has been placed on this sea floor. Your owner must have used some sort of method to throw you down here.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he walked towards the transparent barrier that separated the seawater and pointed at it. With a proud look, he said. \u201cI personally set this barrier up. Even if a late-stage Heavy Deity might not even break through it, let alone a terrible divine sword like you.\u201d He then swung her towards the barrier, as though he was trying to prove the quality of his formation.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s blade slashed towards the front. Then, a crackling sound could be heard. It was the sound of something being slashed apart.</p><br/><p>In the next instant, large amount of seawater gushed in as the barrier shattered resoundingly. It quickly flooded the entire isolated area.</p><br/><p>A few moments later\u2026</p><br/><p>Above the boundless sea, the intense winds swirled into dark clouds, and between the dark clouds and the surface of the sea, Haiyan\u2026 ah pui! A human head popped out, with one hand clutching onto a floating log and a second rank divine sword with the other, his face was filled with shock!</p><br/><p>He raised the sword up. A human and a sword silently stared at each other for ten seconds.</p><br/><p>Something called \u2018resentment\u2019 began floating in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao gave him a few seconds of silence. \u201cI already told you, I was thrown down here.\u201d If you don\u2019t listen to the words of a divine sword, you will regret it, young man!</p><br/><p>Xue Yi\u2019s expression darkened. He gritted his teeth, and then stubbornly replied. \u201cThis granddaddy believe you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He cast the Light Body Art, and then leapt up from the wooden log. He moved quickly across the water surface, heading towards the northern side.</p><br/><p>Wuaah, he\u2019s using qinggong to float atop the water! At that moment, she felt that this unfortunate youth was pretty cool.</p><br/><p>Xue Li leapt across the sea like a waterfly for half a day before arriving on dry land. The place he stopped at was an island.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you fly on a sword?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe turned to glare at her ruthlessly. \u201cDo you think this daddy doesn\u2019t want to? This daddy\u2019s belongings are all in the water, alright?\u201d It\u2019s not like he did not want to fly on a sword, he had no swords to fly on!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d That\u2019s what you get.</p><br/><p>Xue Li rested for a short while, and then looked at Zhu Yao. \u201cHey, just what in the world are you? Clearly you\u2019re a second rank divine sword, yet you\u2019re actually able to break my barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 This is a tricky question.\u201d Let her think of something to muddle her way through. \u201cActually\u2026 I\u2019m not a sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d Xue Yi sized her up for a moment. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly be trying to tell me you\u2019re a sabre, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re the sabre, your entire family is made of sabres.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not a weapon at first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed, as she used all of the acting skills that she had learnt throughout her life. \u201cActually\u2026 I\u2019m a princess\u2026\u201d Then she altered the \u2018princess and the frog\u2019 fairytale into a \u2018prince and the divine sword (PS: a second rank one)\u2019 story, and narrated it to him affectionately and enthusiastically. \u201cSo\u2026 As long as I can find the kiss of true love, I will be able to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Li\u2019s face was like this: (\uffe2_\uffe2)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, young man. You must believe divine arts!\u201d Zhu Yao continued to brainwash him.</p><br/><p>The corner of Xue Li\u2019s lips twitched, and then asked seriously. \u201cIs there the word \u2018idiot\u2019 written on my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d She hated intelligent people the most. When she was in the modern era, not a single one of the little brats on the street wouldn\u2019t believe her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you must have been struck with a soul assimilation art right?\u201d Xue Li analyzed. \u201cAnd then, you were sealed in this sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh.\u201d He sure made a precise guess.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to return to your main body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to send you back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot going!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Then why the hell did you lead me on just now!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I have to send you back? There\u2019s no merit for me at all.\u201d He stretched his waist and said with a slovenly expression. \u201cFurthermore, you were the one who destroyed my barrier. I don\u2019t even have a place to stay in now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d You were clearly the one who slashed at it with your itchy hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were a good amount of treasures inside, you know? They were all there to prepare myself for the future. Even if you return to your divine body, you wouldn\u2019t be able to pay\u2026 Wait a minute!\u201d His words halted there, as though he had just thought of something. He turned to look at Zhu Yao on the ground, and then pointed at her with his trembling hand. \u201cYou\u2026 Y-Y-You\u2019re a female sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell is a female sword? Zhu Yao rolled her eyes and asked back. \u201cYou\u2019re a male human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Li did not reply, his entire figure was rooted to the ground. His entire body was stiffened tight, and that bronze-coloured face was beginning to be dyed with a strange red, which spread all the way to his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>However, it was as if he was startled, leaping up all of a sudden. He took a few steps back, and his eyes began to swim around. He glanced to the left and looked to the right, but he did not dare to look at the sword on the ground. \u201cN\u2026 N\u2026 N-N-N\u2026 Nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you stammering now?\u201d</p><br/><p>He grew even more flustered and decided to turn around with his back facing her. His two hands crossed, and his two thumbs twiddled between each other. Female type. She\u2019s actually the female type that mother spoke of. What should I do? I\u2019m so anxious. This is the first time I\u2019m interacting with their kind this close. Will she love me at first sight? She must definitely like my muscles, right? She definitely will.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d When you\u2019re muttering to yourself, don\u2019t let me hear you, hey! What\u2019s a female type? And who the hell likes your muscles?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d He finally turned around, yet he was still stammering his words. \u201cI will\u2026 s-s\u2026 send you b\u2026 ba\u2026 back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo thank you!\u201d She had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cN\u2026 N\u2026 N-No need to be courteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Who wants to be courteous with you?</p><br/><p>Heheh. She might like me after we develop our feelings on this journey.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho will like you? I have a man already, alright? Also, those inner thoughts of yours, can you please keep them to yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW\u2026 Where do you want to g\u2026 go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t hear me, hey! I don\u2019t want to go anywhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>He however had already walked over to her. He wanted to reach out to hold her, yet he figured that it wouldn\u2019t be prudent enough. He tore out half of his long robe, placed her on the fabric, and then carefully tied her up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs\u2026 Is\u2026 Is it\u2026 to the east?\u201d He held up Zhu Yao with a shy face. Then, he once again circulated the Light Body Art, and headed in the eastern direction.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She seemed to have been kidnapped by a single puppy.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine sword maiden, there\u2019s a divine city over there. Shall we snatch a house and stay there for a while?\u201d Xue Yi said to the sword in his hand fawningly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnatch?\u201d Are you a bandit?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I came here before.\u201d Xue Yi explained with a serious look. \u201cThe houses here are really easy to snatch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What did you do in the past?</p><br/><p>As Xue Yi spoke, his figure flashed and arrived at the gate to the divine city. In order to prove his words, he enthusiastically greeted the Deity practitioner protecting the gate. \u201cYo, long time no see!\u201d</p><br/><p>That Deity practitioner\u2019s face instantly paled and he immediately ran into the city, as though he had just seen a ghost. As he ran, he shouted loudly. \u201cHurry and run! That bastard surnamed Xue is back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The city that was still bustling with activities earlier instantly quietened down. In the next moment, every single person did the same thing. They took out their flying swords, rose into the air, and fled wildly in all directions. Not a single one of them turned around to have a glance.</p><br/><p>In just a few minutes, not even a single human figure could be seen in the small city.</p><br/><p>This escape speed they displayed was even faster than a regular evacuation drill.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao glanced at the person next to her. \u201cPlease hold onto your chest and tell me, just what did you do to these people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much.\u201d Xue Li said innocently. \u201cI\u2019ve only came here thrice. During the first time, I wanted to stay in the city lord\u2019s residence, but he didn\u2019t let me, so I beat him up. The second time, I wanted to try some wine, but that person said to pay him divine stones for it, so I beat him up too. The third time, they didn\u2019t allow me to enter the city, so\u2026 I beat up everyone in the city. Just like that. I didn\u2019t really do much either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t treat beating people up like eating a meal, hey! If that isn\u2019t much, just what in the world would he do if he put in a little more effort?</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine sword maiden, which house do you want to live in? Pick whichever you want!\u201d Xue Li spread out his arms. At that moment, it felt as though he was possessed by a tyrannical CEO and the entire divine city was his territory.</p><br/><p>Is this guy in the mafia? Can I resign please? \u201cAunt Xue, I\u2019m a divine sword, I don\u2019t need to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu!\u201d He lowered his head in disappointment. So unfortunate, mother told me that if I give a female type something, she will like me, love me, and desire me!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Call your mother out, I want to talk to her about life.\u201d I already told you many times not to speak out your inner thoughts! Don\u2019t think that I can\u2019t hear you without those quotation marks!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, divine sword maiden. Let\u2019s replenish some of our necessities, and then continue on our way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Did you activate the \u2018Automatically Shield Off Anything That I Don\u2019t Want to Hear\u2019 ability?</p><br/><p>Xue Yi walked into a divine artifact store and glanced around. He took away a fifth rank flying sword from the most sealed cabinet that was furthest away from the store entrance. Then, he leisurely returned to the lobby and casually took away all of the fourth rank, third rank, second rank\u2026 and first rank divine artifacts.</p><br/><p>Before he left, he even took away the storage rings inside the counter\u2019s drawers.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently lit a candle for the store owner.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had thought that he would fly on his sword and leave the city, but he instead made his way into a pharmacy on the left, the talisman store on the right, and the formation store in the opposite street. Finally, he even entered a material store. Like sweeping away the autumn leaves, he swept everything into the storage rings in his hands. Only when he was no longer able to store them in, did he stop with a regretful look.</p><br/><p>He stroked the rings in his hand. \u201cHaah, it\u2019s lacking a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao really wanted to cuss out in place of the residents of this divine city: Your sister!</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine sword maiden, we can leave now.\u201d Xue Lin found a white divine yarn handle, and hung her on his body. It was not on his back, but right in front of his chest. It looked especially stupid. \u201cOh right, where do you want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEast!\u201d Zhu Yao had already given up all form of resistance, after all, he would automatically shield away anything that he didn\u2019t like to hear. She thought that she might as well go along with him until she return to Lightning Divine Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Xue Li summoned the fifth rank flying sword he stole. Just as he was about to leave, a Heavy Deity pressure suddenly assaulted in their direction. Xue Li wasn\u2019t able to stabilize himself, and he ended up kneeling onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless heretic Deity, you actually dare to act so wantonly here.\u201d A mighty voice resounded from above their heads.</p><br/><p>Aunt Xue(): She is a character in Romance of the Rain, a Chinese drama filmed in 2000. The character\u2019s full name is Wang Xueqin, a devious and power hungry woman. The pun here is that the Chinese for aunt(), Yi, sounds the same as  in Xue Yi\u2019s name .</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She had finally dealt with a bug, yet was another one about to be born? Could she actually catch a break? Before she could even figure out how she should deal with this chain of events, a column of heavenly light suddenly descended, piercing through the layers of clouds and instantly shining upon this dark world.</p><br/><p>Light of Guidance! Now!?</p><br/><p>Her body lightened as her entire being flew towards the sky. She was only able to call out to Sesame in time and have it return to her divine sense. In the next instant, she ascended to the boundaries of the worlds, but just as she was about to cross, a familiar darkness descended. She had returned to that space once more.</p><br/><p>The hell! I can never go through the standard process of becoming a Deity, is that it!?</p><br/><p>A QQ chat window popped out as usual, and the entire screen was filled with exploding flowery fireworks.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Welcome back, young maiden! Congratulations on splendidly fixing yet another bug! Even I am about to become your die-hard fan.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at him with narrowed eyes. \u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Ouu\u2026 Young maiden, you\u2019re so cold, so heartless, so nonsensical.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough with the crap, just what happened this time? The beginning act was ridiculous, and the ending act was even more ridiculous? What happened to Fa Yu and Ling Tian?\u201d Putting aside Ling Tian, Fa Yu actually turned into a Devil. Was a mortal able to become a Devil?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Young maiden, I\u2019m innocent! That world was about to approach all-round collapse in the first place, so there were many instabilities. So, it\u2019s understandable that you did not descend in the correct avatar. It\u2019s out of my control, after all!</p><br/><p>(\uffe2_\uffe2) Doubtful gaze.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: It\u2019s true, it\u2019s true. Young maiden, that was the reason why I rushed you.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Ling Tian\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao took a deep breath, as she still felt a stifling feeling in her heart. \u201cDid she really\u2026\u201d have to die?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Ling Tian is the patch for that world in the first place, and sooner or later, she would be needed to completely mend that world. That\u2019s also the reason why her aptitude and abilities worsened as she reincarnated over and over again. Theoretically speaking, someone like her who accidentally gained awareness shouldn\u2019t develop feelings of love in the first place. However, it\u2019s exactly because she accidently developed such feelings in this lifetime, which gave birth to desires within her. Thus, it caused the disaster she had in this lifetime, where she was on the brink of death before the right time, yet no longer possess the ability to enter the wheel of reincarnation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean, she\u2019s not a human in the first place?\u201d Zhu Yao frowned.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Initially, yes. But\u2026 Ever since her previous reincarnation, she became one.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, it would have been better if feelings hadn\u2019t budded in the beginning. At the very least, it wouldn\u2019t have ended that way in the end\u2026</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Yaoyao\u2026 Does her death break your heart?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not to the degree of heartbreak, but more of sadness and sympathy.\u201d Zhu Yao took a deep breath. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that Ling Tian is a full-fledged saviour of the world. She saved the entire world, and had even sacrificed her most cherished feelings. I sympathize with her, and also feel sad about her death. This is human nature, but not to the degree of a heartbreak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 she might be a great heroine and a good role model, or even barely be considered as a good girlfriend. However, I have never treated her as a good friend.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cSince the beginning, she was never frank with me. She might have various reasons in doing so, but the fact that she had lied to me cannot be changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFeelings are mutual! Maybe, if we got to know each other a little longer, she might tell me the truth, and I will most likely become as furious as Fa Yu.\u201d She sighed. Probably because Ling Tian had forced her to stay within her body, Zhu Yao felt as if something was tying her heart down. However, now that she was dead, there was no longer a need to be frustrated about it. That was why, though she sympathized with her plight, she was not as sad as the time when she witnessed Ying Luo\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, what happened to Fa Yu?\u201d Zhu Yao suddenly recalled. \u201cHe had clearly become a Devil. Can mortals become Devils too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Haah\u2026 Young maiden. All living beings carry the nature of Devils in their hearts. The only difference is whether they are willing to let that nature loose.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!? Wouldn\u2019t that mean there would be a never-ending amount of bugs?\u201d Zhu Yao wanted to cuss out. Among the bugs that she had fixed, most of them were related to the Devils, you know? \u201cWait a minute\u2026 Fa Yu had clearly turned into a Devil, yet you pulled me back here. Could it be that he isn\u2019t a bug?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Congratulations, young maiden! Your IQ has logged on!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak human.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Uh\u2026 Actually, the reason why those ancient Devils that you faced in the past were bugs, was due to the fact they were initially out of the boundaries of the Three Realms. However, Fa Yu is different. He is a resident of the Three Realms in the first place, and even if he turns into a Devil, it\u2019s within the boundaries of the Three Realms.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d There were actually differences between ancient Devils and earth-born Devils. So was this racial discrimination? However, after pondering for a moment, though Fa Yu did indeed possess devillic energy, he seemed to be weaker than the ones she had seen in the past. Was that why he did not face her in a direct confrontation?</p><br/><p>Whatever. Since Realmspirit said that he wasn\u2019t a bug, then why should she be frustrated over it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Fan Zhishan?\u201d Zhu Yao continued to ask, as she felt that the female lead wasn\u2019t that simple. \u201cShe can\u2019t possibly be a regular person who has awakened to a hidden talent, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Young maiden, you\u2019re so smart! Actually, she\u2019s an accident too.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: She was initially born with a soul that was fragmented due to the erosion of resentment, and she had to go through several lifetimes in order to restore her soul to completion. However, her resentment which was exterminated before had unexpectedly returned to the world of the living, and possessed her body. This caused a shift in time by a certain degree and made her possess memories which she shouldn\u2019t have, and thus developed a mutation of a certain degree.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cCan you speak human?\u201d The hell, she couldn\u2019t understand at all, hey.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Ou, to put it simply, she thought that she had reincarnated.</p><br/><p>The hell! Another reincarnation! It was no wonder her cultivation rose so swiftly. That mutation must have been her ability to see luck.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head and looked at Realmspirit\u2019s chat window. For some reason, a strange sensation rose in the depths of her heart. Luck, soul, and resentment. These were all ethereal things to practitioners and even Deities. However, Realmspirit could speak about them this casually.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, no matter if it\u2019s Ling Tian or the River of Forgetfulness, to put it simply, they were all extraordinary existences themselves, yet they all trusted him to a irregular degree.</p><br/><p>No, that\u2019s not right!</p><br/><p>Rather than trust, they were all\u2026 abiding by his orders.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned as she took in a deep breath. She suddenly had an incredible thought in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit\u2026 Who in the world are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The screen flashed a few times, and after a long while, a row of words appeared.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Geez, I\u2019m your friend, of course! Oh right, regarding the overtime work this time, your reward is a one-time vacation. Young maiden, do you want to use it now?</p><br/><p>\u201cVacation?\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cIs that true? Is there no need to fix bugs anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Uuuu\u2026 Young maiden, how can you suspect my sincerity\u2026 my sincerity\u2026 sincerity\u2026 sincerity!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blaming me?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cTell me, when have you ever been reliable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: It\u2019s true this time! Let\u2019s use it immediately!</p><br/><p>A familiar loading screen suddenly appeared in front of her, and it was loading really quickly. Zhu Yao\u2019s figure flashed, and she instantly disappeared from this dark space.</p><br/><p>A long while later\u2026</p><br/><p>Rows of red words popped out.</p><br/><p>Notice! User\u2019s awakening has been detected!</p><br/><p>Do you wish to activate it automatically?</p><br/><p>Selected Choice: Hide information on awakening.</p><br/><p>Awakening has halted.</p><br/><p>The chat window flashed, and another row of words appeared.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: It\u2019s not time yet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

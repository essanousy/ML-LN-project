As expected, when it came to taking the initiative for a hug, her master still did it the best.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s body stiffened, as he raised his hands to pick off the leaves on her head. Was his stupid disciple acting on her bad habits again? He sighed, but rather than pushing her away, he embraced her even tighter. Suddenly, he felt that getting along like this was actually rather comfortable, so he did not feel like letting her go.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, were you looking for me?\u201d Zhu Yao rubbed about.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Yu Yan stroked her hair, and lightly said. \u201cYour master has sensed an anomaly with the spiritual energy at the northern edge of this continent. Something seems to be gathering there, and in less than ten days, chaos will ensue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled, as she hurriedly raised her head and took a step back. \u201cThe extreme north? What\u2019s gathering over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that his arms were now empty, Yu Yan frowned with dissatisfaction. He glanced at the distance between the two of them, and then, pulled his disciple back. \u201cThe spiritual energy in that direction is disoriented, and carries a malicious aura. They are most probably demonic beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic beasts\u2026 You\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao\u2026 a beast wave is approaching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beast wave!</p><br/><p>This soon? Wasn\u2019t it said that a beast wave would only occur once every hundred years? She clearly recalled in the scenario that the next wave would occur fifty years later. And it was because of that wave, the Beast Lord was unexpectedly injured and saved by Mary Sue, thereafter, the main route of constant death courting and world destruction would be activated.</p><br/><p>Why was it pushed forward by such a large extent all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the beast wave assaulting, every clan and sect must face them with their entire force.\u201d He slowly said. \u201cYu Yao, have you done your preparations?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Could she say that she simply did not expect this event at all?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan sighed, as though he had already guessed it. \u201cThough you have already formed your Azoth Core, you are still not completely safe from the beast wave.\u201d With a wave of his hand, a familiar red fan then appeared on his hand. \u201cIn these few days, your master has refined this weapon for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then at Jade Forest Peak, you were most proficient with this weapon. So I have prepared this for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d As expected, he was the best master who could move the world, for him to have even considered this for her. This fan-type weapon looked exactly the same as the first weapon her master had given her back then. However, back then, it was just an elementary rank artifact, while this one was sixth-ranked. Look at the streaks of lightning that were faintly flowing at the base of the fan, this was actually even imbued with the lightning attribute.</p><br/><p>So moving. She had arrived in this world for so many days, but even her current flying sword was the uniformed one provided by the sect, and it had long been incredibly damaged as well. Presently, she finally had a weapon of her own.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn!\u201d Yu Yan nodded. And then, as though he was acting out a magic trick, he took out a storage pouch, and began to take items out one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a flying sword, engraved on it is a defensive mystic art which is capable of suppressing a Demigod practitioner\u2019s full frontal attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>She indeed required a transportation tool. Received.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a seventh ranked talisman formation. If you are in trouble, you can use this.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was actually a talisman formation too. Received.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a Purple Extreme Heavenly Lightning Talisman. I sealed an Ascension Tribulation Lightning within it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A talisman? She probably wouldn\u2019t be able to use it, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s several mystic robes as well. Didn\u2019t you like your master\u2019s robe back then? I made a similar one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d No, I just wanted to strip you.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s several others. You can choose to change into them too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why did she have the feeling that she was going for a vacation?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a few snacks. If you ever get tired from killing demonic beasts, you can try them. Don\u2019t eat medicinal pellets, they are not good for your cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Master, I\u2019m going to kill demonic beasts, not going for a vacation, hey.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still have\u2026 periods?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you still have them, then your master will have to prepare\u2026\u201d cloth menstrual pads.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m returning now, bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao finally understood why her master\u2019s life skills were so top-notch. He was lonely.</p><br/><p>She had only been gone for a few days, and he had already prepared a huge bunch of stuffs. In order to prevent him form taking out anything shameless, Zhu Yao wisely fled.</p><br/><p>The beast wave happening in advance was definitely a huge matter. Zhu Yao instantly told this piece of information to the various clans and sects, and their faces sank a little after hearing the news.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe beast wave have always happened once in a hundred years, why is it happening earlier than usual for no reason?\u201d Xuan Xu was the first to bring up his doubts, and his tone even faintly carried a hint of suspicion.</p><br/><p>Good question, she wanted to know too.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the lord inside who personally told me this. I don\u2019t know the actual reason behind it, but if you harbour any suspicions, you can ask him yourself.\u201d Zhu Yao sent his suspicions back at him.</p><br/><p>As expected, Xuan Xu\u2019s face immediately darkened. Evidently, he recalled that embarrassing scene of being unable to even get through the formation earlier. He had always disliked Zhu Yao, and asking this question was actually to make things difficult for her. However, he never expected that he would be the one who would get the short end of the stick.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the lord has this prophecy, then it shouldn\u2019t be false.\u201d Sect Master Lin Yu came forward to mediate the situation, and said while looking at Zhu Yao. \u201cJunior-martial sister Zhu, earlier, the lord said he would bestow a mystic artifact, I wonder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he asked this, the rest of the people instantly straightened their ears, and looked at Zhu Yao with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not hide it either. Loosening the storage pouch, various mystic artifacts numbering in the high hundreds instantly flew out with the wave of her hand. Mystic artifacts, from third to seventh ranked, were kept within. Furthermore, the key point was that these were all mystic artifacts of the extreme grade.</p><br/><p>The crowd stared blankly at this scene. Refining artifacts below the fifth rank was not difficult, as long as its a sect that was above third-rate, then there would be people who would be capable of refining one. However, extreme grade artifacts could not be refined by any regular person. Even if it was a seventh ranked artificer, he might not even be able to refine an extreme grade artifact after refining several thousand times. However, there were actually more than a hundred of them here!</p><br/><p>There were already practitioners beginning to pinch their own faces, to ascertain they weren\u2019t dreaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lord said that these artifacts have a certain degree of spirituality, and would choose their most suitable wielders on their own. So, only the destined ones will be able to receive them.\u201d Zhu Yao explained.</p><br/><p>As expected, in the next instant, several hundred weapons began to dance in the sky on their own. After spiraling a few rounds, each one of them flew to the people\u2019s sides, and all those who obtained one had excited expressions on their faces. The rest could only sigh at their bad luck of not being chosen by the artifacts.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly felt like she was a tycoon scattering money on the streets.</p><br/><p>Willfulness comes with riches!</p><br/><p>Actually, these weapons were not prepared by her master. It had only been a month since she returned to Blue Parasol Sect, even if her master was so incredible, it was impossible for him to refine so many artifacts in a single month. These were all artifacts that originated from the ruins itself. She was just leading away a goat in pa\u2026 Ah pui, she was just presenting a borrowed flower to Buddha.</p><br/><p>As for this choosing their owners on their own situation, it was just something she came up with. She had merely set down a formation, and allowed the artifacts to fly randomly before falling back down. Otherwise, looking at the personalities of the people in the various sects, they would argue again over the ownership of these artifacts. Wasn\u2019t this a better option? There\u2019s no rush, nor the need to fight over.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao satisfyingly looked around for a moment, only to see a fourth ranked red damask was flying towards the right, and the person standing there was\u2026 Mary Sue!</p><br/><p>Yi Ling carried an excited expression, and her eyes had already begun to shine. Just as she was about to reach her hand up to grab it, Zhu Yao\u2019s fingers moved, and that red damask spun, landing in Lin Xiang\u2019s hands instead.</p><br/><p>Yi ling\u2019s face instantly darkened, and that pure and kind face of hers was close to collapsing.</p><br/><p>Mn, that\u2019s right, she\u2019s that short tempered!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao, what about me?\u201d A voice transmission suddenly sounded in her mind. Yue Ying stood behind her with a gentle smile, as though he had seen through everything.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned around and passed a bag of spicy gluten onto his hands. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Zhu.\u201d Lin Xiang received an extreme grade sixth ranked artifact as well, and he kept it with a joyful expression. He asked. \u201cDid you find out the cultivation level of the lord who bestowed us these artifacts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemigod.\u201d To be exact, he was a High Deity.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemigod?\u201d Lin Xiang was stunned for a moment. \u201cWhat is a Demigod?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe large realm after the Nascent Soul realm is the Demigod realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A large number of people suddenly held their breaths, as though they had no idea how to react. Though they faintly guessed that the lord\u2019s cultivation level was definitely above the Nascent Soul realm, no one had expected that his cultivation level was higher by a large realm. In this world where the highest cultivation level was merely the Nascent Soul realm, the crowd was a little fazed by this incredible information. Could it be that ascending into deities was not a myth, and could actually be done?</p><br/><p>The remains distr\u2026 ahem, the artifact distribution activity thus harmoniously ended. In the end, Blue Parasol Sect became the largest winner as they had the most people present. Because of that lie she came up with, about the destined ones would receive them, the thoughts of fighting over the artifacts were quelled. After the distribution, not only did the crowd not begin a fight, they even began to merrily discuss about the arrangements for the beast wave.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhu Yao was facing the so-called beast wave. She was unclear if it was because of the butterfly effect, but the scenario had already intensely diverted away from the former route. Though, the number of harem members Mary Sue collected did not decrease because of it.</p><br/><p>But, the beast wave had actually been brought forward by fifty years. Initially, Yi Ling would meet the Beast Lord after she had built her Foundation, and because the two of them would conduct practitioner-pair activities, she would immediately form her Azoth Core. From then on, she then walked on the path towards the summit of life.</p><br/><p>Yi Ling was however presently still an Essence realm disciple. No matter how ferocious the beast wave would be, the various sects would not dispatch an Essence realm disciple to the frontlines. With this thought in mind, she suddenly felt that she had gotten it off easy this time.</p><br/><p>However! Five days later, a piece of news came, allowing Zhu Yao to truly experience the incredible power of plot. Yi Ling successfully built her Foundation. An elementary-stage Essence realm disciple suddenly built her Foundation within five days. This piece of news came too quickly, and was simply unbelievable.</p><br/><p>The official explanation was: On that day at the ruins, she was enlightened, and comprehended the intricacies after her return. Then, she immediately built her Foundation.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had a feeling that this trip was not going to be simple.</p><br/><p>Eight days later, news came from the north. The demonic beasts had already begun to gather, and were soon about to launch an attack.</p><br/><p>Blue Parasol Sect dispatched all their disciples who were at the Foundation realm and above. Among the Azoth practitioners, other than the Sect Master who remained, all of them had gone over, and leading the party was Sovereign Xuan Xu.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao pulled Yue Ying to the gathering location, Xuan Xu was already leading everyone at the square in front of the hall for preparations. She wondered if it was her imagination, but she felt that Xuan Xu\u2019s mood today was especially good. Even that dead creased look he always had, had turned gentler by quite a bit. When he saw Zhu Yao, he merely frowned before diverting away his line of sight, and did not intentionally made things difficult.</p><br/><p>As expected, Yi Ling was present as well. However, what was different was there weren\u2019t a bunch of men surrounding her like usual. Instead, she lowered her head, and closely followed behind Xuan Xu.</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu loudly declared their departure, and summoned his own weapon. Then, he turned around a cupped Yi Ling\u2019s waist, and the two of them rode on the same sword. The two of them were master and disciple, so this was not a matter to be usually concerned about. However, Yi Ling\u2019s face flushed from shyness. She pressed her two hands on his chest and abnormally struggled a little, but there wasn\u2019t any effect, instead, she seemed to have leaned even closer to Xuan Xu.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao widened her eyes, and her heart skipped a bit. Suddenly, she thought of a possibility.</p><br/><p>These two\u2026 they couldn\u2019t have done it, right?</p><br/><p>She glanced at Xuan Xu who was full of spirits. This development was a little too quick, right? She suddenly recalled a certain someone who was trapped in that mustard seed dimensional space\u2026</p><br/><p>Many years had already passed, and he was still completely pure.</p><br/><p>-scratches wall-</p><br/><p>Master, learn a thing or two from this person!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao.\u201d Zhu Yao felt her artifact sink a little. Yue Ying seemed to have stepped on her artifact with one of his feet, and he looked at her with a hopeful look. \u201cCan you bring me along? I don\u2019t have my own artifact yet, and I don\u2019t have sufficient spiritual energy, so I can\u2019t fly that far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Just as she was about to agree.</p><br/><p>With a flash of white light, her fan suddenly opened. It traveled a short distance and immediately shot Yue Ying away.</p><br/><p>(\u2299o\u2299)</p><br/><p>On the red fan, a row of words suddenly appeared. \u201cThe Devil and dog are not allowed on the fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hoho, master, you\u2019re so childish.</p><br/><p>In the end, Zhu Yao could only pull out a flying artifact which she had additionally prepared, and passed it to Yue Ying. This would save him some spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry Yue Ying, for not being able to have you look cool by riding on my artifact.</p><br/><p>This journey had them fly for eight hours before arriving at their destination. However, it was where the beast wave was located, but a town governed by practitioners. The various sects and clans had already agreed to converge at this place. When they arrived, many practitioners were already there.</p><br/><p>The various sects spoke some courteous words, waited for all members to be gathered, before heading off together to where the beast wave would occur.</p><br/><p>As they approached their destination, Zhu Yao felt the air was growing heavier. She could feel the pressure coming from in front of her, and her emotions began to stir a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame, can you sense those demonic beasts? Are there many of them?\u201d Zhu Yao internally viewed her divine sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s many\u2026\u201d Sesame carried a look of uncertainty.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned, and could not help but ask. \u201cThose demonic beasts can\u2019t possibly act like the Risefire Beast, and like to have people grab their paws, right?\u201d If that was the case, forget about stopping the beast wave, she definitely wouldn\u2019t make a move at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Phew, that\u2019s good to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf mistress releases that the aura back then, their only desire would be to bear monkeys for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, can you promise me?\u201d Sesame suddenly said with a serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me give you your first monkey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Go find your own \u2018divine\u2019 partner.</p><br/><p>This lady doesn\u2019t like monkeys! She made a decision. She would definitely seal this World Favourable Impression forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress! You\u2019re so heartless, so unrighteous, and so nonsensical.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Do you believe I will take you out and throw you over to Yi Ling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sesame let out a miserable cry. \u201cI don\u2019t like two-legged beings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A long while later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI forgot to mention this. From my senses, the aura of the beast wave over there is a little chaotic. It\u2019s very unnatural.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Would it have killed you to this tell me this important piece of information earlier!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Each of the four people had his or her own unique aura, though the colours were a little strange. The demonic beast Bai Li\u2019s was faint green, Cao Qi\u2019s was a shallow yellow, while Cheng Yufeng\u2019s was light blue.</p><br/><p>The most dazzling one belonged to the female lead, whose aura comprised of several colours. It was as if she was wearing a flower-patterned jacket filled with patches here and there. Compared to the complete oval-shaped aura she saw on the Elder\u2019s body, hers were filled with lights of irregular shapes and sizes. Zhu Yao meticulously counted, but realized that the lights were overly complicated and she could not count them all at all.</p><br/><p>Even with the three others combined, theirs were not even larger than her light. Furthermore, the lights of the other three people seemed to be a little fragmented. They looked as if they were being blocked by something, missing bits and pieces. Cheng Yufeng\u2019s aura especially only had a single tip remaining, as if it could extinguish at any moment.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. If she had suspected her own guess earlier, then the present situation of the female lead had completely proved her conjecture.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Fa Yu woke up from his meditation and stared at the telescope in her hand. \u201cThis can\u2019t be the mystic artifact that you have refined, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is!\u201d Zhu Yao waved the telescope in her hand.</p><br/><p>Fa Yu\u2019s face instantly darkened. \u201cYou pulled me this far off to look for materials, all in order to refine a broken toy that could not be considered a first rank mystic artifact?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was about to explode, Zhu Yao sighed. \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t be so anxious. \u2018Artifacts\u2019 cannot be determined by their looks. Who cares if they\u2019re seventh, eighth or ninth rank if they\u2019re useful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t even a first rank.\u201d Fa Yu had a scornful look.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately pushed the mystic artifact to his eyes. He glanced into it suspiciously, and was shocked the next moment. \u201cThis\u2026 is luck?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded.</p><br/><p>Fa Yu\u2019s expression sank even further. \u201cSo she can truly steal people\u2019s luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>So this boy did not believe her all along till now? What happened to the promise of being people standing on the same boat? Zhu Yao was a little disappointed. Fa Yu however did not speak any further, though his expression had turned even colder than before, as if he was coming up with countermeasures.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao continued to inspect Fan Zhishan through the telescope. Now that they could see luck, she believed that there would definitely be a way to stop luck from being stolen.</p><br/><p>Eh, what\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>Three thin strands of different colours circled around the female lead, and they wouldn\u2019t have been easily discovered unless one looked carefully. The source of the three strands were actually the three male leads, as if several transmission tubes were linking the four of them.</p><br/><p>Was the female lead stealing luck right now? She looked carefully, and though it wasn\u2019t obvious, the auras of the three people had indeed turned smaller, while those thin strands were becoming larger as well. They could hardly be seen from how thin they were earlier, yet they were now as thick as a finger. Correspondingly, the auras of the three men were flowing away at immense speed, and in just less than a moment, a fifth of their auras had disappeared. Cheng Yufeng\u2019s light blue aura had even extinguished in a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>The female lead suddenly let out a unique moan. Her voice carried a slight sharp tone, and it was especially obvious amidst their gasps for air. However, the others who were immersed in lust did not notice it at all. Instead, they moaned a few times in concert before ending this day-and-night long heavy taste exercise.</p><br/><p>Almost at the same time, those three transmission tube-like strands disappeared into the air, and the faint green, blue and yellow lights on the female lead\u2019s body strengthened a little. The faint blue aura of hers especially seemed to have taken up half of the rest of the other auras combined.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt as if a lightbulb had lit up in her mind. She suddenly understood why this was an R18 scenario. The female lead was actually seizing the luck of others through the exchange of yin and yang. It was no wonder she had so many male leads around her.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>That shouldn\u2019t be all to it. Didn\u2019t she also pull out that bugged weapon to attack her? Could there be different methods to seize luck for different sexes? Or could it be that the female lead still had other considerations?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not figure it out, while the passionate men and woman over there had already begun to wear their clothes and leave the place. Zhu Yao could not help but look towards Cheng Yufeng. She did not know if it was because he had lost all of his luck, but she actually saw a strand of the aura of death between his brows.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to look even more carefully, Fa Yu suddenly reached out his hand and pressed her into the dirt once more.</p><br/><p>The hell! What happened to the promised love between teammates?</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re leaving.\u201d Fa Yu transmitted his solemn voice. Only after the sound of their footsteps grew further away, did he release his hand.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao whose face was once again covered in dirt: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This asshole definitely did it on purpose!</p><br/><p>Fa Yu dispelled the surrounding formations and walked out. Zhu Yao stood up and caught up to him. The high grade concealment talisman instantly lost its effects at this moment, turning into ashes. The time was just right!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s return.\u201d Zhu Yao bit down two mouthfuls of dirt during this trip, and her heart ached.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Fa Yu coldly narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not going to bring back a few more Rising Symbol Rocks, just in case?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that only a single piece is born every several tens of thousands of years?\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at him. Could there actually be a second piece?</p><br/><p>\u201cA single piece is born every several tens of thousands of years, but I didn\u2019t say there\u2019s only one right now! This place has already existed for hundreds of thousands of years.\u201d Fa Yu looked at her as if she was an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She wanted to exterminate this teammate of hers, what to do?</p><br/><p>He pointed at the highlands behind her. \u201cThere\u2019s one right above you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head to look. As expected, not far away from her, there was a Rising Symbol Rock that was four to five times bigger than the previous one. There was no harm in being prepared, and furthermore, she could not guarantee that Fa Yu would be this nice to accompany her again.</p><br/><p>Thus, she did not hesitate and turned to walk towards the stone mountain. Just as she took two steps, her feet suddenly turned heavy as a powerful pulling force came from below. Because she did not have a stable footing, she was slammed onto the ground and was unable to move. The radiance of a formation around her shone brightly. Her heart clenched as she suddenly thought of Fan Zhishan who just left. Could they have been discovered? She turned back her head hoping to warn the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a formation, hurry\u2026\u201d Before she could even say run, she saw Fa Yu\u2019s cold expression. The \u2018everything in this world was trash\u2019 look was missing from his face, and instead, his entire being had turned even colder than before. Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cYou were the one who placed down this formation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fa Yu did not reply, and simply walked over towards her with a solemn expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar\u2026\u201d Sesame sensed the danger as well as it roared out loud. Just as it was about to turn back to its original size, Fa Yu simply snorted and cast an art. Something flashed from Sesame\u2019s core and it instantly slammed onto the ground. No matter how it struggled, it could not take a single step. A large fire instantly lit up around it, covering its entire body.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame!\u201d Zhu Yao was frightened, as she turned to look at Fa Yu who had suddenly changed in personality. \u201cWhat did you do to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too difficult to handle, so I simply added a few small formations in its Inner Core.\u201d He replied without a mind, yet his voice was chilling to the bones.</p><br/><p>Inner Core? Could it be when he was healing it? Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank. \u201cJust what are you planning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fa Yu however did not reply. He walked straight towards her and then cast an art with both his hands. Seals flew out of them and circled around her surroundings.</p><br/><p>These mystic seals are\u2026</p><br/><p>Soul Expelling Art!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re planning to expel me out of Ling Tian\u2019s body!?\u201d Zhu Yao widened her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so many days, you have stayed for long enough.\u201d Fa Yu said solemnly. \u201cHow can I allow you to stay in her body any longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFa Yu, I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Fa Yu glared at her with cold eyes, as if he could not wait to devour her alive. \u201cYou understand the concept of luck and is even able to create a heaven-defying mystic artifact that can view luck itself. You must have been an incredible expert in your past life. With the capabilities you possess, is your reason for possessing her body truly to simply save her? In this world, are there any vile ghosts that don\u2019t think of taking over the living bodies? Those words of yours can only fool Tiantian. When the time comes, will you really give up on the opportunity to take over her soul?\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression grew colder the longer he spoke, his eyes were filled with hatred, as if he had turned into another person.</p><br/><p>No, this was his true self. The person he had been in these recent days was just an act.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou never believed me right from the start?\u201d As expected of the emperor of acting, she actually did not spot anything off, and had been wholeheartedly helping Ling Tian girly deal with the female lead. She never expected that he would pretend to cooperate with her while planning to expel her.</p><br/><p>Ling TIan girly\u2019s explanatory work was clearly not enough, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, I only believe in myself!\u201d Fa Yu flipped his hand, and the surrounding mystic seals began to circulate even faster. She could feel a force desperately pulling her out of the body.</p><br/><p>\u201cFa Yu.\u201d She suddenly felt a little panicked in her heart. Just who in the world did she offend, hey? \u201cHave you ever thought about what would happen to Ling Tian after I leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression turned colder. \u201cNaturally, I will protect her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you can protect her?\u201d Zhu Yao coldly laughed. If he truly could stop the female lead, then there wouldn\u2019t be a need for her to be in this world. When she first arrived, Ling Tian girly was trapped to death within Spirit Heaven Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d A hint of hesitation flashed across Fa Yu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to explain further, beastial roars suddenly came from afar one after another. Following after, the earth began to tremble as large explosive noises moved towards their direction. Even Fa Yu could not get a stable footing.</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan, Cao Qi and the demonic beast Bai Li came flying back from the forest. Seeing Zhu Yao and Fa Yu in front of them, they were clearly stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you people!\u201d Her expression changed, and a hint of killing intent flashed across her eyes.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, one figure after another appeared in a flash. A huge concentrated crowd of demonic beasts suddenly came into the scene, surrounding Fan Zhishan, Zhu Yao and the rest. Within the beast crowd, there were human-shaped ones dressed in various clothes, and there were even beasts of various sizes. They were all ninth or tenth rank demonic beasts, without a single exception.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, all of them looked furious, their pair of bloodshot eyes glared intensely at the few people in front of them. Their immensely fuming growls were deafening to the ears.</p><br/><p>A black-robed man walked out of the beast crowd, and he flung out his hand.</p><br/><p>With a \u2018pa\u2019 sound, a bloody object fell right in front of them. After having a clearer look, Zhu Yao took in a deep breath.</p><br/><p>That was actually a person. A person who had been bitten into shreds. He was one of the male leads who was still playing restricted-level games with the female lead \u2013 Cheng Yufeng.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s dead!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt her stomach churning.</p><br/><p>Fan Zhishan\u2019s face instantly turned as pale as snow, as she took a step back in panic. She hurriedly turned her eyes away, as though she wasn\u2019t willing to see the corpse on the ground. Even Cao Qi\u2019s and Bai Li\u2019s expression carried a hint of panic.</p><br/><p>That black-robed man first glared at Bai Li with vicious eyes, and then turned to spit onto the ground. \u201cPui, traitor! Hurry and hand over the Sacred Dragon Scale.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

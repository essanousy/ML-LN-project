They had automatically gone to find Yu Yan and Yue Ying to activate the permits. That so-called Plane Imprint had directly entered her divine sense, openly floating at its very core.</p><br/><p>A shoe print of size 42 was floating in her primordial spirit, Zhu Yao simply felt uncomfortable all over. This feeling of being stepped on by someone at every moment was simply heartstopping. Because of this point, she was never going to accept that lowly person being together with Guoguo. Even she had to tear the two of them apart, she was going to object to their relationship to the very end!</p><br/><p>Hmph! She was a serious person like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, even though it looks a little\u2026 It\u2019s still an imprint.\u201d Realmspirit patted on her shoulder, and suddenly suggested. \u201cIf you really dislike it, why don\u2019t I\u2026 modify it for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned around. \u201cModify?\u201d How are you going to modify it?</p><br/><p>Realmspirit chuckled. With a wave of his hand, a light breeze swept past. A new mass of light appeared in Zhu Yao\u2019s primordial spirit, and the light slowly gathered and stretched. Then\u2026</p><br/><p>It turned into another shoe print.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit had a satisfied look. \u201cNow it\u2019s better!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBetter, your sister!\u201d Flips table! One shoe print is already troubling enough, why the hell did you want to make it a pair? \u201cDo you believe me when I say I\u2019m going to slice you to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts, it hurts, it hurts\u2026\u201d Realmspirit breathed in cold air as he screamed. \u201cDon\u2019t hit my face\u2026 Aiyoyoyoyo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and remove that shoe print.\u201d Momma\u2019s egg. Earlier I was stepped on, and now I was stepped on a second time. Also, one of them is size 43, while the other is size 42? Even if the new one is colorful and has more patterns, please pay attention when you\u2019re stepping on someone, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something very useful, the Three Realms Imprint\u2026\u201d Realmspirit said innocently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree Realms Imprint? What\u2019s that?\u201d Zhu Yao loosened her grip. She suddenly had a bad feeling. She calmed her heart down and then looked at the new shoe print. She saw the curvy lines around the center of the imprint form three letters \u2013 CEO!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell\u2019s with this CEO? You best explain to me!\u201d The hell, stop giving me weird things!</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, calm down!\u201d Realmspirit looked at her with a pair of sparkling eyes. \u201cThis is the ultimate reward pack! Three Realms Imprint! With this, my powers are for you to use, and your friendship level with the Three Realms is instantly maxed out. Your journey to the Three Realms will be worriless and painless! It\u2019s an essential product for travelling between planes, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it sound rather unreliable?\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes. \u201cSay it again in human language!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, you can freely move about in the Three Realms with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d There\u2019s something that good? \u201cAre you certain there\u2019s no side effects?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho, why would there be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there isn\u2019t, why are you standing so far away from me?\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at the distance between them. They were suddenly three meters apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Just as Realmspirit was planning to take another step back, he stiffened. After a while, he said. \u201cWell, there is that really small side effect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen it comes to the matters of the Three Realms in the future, there\u2019s a need for you to temporarily manage them in my place.\u201d His smile grew even more sly. \u201cIn other words, you\u2019re the manager of this plane now! How awesome is that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So she had been forcefully signed into doing a labour contract. Awesome, your sister! Who told you I want to become a manager now?</p><br/><p>\u201cTake back the imprint. Immediately. Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis imprint can\u2019t be withdrawn. At the very least, before I awaken again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned for a moment. \u201cAwaken? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit smiled with a satisfied look on his face, as his body began to turn transparent bit by bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey\u2026 What\u2019s happening to you?\u201d Her heart sank as she grabbed onto his hand. \u201cWhy are you turning transparent all of a sudden!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d She said without a mind. \u201cThis is normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this normal? You\u2019re about to disappear! Don\u2019t scare me, hey.\u201d Though he was a little detestable, she never thought that he would disappear. \u201cAt the very most, I won\u2019t have you remove the shoe print for now. I will become a manager and help you with stamping papers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026\u201d Realmspirit held onto her hands. \u201cI came into this world as a spirit and gained sentience because of this plane\u2019s crisis. Now that you have helped me construct a brand new Heavenly Dao, I naturally have no need to continue existing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018no need\u2019? You best not die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m the Three Realms. As long as the Three Realms exist, how can I possibly die?\u201d Realmspirit said without a mind. \u201cNow that order has been restored, there\u2019s no longer a need for a spirit of the realms. I will just be returning to the main body of the Three Realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>How\u2019s that any different from dying?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao clenched her fists. \u201cIt\u2019s all because\u2026 I changed the Heavenly Dao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026 It\u2019s fine. I will always be here.\u201d Realmspirit smiled. \u201cThe Three Realms in their entirety are all me. I was incredibly sick in the past, and you helped me find the cure. Right now, I am just returning to my healthy state.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was silent for a moment. \u201cIs there a need for you to disappear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the manifestation of the old Heavenly Dao. Only after my return can the new order truly begin.\u201d His body grew even more transparent, and only a faint image of his body was left. \u201cThat\u2019s why, I\u2019m requesting this of you. Before the awakening of the new Realmspirit, please help me safeguard this world, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not express the feelings in her heart in words, though something bitter was surging within her. \u201cAre these like your final words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can put it that way!\u201d He smiled. \u201cThis is my final request, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a step forward and hugged him. She was only able to suppress the emotions in her heart after taking a deep breath. \u201cRealmspirit, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was dumbfounded for a moment. Right after, he revealed a brilliant smile that was as warm as the sun of dawn.</p><br/><p>How could Zhu Yao not understand the true purpose behind her managing the Three Realms? He was the spirit of the Three Realms, and the moment he were to disappear, no one would possess the ability to move across planes. In order words, she might not be able to return to her former world, let alone bringing her master over. After all, without a guide, the permits would be useless. That was why he entrusted the entire Three Realms to her and have her become their manager. That way, she would have the ability to cross planes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we still friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019ve always been.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao continued to embrace him like that, until his figure grew fainter and finally turn into tiny spheres of light, disappearing before her eyes. She stood still for a few moments before regaining her senses. Her heart suddenly felt a little empty. She could sense that Realmspirit had truly disappeared this time.</p><br/><p>No, disappearance wasn\u2019t it. He had returned to his main body \u2013 every single plant, tree, and everything in the Three Realms. Just as he had said, he was everywhere.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 He could no longer bicker or chat with her.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, there were times where Realmspirit\u2019s actions had made her feel disgusted, but in the end, all of them were excusable. Just as he had said, the Three Realms were walking on a path of ruin, and he had simply sought help from her as a friend.</p><br/><p>Now that she thought about it, she had known him in the modern era for five years. There were clearly countless opportunities for him to have her transmigrate over, but he didn\u2019t. Rather, he only transferred her after obtaining her permission. Though there were some cover-ups, she could understand the reasons behind them now. If Realmspirit had told her of his identity right from the start, she most likely wouldn\u2019t have seen this world clearly. She would simply be an outsider giving a few suggestions. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to experience it with her own body and see things with her own eyes. Even if she had the opportunity to walk across the Three Realms, she would have simply done it in the perspective of a player.</p><br/><p>That way, the opinions she give would most likely be limited, and there wouldn\u2019t have been a guarantee that this world\u2019s Heavenly Dao would be completely fixed. Furthermore, Realmspirit only had one chance. He was the spirit of the Three Realms, the materialization of the Heavenly Dao. If the Heavenly Dao had to be reconstructed, then he would definitely disappear.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit made a very huge gamble by taking her in. He betted himself and the lives of all the living beings in the entire plane on her. Even if he couldn\u2019t see the results now, he still betted everything without turning back.</p><br/><p>How could she possibly dare to fail such huge trust that was placed on her? That\u2019s why\u2026 seeing that they were friends, she had no choice but to continue working for him.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath and carefully sensed the Three Realms Imprint in her primordial spirit. Everything in the Three Realms was displayed before her, and at that moment, she felt like she could control everything. This was different from pure power. Rather, it was like a form of will. Everything could be controlled at her whim. It\u2019s as if she was looking at\u2026 a game\u2019s main engine. All of the living beings here were like player accounts, while she had entered the game\u2019s back-end control system. She could alter any of the data and even change the game\u2019s modes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had a simple glance before immediately withdrawing from it. This authority was too huge, and she had to take her time to study it. She was truly a little worried that she would end up collapsing the game entirely if she changed something.</p><br/><p>This was something that Realmspirit did not dare to casually change back then, so naturally she wouldn\u2019t make huge changes either. Back then, Realmspirit simply called out the Light of Purification to exterminate resentment, but it ended up birthing side effects such as the rumours of the Realm of Gods being in the Lightning Divine Tower. This led to Deities being washed away of their seven emotions and six desires, along with their qualifications of entering the reincarnation wheel. As a newcomer, there needn\u2019t to be said. Furthermore, the new Heavenly Dao had already been formed, so this was not the time to make changes either.</p><br/><p>She just had to safeguard it properly, and if she were to be in a good mood, she would just have to fix a few of the remaining bugs. However, just how would she find out what were bugs?</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a familiar notification bell could be heard. The size 43 shoe print in her primordial spirit suddenly shot out a blue ray of light. A conversation window instantly appeared before her. This time, the choices and words on it were a lot more than before, and after looking at it properly, she found out that it was actually a long form. Written on it with large and bolded font was: System\u2019s New User Registration Form.</p><br/><p>Below it were a dozen rows of cumbersome fields that required her account name, password, name, etcetera.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Is this a census?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>She recalled that Realmspirit once mentioned the system was gifted to him by the manager of her plane. A certain unknown creature living in Guoguo\u2019s apartment suddenly flashed in her mind. The hell! This thing is actually made by him.</p><br/><p>No, this can\u2019t do! I\u2019m definitely going to head back and launch a complaint.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao resentfully filled up the form. At that moment, the screen flashed, and a few windows appeared before her eyes. All of the windows were different, though the same string of white words was written on them: Suspicious case of a bug! Not a threat as of now.</p><br/><p>It seemed like it was an smart system of some sort that could predict and monitor the loopholes of the Three Realms.</p><br/><p>She then sent a will and the screen disappeared, returning into her primordial spirit. With this, she no longer had to worry about finding bugs.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, she suddenly felt her shoulders being a little heavy. Realmspirit had handed the Three Realms to her. She could not guarantee that she could do her job well, but she did not want to let down the trust he had that made him bet everything on her. Clenching her fists, she accepted this role of CEO!</p><br/><p>Until\u2026 the new Realmspirit awakens.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! Remove that horizontal line for now!</p><br/><p>She just recalled something\u2026</p><br/><p>Realmspirit seemed to have mentioned that she was born as a spirit because the Three Realms were on the verge of collapse. Then, for the new Realmspirit to be born, wouldn\u2019t it only happen when\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell, why do I feel as though I have been tricked again!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

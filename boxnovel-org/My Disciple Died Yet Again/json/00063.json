Was there a need to use this type of method to identify her?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s return.\u201d Yu Yan sighed, picking up his own disciple, he rose in the air. In an instant, they returned to the peak of Jade Forest Mountain.</p><br/><p>Looking at his disciple\u2019s new look from head to toe once again, he could not accept it no matter what. She actually turned into a man. An unclear knot surfaced deep in his heart for some odd reasons.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you become like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. I fell into the Severed Lands, and after I woke up, I became like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master, we\u2019re no longer able to become good girl friends, I wonder if you\u2019re looking for a gay friend?</p><br/><p>\u201cSevered Lands?\u201d Yu Yan frowned even deeper. Recalling everything that happened in the Secret Realm, his heart was filled with unrestrained fury, and the cold aura he emitted became even more evident.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but feel a chill down her spine. Master looks so scary, is he about to burst out? She silently took a step back.</p><br/><p>And another step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot complying to your master\u2019s orders, and acting arbitrarily, you need to be punished!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s little heart trembled. \u201cUmm\u2026 Is it alright if you don\u2019t hit my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not say another word, it\u2019s just that the cold aura around his body was becoming even more rapid. It seemed like she was unable to escape from this. Zhu Yao could only slowly, and slowly, moved towards him, and heroically stretched out her left hand.</p><br/><p>Hit me then, as long as you don\u2019t hit my face.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was startled for a moment. Looking at the hand in front of him, his brows furrowed. With a wave of his hand, he moved a piece of rock over and sat down on it. Then, he strongly pulled his disciple\u2019s hand, and had her entirely pressed on his thighs. Aiming at a certain part of her body, he began spanking.</p><br/><p>The hell, why is he hitting my buttocks? Zhu Yao felt like crying, as he was not being lenient in the slightest, and her lips curled from the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo, stop\u2026 stop. Master, I admit my mistake.\u201d If he were to continue spanking, her buttocks would bloom.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan paused for a moment, and was hesitating if he was putting enough strength into his punishment.</p><br/><p>Rooar~~ \u2517|\uff40o\u2032|\u251b</p><br/><p>At this decisive moment, that mystic suddenly popped out of nowhere, and, ignoring the difference in strength, charged at Yu Yan as it began to roar.</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hand, Yu Yan slapped towards it. The mystic beast was instantly slammed a few dozen meters away, and once again, struck towards a tree.</p><br/><p>It crawled up miserably. As expected of a master and his disciple, even the way they attacked was exactly the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis demonic beast\u2026\u201d Yu Yan recognized this demonic beast as well. Holding his disciple up and protecting her behind him, he looked as though he was about to attack.</p><br/><p>A certain mystic beast, which was hurt from the fall, cried out. \u201cWaaaah, mistress, he bullied me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe bullied me as well.\u201d Zhu Yao rubbed her own buttocks, and gave it a helpless look.</p><br/><p>Master: \u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Master sure was ruthless, her buttocks were about to split into four.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou subdued this mystic beast?\u201d Yu Yan turned and looked towards his disciple.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shook her head. \u201cI did not. It wanted to follow me on its own accord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression instantly turned cold, and he raised his hand, as though he was about to summon a bolt of lightning. That mystic beast trembled, hugging its head with its two paws, it miserably shouted. \u201cI\u2019m her beast, I\u2019m her beast\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at it scornfully. At the very least, it was an eleventh-ranked demonic beast, did it have to act so pitiful?</p><br/><p>When the mystic beast saw that she did not have any reaction, it became even more saddened, and began to roll around the ground, crying. \u201cWuuuuu, you even know my true name, yet you still don\u2019t admit me as your beast. Bad person, wuu\u2026 I don\u2019t care. I want to be your beast, I want to be your beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was exasperated, and she almost responded it with this line. I don\u2019t want to be on top!</p><br/><p>She could forget about becoming a man, but was there a need to go on the Boy\u2019s Love route!?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I ever know of your true name?\u201d She was straight.</p><br/><p>The mystic beast stopped, leapt up, and replied with a serious look. \u201cWhen we were at the Secret Realm, didn\u2019t you call me? You even had me open the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>Open the door? Zhu Yao was startled for a moment, and suddenly recalled that joke password. The corner of her lips twitched.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 can\u2019t be called Sesame, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mystic beast tilted its head. \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell! Why were you named so casually? Does your parents know about this?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough a demonic beast\u2019s true name has a very strong binding characteristic, it\u2019s only restricted to demonic beasts below the tenth-rank.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s expression turned cold. \u201cJust what is your goal for following my disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression of the mystic beast, Sesame, instantly stiffened, however, it immediately returned to that utterly shameless look it had earlier, and it said even more miserably. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s because mistress if very strong, by following her, I\u2019m able to return to the Higher Realm much sooner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan waved his hand and summoned a bolt of lightning, striking it right next to the mystic beast. Instantly, a large crafter appeared, and his expression became even colder. \u201cTell the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I said\u2026 was the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang! Another bolt of lightning struck. This time, however, it directly struck onto its tail. That long tail, instantly turned into two sections.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy tail!\u201d Sesame cried out in pain, and turned to hug its tail which had lost half of its form. However, its feet slipped, and it tumbled into the huge crater that was formed earlier, its entire body was now completely stained with dirt.</p><br/><p>When it had finally managed to stop rolling, it turned and looked at its half severed tail which was still oozing with blood. Baring its teeth, it roared out loud, and went to pounce on Yu Yan regardless of its current state. \u201cI\u2019m going to duke it out with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a wave of her hand, Zhu Yao slapped right towards it, and once again, slapped it away. Hearing her master say as such, she had thought about it as well. The reason why it was following her was definitely not as simple as just ascension.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan used an Art, and had Sesame, who was still flopping about, fixed at its position. Zhu Yao walked over, and with her palm, she patted on its beast head. \u201cSpeak, what\u2019s your goal? An eleventh-ranked demonic beast can activate the Ascension Tribulation Lightning on its own, there\u2019s basically no need to rely on others to ascend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame paused for a moment, and then, refuted angrily. \u201cWhen we demonic beasts face our tribulation, there\u2019s only one out of ten chance to survive. Lightning naturally suppresses us demonic beasts, and it\u2019s even more so if it\u2019s the Tribulation Lightning of Ascension. I will be zapped to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan slightly narrowed his eyes, and coldly spoke. \u201cIt might be the case for other demonic beasts, but if it\u2019s you, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Sesame was startled, and instantly stopped its struggle.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly recalled what that old man once said. Sesame was a mystic beast that came from the Higher Realm, which meant that it had once faced the Ascension Tribulation, and had reached the Higher Realm alive. Then, even if it had fell back into the Lower Realm, even if it were to face another round of Tribulation Lightning, it would absolutely not pose any danger to its life.</p><br/><p>Having realized this, Zhu Yao slowly rose and took a step back. Little animals are too smart, there\u2019s a need for humans to make up for their IQ.</p><br/><p>Sesame looked at the two people back and forth. As though it felt that it could no longer hide it any longer, it instantly retrieved the cutesy and pitiful expression it had earlier, and its voice carried a hint of provocation. \u201cHmph, I didn\u2019t expect to be seen through. As expected of a Demigod-stage old monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old monster?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned, and responded. \u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p><br/><p>If a Demigod-stage practitioner was considered old, then this demonic beast which had ascended long ago, was as old as the horizon. He turned to looked at his own disciple. Mn, he was not old in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Sesame\u2019s expression stiffened, and once again clenched its teeth. It took a deep breath to hold it in, and leisurely said. \u201cIndeed, I\u2019m capable of ascending, however, I caused some trouble in the Higher Realm back then, and it\u2019s inconvenient for me to be exposed. So, when this little lady\u2026 uh, this little kid ascends, I wish to use the name of a contracted beast to return to the Higher Realm, so as to prevent being discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the meaning of that pause earlier, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d If it only had to find someone that could ascend to bring it along, then would it not be faster if it was her master?</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re easily fooled!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa! Zhu Yao once again gave it a slap. The hell, why do I feel that people that who speaks the truth, are always asking for a beating!?</p><br/><p>\u201cStop hitting, stop hitting!\u201d Sesame dodged her hand in a panic, and explained. \u201cThe words I told you earlier are not lies! The reason why I\u2019m following you, is because you\u2019re really strong. You have a great fate that an average person do not have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Great fate? Why did she not know about it? Other than dying frequently, was there any other fates?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if my disciple can ascend.\u201d Yu Yan took a step forward. \u201cShe does not need to risk doing this. She does not need to offend deities of the Higher Realm right after her ascension.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao realize this. The hell. This Sesame was clearly using her as a shield.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut before that, I will use all my abilities to help her become a deity.\u201d Sesame looked at Yu Yan. \u201cAnd in any case, even if I wish to stay here, you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank, and instantly, killing intent rose in all directions.</p><br/><p>However, Sesame completely did not mind at all, and continued to provoke him. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, the reason why I\u2019m like this, is because I do not have a single thread of spiritual power in my body. As long as I charge up my spiritual energy by taking in spiritual energy into my body, I will naturally restore myself to my previous form. I had just tried it earlier, and restored a bit of my spiritual power. You\u2019re unable to kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking in spiritual energy? Zhu Yao was startled for a moment. Did she not have to be struck by lightning? Back then, her master said that the lightning had incidentally charged up the spiritual energy inside her body, and hence, restored her cultivation. So, she only had to replenish her spiritual energy, and did not need to be struck by lightning.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>She wanted to cry for her own IQ\u2019s sake.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan went silent, and tightened his fists. Although it was impossible for him to lose, currently, they were not in the Tasyoluk Secret Realm. If they were to fight, he was afraid that it would pull the entire Ancient Hill Sect into it. But to have such a threatening individual staying by his disciple\u2019s side, he was unable to stay unworried.</p><br/><p>\u201cLay down the Life and Death Contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Seeing that he had compromised, Sesame was joyous, and agreed to it very happily.</p><br/><p>Closing its eyes, its four limbs were placed on the ground. It circulated the single strand of spiritual power in its body to summon its own core, and a blue pearl could be seen flying out of its mouth, floating right about its head. Sesame raised out its front paws to touch it, and the core instantly flashed a hint of blood red, and a drop of red liquid was taken from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my essence blood!\u201d Sesame turned and looked towards Yu Yan, and then, returned its core into its own body.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan spread out his palm, and the drop of blood automatically flew towards him, floating right above its palm. He turned and looked towards his disciple beside him. \u201cTake out your hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhu Yao was a little dazed from the scene, yet, she still obediently reached out her hand. What is this for?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan stretched out his hands and rolled up her sleeves, revealing her entire arm. He pressed the drop of blood into the back of her hand, and instantly, there was an additional red dot on her hand, blood red and dripping.</p><br/><p>Why did she feel like she was being tested for her virginity?</p><br/><p>Sesame was a little unhappy. Clearly, Life and Death Contracts had always been tapped on the forehead, why did he pressed it on her hand? Recalling that he was its mistress\u2019 master, it held his comments back in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, from now on, I\u2019m yours.\u201d Sesame rolled around on the ground, and returned to its former shameless look. \u201cYou have to properly pamper me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt like beating someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, I\u2019m going to recover my spiritual energy for now. You must think about me!\u201d After saying that, it took the half of its tail that was severed earlier from the lightning strike, and with one leap and another, it had ran far away.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what the hell happened? Can someone explain it to me?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a blood contract!\u201d Yu Yan rolled down her sleeves, and explained. \u201cAs long as this contract exists, if you\u2019re injured, the same injury will be applied on the body of the contracted. This is a contract for mutual death with demonic beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, if I\u2019m injured, it will be injured as well. Then if it\u2019s injured, will I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, it\u2019s an one-sided suppression?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen if I were to die?\u201d She recalled something.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, it will die as well.\u201d Yu Yan calmly replied.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, and bitterly raised out two fingers. \u201cMaster, I have already died twice, because of this, you can\u2019t have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression became even calmer, as he reached out his hand to stroke her head. \u201cReturn to the cottage, let me help you inspect your injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Master, is it really alright for you to divert the topic like this? Clearly, you\u2019re making a fool out of that mystic beast, right!? And, where did you see that I\u2019m injured? There\u2019s absolutely no need to inspect, right!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

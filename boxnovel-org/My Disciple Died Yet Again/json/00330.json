When Zhu Yao thought that he was about to continue cussing, he suddenly turned his around and looked at her with a \u2018you trash\u2019 expression. With a cold tone, he said. \u201cThat trash will succeed the Sect Master position three days later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d What trash? This change in topic came too abruptly, give her some buffer time to calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what method that trash used either. She was actually able to awaken the Spirit Guiding Beast.\u201d Fa Yu said with a cold look.</p><br/><p>By \u2018trash\u2019, he was referring to the female lead. The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, and she then modestly inquired. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Spirit Guiding Beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it a demonic beast? She had never heard of the existence of a demonic beast like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Spirit Guiding Beast is the guardian beast of Spirit Heaven Palace.\u201d Fa Yu threw a \u201care you an idiot?\u201d glance. \u201cIt\u2019s born as a ninth rank, and after maturing, it can advance into the tenth rank. As long as it goes through the lightning tribulation after that, it can ascend to the Higher Realm. The Spirit Guiding Beast can only be awakened by every generation of the Spirit Heaven Palace Sect Masters, and they will only form contracts with the Sect Masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian isn\u2019t able to awaken the Spirit Guiding Beast?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible!?\u201d Fa Yu glared at her. \u201cTiantian is the true Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace. However, the Spirit Guiding Beast lives in the Heaven Profound Cave, and it will only break out of its shell in a hundred years. When Tiantian was in Spirit Heaven Palace, that beast was still in its egg! It\u2019s not even close to day of hatching yet, so naturally it shouldn\u2019t be awakened by force. Who knows just what method that trash used to make the Spirit Guiding Beast break out of its shell prematurely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what was going on here? Zhu Yao naturally did not suspect Ling Tian\u2019s identity, otherwise the world wouldn\u2019t collapse after her death in the scenario she was showed. She was worried about what the female lead was after.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Tiantian is the true Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace, the true daughter of fate! The hell is that trash!?\u201d Fa Yu said matter-of-factly. As though he had a recalled some beautiful memories, he muttered in a fragmented manner. \u201cBack then, when my Tiantian arrived at Spirit Heaven Palace for the first time, I knew she was the best in the world. How could any other trash be compared to her? If the other trash wants to act as a cushion for my feet, I would feel my feet would be stained, you hear me? The position of the Spirit Heaven Palace Sect Master? She deserves the best in this world, of course. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be a need for me to be considerate by damaging my own cultivation to grow up with her. If not because I had to shut the mouths of those old geezers and prove that I\u2019m worthy of her, would I have left her and come to a stupid place like this Grandhall Sect to become a Sect Master or whatever? This man here only wants to protect, safeguard, and watch her every single day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently turned her head away. She seemed to have just listened to something incredible.</p><br/><p>His complaints came to an abrupt halt, and he suddenly turned to look at Zhu Yao, as though he had just recalled that she was just by his side. \u2018Oh. Shit.\u2019 was all over Zhu Yao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d He gave her a death glare, killing intent surged out of him like a hurricane as he warned. \u201c\u2026 are not allowed to tell Tiantian, otherwise, you will get what\u2019s coming to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, President! No problem, President! Even if you beat me to death, I won\u2019t let it slip!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately swore an oath. I won\u2019t tell the girly about how you\u2019re secretly in love with her and how you planned an entire loli-raising plan since you were young. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His killing intent grew heavier.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 Ling Tian girly seemed to have been listening to our conversation the entire time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The cool and tyrannical President Fa instantly turned into an exploded tomato, with his face turning completely red. In the next instant, as though he was a fleeing soldier, he charged out of the door. As though there was a ghost chasing after him from behind, he even accidentally tripped over the door sill and smacked onto the ground. However, he then immediately crawled up and ran far away, till his figure could no longer be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What happened to the promise of letting me get what\u2019s coming to me?</p><br/><p>A long while later\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian: \u201cLittle Yu is so cute\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, which part of that was cute? I only see a huge pervert, alright? For his loli-raising plan, he damaged his own cultivation to become a child so that he could play the role of a childhood friend. That\u2019s simply too heavy a taste, alright?</p><br/><p>It was no wonder Ling Tian was just at the Foundation stage, while Fa Yu was already at the Nascent Soul stage. Him being a childhood friend was just a roleplay.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ever since Fa Yu found out that Ling Tian girly was an audience to every single one of his conversations with Zhu Yao, he grew uncomfortable. Probably due to awkwardness or whatever, he did not appear for two consecutive days. Because of her status as the former Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace, she could not casually wander about either, and had no choice but to stay in the house from before in order to prevent getting exposed.</p><br/><p>On the third day, Fa Yu appeared with a perturbed look. However, rather than the expression he had as if he was looking at dirt when facing Zhu Yao, it was much normal than before\u2026 No, it was incredibly more so than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cTiantian\u2026\u201d He looked at her sheepishly with a tensed expression. \u201cAre you angry at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m Ma Liang!\u201d Zhu Yao raised her hand.</p><br/><p>His expression stiffened, but he immediately grew his gentle smile back. It was as if flowers had bloomed within his eyes. \u201cLady Ma, I\u2019m sorry. My attitude towards you in the past few days was bad. I apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yo, is the Sun rising from the west now? This pervert with a poisonous tongue has such a drastic change in attitude! Also, the hell is Lady Ma?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are here to help Tiantian, so you\u2019re considered as a benefactor of ours. I should be thanking you.\u201d He said with a sincere look. Suddenly, he took out a bottle from his side, and passed it ot her. \u201cBack then, I didn\u2019t hold back myself well, so I don\u2019t know if I have injured milady. I hope this healing sacred medicine is enough to express my goodwill.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She stared at the bottle he was passing to her, but did not reach out to grab it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain it\u2019s a healing sacred medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>His smile was filled with pure sincerity. \u201cOf course. This is the best healing sacred medicine in Grandhall Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why is the three words \u2018Soul Extracting Soup\u2019 labelled on it?\u201d Are you treating me as blind!?</p><br/><p>Fa Yu\u2019s smile retracted. \u201cTch.\u201d He had forgotten to tear it off!</p><br/><p>In an instant, he returned to the numbed expression from before. The changes in his expressions were like flipping through a book.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The hell, this bastard is definitely doing this on purpose, right? He\u2019s trying to make me leave Ling Tian girly\u2019s body, isn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>Realizing that he had been exposed, Fa Yu was no longer interested in continuing his act. \u201cHey, wear this!\u201d With a wave of his hand, he threw over an item.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao grabbed it on reflex, and realized it was a bracelet. The bracelet was covered with large number of formations, and the spiritual energy it was exuding was incredible. It was a seventh rank mystic artifact. When she wore it, a circle of light instantly swept across her entire body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis mystic artifact can conceal your looks.\u201d Fa Yu explained impatiently. \u201cDemigod Sovereigns might not be able to see through it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao summoned a water mirror with a wave of her hand. As he had said, her looks had changed. Her facial features now leaned closer to average, belonging to the type which, if she was thrown into a crowd of people, she would not be easily recognized by others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch behind this?\u201d Fa Yu would not give her something like this for no reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow, that trash will summon the various clans and sects to bear witness to her officially becoming the Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace.\u201d Fa Yu rolled his eyes, his face was filled with scorn. However, compared to before, his attitude was much better. Back then, the eyes he looked at her with had always been: You disgusting slug. Now, when looking at her, he first asked if Ling Tian was watching through his eyes, and then he changed his eyes into: You slug.</p><br/><p>Though both slugs, she was now no longer disgusting. Mn, Zhu Yao was a person that was content with just what she had.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough Cao Qi came up with the excuse of twins, those old geezers of Spirit Heaven Palace aren\u2019t stupid either. They are definitely aware that though the trash is able to awaken the Spirit Guiding Beast, it might not definitely take her as its owner. If we want to take back the position of Sect Master, we have to make use of this opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of having Ling Tian return to take in that Spirit Guiding Beast, in order to prove her identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was indeed a good opportunity. Now that Fan Zhishan believed that Ling Tian was already dead, she definitely would not set up much defenses. Furthermore, she definitely would not have guessed that Ling Tian would be so daring to charge back in. However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you do such a thing, it\u2019s akin to breaking off from Fan Zhishan. You must be aware that she was born in the first-rate deity sect \u2013 Sleipoup Sect. She has still many people backing her up. Spirit Heaven Palace is just a small part of her forces. If she were to turn back and attack Grandhall Sect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can talk about future matters in the future. Tiantian must not be sullied by her for nothing!\u201d Fa Yu frowned, and he said with a furious look. \u201cIf she were to truly become the Sect Master of Spirit Heaven Palace, Tiantian will have nowhere to stay in the future either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not persuade any further. Sure, hiding was good and all, but why not declare a fallout with her in the open? At the very least, by doing so, Fan Zhishan would not be able to make her move openly for a short period of time.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In the early morning of the second day, Fa Yu brought a large number of disciples to Spirit Heaven Palace. He intentionally picked out a portion of the disciples from various levels, including those with Essence and Foundation cultivation levels, and Zhu Yao was mixed among the Foundation disciples. With a total of thirty or so people, it seemed sufficient enough to sustain the face of Spirit Heaven Palace.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at Spirit Heaven Palace, they were welcomed by Cao Qi. This was the first time Zhu Yao met nth member Cao Qi, and she had to admit that he had good looks. With mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivation level, he looked like a true gentleman. With utmost courtesy, he led Fa Yu into the inner hall.</p><br/><p>Because Zhu Yao\u2019s status was insufficient, she could only follow the rest of the disciples and stand by outside the hall. She then sized up Spirit Heaven Palace. Similar to the other deity sects, Spirit Heaven Palace was built upon several floating mountains. The place Ling Tian lived was the main mountain the very center, but it was not the largest one. Not far in front of her, there was a floating mountain that was even larger than the main mountain. However, compared to the cave residences here that were abundant in spiritual energy, the spiritual energy there was so dense, the mountain was surrounded in condensed wisps of spiritual energy, yet not a single human presence could be felt there. Zhu Yao felt this was a little strange. Generally speaking, that place had much thicker spiritual energy, so why wasn\u2019t the main mountain built there, but build it in the present location it was in?</p><br/><p>This doubt flashed past her mind, however, she did not dwell in it much further. She could not help but raised her head and look at a cloudy place in the sky. She could faintly see the shadow of a pagoda. That was the cave residence of the Spirit Heaven Palace Sect Master. It possessed the densest spiritual energy, and it was also the place she first woke up in.</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign Pi Shi of Sleipoup Sect has arrived!\u201d Following after the passing of the message, someone flew over from afar. His body was exuding incredible radiance. Dressed in blue robes and bearing a straight back, he was filled with endless magmanity.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. This person carried his own lighting special effects during his own entrance. It seemed like this was Fan Zhishan\u2019s first member \u2013 the female lead\u2019s master. It would have been incredibly shocking, if not for half of the lighting going missing. As if it was blocked by something.</p><br/><p>Eh, wait a minute!? Just what in the world was that radiance?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a closer look, and the light exuding from Sovereign Pi Shi disappeared again. Was this an illusion caused by the Sun?</p><br/><p>When she finally regained her senses, that person had already landed on the ground. The various clans and sects, that had come to participate in this succession, moved over to welcome him, and gave Sovereign Pi Shi their respects and greetings.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

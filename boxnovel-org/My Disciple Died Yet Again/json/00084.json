These were considered as greeting gifts, and even Wang Xuzhi had passed her a spiritual sword.</p><br/><p>Except her!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gave a face. She really did not know she had to prepare a gift. Turning her to glance, she glanced at the little baby girl who was still in someone\u2019s embrace, and the three letters on her face were still causing her to feel irritated. Suddenly, an idea came to mind.</p><br/><p>Turning around, she looked at Zi Mo in the eyes, and said. \u201cHoho, senior-martial brother. I really have forgotten to bring a greeting gift, however, the moment I see this little niece of mind, I exceptionally\u2026 like her. Why don\u2019t I take her as my disciple then?\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter what kind of BUG this little girl was, right now, she was just a baby who had just been born. The reason why Xiao Yi would bring the Five Spirits away, causing the apocalypse, was because of the experiences when he was young, which caused his three views to be distorted ever since he was young, and could not be reformed. However, this child was still young, she could completely bring her up from young, and have her become a kind person.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, this\u2026\u201d Zi Mo hesitated a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure came up with a great idea!\u201d Hongchou from the side suddenly cut in, snorting lightly. \u201cYou did not even bring a greeting gift, yet, you still wish to take away their daughter. Senior-martial brother, do not listen to him. I see that I have a better compatibility with your daughter, why don\u2019t she become a disciple of mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned her head and stared at her. You damnable lolicon.</p><br/><p>Hongchou stared back at him. Miser who did not even bring a greeting gift.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo looked at the two forceful people back and forth, and was hard pressed for a moment. He never planned on letting her daughter have a master. And, both him and his wife were Nascent Soul practitioners, so why must his daughter take someone else as her master!?</p><br/><p>In the end, Zi Mo could only evade the topic by saying that his child was still young, and the matter could only be discussed after testing her spiritual veins. Then, he chased the two of them out.</p><br/><p>After returning, Zhu Yao, however, could not calm down. She had yet to deal with Xiao Yi, yet now, another one popped up. She was really being treated as a GM, huh? With so many bugs around, how could she fix them all?</p><br/><p>After that day, Zhu Yao had went to the Sword Mountain to see the little girl for a couple of times. Although she would always encounter that lolicon Hongchou, she had confirmed it, the exact same letters, BUG, were really written on the face of the little child. The only difference was, the one she saw back then on Xiao Yi was much deeper. And, that yellow exclamation mark did not appear above the little girl\u2019s head. Did this prove that she could still be reformed?</p><br/><p>She believed that there was no bad people from birth. However, the main point was, how would she reform her?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, are you here?\u201d From afar, she could hear little wimp\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>When she opened the door, he had once again entered with a big stack of documents. After knowing that she wished to take his own daughter as her disciple, Zi Mo enslaving her had become even more justifiable.</p><br/><p>Hence, her enslaving little wimp had become even more natural as well.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi looked as though he had been born to do great things. The big and small matters between the various Mountains, caused her head to ache, yet, he was able to manage each and every one of them smoothly.</p><br/><p>This was something she had to praise him for.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you come here so late in the night?\u201d Zhu Yao took the documents from his hands, and placed them on the table. \u201cYou could have sent them over tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was afraid that you might be in an urgent need for them.\u201d Little wimp smiled. Habitually, he poured a cup of tea for her, and then, poured one for himself. \u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, did you just return from Sword Mountain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head. \u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, you should just give up. Master only have this one treasured daughter after so many years, furthermore, master-aunt risked the danger of losing her cultivation just to give birth to little junior-martial sister, so how would they allow their own daughter to take someone else as her master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. What did this little wimp know? She did not want to bring up their child for them either. Didn\u2019t she have no other choice? And, there was something she was more worried about. Back then when she saw Xiao Yi\u2019s BUG, she had that precognitive dream. Now, even though she had slept everyday, she was unable to dream of the matters concerning the Sect Master\u2019s daughter.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was still not giving up, Wang Xuzhi sighed. Drinking a sip of his tea, he suddenly recalled something, and asked. \u201cOh right, big sis Zhu Yao. Why did you deactivate all of the prohibition formations at the entrance? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProhibition? I didn\u2019t deactivate them.\u201d Zhu Yao was startled, as she made eye contact with him.</p><br/><p>Then, who closed them?</p><br/><p>Her heart tightened, and just when she was about to stand up and take a look, a cloud of black smoke suddenly flew over. Zhu Yao hurriedly set up a defense formation, yet, she was still a step too late, and was struck by that black smoke.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi fainted instantly at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle wimp!\u201d Zhu Yao became anxious. Just when she was about to circulate her spiritual energy, she felt a pain at her chest. The mystic powers in her entire body, seemed to have been completely sealed, and could not be released.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe meet again.\u201d A dark female voice rang next to her ears, and then, she was struck with a palm at the back.</p><br/><p>In the next instant, she sank into a state of unconsciousness.</p><br/><p>It was Rui Yu!</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao woke up, she was at a dark place. Her four limbs were being restrained by talisman chains, and she was being hanged above a huge black pool. That pool was exactly the same as the the pool used to refine demonic beasts she saw at the underground city. The only difference was that the pool before were refining the remains of demonic beasts, while the pool now was floating with human bones.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhu Yao felt creeped out, and just when she was thinking of struggling, she realized that her mystic powers were sealed, even her four limbs were stiffened a little abnormally. It seemed like someone had casted an art on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, seems like you\u2019re awake?\u201d Rui Yu suddenly appeared in front of her. Stationing herself in the air, her smile was extremely bewitching, as she pointed to the surroundings. \u201cThis is a prison designed especially for you, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Rui Yu? Why did she capture her?</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like you remembered me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you capture me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rui Yu laughed, and then, suddenly, gave her a tight slap. \u201cWhy? After how you plotted against my Xiao-lang, shouldn\u2019t I capture you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Plotted against? She\u2019s talking about how she helped to matchmake Xiao Yi and Ling Long?</p><br/><p>\u201cI arranged a very good marriage for him, how could you say it\u2019s a plot?\u201d The hell. You captured the wrong person, right? If you have to capture someone, it should be Xiao Yi, shouldn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Rui Yu\u2019s expression turned cold, raising her hand, she gave her another slap. \u201cDon\u2019t play with my mind, I will never believe it. I have never suspected Xiao Yi\u2019s feelings for me. If you\u2019re the least bit sensible, then take out your treasures. Otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. \u201cWhat treasures?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rui Yu frowned, reaching her hands out, she cast an art. At that moment, Zhu Yao felt as though her entire body was exposed to intense flames, her entire body even began to spasm from the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t speak.\u201d Rui Yu laughed coldly. \u201cIn any case, I have all the time in the world to get you to speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that, she disappeared. As for Zhu Yao, she fainted from the pain.</p><br/><p>Ever since then, she would come over everyday to ask that question. If she did not get an answer, she would torture Zhu Yao. Sometimes, it was flames. Sometimes, it was lightning. Sometimes, it was ice. The punishment meted out everyday was different.</p><br/><p>And her cultivation just had to be completely suppressed, and she was completely unable to resist at all. If she had not once experienced the pain of a shattered Azoth Core, she would have already turned crazy from the torture.</p><br/><p>When Rui Yu appeared before her for the eleventh time, and was about to torture her, she finally could not help but curse out.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yi, you motherf***ing coward, you have the guts to capture me, but not to appear before me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rui Yu paused for moment, a hint of fluster instantly flashed past her face, and then, she immediately recovered. \u201cWhat are you blabbering about? I\u2019m the one who captured you, what does this have to do with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m motherf***ing stupid!?\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at her. \u201cWithout an insider, how would you, a single heretic practitioner, dare to infiltrate Ancient Hill Sect?\u201d In these ten days, she finally understood, why the formation at her courtyard would deactivate by itself. And at that same moment, Rui Yu suddenly appeared in her room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you\u2019re rather smart.\u201d A white figure revealed himself beside Rui Yu, and as expected, it was Xiao Yi. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re able to plot against me every single time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? What did I plot against you?\u201d Zhu Yao was even about to curse his mom. She saved him for so many times, why did they all turn into plots?</p><br/><p>\u201cStop acting!\u201d Xiao Yi\u2019s expression turned cold, as he said, emphasizing on every single word. \u201cSenior. Martial. Aunt. Zhu. Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. The hell, how did he know about it?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you wondering why I knew about it?\u201d Xiao Yi snorted. \u201cIf I did not happen to hear Wang Xuzhi call out your name, I really wouldn\u2019t have known, you\u2019re actually Zhu Yao, the personal succeeding disciple of Sovereign Yu Yan, who should have died a hundred years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned solemn. She knew she should not have told little wimp the truth. Although he would always call her \u2018elder\u2019 whenever someone else was around, in private, he would still call her big sis \u2018Zhu Yao\u2019. But just when did Xiao Yi hear it?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe matter about you taking over someone\u2019s body doesn\u2019t concern me, but you definitely shouldn\u2019t have plotted against me every single time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d The more Zhu Yao listened, the more confused she became. \u201cI have never\u2026 Taking over a body, and plotting against you, is there even any relations between them at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hatred in Xiao Yi\u2019s eyes deepened. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know how you despicably stole my Wood Spirit and Water Spirit from my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. As expected, he had already known the matters concerning the Wood Spirit and Water Spirit. But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute? Stolen from your hands?\u201d Just where did that come from?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think you could have done everything seamlessly?\u201d Xiao Yi\u2019s face was filled with resentment. \u201cThat old man who saved me from the Secret Realm, had long told me of your matters. It was just that my cultivation back then was still shallow, and I did not know that girl was actually metamorphosed by you as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, did he tell you this? Back then when your Azoth Core went berserk, I was the one who suppressed it. Otherwise, you would have already died from trying to maintain your Azoth Core.\u201d At that moment, Zhu Yao felt it was a little funny. \u201cAlso, you said I stole them from you. Were the Wood Spirit and Water Spirit ever in your hands? Or are you saying that your name is written on them somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi was speechless for a moment, his embarrassment turned to rage, as he said. \u201cStop denying it. In any case, no matter what, I will never forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the one denying it!? Xiao Yi, do you even have brains at all!? Can you actually think logically!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Xiao Yi once again tortured her, stopping her words. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in speaking any further. If you don\u2019t hand me the Wood Spirit, Water Spirit, and your Body-Takeover Mystic Treasure today, I will never let you off.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, aren\u2019t all these just for your own benefits? Zhu Yao coldly laughed. She wanted to roll on the ground from the pain, however, she was firmly tied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

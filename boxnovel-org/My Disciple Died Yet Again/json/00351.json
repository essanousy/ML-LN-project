He didn\u2019t know how his little little grand disciple ended up in this person\u2019s hands. He somehow managed to force him into a place like this where no one else was around. Hurry and return my little little grand disciple, so that I can at least negotiate terms with Little Yanyan!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d Xue Yi was instantly enraged after hearing this. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me to give divine sword maiden to you? In your dreams! I finally managed to find a female type, and she\u2019s the partner that I\u2019ve decided on! We love each other and will never be apart! You want us to separate? You will have to kill us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPartner!?\u201d Yu Jin was stunned. He silently turned to look at the sword. Little little grand disciple, do you still remember Little Yanyan of Lake of Great Splendour?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, who\u2019s your partner!? Speak clearly.\u201d Zhu Yao grew anxious. \u201cCan you please cure your delusions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine sword maiden, don\u2019t worry.\u201d His automatic word shielding ability once again activated, and with affection and no regrets, he said. \u201cAt this moment, I finally recognized my true feelings. I won\u2019t allow him to harm you even the slightest bit. We will be together forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTogether my ass. Who wants to be with you?\u201d Zhu Yao wanted to zap him herself now. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, please zap him to death. Immediately. Right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine sword maiden\u2026\u201d Xue Yi was however moved, and he was this close to crying tears from joy. \u201cYou actually want to elope with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Heartaches always occur so suddenly.</p><br/><p>Yu Jin: \u201c\u2026\u201d (\u2299\u25bd\u2299) Little little grand disciple actually has a change of heart.</p><br/><p>Xue Yi sniffled, and then his expression turned cold. In an instant, he resolutely stared at Yu Jin and said. \u201cCome with all your might! We will never separate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things that will cause others to misunderstand, hey!\u201d I want to die so much. Oh my master who\u2019s in the faraway Mars, please come and save this disciple\u2019s morals.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d The lightning clouds in the sky gathered once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, wait a minute!\u201d Are they really going to fight? \u201cPlease let me finish what I have to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, no one listened to her, as the two began to fight once more in the sky, as though they were addicted to fighting. It was evident that Xue Yi was on the disadvantageous side, while Yu Jin seemed to be toying with him. His only goal was to snatch Zhu Yao back from Xue Yi\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Xue Yi saw that he was unable to beat him and suddenly cast an art. He sliced his palm and drew a blood formation. Zhu Yao\u2019s entire blade suddenly began to shine with a white light. Large amount of divine energy entered her body as she slowly rose into the air.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart clenched. \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d She suddenly had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine sword maiden, I will take you in as my Life Artifact. We will have the power to fight him that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Life Artifact!\u201d A portable summoned beast?</p><br/><p>After binding her to my life, maiden will then be able to appear in my divine sense. Our feelings will bloom after a long period of time, and we will then get married and give birth to monkeys. Just thinking about it makes me a little excited!</p><br/><p>\u201cExcited, my ass!\u201d Please don\u2019t speak out your inner thoughts at a moment like this. \u201cWait, no! I don\u2019t want to become your Life Artifact, stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her rejection was instantly ignored by a certain someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle little grand disciple!\u201d Yu Jin was stunned as well. He saw through Xue Yi\u2019s plans as well and his expression instantly changed. If he allowed Xue Yi to succeed, then it would spell trouble. If Little Yanyan\u2019s wife gets binded to someone else? I will definitely be burnt to ashes, right!? At that moment, he regretted wasting so much time earlier.</p><br/><p>He immediately summoned tribulation lightning bolts in an attempt to stop him. However, it was already too late. The formation was about to be completed, Zhu Yao was about to turn into a ray of white light and enter Xue Yi\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>A white bolt of light suddenly tore through the sky and blew across Xue Yi\u2019s forehead, instantly interrupting the cast of the art. Xue Yi simply felt an immense might directly assaulting the center of his forehead and his divine sense was in intense pain. It was as though someone had sliced him apart alive. No longer able to maintain his stance, he knelt with one knee on the ground.</p><br/><p>He unconsciously searched for Zhu Yao and when he raised his head, he saw another person in the sky. With an upright posture in the air, he wore a white robe and had an ice-cold look on his face. In his hand was that second rank divine sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cMasteerr\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was about to cry. Oh my loved one, you\u2019re finally here!</p><br/><p>Yu Yan glanced at the sword in his hand and ascertained that it was his stupid disciple. He then looked at the person who was half-kneeling on the ground and recalled that scene earlier. In an instant, a chilling aura filled the place. The air seemed to have fallen to extremely cold temperatures, as every word he spoke felt like it create ice out of thin air. \u201cYou actually want to take her into your divine sense!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan had never felt as furious like right now, as he felt like he could decimate the earth and destroy the sky at any moment. He had searched for so long, had ended up empty-handed so many times, and even right before this, he was just about to flip the entire ocean over. When he finally managed to find his stupid disciple, he discovered that she was just about to be taken into someone else\u2019s divine sense and become his Life Artifact.</p><br/><p>A Life Artifact was linked to the divine sense, and the moment the bind was formed, it could never be removed. They would be linked forever. He hadn\u2019t done it himself, yet this brat that came out of nowhere actually dared to touch his disciple! At that moment, the pressure in the air alone seemingly felt like it could suffocate people to death.</p><br/><p>Xue Yi was receiving a rebound from the failure of his art in the first place, and now, he was this close to lying flat on the ground. Though it was said that a difference in level could suppress one to death, he had never seen something this terrifying. Unable to sustain any longer, his vision darkened. He had gorgeously fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Little Yanyan.\u201d Yu Jin could not help but call out. If this were to go on any longer, that person would be pressed onto the ground to death. \u201cUmm\u2026 Calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan turned to look at him, the ice shards in his eyes changing their target.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Yu Jin silently took a step back, and then another step back. Little Yanyan looks so scary, even my little heart is shivering. \u201cAs you were. I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d He immediately retracted his statement.</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt that the Little Yuyan that he competed with above the Lightning Divine Palace back then, when compared to right now, was as gentle as a light drizzle.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao called out in time. Though Xue Yi wanted to take her in as his Life Artifact, his initial goal was to save her. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen a second rank divine sword as his Life Artifact. \u201cLet us return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Yu Yan turn to look at the sword in his hand. He retracted the chilling aura, and then, gave Yu Jin a \u2018I will settle scores with you later\u2019 look, before making his way back to Lightning Divine Palace with his disciple. After such a long search, he finally found her. He had to hurry and return his disciple\u2019s soul back to her body, otherwise, there would always be bastards wanting to snatch his disciple away!</p><br/><p>Yu Jin was thus left behind. Lowering his head, he looked at the living corpse on the ground and helplessly sighed. He grabbed him up and then followed after them. Looking at the faraway figure, Yu Jin felt a little sour in his heart. Why did he feel that his status as a mighty Lightning Divine Palace Floor Master, was falling lower and lower with each passing day?</p><br/><p>He pondered for a moment. When did this situation begin? Mn. Back then when Little Yanyan just ascended, though he was still as cold, at the very least, he was a good child who respected his elders. However, ever since his disciple appeared, he grew even more terrifying. Every single day, he would pull out his sword at a moment\u2019s notice! Especially after that, when he requested instructions from that disobedient grand disciple and decided to marry little little grand disciple, Yu Jin\u2019s dignity as a Floor Master had completely turned into mush.</p><br/><p>So, the conclusion was because of some unspoken rules with his disciple?</p><br/><p>Mn\u2026 Maybe, I should consider taking in a female disciple or something? Then, I can logically escape being single, and maybe I can raise my social status a little too!</p><br/><p>The longer he thought about it, the more he felt that it all made sense. He felt that he had just found the key to the recovery of his dignity. Now\u2026 the only problem he had was to find out where he could find an obedient female disciple that he could take in.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That\u2019s right, what her master picked up was that piece of divine jade with a dimensional space within it. Mo Xianxian\u2019s biggest cheat. Other than missing half of its body, the rest looked exactly the same.</p><br/><p>Returning to Dawnfall Peak, Yu Yan cast an art, encompassing the divine jade he picked up with a barrier-like isolation divine technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Yu Yan solemnly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at that piece of jade. \u201cI don\u2019t know which wrong train Mo Xianxian got onto, but she wanted to kill me no matter what.\u201d Zhu Yao hence explained to her master everything about the bug this time, along with what she had seen from her precognitive dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that she must have hidden herself in the dimensional space within the jade.\u201d She must had thought that this was a foolproof plan, after all, in a huge fire like that, who would notice such a regular piece of jade? Even if it was seen, no one would think that there\u2019s actually another universe within it. Unfortunately, out of anyone whom she could have entered the dimensional space in front of, she just had to do it in front of Zhu Yao. Should she be seen as unlucky, or even more unlucky?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, is there any way to let her out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan turned his head, and looked at her strangely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to talk to her.\u201d Ultimately, Mo Xianxian was a pitiful person as well. She was once the pride of the heavens, revered by the people in the Lower Realm. With all of her might, she finally managed to ascend to the Higher Realm, all for the sake of finding her own husband, to pursue their former destinies. In the end, she found him, but the love had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>However, on the day of the practitioner-pair ceremony, clearly, she had already completely given up on Xu Nuoyan, so why did her attitude change once again? Did someone tell her something? Or could it be that she was still unwilling to see things clearly, and hence, wanted to vent all of the wrongs and faults on Zhu Yao?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Yu Yan frowned. According to his ideology, an enemy must be eliminated, so as to avoid future troubles from occurring. Since that woman actually dared to make a move, then she should have the resolve to die.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zhu Yao nodded. \u201cMaster, do you know a way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan turned to look at the divine jade on the table, and only spoke after a while. \u201cBack then, when I was inside, the void-shattering formation had already been completed to a large extent, if it\u2019s activated from the outside\u2026\u201d Yu Yan hurriedly cast an art, and then, slashed his hand towards the void, causing a bright light to flash in mid-air.</p><br/><p>Space twisted, and a white tear expanded towards the two sides. Faintly, the mountains and rivers on the other side could be seen.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a blue figure flew out. Zhu Yao was about to make a move to stop Mo Xianxian, however, she suddenly heard a furious roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d It was actually a male voice.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. The hell, her master did not inform her that this passage was linked to Thailand though? Why did her gender change?</p><br/><p>That person was dressed in a blue robe, and had a burly figure. His entire body was filled with rich muscles that could not even be covered by the robe he was wearing, and that face\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGoudan!\u201d Why was it him!?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d The man blanked, and even the sword he was striking towards her with had stopped for a moment, before he immediately regained his senses. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it! This daddy here will slice up the bastard for bullying little sis Xianxian!\u201d</p><br/><p>You think you alone have what it takes!? Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him, as she dodged to the side. With a swing towards his forehead, she sent a slap right towards it. In an instant, he was crawling on the ground. Then, she cast a binding art to fixate him onto where he was. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few months since we last met, and your guts seemed to have fattened up, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>With cultivation level lower than an Earth Deity,he actually dared to stand up for someone else. Just where did he get his confidence from?</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease me!\u201d Goudan fumed as he struggled for a few times. \u201cIf you have the guts, then fight me fair and square!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Didn\u2019t he launch a sneak attack against her just earlier?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s head ached a little. How could she have forgotten that Goudan had binded that dimensional space back then as well? So, it was very normal for him to be able to enter the space, and this guy seemed to still harbor some feelings towards Mo Xianxian. But in that precognitive dream, he basically wasn\u2019t mentioned at all! Could it be that the timeline had already strayed off since the very beginning?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shameless soft egg, if you have the guts, then release me.\u201d Goudan still continued to curse out.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but kick towards him. This lady here has yet to ask you about the benefits you obtained, and you dare to curse at me? \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you cultivating in Advent Cloud Hall, but instead, hiding in the dimensional space? Where\u2019s Mushmush?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Goudan snorted very strongly. \u201cDon\u2019t think that just because you\u2019re acting all familiar with me, I will forgive you. Let me tell you this. Bullying Xianxian is the same as bullying me! I will never forgive\u2026 Aiyaaaaa, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts\u2026 my ears, my ears!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pulled his ears, and and did various twists and turns. \u201cAre you going to speak, or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will speak, I will speak, I will speak\u2026\u201d Goudan submitted in a second. The moment Zhu Yao relaxed her fingers, he weakly glanced at Zhu Yao. \u201cLet me get up first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao released the binding art on his body. \u201cSpeak, how did you get entangled with Mo Xianxian?\u201d</p><br/><p>Goudan rubbed his own arm, and his eyes rolled to the left and right.Glancing at Zhu Yao, a small arc was made at the corner of his lips, looking as though he was about to do something bad at any moment. As expected, immediately after, he pointed outside and loudly said. \u201cWow, there\u2019s a tiger outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stood as still as a mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, there\u2019s a huge tiger outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not make a single budge.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not lying. Take a look yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao continued to look at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must believe\u2026 believe me. I don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stared ruthlessly at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, another one came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened, as she let out a long sigh. \u201cYou dropped your purse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Goudan immediately lowered his head to look for his money pouch.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sent her slaps straight towards him, and his head was instantly filled with bulges. \u201cIf you want to lie, you must first pick up the skill properly, alright? Nonsense such as tigers appearing, is something a three-year-old wouldn\u2019t believe even if you told him about it! You might as well say an UFO appeared.\u201d When this guy was born, his intelligence must have been thrown away along with umbilical cord, right!?</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, stop! Stop hitting, stop hitting\u2026\u201d Goudan dodged in an embarrassing manner. Like a mouse being beaten, he once again squatted back down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak. When did you enter the dimensional space?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does this have to do with you? That dimensional space was mine to begin with. As long as I wish for it, I can enter it at any moment.\u201d Goudan\u2019s shame seemed to have turned into anger, as he immediately picked up the sword on the ground, leapt a step back, and summoned a golden sword intent. The sword intent seemed to carry an imposing aura. \u201cHmph. You vile woman who bullies others, don\u2019t think I\u201dm afraid of you. In this world, other than the great deity inside that dimensional space in the past, who had since disappeared, I, Goudan, hasn\u2019t feared anyone else. Die!\u201d</p><br/><p>The great deity who disappeared? Zhu Yao was stunned for a moment. Turning her head, she looked towards a certain master who had been simply watching the show at the side the entire time, and pointed. \u201cAre you referring to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Goudan unconsciously turned his head, and his eyes suddenly widened. With a face that looked as though he was being struck by lightning, his hands shivered, and the golden sword intent which carried the condensation of his entire divine energy whizzed uncontrollably towards Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Why was the great deity within the dimensional space here? This wasn\u2019t logical!</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. In the next moment, the immense pressure of a High Deity pressed towards Goudan. His sword intent shattered soundingly, while he was slammed heavily towards the ground as well, puking out three liters of blood. As expected, this great deity was an eternal nightmare in Goudan\u2019s \u2018arrow\u2019 life.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was furious. This person sure had the guts to assault his disciple right in front of him. With a twist of his wrist, a heavenly lightning bolt was just about to strike towards Goudan.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d The air once again began to twist, and a pinkish figure descended from the sky. Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone. Mo Xianxian finally decided to co-</p><br/><p>Little bitch!? Why was it her?</p><br/><p>And just where did she pop out from, hey?</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng blocked in front of Goudan, and though the sword in her hand was slightly trembling, she did not take even half a step back. She looked as though she was prepared for death.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Was today the day the conference for former jade\u2019s dimension space owners supposed to happen? The number of former owners here were just about enough to form a mahjong table, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cLil sis Manfeng, hurry and leave!\u201d Goudan pushed Tao Manfeng away, while his legs began to tremble. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat this great deity.\u201d He was really afraid. Recalling the time she first entered the dimensional space, he was zapped to the point he was between life and death by this great deity. That scene was simply comparable to the dark past of one\u2019s childhood, a memory which he did not even dare to recall. If lil sis Mo Xianxian had not binded the dimensional space with her blood, and if he was not forcefully pulled into the dimensional space, he most probably would not have realized the secret behind the jade in his entire lifetime.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Tao Manfeng glared at Goudan. \u201cNot everyone here is as stupid as you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mn, Zhu Yao agreed with these words of hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh Deity!\u201d Tao Manfeng bowed towards Yu Yan. \u201cGoudan had only become a spirit not long ago, so he might make many offences in his various ways of conduct. I seek High Deity for your forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not even spare her a glance, and simply continued to summon his heavenly lightning bolt, not to mention, that one single bolt had even split into two. Very evidently, he wasn\u2019t forgiving at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh Deity!\u201d Tao Manfeng flustered, and she had no choice but to light up a protective barrier to shield both her and Goudan.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little stunned while watching this scene. She knew absolutely clearly what kind of person Tao Manfeng was, yet, she actually stood up for someone she was unrelated to, and the other party was even Goudan. Th-This\u2026 This was a little too miraculous, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>For a moment, the thought of a drama regarding a triangle love relationship popped up in her mind. Mo Xianxian vs Goudan vs Tao Manfeng.</p><br/><p>Why did she feel that the style of this drama would be so strange?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, wait.\u201d Zhu Yao had no choice but to shout \u2018cut\u2019. Yu Yan glanced at her, and was evidently not amused with his disciple\u2019s softhearted actions. Zhu Yao took two steps forward, and pulled down the hands he were casting an art with. After pondering for a moment, she tightened her hands, and her fingers intertwined with his. She then chuckled. \u201cGive me some face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. Looking at his hands which was intertwined with his disciple\u2019s, a sense of satisfaction strangely surged from the bottom of his heart. Mn. Allowing his disciple to rebel against him just once did not feel like something unacceptable.</p><br/><p>Hence, he turned his head, and could not be bothered any longer.</p><br/><p>Just\u2026 He did not wish to let go of her hands.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao struggled for a few moments and was unable to escape from his grasp. She had no choice but to turn around to block their intertwined fingers from view. Haah, her master was being petty again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell Mo Xianxian to come out, and I will let the both of you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Goudan fumed the moment he heard her words. \u201cShe\u2019s already injured, what are you planning to do with her still?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something that I wish to talk to her about.\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. I don\u2019t believe you. I know you simply want to harm her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haah, look at that temper of his. With a wave of Zhu Yao\u2019s hand, the jade on the table instantly flew into her hand. \u201cIf I wish to kill her, I wouldn\u2019t do something so troublesome. I would have simply destroyed this piece of jade, why\u2019s there the need to go round and round with you people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Goudan still carried that look of disbelief, though, Tao Manfeng nodded. \u201cFine, I will head in and speak to her.\u201d After saying that, she raised her head and glanced at Yu Yan, before disappearing into the dimensional space.</p><br/><p>A moment later, she appeared in the room, along with the injured Mo Xianxian.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

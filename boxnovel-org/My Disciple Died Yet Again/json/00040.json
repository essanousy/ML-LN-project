Because, it would occasionally cause you to say the things you should not be saying, do the wrong things, and go out of character.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s identity, because of the words she said out of reflex, was stripped off unscrupulously by a certain master.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao covered herself with the blanket, she was too ashamed to see anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cReason?\u201d He pulled out the stupid disciple who was attempting to hide herself in the blanket, and strongly looked at her. The incidental Lightning Tribulation yesterday, caused him to suddenly think of the violent storm of spiritual energy when his stupid disciple broke through into Foundation. Hence, with slight suspicion, he called out her name, however, he did not expect that it would actually be her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao struggled to squeeze out a pitiful expression, however, because of the aftermath from keeping a poker face for such a long time, she could not squeeze out any expression other than her poker face. Hence, she could only wave her two small hands about. \u201cMas-ter-ter~\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression did not change, as he stared directly at her.</p><br/><p>Evidently, acting cutesy was of no use.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Zhu Yao acknowledged her mistake, as she lowered her head and twiddled her thumbs. \u201cI realized I was like this the moment I woke up, and then, master, you came to get me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her aggrieved look, Yu Yan instantly believed her entirely. A short while later, he seemed to have thought of something, as his brows began to furrow again. \u201cWhy did you not tell master right from the start?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao hanged her head down even lower, as though she was attempting to roll herself into a real dumpling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust your master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Zhu Yao instantly raised her head, and then, she shook it strongly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s master\u2019s fault.\u201d Yu Yan frowned deeply, as he stretched out his hand to stroke her head. \u201cI did not protect you well, it\u2019s normal for you to not believe me.\u201d On that day, when he saw her corpse, it was the first time he had ever felt anger, and because of the loss of control, he destroyed the entire Silent Melancholy Forest. However, even if he did that, he was still unable to save his disciple\u2019s life. He was not a competent master.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d Zhu Yao became a little anxious. The incident back then, her master was not on-site anyway. A faraway water stream could not put out a fire nearby, it completely did not concern him at all.</p><br/><p>As to why she did not reveal her identity, it was because\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI had thought of telling you in the first place, but I don\u2019t even know why I became like this. And also, in my current state, I can\u2019t talk either\u2026 Eh? I can talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>On hindsight, Zhu Yao rubbed her face, she really was able to talk now. Earlier, she was still like a regular one year old, unable to say a complete sentence. Now, when she talked, there were completely no hindrance. Had she not grown too fast?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour cultivation has recovered.\u201d Yu Yan calmly said. As a Foundation Paragon, naturally, talking should be of no problem.</p><br/><p>Eh? Zhu Yao was startled. She tried sensing for a moment, and as he had said, there was spiritual energy flowing. She then circulated the spiritual energy, forming a ray of lightning, with a bang. The white ray of lightning, then struck directly\u2026 on Yu Yan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, my hand slipped!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMischievous!\u201d Yu Yan coldly glared at her, yet, his tone did not sound reproachful in the slightest. A ray of lightning cast by a mere Foundation-stage practitioner, obviously could not harm him. Actually, before that ray of lightning made contact with his body, it had already been dispersed by his pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disciple acknowledges her mistake!\u201d Although it did not land on him, acknowledging her mistake was still something she had to do. This was a problem regarding one\u2019s attitude. \u201cMaster, how did I suddenly recover my cultivation? Even though, back then, when I tried it out, it wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan sat at the side. \u201cIn fact, your cultivation has always been there. It\u2019s just that because your body did not even possess a single strand of spiritual energy, hence, you were unable to cast Mystic Arts. Earlier, when you received that ray of Heavenly Lightning, it coincidentally filled you up with the lightning spiritual energy you required. Now that you have spiritual energy, naturally, your cultivation will recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>In that case, she really had to thank that Heavenly Lightning for striking her so suddenly. Zhu Yao felt a little strange. \u201cMaster, even though I changed my look, why is my cultivation still here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I do not know either.\u201d Yu Yan shook his head slowly. In fact, not just her cultivation, even the divine imprint that he had placed on her when he took her in as his disciple, was still on her body. Logically, be it cultivation, or divine imprint, they would both disappear when one died, and it was impossible for it to be transferred along with one\u2019s soul. Even if it was a soul take-over, that person would still have to start cultivating from scratch. Just who had such ability to reincarnate her, and keep her cultivation as well? And what was that person\u2019s intentions behind this?</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore this matter is clearly investigated, you shall stay in the Jade Forest Mountain. You\u2019re not allowed to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! I have to be confined again.\u201d Don\u2019t, master. Just one confinement of yours lasted five years, your dear disciple can\u2019t hold out that long.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe matters regarding your body, are too unusual! And your cultivation raising speed is too quick, to prevent yourself from bringing in unnecessary trouble, staying here will be safest for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao went silent. Currently, indeed, it would not be wise for her to appear before people in her current situation. A Foundation-stage one year old, who would believe it? People might think she was in the possession of some heaven-bending mystical treasure. It was still best for her to keep to a low profile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao.\u201d Yu Yan stretched out his hand to stroke her head, which had grown short strands of hair. \u201cNo matter if you still believe in me now, master will do all he can, to protect your well-being.\u201d He would no longer allow her to disappear in front of him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head. Seeing that there were no impurities in his eyes, which was still as gentle and calm as ever, she could feel the cautiousness in his words. Was it due to the guilt for not protecting her well back then? Even though it was clearly not his fault, he actually placed all the blame on himself, and seeked her trust once more.</p><br/><p>Momentarily, her eyes felt hotter, some warm liquid was about to flow out of her eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took in a big breath through her nose, and roared back loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s Zhu Yao! My surname\u2019s Zhu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Remember your own disciple\u2019s name well, bastard!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s still call you Yu Wang then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s Desire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Yu Yan was determined to thoroughly investigate the matters that happened to his disciple\u2019s body, sometimes, plans could never catch up to the changes, as another new situation had occurred on Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>She was woken up by some heat. On the Jade Forest Mountain, it was spring throughout the year, yet, Zhu Yao woke up with her body covered in hot sweat. It was as though a fire was burning in her body, and the flames were unbearable. Ever since the showdown with her master last night, she finally returned to her own cottage to sleep. With her small hands and legs, even if she wanted to open the windows to disperse the heat now, she was unable to do it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pushed the blanket away. She thought of crawling down the bed, and feel the breeze outside. But, she felt that burning heat earlier had disappeared, a mass of air had suddenly stagnated in her chest, and the blockage was causing her to feel uncomfortable. Hence, she could only circulate the spiritual energy inside her body, attempting to disperse that mass of air somewhere else.</p><br/><p>However, she did not expect that it would actually work, as that mass of air, following the circulation of spiritual energy, was slowly moved to her leg. Before Zhu Yao could feel happy about it, creak, her leg which looked like a small lotus root earlier, suddenly grew by several times.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao strangely looked at her elephant leg. No, it should not be elephant leg, it looked more like the leg of an adult woman. It was slim and slender, and completely did not have the baby fat like earlier.</p><br/><p>Just what is going on? Why did it suddenly grow big? And why was it only a single leg!? God, get out here, let us have a talk about life!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao carefully thought about where the problem came from. Could it be that mass of air earlier? She tried to slowly retrieve that mass of air, and then, that adult leg disappeared, restoring to its former little lotus root.</p><br/><p>She then tried to guide the mass of air to her arm. As expected, creak, her arm instantly became the size of an adult\u2019s, while the rest of her body was still that of a child\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little excited, as she guided the mass of air to her head. Creak, she gained a huge head.</p><br/><p>She then continued to test it out, constantly rotating the mass of air around the various parts of her body. Hence, suddenly, a weird scene appeared in her room. The dumpling-like child on the bed, for a moment, turned into an infant with a huge head, an infant with a huge leg in the next moment, and an infant with a huge arm in the next.</p><br/><p>And when a certain master, who came over to investigate after sensing an anomaly, saw his disciple who had already gotten addicted to it, silently turned around and returned. What am I going to do with my disciple\u2019s \u2018chicken\u2019 IQ?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

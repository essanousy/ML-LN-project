Seven times in a single night? That\u2019s just a legend. Her master had only done once in a single night, but that one time lasted the entire night.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao finally understood what was truly called \u2018you won\u2019t die if you don\u2019t court death\u2019!</p><br/><p>On the second day, she was already lying on the bed like a dead fish, and there wasn\u2019t a single spot on her entire body that wasn\u2019t feeling sore. She did not even have the strength to raise her hand.</p><br/><p>Yet a certain culprit was in high spirits and filled with vigour. He continued to carry that ice-cold expression as he seriously checked her pulse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour body is just feeling weak, and your mind is simply a little fatigued. It won\u2019t pose a problem after having a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that, can you first get down?\u201d You clearly know my body is weak, so why are you still pressing on my body?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was stunned for a moment, and a seemingly undetectable hint of redness flashed past his face. With a shift of his figure, he carried his disciple into his embrace.</p><br/><p>After a slight cough, he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao, you\u2026 fainted earlier.\u201d That was why he inspected her pulse at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d They did it for an entire night, how could she not faint after that? Who could possibly plant radishes for an entire night?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan cast an art and tapped on Zhu Yao\u2019s forehead. She instantly felt her body relax, and the fatigue on her body was swept empty. Even those bluish and purplish bruises had disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeeling better now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zhu Yao vaguely responded. She was tired to the point of being unable to open her eyes.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan glanced at the person in his embrace. Recalling the matters last night, a blazing heat instantly surged on his face. He hurriedly turned his head away and silently chanted the Heart Purity Art. He was just practitioner-pairing. This was a very serious cultivation method. He simply displayed a responsible attitude towards his disciple\u2019s seriousness. He was just slightly stricter towards his disciple last night\u2026 Just slightly.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath and suppressed those unfamiliar emotions in his heart with all his might, along with his extreme desire to wake his disciple up again. He silently circulated the spiritual energy in his body, and realized there wasn\u2019t much difference to his cultivation after last night. Recalling for a moment, according to the description of the arts, while engaging in practitioner-pairing, they had to circulate their spiritual energy, swap their yin and yang, and merge their souls and physical bodies into one, in order to advance their cultivation.</p><br/><p>Last night\u2026 He seemed to have\u2026 forgotten about it.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Should he, wake his disciple up again, and practice it once more?</p><br/><p>On the third day of Zhu Yao\u2019s return, she picked up a dragon corpse at the backyard. Though it had turned exceptionally small, it still took up a large half of the grass field with its belly showing. It was lying on the ground with its four limbs raised towards the sky, looking as though he was not experiencing any love in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey hey, are you dead yet?\u201d Zhu Yao nudged it with her stretched foot.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Seventh\u2026\u201d That dragon pitifully twisted its head over, and slightly swung its dragon tail about.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not dead, then get up. Don\u2019t block my way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He felt that his dragon heart had suffered damage. With a flash of his body, he changed back into that purple-robed man. The swells on his face had finally dispersed, and he no longer had that pig face, rather, it had turned into a face with palette colours. \u201cLittle Seventh, at the very least, we still belong to the same race. How can you do this to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the same race with who?\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. \u201cI\u2019m a phoenix, while you\u2019re a dragon. We\u2019re not the same species, alright?\u201d Furthermore, she was presently not a phoenix either.</p><br/><p>His expression stiffened, and he then said aggrievedly. \u201cWe\u2019re both of the God Race, so we should be helping each other out, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had not brought it up, everything would have been fine. However, the moment he did, flames of anger within Zhu Yao instantly surged.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Jiang!\u201d Zhu Yao sent a kick towards him. Ever since he turned into that azure dragon, she recognized that he was that piggish teammate who squished her to death. \u201cHelp your sister! If not because I helped you, would I have been squished to death by you?\u201d This was simply the most troll method of death in history, with nothing else to compare to.</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t I just a little too excited back then? It was an unintentional mistake, unintentional mistake!\u201d His face was filled with embarrassment. \u201cFurthermore, didn\u2019t I help beckon your soul? You\u2019re looking really great right now too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were the one who helped beckon my soul?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled. She thought it was her master this entire time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s me!\u201d Ao Jiang patted on his chest with a confidently look. \u201cOther than our God Race, who else is capable of beckoning living souls directly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiving souls?\u201d What did he mean? Wasn\u2019t she just a ghost?</p><br/><p>\u201cLiving souls are naturally souls that can be resurrected.\u201d Ao Jiang explained. \u201cIf it\u2019s just a regular soul-beckoning, even if you return to this realm, you will merely stay as a ghost, with no chance at possessing a body.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s the case! She was wondering why she had suddenly returned to life, not to mention having a body. However, after pondering for a moment, she felt that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>Soul-beckoning alone was not enough to resurrect someone after death, right? Though the God Race was powerful, they should not have such abilities. Otherwise, the God Race would not have so much trouble finding heirs. \u201cHow were you able to beckon a living soul?\u201d</p><br/><p>When her words fell, Ao Jiang\u2019s expression instantly stiffened, and then he said while looking at her with an accusing look. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obviously because I lent you my dragon pearl? You haven\u2019t returned it to me yet! With the protection of the dragon pearl, even if your physical body is obliterated, your soul will still carry life energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sensed for a moment, and indeed, within her Primal, there was something additional in there. \u201cWhy is it in my Primal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Ao Jiang looked as though he wanted to cry. \u201cWhen I lent you my dragon pearl to exterminate the Devil back then, you promised you would return it to me? But you directly merged it within your Primal, and my abilities were greatly weakened after the loss of the dragon pearl. Otherwise, when you were heavily injured back then, it wouldn\u2019t have been impossible to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d So he was saying the reason she died back then, was because she courted it herself? Back then, in order to guide out even more godly energy, she subconsciously wanted to merge with the god-soul, and so placed the dragon pearl in her Primal. It was no wonder she was able to freely use mystic arts when she was a ghost. It seemed like the dragon pearl was the reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not because I lost my dragon pearl, how could I be beaten up like this by that master of yours?\u201d Recalling this, Ao Jiang felt sadness welling up. Thinking back on how he, a mighty dragon, was beaten by a human practitioner to the point where he had to search for his broken teeth on the ground, it was simply too shameful. \u201cLittle Seventh, are you sure you don\u2019t want to look for another man? Your master is too violent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mn, he was very incredible in that aspect too. Once in a single night, one that lasted the entire night.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Seventh, I\u2019m for real here, alright? What do you think of me?\u201d Ao Jiang winked at her, and he began to dig the corner of the wall with all his might. \u201cI have a strong body, and my godly powers are incredible too. Living for tens of thousands of years with a single breath is not a hard feat, and I can even incubate eggs. Why don\u2019t you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, a heavenly lightning bolt came striking down, instantly zapping him charred black.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan suddenly appeared five meters away, and the chilling aura from his expression suffused into the air. He walked over with slow steps, and every step he took, ice plains would form underneath his feet.</p><br/><p>Recalling the days when he was beaten into pig heads, Ao Jiang\u2019s legs instantly gave way, and with a plop, he knelt on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Zhu Yao took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho\u2026\u201d The corner of Ao Jiang\u2019s lips twitched, and in an instant, he said with a stern look. \u201cI feel that while in a kneeling position, your master looks exceptionally mighty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Where are your principles? \u201cEarlier, who was the one who said he had a strong body, powerful godly powers, and was even capable of incubating eggs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan had already arrived next to Zhu Yao. Hearing his disciple\u2019s words, his eyes instantly floated towards Ao Jiang on the ground.</p><br/><p>Ao Jiang trembled, and at that moment, his entire face was filled with cold sweat. \u201cHohoho\u2026 Little Seventh, you misheard. I said, I\u2019m weak, ugly, and do not carry the slightest of merits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Can you be even more tacky than that?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. Circulating her spiritual energy, she directly forced out the dragon pearl from her Primal, and passed it over. \u201cHere, I\u2019m returning it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ao Jiang was startled, and in an instant, he was utterly moved. He looked at Zhu Yao with eyes that appeared as though he was looking at an angel. \u201cLittle Seventh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you\u2019re weak, ugly, and do not have the slightest of merits, at the very least, your judgment is correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ao Jiang said that because of the dragon pearl, she did not die thoroughly, so she was able to be resurrected using her living soul. Theoretically speaking, she was directly revived. But why did she faintly sense that something was amiss? The reason of this strange feeling was because of her cultivation level. \u201cMaster, my cultivation level seems to have fallen to the Foundation stage?\u201d Back then, because of the dragon pearl, she had not actually noticed it. After returning it to Ao Jiang, she realized her cultivation had returned to its pre-awakening state.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan however had a calm look, as he reached out his hand to comb the hair by the side of her ear. \u201cYour cultivation level was at the Foundation stage in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d What did he mean?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment, and then, she immediately materialized a water mirror. What she saw was the face she had used for twenty odd years in the modern era. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Shouldn\u2019t she be that tree demon after her resurrection? How did it turn out like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe damage to your former body was too severe. Even if your soul returns, it\u2019s not possible to resurrect you.\u201d Yu Yan explained. \u201cSo I had you return to your initial body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInitial body?\u201d Zhu Yao was dumbfounded, and then, she suddenly widened her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re saying, this is my initial body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan nodded. \u201cThis is the appearance you had when your master first met you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was the original package she brought from the modern era! Then\u2026</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cMaster\u2026 Can you tell me why my body is in your hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan expression changed, and then he replied while shifting his gaze. \u201cWhen you were killed by the demonic fox back then, your master realized that the personal succeeding imprint did not disappear, so\u2026 I had been preserving it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Preserving? Her avatar!? Master, tell me honestly. Just how deep is your love for your disciple?</p><br/><p>Back then, he had thought that she would awaken once more. Who would have known that she would walk on the irreversible path of courting flowery deaths?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I realized. Though your soul wasn\u2019t present, this body of yours was actually capable of restoring itself on its own.\u201d Yu Yan said with a stern look. \u201cThen, when that dragon was beckoning your soul, your master decided to directly attach your living soul to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao touched her chest. Complete and flawless, without the slightest of scars. The reason why her body was able to restore itself automatically was probably due to Realmspirit\u2019s doing. Could it be that this was the return package he spoke of?</p><br/><p>-_-||| Using recycled goods?</p><br/><p>Speaking of soul-beckoning, Zhu Yao suddenly recalled that Ghost King in the Underworld. That miasma bug was evidently the target of her mission this time. Though she did not know if there was a scenario behind it this time, the danger of that bug was something she personally witnessed.</p><br/><p>She tightly clenched her fists, and took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I want to return to the Underworld.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan stiffened for a moment. Turning to look at her, his brows deeply furrowed.</p><br/><p>After a while, he said in a sunken voice. \u201cYu Yao\u2026 Your master can\u2019t always make it in time.\u201d He couldn\u2019t always make it in time to save her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt a tinge of guilt in her heart. Taking a step forward, he hugged onto the slightly chilly figure. After a moment of silence, she slowly said. \u201cMaster\u2026 I saw little wimp.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was little wimp? In Yu Yan\u2019s memories, there was only one. Someone else\u2019s disciple.</p><br/><p>And the creature he hated the most, was someone else\u2019s disciple! Furthermore, this creature was even the knot in his disciple\u2019s heart. What\u2019s even more infuriating was, just what rights did he have to make his disciple, whom he had raised with all his efforts (several times), save him at all costs? Even when she was finally resurrected, she still wanted to lose her life again to save him.</p><br/><p>Not happy! He expressed that he was really unhappy.</p><br/><p>In an instant, he really wanted to return to the cultivation world, pull out Zi Mo, lecture him and question him just how in the world did he raise his disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019m not going back dead.\u201d Zhu Yao looked at him helplessly. That natural cold air conditioning had been emitting out for the entire day, if this continued, even winter would probably arrive in advance. \u201cThe formation you two used to beckon my soul is still here. We can directly reverse that formation, and I can then be directly sent back. I don\u2019t have to die again.\u201d And she could even bring along her body this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master shall accompany you.\u201d Yu Yan said in a sunken voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d Would it overload with an additional personnel?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan however did not reply as he instantly pulled Zhu Yao into the center of the formation and activated the formation. In an instant, the formation shone with a red light, enveloping the two people within. Countless runic symbols danced in the surroundings. A moment later, they stopped, and began to revolve in the opposite direction. Furthermore, that red light slowly turned white.</p><br/><p>The scenery changed before her eyes, and they had arrived in another realm. A silvery white river appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>She had returned!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little dazed. Initially, she had thought that reversing that soul-beckoning formation would take quite some time, yet her master completed it in an instant. Was this the gap between master and disciple?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d That someone else\u2019s disciple.</p><br/><p>Though his tone sounded the same as usual, Zhu Yao faintly sensed a hint of anger within it.</p><br/><p>The banks of River of Forgetfulness were quiet and serene, with not a single ghost to be seen. Though, there was still remains of the traces of battle on-site. Zhu Yao guessed that little wimp should have already returned to Spiritual Realm. That Ghost King had already been sealed, and it wouldn\u2019t be coming out anytime soon.</p><br/><p>She scanned her surroundings, and realized there were strands of miasma scattered about above the riverbanks. After a careful look, she saw a string of the words \u2018bug\u2019, which should have been left behind by that Ghost King. Zhu Yao wanted to move closer to inspect it, but was held back by Yu Yan behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank, his brows furrowed. With a stern appearance, he looked at the scattered miasma. \u201cIf my guess is right, that\u2019s resentment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResentment?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled for a moment. This was a term which she often heard of. Usually, only ghosts who carried resentment would carry spiritual consciousnesses of their former lives. She had always thought that the so-called resentment was referring to a form of obsession which humans possessed, and was nothing more but a term describing it. She never expected that it actually had substance too.</p><br/><p>\u201cResentment is birthed from a human\u2019s hatred, unwillingness, vengeful thoughts, and various other emotions.\u201d Yu Yan explained. \u201cThey are formless and shapeless, yet at the same time, they are undying and irremovable. The moment one is stained by it, that person will be controlled by various emotions and can no longer escape from its grasp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. \u201cIs there no way to exterminate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan shook his head. \u201cI have only seen descriptions of it through the various records and legends, it\u2019s my first time seeing its substantial form. If not from seeing it calmly floating above the River of Forgetfulness, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to recognize it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The water of the River of Forgetfulness was even capable of cleansing away all memories of a ghost\u2019s past life, yet this miasma was not even the least bit affected. Thinking about it carefully, it could only be resentment itself.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was put in a slightly difficult position now. It seemed like this resentment was an aggregation of all negative emotions. The water of the River of Forgetfulness was ineffective, and lightning could only disperse it for a short moment, this resentment was a little too heaven-bending, wasn\u2019t it!?</p><br/><p>Just how was she going to fix this bug?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

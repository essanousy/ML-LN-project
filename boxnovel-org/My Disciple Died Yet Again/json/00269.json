It\u2019s not something I can control.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeported?\u201d What was he trying to say? Was he treating Yu Yan as an illegal immigrant?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung maiden, your world is completely different from mine. This place is too stable.\u201d Realmspirit sighed. \u201cEvery plane has their own set of laws, and laws are the basic guidelines for world formation. All the living creatures in the plane must be within this set of guidelines in order to maintain the stability of that plane itself. If a deviation were to appear, then it will cause a collapse in every aspect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying my master is that deviation?\u201d Zhu Yao clenched her hands. \u201cIn order to fix this deviation, you sent my master back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already told you I wasn\u2019t the one who sent him back.\u201d Realmspirit sounded like he was about to cry. \u201cTheoretically speaking, anything that does not belong to this plane is considered as a deviation. If a deviation appears, it\u2019s a grave matter that will influence the stability of a plane. But, your world is different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different?\u201d Can you finish everything that needs to be said in one go?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe plane here is very, very, very stable!\u201d He said with heavy emphasis, and within his words, slight hints of envy and jealousy could be heard. \u201cIt\u2019s stable to the point\u2026 where I can be issued with a permit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Haah?</p><br/><p>What permit? You\u2019re really treating this as immigration, huh!?</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, I could only come over because of a permit.\u201d Realmspirit shook the conversation window. Suddenly, an image window suddenly popped out from the table. On the image, words written in a formal manner could be seen:</p><br/><p>Plane Movement Permit</p><br/><p>Checked Otherworld Immigrant Realmspirit</p><br/><p>Gender: </p><br/><p>Age: </p><br/><p>Records:</p><br/><p>Has been very compliant with laws and rules during the otherworld survival period, records are clean and excellent. No bad behaviour to speak of! Has cleared all requirements for plane movement, and thus this permit has been issued!</p><br/><p>Plane Transmigration Inspection Bureau</p><br/><p>16 January 2015</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u2026</p><br/><p>Flips table! What the hell was a Plane Transmigration Inspection Bureau? Why had she not heard of it!?</p><br/><p>Where did this strange department pop up from?</p><br/><p>\u201cSaw that?\u201d The image window flashed and then disappeared. Carrying a prideful tone, Realmspirt said. \u201cMy appearance complies with the plane management pact, and I have gone through all the proper procedures. I\u2019m certified, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how is this related to my master\u2019s disappearance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s related.\u201d His voice suddenly rose. \u201cYour master was brought here along with you during your return, so he was not audited. Without a permit issued, he was categorized as someone who was smuggled in, and could only stay for three months. He was thus forcefully sent back since the time was up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her master was actually an illegal immigrant. \u201cWhere is that Plane Transmigration Inspection Bureau?\u201d She shall head over to apply for a permit then.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Young maiden.\u201d His voice carried some hesitation. \u201cWithout being at a sufficient level, it\u2019s impossible to apply for a permit. If you want to apply for a permit, then you have to work hard in raising your level. For example, helping me with bug fixes or something. Slowly, you will gain the qualifications to apply for a permit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why did she feel as if she was being trolled? She raised her head and glared at the conversation window. \u201cYou\u2019re not lying to me, right? That inspection bureau or whatever basically doesn\u2019t exist, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must believe me, young maiden!\u201d He said in a sincere tone. \u201cWhy do you think I can only appear in a computer? It\u2019s because of the laws of the plane. In your world, I can\u2019t appear with my physical body, which is why I have no choice but to stay inside your computer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why am I able to go to your world?\u201d If laws truly existed in this world, why did she not encounter any obstructions at all when she transmigrated? No matter how it was, she would still be obstructed a little, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026 That\u2019s because\u2026\u201d Realmspirit\u2019s voice instantly became hesitant. \u201cYoung maiden, you are aware of this. Movement between planes are comparable to taking trips to other countries. During trips, everyone would always like\u2026 to bring back a few native products and the like. These are never checked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Native products?</p><br/><p>The hell, she was actually that native product he was speaking of!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung maiden, knowledge that concerns planes is still too early for you, and right now, I can\u2019t exactly give you a detailed explanation on it either. You will slowly come to understand it in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She felt that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung maiden, how is it? Are you interested in coming over to raise your level? Applying for a permit is not a dream, hmm?\u201d Realmspirit said in a relaxed manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I really obtain that whatever permit for my master if I help you fix bugs?\u201d She felt that this was really unreliable.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I shall swear on my principles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still have principles?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Realmspirit paused for a moment. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I swear on my chrysanthemum then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Chrysanthemum my ass. What\u2019s your chrysanthemum? Your battery charging port, or the usb port? They will all busted with a single plug, alright?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed deeply. She was completely defeated by this unprincipled and unscrupulous Realmspirit. After hesitating for a moment, she said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me all these when I returned back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, you were still in your honeymoon phase back then. How can I possibly have the heart to bother you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, this time you\u2019re not just bothering, you have basically bashed apart a pair of mandarin ducks, alright? The moment she imagined that her master was sent back without knowing anything at all, she felt irritated to the point where she could kill people. Only a ghost would believe that that was his only motive! \u201cSpeak human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d After a moment of silence, he said. \u201cYour soul was not stable back then, and it had to be nurtured back in your former world. Only the origin energy of this world can stabilize your soul. If I were to send you back to my world back then, your soul would not have been fixed. To put it simply\u2026 you would not have been able to acclimatize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Acclimatization could be used to explain such a situation?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, you think that my soul is already fixed now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn mn mn, your body is now perfect, and you won\u2019t feel breathless while climbing five floors at one go!\u201d He sniffled a few times. \u201cYoung maiden, you aren\u2019t even aware that my permit was this close to being cancelled when I sent you back here back then! My credibility fell by exactly twenty percent. Fortunately, I supplemented it back with my great show of character. That manager of your world\u2026 In any case, he\u2019s really frightening!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Someone\u2019s character can actually be used to supplement such things?</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the behalf of me paying such a terrible and miserable price, young maiden, please love me once more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why did she feel like bashing him up?</p><br/><p>\u201cTransmigrate, young maiden! As long as you say \u2018I\u2019m willing\u2019, I will return you a wonderfully embroidered tomorrow!\u201d Realmspirit instantly released fireworks within the computer screen. \u201cIf you sign up for the luxury package now, you can even be gifted with a free boyfriend, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Do I need you to send me that? That\u2019s mine in the first place, right!?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, nevermind.\u201d What else could she say? Her master was deported back already. Now that she did not have the hunk with her, how could she not head back to retrieve him?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao called back home, and spoke a few words with her parents. In the end, she still managed to hold back and did not tell them the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can still return, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Plane Movement Permits are issued by the authorities themselves! Moving across planes with a single permit is not a dream! Also, whenever you transmigrate, the time you return to will be the same as well! Our goal is to prevent any deviation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cEnough, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Young maiden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop lying to me. Otherwise\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I will still be able to believe you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the entire room darkened.</p><br/><p>Who turned off the lights?</p><br/><p>A running loading bar suddenly appeared not far away from her. In an instant, the interface shot to 100%.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, she fell unconscious.</p><br/><p>A long while later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she woke up again, Zhu Yao saw an illusory veil that looked like an aurora in the sky. Furthermore, it could constantly change its colour, making it look extremely beautiful. Zhu Yao stared at it for a full five minutes, only to then realize that she seemed to be a little silly.</p><br/><p>==!</p><br/><p>When she sat back up, she realized she was sitting on a bed made out of white jade. The light veil earlier was actually a thin curtain hanged above the bed. The surroundings were extremely luxurious. Every object was carefully selected to make this wonderful masterpiece.</p><br/><p>Even the floor beneath her was made of jade.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s first thought was\u2026 So rich! It felt as if her entire being was walking on the path to the summit of life!</p><br/><p>Realmspirit finally gave her an owner role!</p><br/><p>When she raised her head to look at herself, she realized that she had changed into another avatar again. The thing she was wearing presently was not the pyjamas of the modern era, but a female long dress that was wrapping her firmly and conservatively.</p><br/><p>However, looking at the decorations, the surroundings, and this rich aura of a young maiden, no matter how everything looked, she had the perfect configuration of a great beauty. Zhu Yao\u2019s heart stirred, with intentions of wanting to see her own looks, only to realize that there was not even the slightest strand of spiritual energy in her body, let alone being able to summon a water mirror. She looked around for a mirror, but after circling around, not even the slightest piece of something reflective could be found, let alone a mirror.</p><br/><p> Just as she was finding it strange that such an extravagant room was lacking an important object like a mirror, the door creaked open.</p><br/><p>Dressed in a pink dress, a girl that was as beautiful as a fairy walked in. She looked at Zhu Yao with large, widened eyes, and an expression of pleasant surprise surfaced. Excitedly, she said. \u201cGrandma, you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. The hell\u2019s a grandma? She sized up the girl for a moment. \u201cYou can\u2019t be called Xiaoqian, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl had a joyous look, as she hurriedly nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Grandma, I am Xiaoqian.\u201d</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be? You\u2019re actually really called Xiaoqian, hey? This is not a ghost horror film, refute it a little!</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes reddened, and she suddenly burst into tears. \u201cYou\u2019re finally awake. Do you know while you were asleep, how harsh of a life the clan was living? Xiaoqian had been looking forward to your awakening day and night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Zhu Yao felt that was a need to supplement her principles for a moment. \u201cWhat is this place? And what is this clan you speak of?\u201d Don\u2019t push scenarios onto her every single time, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, what\u2019s wrong? Could it be that your injuries have yet to heal?\u201d Xiaoqian has a worried look. Her peerlessly beautiful face grew even more delicate and pitiful. \u201cDon\u2019t scare Xiaoqian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung lady, you have mistaken me for someone else. I\u2019m not your grandma!\u201d No matter what kind of scenarios were pushed onto her, she could not possibly be the grandma of a young girl, right?</p><br/><p>The girl, however, grew even more anxious. \u201cNo, I have to get junior-martial sister over to see you. Only she is proficient in the medical arts within the clan.\u201d After saying that, she turned around and ran out.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why did she have a bad feeling about this?</p><br/><p>Xiaoqian() and Grandma() are characters of an old 1987 HK movie, called \u2018A Chinese Ghost Story\u2019. In the plot, Xiaoqian is a female ghost being controlled by \u2018Grandma\u2019, a tree demon, who uses Xianqian to lure in mortals for her to eat.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You still wish to go against us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Not that. I just want to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me give you an advice. Know the time and place. I\u2019m already kind enough to let you all off alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lot stay stubborn, I don\u2019t mind sending you all off on the road either!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fellow Daoist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the Nascent Divided Pearl, heh, you guys can stop dreaming. Just treat it as though you\u2019ve never obtained it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat way, I believe you lot will feel a little better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your hand really alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy hand\u2026 What?\u201d The man was stunned for a moment.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao weakly pointed at the pearl in his hand. \u201cI\u2019m saying\u2026 is it really alright for you to hold onto that pearl for so long? I just saw that there were still remnants of the deadly poison on it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s complacent face instantly turned pale. \u201cWhat did you\u2026 say\u2026 urgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression changed as his body was suddenly dyed dark purple. He began to break out into spasms, as he directly fell into the thick mist which the demonic beast had transformed into. Screams resounded as his body began to corrode at high speeds. Yet he could not unleash even a single hint of divine energy. \u201cSave\u2026 Save me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He reached out a hand towards his party members in the air, pleading for their help. However, as he stretched it halfway through, his hand had already turned into bones, and in an instant later, the bones completely melted. This change happened so quickly, it hadn\u2019t been five seconds since it began. The man\u2019s figure was no longer in the mist, and what remained were the various screams filled with terror and despair that still continued to echo in the air. The party members that he had brought along did not even budge, all their faces were filled with dumbfounded expressions.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. That\u2019s why\u2026 Antagonists die because they talk too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss!\u201d The crowd of people finally moved. A female Deity with a miserably pale expression cried out. Her voice was filled with fear. She then turned to glare at the five people on the ground, fury filled her lungs. \u201cYou\u2026 You lot killed him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh please!\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at her belated effort. If she was truly that worried, why didn\u2019t she save him earlier? \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You knew that there\u2019s poison on the Nascent Divided Pearl, why didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d The female Deity said as she gritted her teeth.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cIs your brain made of mush? You guys came here to snatch our loot, so we have to wash it clean and wait for you to snatch it away from us, is that it?\u201d How are you acting all righteous right now?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d The woman grew irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho you\u2019re calling \u2018you\u2019, you?\u201d Zhu Yao however grew enraged. \u201cSo are you guys still going to snatch away the Nascent Divided Pearl or not? In any case, it has poison on it. If you guys want it, then this granddaddy here will give it to you. You can have it if you want it. Though if you guys really want to find, let me warn you that a starved camel is bigger than a horse. Don\u2019t think we\u2019re afraid of you. It\u2019s either the fish dies or the net gets torn, we can all perish together! Hurry and make a decision, we still have to rush off to fight other mobs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The female Deity\u2019s face turned green from anger. Just as she was about to step forward, next to her, a man dressed in a blue robe embroidered with white marks stopped her. This person was also the only one among them with the words \u2018Unknown Deity (Level 2)\u2019 shown above its head. \u201cWait a minute!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you stop me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s already a worthless object, why the need for an unnecessary struggle?\u201d The man said with a solemn voice.</p><br/><p>Only then did the female Deity grit her teeth and stand her ground. She ruthlessly glared at Zhu Yao, and then, with a unwilling look, she left with the crowd.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao heave a sigh of relief, though Yu Yan next to her was frowning. He held onto her hand and solemnly said. \u201cNo need to worry, your master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled. If they really had to fight it out, though they might look disadvantageous in terms of numbers, with her master here, it would definitely be a stable victory for them even against a few High Deities. Though in this tower, the hatred meter for the Lightning Divine Palace seemed to be off the charts. If they need not expose themselves, then it would be for the best.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, I never expected that we would obtain an useless pearl.\u201d Squad Captain Nangong was saddened as he glanced at the red pearl that was still sparkling within the poisonous mist.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a waste of this daddy\u2019s efforts.\u201d Student Zhonggu Lu was a little irritated as well as he unconsciously stroked his own face, looking as though it was aching a little. He wondered if the poison had vanished and hurriedly materialized a water mirror to inspect his face carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might not be the case!\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled as she cast a wind-type art. She used a huge amount of efforts to blow away the layers of thick mist and hurriedly set a formation to suck in the Nascent Divided Pearl. The pearl then rolled a few rounds and stopped by her feet. The poisonous mist once again gathered back together. Before being affected by the thick poisonous mist for the second time, the red pearl merely had a few black strands in it earlier. Now, black covered almost half of the entire pearl.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly, what are you trying to do!?\u201d Squad Captain Nangong looked at her anxiously. \u201cYou saw it for yourself earlier. This pearl has deadly poison on it, it must not be touched.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an idea, Squad Captain Nangong Huang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nangong Cheng!\u201d Flips table. Why do you call my name wrongly whenever you have an idea!?</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, don\u2019t mind such details.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d I mind, alright? He glanced at the white-robed male practitioner next to her. Manage your disciple properly, hey.</p><br/><p>The latter maintained his expressionless look. As long as my disciple doesn\u2019t court death, it doesn\u2019t concern me.</p><br/><p>\u201cSquad Captain Huang, I think this pearl isn\u2019t worthless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why did I turn into Squad Captain Huang again, hey? \u201cThis pearl is stained with deadly poison and can\u2019t be held, how can we bring it out of the secret realm?\u201d Take a deep breath, I\u2019m a squad captain with principles!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis demonic beast is undying, so it must have been challenged by several others. There\u2019s so many practitioners who have risen to the higher floors, so we\u2019re definitely not the only group that encountered this problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying there\u2019s a method to remove the poison?\u201d His eyes shone.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything has its strengths and weaknesses. How do you think the Purifying Pool is formed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right!\u201d He slapped his thighs as he recalled the Purifying Pool behind him. Since the pool could disperse the poisonous gas, then dispersing the poison within the pearl might not be impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout further ado, let\u2019s hurry and place the Nascent Divided Pearl inside the pool, Squad Captain Huang!\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hand and then turned to Zhonggu Lu next to her. \u201cOh right, Little Teal, we have to trouble you to use your earth-type arts to move the pearl over. You\u2019re more specialized in such matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng: \u201c\u2026\u201d I already told you I\u2019m Nangong Cheng.</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu: \u201c\u2026\u201d Who the hell is Little Teal?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s idea was correct. The moment Zhonggu Lu threw the poisoned pearl into the pool, the poisonous gas inside the pearl began to disperse. Though it\u2019s much slower than dispersing the regular poisonous gas, it finally began to revert back to its original red colour.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already contacted the groups from the other secret realms.\u201d Squad Captain Nangong sighed and said. \u201cLooking at the current situation, only three out of the four Nascent Divided Pearls in the other four secret realms have been found. The last secret realm has yet to be cleared yet. It seemed like we can\u2019t exit the secret realm right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that we have to wait like this?\u201d Zhonggu Lu was a little irritated. \u201cThe poison in this Nascent Divided Pearl will most likely scatter in about a day, and when that time comes, there will definitely be possible who will try to steal it. We won\u2019t be so lucky that before either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned as well. Finding treasures was easy, but protecting them was hard. The robbers back then left because the pearl was poisonous, but now, the pearl was no longer poisonous. Once the news spread, it would lure in quite a huge number of people. No matter how high their cultivation levels were, they would not be able to fend off against a sea of people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh. And yet there\u2019s still one Nascent Divided Pearl that hasn\u2019t been found, so we can\u2019t leave immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Yu Yan, who had stayed silent for everyone other than his disciple, suddenly spoke. His ice-cold gaze swept across everyone, and then when his eyes landed on his disciple, a little warmth returned. \u201cSetting a formation down is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not care if they understood either, as he immediately placed down layers upon layers of concealment and defensive formations next to the pool. The half-purified Nascent Divided Pearl in the pool, along with the unpurified poisonous gas, slowly disappeared without a trace. The formations were extremely ingenious, as they were actually able to conceal the ripples of divine energy as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue engaging the demonic beast.\u201d He continued with a solemn voice.</p><br/><p>The group was stunned for a moment, and then, they immediately understood his intentions. \u201cGood plan!\u201d Nangong Cheng said with an excited look. \u201cWe shall hide the Nascent Divided Pearl inside the pool, and when the demonic beast resurrects naturally three days later, we shall act as if we haven\u2019t obtained the Nascent Divided Pearl by engaging the demonic beast. As long as we don\u2019t kill it, we will naturally not arouse the others\u2019 suspicions. Once the final secret realm makes contact with us, we will then charge out together! It\u2019s truly a great plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoist Beichen\u2026\u201d The more Nangong Cheng thought about it, the more he felt that the plan would work. He looked at Yu Yan with sparkling eyes. He looks ice and cold, but he actually has good ideas of his own, doesn\u2019t he? Just as he was about to express his admiration, Zhu Yao suddenly squeezed in and slapped his stretched-out hand back to where it belonged.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, Squad Captain Huang, let\u2019s think about how we should conceal our traces for the next three days, shall we?\u201d Zhu Yao smiled with a friendly and intimate look. I dare you to try touching my master with your claws!</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Why do I feel as if Dongfang girly\u2019s expression has suddenly become terrifying?</p><br/><p>In order to conceal the fact that they had already obtained the quest item, and adding that the demonic beast has yet to resurrect, the group pondered for a moment and decided that they might as well make a trip back to the city. There was already a squad that found out that they had already killed the demonic beast, so there would definitely be people who wouldn\u2019t give up and return to investigate. Rather than staying, they might as well return to the city and make their presence known. That way, the suspicions that people still had would most likely be removed. Because according to the Nascent Divided Pearls\u2019 setting, it would be ineffective if only one of them was brought back to the city, all five of them must be brought back together.</p><br/><p>As expected, the moment they returned to the city, they received countless pitying or gloating gazes. Zhu Yao and her two companions were newcomers, so they were not affected that much, but for familiar faces such as Nangong and Zhonggu, they already had some connections in the city. They immediately received a large amount of questions from the various passers-by, and among them were some that added insult to their injury.</p><br/><p>The two of them received all of these with gloomy expressions, perfectly unleashing the images of sad, unlucky young men who had been possessed by the god of misfortune.</p><br/><p>As for Zhu Yao, her master and Yue Ying, they stood quietly at the side as they watched their act.</p><br/><p>Three days later, the few of them announced that they were once again entering the same secret realm to challenge the same demonic beast, in order to earn back their dignity. Not a single person suspected them. Instead, what the group received was a friendly bonus of taunts and mockeries, as the crowd watched the group enter the secret realm.</p><br/><p>The fifty-fifth squad thus casually returned to where the demonic beast was, and the Nascent Divided Pearl was still safely lying in the pool. The few of them had talked it over, and agreed to poke the unfortunate resurrected demonic beast every two hours for show, in order to deal with the Deities that were to come spectating. Of course, other than Zhonggu Lu. The poisonous gas from back then had left a mark in his heart, and he was unwilling to move out again even if he had to die. Every day, he would squat by the pool and look at his own face with a water mirror, afraid that he would be poisoned again.</p><br/><p>A month later, when the crowd of Deities saw that the five of them were still defending against the demonic beast and were unable to kill it for so long, one after another, they sighed and left. These people sure are idiots. This isn\u2019t the only demonic beast in the secret realm, yet they seemed to have brought themselves into a stalemate with it. At that moment, everyone cleared off their thoughts of snatching away the treasure, and slowly, not a single one of them blocked their path any longer.</p><br/><p>When the people in all five secret realms who found the Nascent Divided Pearls finally contacted each other, the group charged out of the secret realm together.</p><br/><p>Only then did the crowd of Deities regain their senses. They were fooled! Unfortunately, the results had already been decided.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

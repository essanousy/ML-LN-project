This was the Nine Heavenly Lightning, and with this, even if she were to encounter a demonic beast that\u2019s of a higher rank than her, she would not need to be afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you\u2019re the best!\u201d So moving!</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not reply, and simply stretched out his hand towards her hair which was already a pile of mess, messing it up even more. Looking at his stupid disciple who was still smiling sillily, he became more and more worried. His disciple was so stupid, yet, she still liked to head to dangerous places. Back then, she had already lost her life once, this time, he was even more worried. No, I have to give her a few more guarantees.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dangers in \u2018Tasyoluk\u2019 are widespread. Master cannot be by your side, you have to pay more attention by yourself. This sword, can only be used to attack. You have to be on your guard at all times!\u201d After pondering for a moment, he took out a defensive mystic robe from his storage ring. \u201cWear this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at that gold sparkling mystic robe, which was sparkling so bright, it almost blinded her eyes. She spoke up weakly. \u201cMaster, this isn\u2019t suitable, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Yu Yan frowned, and took out another one. \u201cThen this set of robes. A defensive formation has been placed on it, and it is able to defend against any Mystic Art attacks for fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d This set was not sparkling gold, however, it was bright red and purple in color, and was embroidered with a bunch of flowers, as though it was welcoming the new year. She didn\u2019t dare to wear it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not want it either?\u201d Yu Yan frowned even deeper, and continued to pull out another one. \u201cThen, this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d This set was not sparkling, nor was it bright red and purple in color. However, master, why the hell are there so many gems sewn onto it!? She was not going out to sell merchandises!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao speechlessly looked at her master who had already activated the River God mode, and then, once again looked at the three set of clothes on the table. She could faintly see the words \u201cSo silly\u201d being written on the first set of clothes, \u201cyet so rich\u201d on the second set, and \u201churry and steal him away!\u201d on the third set.</p><br/><p>She was clearly heading out to steal an item, she did not want to change her objective into stealing a rural landlord\u00b9!</p><br/><p>Finally, under her firm refusal, her master could only regretfully keep the items, and he looked at her with a complicated expression. My disciple is so stupid, she will be bullied when she goes out, won\u2019t she? She will definitely be bullied, won\u2019t she? She will totally be bullied, won\u2019t she?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could only use rest as her excuse, and escaped.</p><br/><p>Having a master who loved to worry, the pressure on her was immense.</p><br/><p>Finally, it was the day of the opening of the \u2018Tasyoluk\u2019 Secret Realm. Zhu Yao arranged a few life necessities, and prepared to head to the Main Mountain\u2019s open field, to gather for the instance dungeon run. Right before she left, her master actually popped out all of a sudden again. Zhu Yao\u2019s heart trembled, afraid that he would once again pull out some gold and sparkling item for her to bring along.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this time, master was more reasonable. He simply took out a jade pendant necklace, and wore it for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must remember to wear this at all times. It must not leave your body, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan said very seriously, and completely did not have the unreasonable look he usually had. Zhu Yao instantly felt that this must definitely be some sort of very incredible Mystic Tool. She stuffed it into her chest, placed it at a position which was in contact with her body, and patted it twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, don\u2019t worry. Wherever the jade is, I will be there too!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yu Yan\u2019s expression was a little strange, he stared at the collar where she placed the necklace into for a moment, before turning away and leaving without saying anything.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao inexplicably curled her lips, and flew away from the Jade Forest Mountain with a flying sword.</p><br/><p>After going through the demonic training in these few years, her fear of heights had been completely cured. She was finally able to safely become a bird-woman.</p><br/><p>The moment when she flew away from Jade Forest Mountain, Yu Yan had sensed it. Turning his head, he looked towards the direction his stupid disciple left in, and deeply sighed. As expected, he was still unable to put his heart at ease. Suddenly, he once again recalled the scene when his disciple placed the jade pendant on her chest, his face strangely grew a little hotter. Was it because of the weather today?</p><br/><p>There were about a dozen of people in the group, and there were actually four or five female disciples among them as well. In their eyes, without exception, all of them were sparkling with lights of love, and were currently circling around a man, conversing with him. The black bolded \u201cBUG\u201d word on the man\u2019s face, even if she did not want to recognize that he was Xiao Yi, it was impossible.</p><br/><p>As expected of the protagonist\u2019s cheat, the women would instantly feel uncomfortable if they did not stick to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bun!\u201d Her shoulder was patted on, and when Zhu Yao turned her head, she just happened to see Wang Xuzhi. Zhu Yao was startled for a moment, and when she thought about it, it was understandable. He had formed his Azoth Core, so obviously, he would go as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou formed your Azoth Core?\u201d Wang Xuzhi was very astonished, after all, he did not see anyone forming the Azoth Core in the Ancient Hill Sect in the recent years.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have just returned from field training. I formed my Azoth Core outside.\u201d Zhu Yao casually came up with an excuse. She really did not wish to bring up that washbasin tribulation.</p><br/><p>I see. Wang Xuzhi nodded, and then, continued to ask in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re going into \u2018Tasyoluk\u2019 as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! A Secret Realm that only opens once every five hundred years, obviously, I can\u2019t miss out on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, you have just formed your Azoth Core.\u201d Wang Xuzhi showed his disapproval. \u201c\u2018Tasyoluk\u2019 is extremely dangerous. It\u2019s stated in the legends that, even a Demigod-stage expert would not be completely safe when venturing into its core area. Why don\u2019t you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master has agreed to it!\u201d Zhu Yao interrupted his words.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi felt it was not his place to oppose her either. Looking at her a little worriedly, he still could not help but remind her. \u201cLater, after we enter, remember to stick close to me. It\u2019s fine to stay at the outer areas, don\u2019t head deep into the center of the place, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little wimp, are you caring for me? Zhu Yao felt a little pleased, and could not help but stretch out her hand and stroke this man who was even taller than she was. \u201cI understand! Senior, martial, brother, Wang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi was stunned for a moment, and simply stared at her blankly. After a while, he finally sighed and regained his senses. He pretended to be angry and lectured her. \u201cMischievous!\u201d At that moment, he actually thought he was looking at big sister Zhu Yao. As expected, was it because his obsession was too deep?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little martial sister, we meet again.\u201d Out of nowhere, Xiao Yi popped out. His dimples showed when he smiled towards her, and instantly, the protagonist\u2019s cheat was fully activated. Sizing Zhu Yao up, he asked in amazement. \u201cLittle martial sister, you formed your Azoth Core?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since he came over, Wang Xuzhi\u2019s expression was ugly. Although the knot in his heart had been resolved, he still hated the person whom he hates. Before Zhu Yao could even react, he had already side stepped and forcefully inserted himself between them. Staring at him defensively, he rightly pulled Zhu Yao behind his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial uncle Xiao, what you said was incorrect. You\u2019re Sovereign Feng Yi\u2019s personal succeeding disciple, according to seniority, we should be calling you senior-martial uncle, so how could she be your little martial sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeniority is only a form of addressing others, I do not mind at all.\u201d Towards Wang Xuzhi\u2019s causing a scene, Xiao Yi was a little displeased.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial uncle do not mind, but this junior minds.\u201d Don\u2019t think of using the martial brother and sister trick to approach her. Little Bun was big sister Zhu Yao\u2019s junior-martial sister, he had to protect her. \u201cIf other people were to know of this, they would think that we don\u2019t know our courtesies.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Xiao Yi\u2019s expression darkened. Although he knew that Wang Xuzhi had always been unhappy with him, he never expected that Wang Xuzhi would challenge him by himself. As expected, these so-called Inner Sect disciples, were all who did not know the meaning of death. Xiao Yi held in the anger in his heart, looking at the cute little martial sister behind him who was blinking her pair of black grape-like eyes, his tone could not help but soothe down. \u201cLittle martial\u2026 niece, I wonder which Mountain you\u2019re a disciple of?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he smiled coldly towards Wang Xuzhi. Didn\u2019t you say we can\u2019t forget about our courtesies? Could it be that you\u2019re also able to stop a senior from asking a question?</p><br/><p>\u00b9Rural landlord: http://wiki.china.org.cn/wiki/index.php/Rural_Landlords</p><br/>\n</div>"}

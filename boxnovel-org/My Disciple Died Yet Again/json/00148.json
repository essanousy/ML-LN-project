In the next instant, he appeared in a foreign world.</p><br/><p>The mountains were lush and the river streams were clear. Divine plants and herbs filled the land, and the divine energy was dense. Clearly, it would have been a treasured land for cultivation, if not for a man emitting out a cold aura, and a demonic beast baring its teeth, standing in front of him.</p><br/><p>The arrow spirit\u2019s legs shivered, as he instantly knelt on the ground out of fear of that person\u2019s and beast\u2019s aura. He was unable to see through that man\u2019s level of cultivation, but he could clearly feel that killing intent which was impossible for him to resist against.</p><br/><p>As expected, with a loud thunder, a bolt of heavenly lightning was struck directly towards him. As the arrow spirit had a metal elemental body in the first place, he possessed a little innate resistance against lightning, however, it would still be impossible to guard against bolts after bolts of lightning struck towards him.</p><br/><p>The arrow spirit felt that he was suffering the worst inhumane abuse he ever had since he gained his human form. Accompanied by rolling thunder, the lightning bolts struck him several times, directly beating him back into his original form, and he lost consciousness after that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s doubtful voice came from the sky. After looking into her divine sense region, she found out that the dimensional space had instantly shrunk by a great amount. The initially boundless sky and earth, had actually turned into the size of a farming family\u2019s yard.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. \u201cMost probably, it\u2019s because this place has recognized this person as its owner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOwner recognition? That pig-faced arrow!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan nodded. \u201cA mustard seed dimensional space is a spiritual artifact as well, so naturally, it can be possessed by someone. However, I never expected that the method to activate this dimensional space, is actually through a blood contract. Only a drop of blood from the target is required.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly recalled that her face was splattered with that pig-faced arrow\u2019s blood. At that moment, she felt like crying. Who said that a good person would definitely have good fortune!? You best come out! Don\u2019t even wish that you can walk straight again in your entire lifetime!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why did the dimensional space become so small?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost probably, it\u2019s because the cultivation of this spirit is too weak, hence, it is unable to completely use this dimensional space, which leads to such a situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a way to dispel this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be, that I will have to be bound to this pig-faced arrow in the future!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not reply, instead, he lowered his head and looked towards the half-broken arrow, which had reverted back to his original form, that he had already struck down. When he thought that such an arrow spirit was going to follow by his own disciple\u2019s side in the future, for a moment, he felt that he should strike him a few more times.</p><br/><p>When the arrow spirit woke up, he was no longer in that terrifying place. Even the injuries on his face had completely disappeared. As for the little lady who had beaten him into a pig face, was currently sitting not far away from him, looking at him with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d The little lady patted on his shoulders, and her smile became even deeper.</p><br/><p>The arrow spirit had yet to completely regain his senses, as he nodded his head blankly. \u201cI\u2026 You?\u201d Suddenly recalling the countless bolts of lightning that were aiming for his death, the arrow spirit trembled. Plop. He knelt down. \u201cGreat deity, spare my life. This little one will never dare to do it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trembling for!?\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. \u201cIf I wanted to kill you, I wouldn\u2019t have saved you, nor would I have restored your human form.\u201d</p><br/><p>The arrow spirit blanked. As though he understood the meaning of her words, he was momentarily incomparably moved. \u201cWas great Deity the person who saved this little one?\u201d</p><br/><p>To be exact, it was her master. She was only in-charge of pulling him out. That\u2019s right, only this arrow spirit could freely enter the dimensional space.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it was me. You\u2019re intentionally\u2026 What are you crying for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The arrow spirit was so moved, his tears and snot had already begun to mix. That miserable look gave Zhu Yao a fright. \u201cGreat Deity still saved this little one in the end\u2026 Thank you, great Deity. Wuuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Did he have to feel moved so randomly? Where\u2019s the basic virtue of your job as a little ruffian? You look really frightening from crying in such a manner, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuu. This little spirit is unable to repay great Deity for her kindness, I can only use my body to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop there.\u201d Don\u2019t even think about it. \u201cForget about repayment. It\u2019s fine as long as you don\u2019t plot against me behind my back again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlot?\u201d The arrow spirit blanked, as that ugly face twisted. \u201cThis little one has never plotted against great Deity though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re denying it? Then what was the deal with that talisman before?\u201d If he hadn\u2019t threw the talisman at her, she wouldn\u2019t have summoned the heavenly lightning to strike him either. Furthermore, if that was the case, her face wouldn\u2019t have been sprayed completely by his blood, and she wouldn\u2019t be bound to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalisman?\u201d The arrow spirit blanked. In a moment, a degree of sincerity could clearly be seen from that extremely fierce face of his. \u201cThis little one simply wished to offer a treasure to great Deity earlier. That was a talisman treasure. Back then, when great Deity spared this little one\u2019s life, this little one had wanted to offer the treasure to you. Who knew that great Deity would\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d Zhu Yao glared at him. \u201cThat talisman was clearly an explosive talisman. When it\u2019s opened, it will automatically explode. If I had not used my heavenly lightning to disperse it, I would have long been blown into smithereens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExplosive talisman? Impossible. That talisman treasure was clearly something a Gold Deity senior personally bestowed to me in order to aid my cultivation.\u201d The arrow spirit was at a loss, and his face was filled with utter disbelief.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. It seemed like he really didn\u2019t know that talisman treasure would explode. Recalling the position he was standing earlier, if that talisman were to have really ignited, he himself would have been dragged in as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did that Gold Deity give you a talisman treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>The arrow spirit was startled for a moment. Immediately after, he became a little embarrassed, as he chuckled a few times. \u201cI heard that cultivation between practitioner-pair companions is quick, so I have been looking for a partner. That great Deity told me that I could find one within the city, and even gave me this talisman treasure. He said that if I managed to find my practitioner-pair companion, my cultivation speed can increase after using this talisman treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you sincerely looked for that woman as your practitioner-pair companion, and not because you want to use her as your furnace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, your sister!\u201d Zhu Yao slapped towards his head. \u201cIs there anyone who courts girls like you!? If you wanted to become practitioner-pair companions, speak to her properly, yet you behave like a ruffian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Deity\u2019s words are right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at this perspective, it seemed that this arrow spirit was used by someone else. Clearly, that Gold Deity wanted to make use of him to kill that woman, and that talisman treasure was the weapon.</p><br/><p>However, most probably, that Gold Deity never expected that this guy was just all show and no talk. Although his body was covered entirely in a fierce aura, his martial strength was practically zero. And she was just an innocent passer-by who got involved.</p><br/><p>That woman\u2019s cultivation as an Earth Deity was not even stable, so she had most likely just ascended not too long ago. So how did she form a grudge with that Gold Deity? \u201cAre you still able to look for that Gold Deity?\u201d</p><br/><p>The arrow spirit stroked the place where he was slapped on, and shook his head. \u201cBut I have only met him in the city yesterday. He\u2019s most likely still there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re going into the city.\u201d Zhu Yao summoned her divine sword, pulled along the arrow spirit, and flew towards the city that was filled with countless lights.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Deity Till, this little one met that Gold Deity at the south of the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Deity Till?\u201d The hell was that?</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t great Deity\u2019s name \u2018Till Your Throat Breaks\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re \u2018Till Your Throat Breaks\u2019. Your entire family is made of \u2018Till Your Throat Breaks\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m surnamed Zhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2019, your sister! \u201cWhat are you called?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little one has only gained the human form not too long ago, and has yet to receive a name. Why don\u2019t Till\u2026 Great Deity Zhu give me one?\u201d He had long wanted to change his name, however, he simply did not know what was suitable for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both ero, and a spirit. It doesn\u2019t sound good indeed. Alright! Let me give you one then.\u201d Zhu Yao patted on her chest with a confident look. She specialized in giving names after all.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the arrow spirit instantly glowed snowy-white. \u201cThank you, great Deity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao pondered. \u201cWith your fierce aura, the fact that you are formed from a weapon, and your true body is constructed by divine crystals, although you\u2019re a little tattered, you\u2019re still considered as a divine-ranked weapon. Then, why don\u2019t we call you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Goudan(Dog-Egg)[1]!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The arrow spirit\u2019s face which was filled with expectations, instantly stiffened. \u201cGreat\u2026 Great Deity. I\u2019m not a dog spirit.\u201d Why did he have to be called Goudan? And where did the surname Li come from?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah. Don\u2019t mind such small details. Goudan is such a nice name. It\u2019s both tyrannical and easy to live on, furthermore, it rolls off the tongue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Why did he feel something was strange somewhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to know that, it\u2019s very dangerous for little spirits like you to go around the Divine Realm. With a tyrannical-sounding name, it can raise your chances of survival, you know! You don\u2019t have to be afraid of being beaten anymore.\u201d A lowly name could raise a better person, after all. [2]</p><br/><p>\u201cI see!\u201d The arrow spirit revealed an expression of enlightenment. He heavily nodded, and looked at her excitedly. \u201cGoudan thanks great Deity for bestowing this name, I will definitely work hard in my cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, it seems little one has the potential to be taught well!\u201d It was definitely because she was trying to find a sense of balance with the name \u201cBlossoming Jade\u201d, nor was it because she was trying to take revenge against him for suddenly binding her dimensional space.</p><br/><p>For some unknown reasons, whenever she heard the name \u2018Dog-Egg\u2019, momentarily, she would feel that the entire world had become a lot fresher!</p><br/><p>The two of them arrived at the city gate after a short flight. The city did not have any city walls, as its surroundings were seemingly protected by a circulating transparent layer of barrier-like formation. And, at the entrance, there was a gigantic wooden plate floating in the air. On it, the city name was written.</p><br/><p>It was two extremely simple words \u2013 Divine City.</p><br/><p>Mn, it was actually quite appropriate.</p><br/><p>There were not many guards at the city gate, and there was a huge number of Deities walking in and out. The moment they entered however, was a different place. There was a winter melon floating over here, a pumpkin floating over there, a corn floating on the left, and a watermelon floating on the right.</p><br/><p>It was just that those objects, were all incomparably huge, and was almost the size of a storied building. Only when she saw Deities moving in and out of those places, did she finally understand that they were really buildings.</p><br/><p>The construction standards of the Divine Realm were rather advanced, huh. Zhu Yao felt that she had been transported into some sort of fantasy fruit world.</p><br/><p>The student, arrow spirit Li Goudan, brought her directly towards the city south, and only stopped when they arrived at the winter melon structure. Why was the winter melon in the south, and not the pumpkin?3 And what was in the east? There\u2019s nothing she could do if the plants grow in wrong places.</p><br/><p>Li Goudan entered, and asked the owner of the building a few questions. As expected, that Gold Deity was no longer here, most probably to not expose his identity. After all, he already thought of making use of someone else to kill a person, so naturally, he wouldn\u2019t stay and wait here to have someone settle the score with him.</p><br/><p>They then directly went around the city to make inquiries, yet, no one else had seen that Gold Deity. Zhu Yao suspected that person most likely had changed his appearance as well. Seeing that she had taken an unnecessary loss this time, she could only admit that it was due to her misfortune.</p><br/><p>After running around for a day, the sky had already turned dark. Zhu Yao decided to stay in the city for a night, as she rented a room in a structure that looked especially like a sugar cane. It had to be mentioned that the boss of this place sure planned it out pretty well. Since there were layers on a piece of sugar cane, every layer was thus a room.</p><br/><p>That was a place similar to an inn, but these were not just regular rooms, but cave residences, filled with dense amount of divine energy, that were used for cultivation. One could make it a temporary residence, or cultivate in it for a long period of time.</p><br/><p>She was staying in the fifth layer, while Goudan was staying in the floor below. Just when Zhu Yao was about to close the door and head in for a rest, the moment she raised her head, she actually saw a familiar figure in front of her.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that person\u2026</p><br/><p>What a fateful coincidence!</p><br/><p>[1]Li Goudan(): A Chinese internet lingo which refers to someone with a beautiful face, but muscular body.</p><br/><p>[2]A lowly name could raise a better person: There\u2019s a Chinese saying that if you were to give your child a pet name, that child will work even harder in life.</p><br/><p>[3]Winter melon, in Chinese, is called (Fruit from the East), while the pumpkin is called (Fruit from the South). So she was commenting on how the pumpkin was situated in the east instead of the winter melon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

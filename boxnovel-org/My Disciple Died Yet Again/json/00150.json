All of the old spirits in the forest clearly said that when one\u2019s life was saved, he or she had to repay the kindness with their body. Liars, all of them!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was too lazy to care about this deeply lonely arrow spirit. Raising her hand, she summoned her own divine sword, and especially materialized it to the size that could fit three people. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Goudan nodded, as he casually turned to glance at her. \u201cEh? Boss, why do I feel that you suddenly grew a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!\u201d Goudan said with a serious expression. \u201cEarlier, you were merely at my shoulder-level. But now, you\u2019re right at my eye-level. Your legs seemed to have grown taller too, and your shoulders are a little wider\u2026\u201d Goudan looked at her from head to toe, and his face was filled with doubt. \u201cThough this part seems to be smaller\u2026\u201d As he said that, one of his claws reached out for her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d Raising her hand, Zhu Yao threw a fried dumpling right to his face[1].</p><br/><p>Goudan revealed a wronged look. \u201cI\u2019m serious, boss. Your face changed as well\u2026 As though you have changed\u2026 into a man, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?\u201d Zhu Yao heavily patted on her own chest. \u201cI\u2019m a genuine wom-\u201c</p><br/><p>Flat!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s words came to an abrupt halt.</p><br/><p>No, no, no. It\u2019s definitely a problem with the method she touched her own chest with.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s try again.</p><br/><p>She once again touched her own chest, yet, she still felt a vast flatland. This was illogical! Where did her little crystal dumplings go?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but want to pull up her skirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss?\u201d Goudan called out, as he immediately called out to stop her from acting out such moral-collapsing behavior. \u201cDid you drop something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded, as she felt like crying. \u201cYes!\u201d She dropped her morals.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d Zhu Yao pushed the woman into Goudan\u2019s hands, as she sprinted towards the nearby unoccupied large tree, and set down an isolation formation. Not giving up, she pulled apart the top of her skirt\u2026</p><br/><p>Her eyes instantly suffered from irreparable damage.</p><br/><p>Someone tell me, what\u2019s with that additional snake-like thing between my legs!?</p><br/><p>This was illogical!</p><br/><p>Wait a minute\u2026</p><br/><p>She recalled the notification window that appeared when she was first about to materialize a human form. That notification which only had the single body-type option available.</p><br/><p>Bi-Gender type\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell. Could there actually be a network delay with this body-type option!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao walked out with a soulless expression. In her mind, horse-shit kept springing out from the ten thousand horses that galloped past, which stepped on her fragile nerves one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss?\u201d Goudan revealed a worried look. \u201cDid you find the thing you dropped?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Then what should we do?\u201d Goudan became a little anxious as well. \u201cBoss, just what are you missing?\u201d Looking at her dejected look, it must have been a very incredible divine artifact.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gave him a smile that looked even uglier than crying. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t lose anything? I just found myself gaining an additional something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Ah!?\u201d</p><br/><p>While carrying an incomparably solemn mood, Zhu Yao returned to the inn. No matter how she thought about it, she could not accept how she had suddenly turned into a man. Just how did she change?</p><br/><p>Clearly, she had always been a woman till then. And she did not eat anything strange either, nor did she cast any strange divine art. The only exceptional point was that she was smacked by that female Deity.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, female Deity?</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, ever since she gained her human form, she seemed to have only made contact with people of the male gender. Her master, the Hall Master, and Dog-Egg. That female Deity was the only exception. And she seemed to have only turned into a man when she crawled up after being smacked to the ground by her.</p><br/><p>Could that be the reason? She suddenly had a terrible assumption.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoudan, come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Goudan walked over with a doubtful look. Zhu Yao instantly grabbed onto his hand. \u201cBoss! Y-Y-You\u2026\u201d Goudan instantly widened his eyes. \u201cI sell my body, but not my skills!\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t even think about it. \u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>She then instantly kicked Goudan out of the room, as she anxiously looked at the changes to her body. As expected, her figure was currently changing slowly. Her height shrank, and her face became slightly convex. Even the abnormal thing between her legs had disappeared as well.</p><br/><p>The hell. So her gender was set by the people by her side. If she were to make contact with a man, she would become a woman. If she were to make contact with a woman, then she would become a man? Wasn\u2019t this a little too random? Was it really alright for the so-called Bi-Gender type be so random?</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss!\u201d Goudan was still slamming on the door in sadness, wanting to come in. \u201cThat woman\u2019s injuries are very severe, I wish to save her. Please let me in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough nonsense. I will treat this woman, set a defensive formation outside for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao said this, as expected, he stopped, and obediently meditated outside the door to form a defensive formation.</p><br/><p>Looking at the female Deity who was lying on the bed, Zhu Yao momentarily felt uncomfortable. So the moment when she was smacked by her earlier, her second gender type was activated?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao expressed that she no longer had the energy to retort, as she accepted her fate and raised up the person on the bed. Sitting behind her, she circulated her divine energy, as she resigned herself to fate and began to treat her wounds. Haah. She couldn\u2019t bear to see the woman die in front of her, after all.</p><br/><p>As expected, the moment she made contact with her skin, a chemical reaction once again began to happen on her body, as she turned back into a male body.</p><br/><p>Heheh\u2026 Realmspirit you second uncle. Your grandfather\u2019s bi-gender!</p><br/><p>The female Deity\u2019s injuries were very severe. The person who chased after her must had harbored the thought to take her life, as he did not show any mercy in his methods. If she had not encountered them, she basically wouldn\u2019t be able to last through the night. The person who injured her must have been that Gold Deity which Goudan mentioned. She really wondered just what kind of deep hatred that person had for this woman, to the point where he had to send her to her deathbed no matter what.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could only circulate her divine energy to restore the woman\u2019s injured meridians. Restoring meridians was a very delicate process which did not allow the slightest bit of carelessness, and the consumption of divine energy was astronomical. Fortunately, she had a dimensional space worth of divine energy which she could freely use.</p><br/><p>While the Dantian was something she completely did not know how to restore. Fortunately, she had her all-purpose master with her. If she didn\u2019t know, she could always ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, how do I restore someone\u2019s Dantian? How much divine energy do I have to spend, and how should I circulate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. He had many opinions on her disciple\u2019s stupid kindness. In any case, that person was not even her family, so what\u2019s the use in saving her? Hence, he did not teach her wholeheartedly. He left out a bit of the techniques, and missed out on mentioning a little of the things she had to take note of.</p><br/><p>Thus\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOya, she puked out blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOya, I can\u2019t control the divine energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOya, the flow of the divine energy reversed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOya\u2026 the Dantian shattered into smithereens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao spent exactly three days, before she barely managed to somehow fix that unfortunate female Deity\u2019s Dantian, and she began to generate deep suspicion towards her own comprehensive ability. As expected, she was not suitable for cultivation, right?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath, and did the finishing touches. The treatment was pretty much done, and all that remained was to wait for her to wake up and nurture the healing process on her own. Zhu Yao got down from the bed, found a chair to sit on, and casually poured a cup of tea for herself.</p><br/><p>When she had only a third of the cup, that female Deity had already slowly regained consciousness. As though she sensed Zhu Yao\u2019s presence, she sat up shockingly. Tightly grabbing onto her own collar, she revealed a pitiful expression. It was as though she had some sort of heavenly grievances.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t known that this female Deity had an Oscar award, and that Zhu Yao herself was an authentic woman, it was really possible for others to suspect Zhu Yao for doing savage acts towards her.</p><br/><p>This one here did not even tear your clothes off, so why the hell are you grabbing onto your collar?</p><br/><p>When the female Deity saw that she did not have any reaction, her flustered emotions retracted a little, and the color on her face slowly returned as well. After circulating the air within her, she realized that the injuries on her body had already recovered to a large extent. \u201cWas it senior who saved this little one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao narrowed her eyes at her. She did not reply, and continued to drink her tea.</p><br/><p>As though she had already received her confirmation, the female Deity hurriedly got down from the bed, and bowed towards her. \u201cThank you, senior, for your saving grace. This little one will definitely repay you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her master had said that the schemes in her mind were heavy, and that she should not involve herself with her too deeply. Look at this expression of hers. From her eyes, it looked as though she would really do anything to repay her. She really had the knack for acting. Zhu Yao silently gave her a thumbs up. You do know how to act, but I do too. She was the greatest at acting cold and mighty.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior?\u201d Seeing that Zhu Yao still did not reply, the female Deity was a little anxious. She had thought that he would at least ask of her plight, yet, he did not even spare glance at her. This was the first time she had encountered such a cold man, it was as though other people\u2019s affairs were not even the least bit related to him. Then why did he save her?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao continued to drink her tea, and even her eyes had shifted to where the window was. She did not have the slightest intention to care about her. Mn\u2026 Being cold and mighty was a tradition handed down in the Lightning Divine Hall.</p><br/><p>The lady gritted her teeth. \u201cThis little one, is named Mo Xianxian, and has ascended from the White Spirit World. Senior, is it possible to inform this little Deity of your esteemed title? So that this one can repay you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao finally turned her head around. Yet, she simply glanced at her coldly, not the slightest bit of emotions could be seen carried within her eyes.</p><br/><p>Mo Xianxian was startled from his stare. His eyes were ruthlessly cold, yet, they were simply too penetrative, as though all kinds of schemes could not hidden under his eyes.</p><br/><p>Though, she was actually staring blankly into thin air.</p><br/><p>The female Deity realized that she was the first one who lost her cool, as she had indeed raised a degree of cautiousness in her heart. Earlier, she had inspected that her own injuries were mostly healed, and even her shattered Dantian was restored to a large extent. For someone to possess the power to restore a shattered Dantian in the Divine Realm was definitely someone who held great power. If he could take her in, then she would be much safer in the Higher Realm.</p><br/><p>But, how could someone like him easily agree to her request? He must have long seen through her schemes.</p><br/><p>Mo Xianxian gritted her teeth, and decided that she might as well fight for her chances. She instantly knelt down in front of Zhu Yao. \u201cI humbly request senior to save this little Deity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned, as she pinched on the now empty cup. She was hesitating whether she should have another cup.</p><br/><p>Like spilling beans, she spoke out the entire story. \u201cThis little Deity ascended only a month ago. However, ever since the day I ascended, unknown people has been chasing and attempting to assassinate me. I have hovered between the boundaries of life and death several times, and this time, I was even seriously injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao still did not speak, and simply silently turned the empty cup about.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that this matter is indeed unrelated to senior, and that this little Deity is being audacious.\u201d Mo Xianxian continued. \u201cBut, if there isn\u2019t anyone to aid me, I will definitely be killed by people in the dark. Although this little Deity\u2019s death isn\u2019t worth pitying for, wouldn\u2019t it be a waste of senior\u2019s efforts in saving my life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s brows twitched.</p><br/><p>Mo Xianxian clenched her fists, as she continued to plead. \u201cThis little Deity isn\u2019t aware of the identities of the people chasing me, and I have yet to form any grudges with anyone either. It\u2019s just\u2026 when this little Deity was in the Lower Realm, I have a practitioner-pair husband, and his name was You Ran. He had long ascended a thousand years before this little Deity. In these recent days, I have been going to several places to inquire about his present situation, but I have yet to find him. Instead, I have attracted several unknown enemies. So this little Deity guesses that the people who are chasing me, must have a grudge with my husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s the case. Zhu Yao put down the cup in her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior?\u201d Mo Xianxian carefully inspected his expression.</p><br/><p>However, he still did not speak up. Instead, he suddenly stood up, pulled the door open and walked out.</p><br/><p>You have already said it all yourself, so what\u2019s there left for her to talk about?</p><br/><p>[1]Another way of saying a big tight slap to the face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

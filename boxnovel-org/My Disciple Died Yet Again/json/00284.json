In a blink of an eye, the pea reverted back to the size of a basketball and flew towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeapea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sized up the pea from left to right. It was really the pea that she picked up.</p><br/><p>Just what did it do earlier? It swallowed the rampaging demonic beast? She had raised it for so many years, and had yet to see it eat anything. Did it need to have such a heavy taste right from the beginning?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao grabbed onto the green ball and shook it wildly. \u201cPeapea, you\u2019re alright, right? Don\u2019t eat something as strange as that, hey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a demonic beast! Hurry and spit it out! What if you\u2019re allergic to it?\u201d She began to locate its mouth in a fluster. However, she could not see even the tiniest of slit around this round pea.</p><br/><p>The pea struggled for a few moments. \u201cPea\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe obedient, hurry and spit it out. I will water you in the future, is that enough for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea pea pea!\u201d The pea shook and leapt out of her hands. It once again grew large, and opened its mouth in an instant.</p><br/><p>Ahmu..</p><br/><p>Her vision suddenly turned dark.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Bai: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The pea, had swallowed the three of them as well.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry, it seems I have been raising something strange.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was swallowed.</p><br/><p>She was swallowed by the pea she was raising.</p><br/><p>When she regained her senses, her surroundings were pitch-black, without the slightest hint of light. The strange thing was, she was not feeling any pain. Rather, she was feeling really comfortable.</p><br/><p>It was soft under her feet, and it felt pretty good. Not to mention it had a slight elasticity to it. She could not help but step a few more times. Just this texture quality alone could beat every branded carpet. Just as she wanted to look at it carefully, a cry sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo heavy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was shocked, as she immediately left that carpet. Why was this voice a little familiar?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle tyrant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao cast an fire art, and the surroundings instantly brightened. Little tyrant was lying next to her, and his chest was printed with two familiar footprints.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d She pulled little tyrant off the ground.</p><br/><p>Little Bai shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I simply felt that I was pounded on a few times earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho\u2026\u201d It definitely wasn\u2019t her!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao patted on his chest, destroying the crime evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re alright. Where\u2019s the other one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny, I\u2019m over here.\u201d Ye Qingcang\u2019s voice sounded from the side, as he stood up as well. There wasn\u2019t the slightest injury on his body\u2026 nor were there any footprints!</p><br/><p>Very good, the entire party was at full health! Only then did Zhu Yao begin to inspect her surroundings. It was really deep, like the passageway of a cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t we eaten? Why are we here?\u201d Ye Qingcang asked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao touched the stone wall, faintly sensing the energy ripples left by a teleportation formation. \u201cWe seemed to have been transferred to another place. This seemed like an underground passage. If my guess is correct, this should be the depths of that cave earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithin the cave!\u201d The two young pioneers were stunned. That cave had a complicated terrain. How were they going to get out?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Little tyrant suddenly pointed to an area in front of them.</p><br/><p>The passage that was still pitch-black earlier faintly emitted out a red glow. They took a few steps forward, and realized that a demonic beast with the height of an average human was presently curled up like a ball at the center. It seemed to have fallen into deep slumber.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this that\u2026\u201d Ye Qingcang\u2019s face was covered in astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cConcealed Rock Beast.\u201d Zhu Yao hurriedly stepped forward and used her spiritual energy to inspect it. She realized that the aura within its body was calm, nor were there any serious injuries within. At that moment, she heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, it did not self-destruct.</p><br/><p>Little tyrant walked over as well, and carefully inspected it on his own. \u201cWhy did it turn red? And why is it much smaller than before?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao carefully looked at this beast. Its body had turned red, and its figure was several times smaller than before. However, the spiritual energy emitting from its body was much firmer, and even the wounds on its body were beginning to heal. However, because the injuries it suffered were too heavy, it would most likely take more than a year for it to awaken.</p><br/><p>This was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt mutated!\u201d Zhu Yao said firmly. \u201cIts breakthrough failed and it fell to a third rank demonic beast. However, because its breakthrough was forcefully stopped, it led to a mutation which made it red.\u201d Haah, she wondered if this was a good outcome. Mutated beasts were much stronger than regular beasts, but it had fallen a rank and had sunk into deep slumber. It seemed like it was going to spend its time sleeping for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cPea\u2026\u201d A green pea rolled out from the red demonic beast\u2019s claw. As though it had shrunk, it turned into the size of a pearl.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that pea from earlier!\u201d Little tyrant was shocked, as he immediately summoned his own weapon.</p><br/><p>However, that pea merely rolled on the ground for a short while more, before it stopped moving completely.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stepped forward, squatted down and picked up the pea. She gave it a close inspection, yet she did not discover any anomaly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, what is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either!\u201d Zhu Yao shook her head. Back then when she picked it up, it was indeed a regular pea. However, it never expected by swallowing the Concealed Rock Beast, and sending it here, it could suppress its rampage. She faintly sensed that there was something irregular with the pea, yet it did not have that much spiritual intellect at all, and could only repeat the word \u2018pea\u2019 over and over again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost likely, it just wanted to bring us to where the Concealed Rock Beast was earlier, it did not have any evil intentions.\u201d Furthermore, it seemed to be the one which suppressed the rampage of this demonic beast. However, as to how it did it, she had no clue.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry and leave this place then?\u201d Zhu Yao kept the pea. \u201cThe terrain of this cave is complicated, and we have no idea where the exit is. You two are unable to abstain from food yet either, so we can\u2019t stay here for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about that demonic beast?\u201d Little Bai pointed at the beastie on the ground.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered for a moment. Shen then reinforced it with a few defensive formations. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any problems now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did she bring the two young pioneers along with her on the passageway.</p><br/><p>After going deeper did they truly realize just how huge the cave was. The place was filled with several forks, with each passage splitting to another tens of passages. They walked and turned, to the point where they were beginning to go dizzy. They basically had no idea where they were.</p><br/><p>They themselves were unaware of how long they had walked, to the point where even Zhu Yao, who held the highest cultivation out of the three, was beginning to feel a little tired as well. \u201cLet us rest for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the three finally stop. Zhu Yao turned around to take a look. Little tyrant was already drenched from sweat, while Ye Qingcang at the back had a miserably pale complexion, panting heavily. He had the lowest cultivation among the three, so it was extremely difficult for him to keep up with her pace. Yet, he did not complain at all during this entire journey, nor did he signal to stop. He truly was a man among men.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. She set down a spiritual energy gathering formation in the surroundings, and instructed them to replenish their spiritual energy. The two youths obediently nodded, and began to enter a meditative state.</p><br/><p>She pulled out the pea and inspected it for a while, yet she was still unable to find anything different about it. It was exactly the same as described by the girly Little Qian. Forget about awakening its spiritual intellect, it did not have a soul of its own.</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny!\u201d Ye Qingcang who was meditating at the side suddenly called out. He was presently looking at her with a confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d What is it?</p><br/><p>He said with serious look. \u201cQingcang has a question which he has been really wanting to ask for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never loved before!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d He was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Sorry.\u201d This was all purely on reflex. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask granny why you wanted to save that demonic beast?\u201d He said, perplexed. \u201cDemonic beasts and human practitioners are in opposing factions in the first place. Though we can take them in as spiritual beasts, generally, it\u2019s either we die or they do. Even if granny has saved that demonic beast today, most likely in the future, it will still be killed by other practitioners.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn\u2026 That\u2019s a very sophistical question.\u201d Zhu Yao stroked her chin. She pondered for a moment before replying. \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t actually have any reason. When I first saw that beast, it clearly could swallow me instantly, but it didn\u2019t do so. It had sufficient trust in me, believing that I wouldn\u2019t have it. I simply wanted to repay the equal amount of trust it had for me, that\u2019s all. It didn\u2019t kill me, so I helped him pluck out his tooth\u2026 I mean, pluck out the trident.\u201d Believe me, that tooth was an accident.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for what happened next, you saw it for yourself as well. Zhao Li used an illusion of me to lure it out. The reason why even though it was injured to such an extent, yet it still continued to hold its ground, was because it wanted to protect that false image. What it wanted to protect with its life was me. Since even a demonic beast can hold such heavy sense of righteousness, as a human being, why can\u2019t I do it as well? So, saving it with my life on the line is something I ought to do too. As for the future you mentioned\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao smiled. \u201cAs for what the future holds, it\u2019s all in the future. Probably it will still die one day, or because it\u2019s still alive it might even harm other practitioners. The cause and effect of the world is unclear in the first place. If we have to think about so many causes and effects before we do anything, then when will we ever have the time to do anything? What I can do, is follow one\u2019s conscience. At the very least, I did not betray my conscience earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang seemed to have some enlightenment, as though he had understood something. However, the next moment, it was as though he grew even more perplexed, his eyes turning hollow as he silently chanted. \u201cFollow one\u2019s conscience\u2026 Follow one\u2019s conscience\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s happening to him now?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you alright?\u201d Zhu Yao planned on patting him.</p><br/><p>A dense gust of spiritual energy suddenly blew out form his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was astonished, her palm turned a little numb.</p><br/><p>The spiritual energy in the surroundings suddenly stirred in disarray. As if they were being attracted by something, the five elemental spiritual energies madly poured towards Ye Qingcang.</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny\u2026\u201d He had a perplexed and flustered look on his face. The overwhelming spiritual energy had caused him to feel a little unbearable, as his face began to turn pale. Beads of sweat fell off from his forehead.</p><br/><p>This is\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and calm yourself, guide the spiritual energy into your body.\u201d Zhu Yao said with a sunken voice. \u201cFocus your senses, don\u2019t need to panic. You just have to keep thinking about what you comprehended earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did he cross his legs and sat back down. Taking in a deep breath, he guided the gathered spiritual energy into his body.</p><br/><p>Little tyrant was also startled awake by this sudden change. \u201cGrandma, this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe received a sudden enlightenment.\u201d Zhu Yao explained simply as she pulled Little Bai a little further away. After adjusting the spiritual energy gathering formation a little, she helped keep a look out for him.</p><br/><p>Little Bai had a perplexed look on his face, as he blankly looked at Qingcang for a while. A hint of envy flashed past his eyes, before sitting next to Zhu Yao to keep a look out for him as well.</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang meditated for about eleven hours, before the surrounding spiritual energy slowly calmed down. Furthermore, his cultivation had also leapt from the first level of Essence to the fifth level of Essence. As if he was sitting on an aeroplane, his speed of improvement was beyond compare.</p><br/><p>When he opened his eyes, a day had already passed. Taking a deep breath, she sensed the expansive spiritual energy in his own body. A smiling intent flashed past his plain face, as he looked at Zhu Yao excitedly. \u201cGranny\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it, I saw it.\u201d As expected of the main protagonist. He leveled up five times in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, junior-martial brother Ye.\u201d Little Bai smiled as well.</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang took a deep breath, as if wanting to suppress the excitement in the depths of his heart. Standing up, he respectfully bowed in front of Zhu Yao. \u201cThank you granny for your guidance. Qingcang was about to break through this mental barrier and strengthen his state of mind because of it. Qingcang will never ever forget his eternal gratitude for granny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for to be so exaggerated.\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hands and then patted on his shoulder. She could not help but feel a little excited in the depths of her heart as well. \u201cI simply said a few casual thoughts of mine, being able to receive an enlightenment was all your own efforts. Little one, not bad. Your future prospects are looking good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then smiled shyly.</p><br/><p>She never expected that she had the ability to allow others to receive sudden enlightenments. For a moment, Zhu Yao felt she was pretty awesome. Her acting power had risen a level, you know? She suddenly had thoughts of taking in disciples, what should she do? The main protagonist rose by five levels just from her saying a few words, if she were to take in disciples, wouldn\u2019t that\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>The main protagonist seemed to be a bug. If he were to raise his level too quickly, wouldn\u2019t that mean that he had taken huge steps towards his goal of becoming a global idol? The date of the residents wanting to walk on the path of bloodshed to deityhood would then be\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>Just what had she done?</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, fellow student Cang\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao pulled onto Ye Qingcang\u2019s hand, her face looked as if she wanted to cry. \u201cIf I were to say\u2026 What I said earlier are all lies, would you believe me?\u201d Promise me, alright? Let\u2019s try this all over again?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it too late for regrets now?</p><br/><p>There was only one sickness in the world that couldn\u2019t be cured, and that was blabbermouth-ism!</p><br/><p>Because she did not control her mouth for a moment, she allowed the main protagonist to receive a sudden enlightenment. Realizing this truth, tears fell from Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes. Along the way, she could not help but shoot resentful lightwaves at a certain someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny\u2026\u201d He began to look a little uneasy. \u201cWas there somewhere which Qingcang was unable to do well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s exactly because you have done too well!\u201d It was way too much.</p><br/><p>He grew even more flustered, thinking that she was dissatisfied with him. \u201cGranny, don\u2019t be angry. My spirit veins are of poor aptitude, and has only risen to the fifth level of Essence in a single moment of sudden enlightenment. Don\u2019t worry, I will continue to work hard in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must not!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I mean, you have already done really well.\u201d Don\u2019t continue to raise your level, it\u2019s really scary, alright?</p><br/><p>Only then did he nod doubtfully.</p><br/><p>In regards to Ye Qingcang, Zhu Yao really did not know what was best. From what she\u2019s seeing, she was really unable to suppress a good youth like him who possessed the correct three views on life. The key thing here was, even if she forced herself to be heartless, she did not know just which aspect of him she should begin from.</p><br/><p>According to the scenario, during the rise of this inspirational youth, the only thing that could be considered as a cheat, was the Pellet Hall\u2019s inheritance. However, if not for his own comprehending abilities, even if he had an inheritance it wouldn\u2019t have been of any use.</p><br/><p>In the modern era, there were five thousand years worth of knowledge that anyone could pick up and learn, yet not many people like Edison came into prominence. In the end, the reason why he became a renown pellet refining master, was truly because of his own capabilities and comprehending abilities. Not to mention the set of heaven-defying cultivation technique he crafted on his own later on.</p><br/><p>Presently, she was encountering a dead knot that could not be untied at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, there\u2019s light up front!\u201d Little tyrant pointed towards the front, and as expected, rays of light could be faintly seen. Though it was really dusky, a faint fresh scent was in the air.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

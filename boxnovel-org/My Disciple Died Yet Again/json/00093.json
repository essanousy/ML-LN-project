Because the main property of the Water Spirit Vein was gentleness, all disciples with the Water Spirit Vein had great natural comprehensive ability towards the Healing Arts.</p><br/><p>If we were to use online gaming terms, she possessed an innate cleric physique. But the clerics of the cultivation world, were not necessary in parties and dungeon raids. Because the method of healing with the Water Spirit Vein, mainly revolved around inserting their own spiritual energy into their targets\u2019 bodies, to heal their injuries. This method was very quick, but, it was extremely dangerous. Because of the mutual clash between the five different attributes of Spirit Veins, if an non-identical spiritual energy were to be inserted to the target\u2019s body, it would bring about the rejection by the target\u2019s innate spiritual energy, and the target might die at a faster pace instead of actually being healed.</p><br/><p>This was also why, during the Feng Yi Rescue Operation, Zi Mo sent her, whom he thought had the same Wood Spirit Vein as Feng Yi, and there was not a single person who objected to it. It\u2019s because of the fact that their spiritual energy would not clash.</p><br/><p>But this rule did this not apply towards the Water Spirit Vein. Water had a gentle property, and was the most stable out of all of the different types of spiritual energy. If the Water Spirit Vein was used to heal, when water spiritual energy was inserted into the target\u2019s body, not only would it not cause rejection, instead, it would be absorbed and fused into the target\u2019s spiritual energy, turning into the target\u2019s spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why the Water Spirit Vein was so welcomed, but, this also brought about a malpractice. Because the spiritual energy could be absorbed by the person himself, after inserting the spiritual energy into the target\u2019s body, wouldn\u2019t that mean the healer\u2019s own spiritual energy was taken away? Hence, someone harbored evil thoughts for those who possessed the Water Spirit Vein. By forcefully mating with disciples who possessed the Water Spirit Vein, other disciples could absorb the spiritual energy from their bodies, and raise their own cultivation.</p><br/><p>And the people who had their spiritual energy harvested, were termed as furnaces. Most practitioners who possessed a Water Spirit Vein had many other Spirit Veins as well, if one was not willing, during the harvesting process, other types of spiritual energy might be carried along as well. Hence, the more affinity one had towards the Water Spirit Vein, the purer the spiritual energy harvested would be.</p><br/><p>As for someone who only possessed a single Water Spirit Vein. Naturally, without saying, there wasn\u2019t a need to worry about harvesting process at all.</p><br/><p>However, Heavenly Spirit Veins were very rare, and it was especially so for the Water Heavenly Spirit Vein. Ever since the start of the Ancient Era, practitioners who possessed the Water Heavenly Spirit Vein numbered less than a hundred. And, they had either died under the hands of the harvesters, or died while being harvested.</p><br/><p>That was also the reason why Zi Mo was in such a panic when he saw that his daughter had the Heavenly Water Spirit Vein.</p><br/><p>Naturally, things like furnaces did not have a good reputation. Though, the act would not be disgraced if they were husband and wife, and only heretic practitioners would illegally raise a few furnaces. However, who could resist the temptation of raising one\u2019s cultivation? Although one in the just faction would not daringly and openly raise a furnace, he could openly, and justifiably marry her.</p><br/><p>But, even though it was easy to hide from a visible gun, it was hard to guard against a hidden arrow. Who would be sure that there wouldn\u2019t be any heretic practitioners making their moves in the dark?</p><br/><p>Zi Mo was actually a good person with a weak heart, and this fact could be seen from how he still thought about his disciple, who died five years ago, even up till this day.</p><br/><p>Hence, currently, Zi Mo did not have any dreams of having her daughter\u2019s cultivation exponentially increase, or seeing her ascend. He simply wished to see her live a stable life, even not departing on the road of cultivation was better than being harvested by someone else. Hence, he requested his little martial aunt, not to teach her any Mystic Arts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there no offensive Water Mystic Arts?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t any. It\u2019s just that due to water\u2019s gentle property, the Mystic Arts of this attribute are usually not formidable. Even if it allows one to control water, it\u2019s still not comparable to other Mystic Arts in strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression sank, as she stared at Zi Mo in the eyes. It allows one to control water, and you call it weak? You\u2019re kidding me, right?</p><br/><p>Who gave you this sort of idea? Call him out here, I guarantee that I won\u2019t beat him to death!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao realized that Xia Lewei was a very worriless little radish. She faintly knew that her Spirit Vein was not really good, after being upset about it for several days, she recovered and reverted back to that carefree little radish. Zhu Yao was a living trash. Back then, when she had not abstained from food, she did not need to worry since there was her master to take care of her. However, she currently had a disciple, so she had to depend on herself now.</p><br/><p>But, she did not know how to prepare food, so she simply brought his disciple to Zi Mo\u2019s home every day, and then, brought her back after feeding her. She was his daughter anyway, so it\u2019s his responsibility to feed her, right?</p><br/><p>Regarding the matter of not teaching her Mystic Arts, Zhu Yao did not agree to it, and would not agree to it. Although it\u2019s said that little radish would not have to be afraid of being harvested if she did not possess cultivation, it also meant that she would not have strength to fend for herself. It\u2019s always better to take the initiative to attack, then to be forced to attack.</p><br/><p>Today was yet another day of her routined freeloading.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Little radish came running over from afar, and she seemed to be holding onto something in her hands. With a face filled with expectations, she passed it over to her. \u201cThis is a Spirit Fruit which father gave me. Here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment, and she felt a gentle squeeze in her heart. How could she not protect such a cute disciple? She really wanted to pinch her little cheeks\u2026 No! She must stay calm, she was a cold and prideful Demigod Sovereign.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, master does not need to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little radish stiffened, her face was a little pale. A little disappointed, she retracted her small hands, and then, a moment later, she regained her spirits. \u201cThen Bao Bao shall give master something more delicious next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stroked her head, she was such a considerate little girl. Spreading out her arms, Zhu Yao said. \u201cLet\u2019s head back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Bao Bao responded sweetly, however, she took a step back, and obediently followed behind her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao whose arms were spread open: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened to the promised \u2018flying into her embrace\u2019?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao awkwardly kept her hands. Alright then, she was a cold and prideful Sovereign, it would indeed break her image a little if she was seen hugging a child.</p><br/><p>Turning around, she began to walk towards Jade Forest Mountain\u2019s teleportation formation. So as to prevent her little disciple from not being able to catch up, she even intentionally slowed her steps, and leisurely walked.</p><br/><p>The little radish was a good seedling. She had only taught her how to take in spiritual energy two days ago, yet currently, she was already at the second level of Essence. She planned on teaching her a few simple Mystic Arts a few days later.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the Sect Master\u2019s daughter has the Water Heavenly Spirit Vein?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen doesn\u2019t she have a potential to be a furnace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I never expected that even though the Sect Master had waited for this moment for so many years, in the end, it was all for naught. He actually bore such a daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that, any female practitioner who possesses the Water Spirit Vein, looks especially\u2026 I wonder how Sect Master\u2019s daughter looks like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, it goes without saying, since she possesses the Water Heavenly Spirit Vein after all. I wonder who she will form a practitioner-pair with in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Her future husband will sure be blissful, though, I wonder if he\u2019s able to protect her well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s right. Even I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Filthy conversations could be heard faintly from afar. Zhu Yao frowned, she was a little enraged in her heart. She never expected that people within the Ancient Hill Sect would have such thoughts as well. Just when she was about to teach them a lesson, she lowered her head and saw the little radish biting her lower lips, and instantly changed her mind.</p><br/><p>A child at her age, was already faintly aware of their surroundings. Although she could not understand the hidden meaning behind their conversation, she could still feel the evil intentions behind them. Furthermore, from the beginning, she had already known that her Spirit Vein was not really good.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you angry?\u201d Zhu Yao did not speak up, instead, she directly transmitted her voice to little radish.</p><br/><p>The little radish startled for a moment. Raising her head to look at her, as expected, faintly, there were already mists forming in her large eyes. She tightly clenched her small fists, before nodding her little head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you memorized the Water Controlling Art master taught you?\u201d Zhu Yao continued.</p><br/><p>The little radish nodded again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can try it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little radish\u2019s eyes shone. Turning her head to look at that two disciples who were still engaged in their conversations, she then looked at the pond at the side, and began to chant out the Mystic Art. She tried two times, yet, she was unable to succeed. Clenching her teeth, she chanted it for the third time.</p><br/><p>Finally, ripples began to form on the calm water surface. Slowly, the water rose, forming into a big lump of water. The little radish held her breath as she controlled the water, after moving it above the heads of the two people who were still chatting lively with each other, her spiritual energy finally depleted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shuaa~\u201d Instantly, the two people became two drenched chickens.</p><br/><p>Just when the little radish was about to celebrate.</p><br/><p>The two drenched people suddenly stood up. \u201cWho was it? Whose prank was this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little radish\u2019s face instantly paled. With a light wave of her sleeves, Zhu Yao hid their figures.</p><br/><p>The two of them searched for a long time, yet, they were still unable to find the trace of any human figure. Only then did they blame themselves for the bad luck, complaining as they walked far away.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao brought little radish, and flew straight back to Jade Forest Mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d The eyes little radish was looking at her with, finally regained that sparkling luster, and beneath them were filled with the radiance of worship towards her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stroked her head, and took the opportunity to teach her. \u201cIt\u2019s good to endure in secret. However, if you bottle up too much of your feelings, it\u2019s very easy to result in internal injuries. So, if there are matters you can\u2019t tolerate, there\u2019s no need to tolerate them. Whoever slaps your face, give that person a ruthless slap back, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn!\u201d The little radish nodded strongly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly felt mighty and domineering.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 Master, why did we have to hide?\u201d The little radish asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d If we don\u2019t hide, won\u2019t we be simply waiting for them to catch us? \u201cIt\u2019s to\u2026 keep a low profile. They\u2019re unable to beat us already, at the very least, we have to leave them some face. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand!\u201d The little radish nodded as though she had just received a royal decree. (\u2299o\u2299)</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao lips twitched. She wouldn\u2019t be raising a little tyrant, right? Mn, that wouldn\u2019t happen. She\u2019s such a kind child. \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>Five years later.</p><br/><p>Little radish had already become a huge radish. Her cultivation had already raised from the second level of Essence to the eighth level of Essence as well. Among her peers at the same age, she was considered to be extremely fast. Zhu Yao was very pleased, but Zi Mo was very worried.</p><br/><p>Whenever he had the opportunity, he would climb up Jade Forest Mountain, and sob and sigh to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial aunt, my Bao Bao\u2026 Lewei, oh, that\u2019s not right, it\u2019s Yu Luo. I think it\u2019s best that she doesn\u2019t raise her cultivation so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the Daoist title Zhu Yao gave the little radish was Yu Luo (Rad)\u2026 Bo (ish). She was after all, a disciple of Jade Forest Mountain, so naturally, she had to have the surname \u2018Yu\u2019.</p><br/><p>Speaking of this, there\u2019s something she had to bring up. Back then when she was giving her disciple a Daoist title, she was initially really casual about it. She had wanted to give her the name \u2018Di\u2019 (stem). There were only two of them on the Jade Forest Mountain, two flowers which had stemmed themselves and blossomed on this mountain peak. It was a name that was at the level of fresh and modern literature.</p><br/><p>However, it was ruthlessly rejected by Zi Mo. He stayed in Jade Forest Mountain and protested, roaring out loud. \u201cMartial aunt, if you dare to give my daughter the name \u2018Yu Di\u2019 (Jade Emperor), then I will dare to jump down from the peak of this Jade Forest Mountain as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>So as to settle down the internal strife within the sect, Zhu Yao could only reluctantly give up on this name. And in the end, her name was fixed as \u2018Luo\u2019.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had to admit, the name she gave was at a much higher level than her master\u2019s, though she had to blame her disciple for having a father with such poor tastes.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial aunt, your teachings are great, however, isn\u2019t it a little too tiring for you? Why don\u2019t you take a break for a short while?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial aunt, I heard that there\u2019s some problems with the formation at Moonleague Sect, since you have studied formations for so many years, why don\u2019t you head over to give them some pointers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial aunt\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, recently, Zi Mo had been finding excuses to prevent his own daughter from being so eye-catching. Of course, he was ignored by Zhu Yao. After all, her master had often ignored people this way as well, so Zi Mo should be already used to it.</p><br/><p> (Yu Di): The name she wanted to give Yu Luo.</p><br/><p> (Yu Di): With the same pronunciation, it\u2019s Chinese for Jade Emperor, which is usually the title given to the emperor governing the celestial world in many chinese mythologies.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

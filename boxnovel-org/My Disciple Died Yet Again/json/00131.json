She seemed to rarely return to Jade Forest Mountain, as she spent her entire time in the Main Mountain dealing with a few Sect matters. Zi Mo had already gone into life-death isolation. He only had a short amount of lifespan left, and if he did not make a breakthrough into a Demigod this time, he would most likely fall as a Nascent Soul practitioner. Most of the matters in Ancient Hill Sect had mostly been handed to the various Mountain Lords and Yu Luo.</p><br/><p>Only Zhu Yao and Yue Ying remained in Jade Forest Mountain. Zhu Yao was busy looking for Mu Meiyan as well, so she would often head out. Only Yue Ying was really staying on the Jade Forest Mountain. Yue Ying was a child who lacked a sense of presence, adding that he did not speak often, if not because he would often like to follow her by her side, Zhu Yao would have subconsciously forgotten about him. Though, he was very serious with his cultivation. It could be seen from how he was able to form his Azoth Core so quickly with his aptitude as a holder of the Penta-Spirit Veins.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but feel a little guilty towards him. Back then, she made the decision to bring him out. However, for so many years, he had basically been placed in someone else\u2019s care. Even the matters related to his cultivation were taught by Yu Luo. She had basically not laid her hands in anything.</p><br/><p>Turning around, she looked at Yue Ying who had been staring at her with a wooden expression. Though, his eyes were crystal clear. Other than her figure being printed in them, there was nothing else. Forget about resentment, it was as though it was enough for him to simply look at her like this.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt even worse than before, as she felt that she had really neglected her duty. Taking the opportunity that there was such a nice sky today, she thought of giving him some pointers in regards to his cultivation. Just when she was about to speak, suddenly, the earth shook. On the surface of the sea which was calm earlier, a pillar of light suddenly appeared, firing straight to the clouds. Auspicious signs surfaced everywhere, as the rainbow-colored light scattered down, filling the entire sky with colorful clouds. Rows of flowers around Ancient Hill Sect bloomed one after another, and in an instant, the scent of flowers suffused in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d The hell was this?</p><br/><p>\u201cA unique artifact has surfaced in the sea.\u201d Feng Yi flew over with her sword, hinted for Zhu Yao to follow her, before flying towards the pillar of light.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao faintly sensed that this matter wasn\u2019t that simple either. \u201cBe obedient, stay here and wait for my return.\u201d</p><br/><p>After instructing Yue Ying, she flew her sword and chased after her. In but an instant, they had already flown close to the pillar of light. They were not the first ones to arrive, as a few people had already begun to crowd the nearby area. However, all of them were Demigod Sovereigns of the other Sects, and Qihan was one of them. Most probably, they had all sensed the unusual movements, and rushed over here.</p><br/><p>That pillar of light was very huge, with an estimate of ten meters in diameter. It seemed to be formed completely by spiritual energy, and it was so dense, it looked as though it was about to solidify. Everyone did not move, and simply stared at it intensely. However, the onlookers began to increase, and seemingly all of them were practitioners above the Nascent Soul stage. When a unique artifact emerged, there would be a phenomenal sign produced by the heaven and earth. Adding that this sign was so obvious as well, it could be seen how valuable the treasures inside would be. There might even be Divine Tools.</p><br/><p>A moment later, within the pillar of light, a long-shaped something suddenly rose, and everyone waited with bated breaths. Yet, they could not help but begin to size up the surrounding crowd. A treasure without a master, naturally belonged to the person who first lay his hands on it. There was never absolute peace in the cultivation world, let alone in front of personal benefits. The atmosphere instantly became a little tense.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, due to the re-emergence of the Devil, it created a scene where everyone was united in one go. Now that this trend was about to collapse, Zhu Yao suddenly felt a little powerless.</p><br/><p>That pillar of light slowly faded, and the thing inside slowly revealed itself as well. Unexpectedly, it was not a Divine Pellet nor a Divine Tool, but a gigantic door. With an incomparably huge structure, its entire surface was purely white, and it looked extremely ancient.</p><br/><p>And, red-colored words, the size of a human body, were written at the very top of that door.</p><br/><p>White Rabbit Divine Residence.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a residence of a Deity from the Higher Realm!\u201d Someone exclaimed. In an instant, the entire crowd was completely excited. That was, after all, a Divine Residence, a residence which belonged to someone who had already ascended and turned into a Deity. Any random object inside would be Divine Tools that the Lower Realm could only dream of having.</p><br/><p>Earlier, because of the fact that there was Demigods present, the people who felt that they did not have any hope of obtaining the treasure, instantly became excited. How could someone who was called a Deity only possess a single Divine Tool? As long as they were able to enter the place, then there would be hope of obtaining one. Many people had already unconsciously summoned their weapons, and took a stance as though they could prepare to fight at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign, do you think there\u2019s any link between this Divine Residence and that Devil?\u201d In the end, there were still person who understood, and this understanding person was even someone familiar \u2013 Mountain Lord of Beast-Taming Mountain, Zi Dan. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s that pig-riding fatty.</p><br/><p>His fat figure squeezed forward, and the two, man and pig, instantly pushed away several people. Rushing all the way in front of her, he asked respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility.\u201d Zhu Yao answered ambiguously.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the battle spirit of the crowd of people who were filled with eagerness earlier, instantly died down, as they looked at that door with fear.</p><br/><p>How could there be such a coincidence? The Devil had only just emerged, and a Divine Residence from the Higher Realm appeared right after. There was definitely a need to get to the bottom of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn regards to whether there\u2019s a link or not, we will know once we break into it.\u201d It was unknown who shouted that out, as suddenly, a gigantic ice shard attacked towards that white door. However, at the moment it struck the door, the ice shard disappeared, as though it had been devoured.</p><br/><p>Before the crowd could even react in time, a ray of light flashed past from the door. The ice shard which had disappeared earlier, suddenly resurfaced and flew out. This time, however, it struck towards the direction where the ice shard was shot out from earlier.</p><br/><p>One Nascent Soul practitioner could not dodge in time, and was struck head-on. If not because he was able to put up a barrier at the very last moment, most probably, he would have already been penetrated by the ice shard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis door, has a Reflection Mystic Art placed on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned, as they began to try firing out a few attacks. Without an exception, all of them were shot back towards where they came from. Even Demigod Sovereigns had attacked as well, however, the door still did not have even the slightest trace of opening.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange, clearly, there\u2019s no energy wave being produced by a formation. So why?\u201d The people present could not help but feel an itch in their hearts. Even though the treasure was right in front of them, they could not find the key to open the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere seems to be some wordings on the door.\u201d Someone reminded, and only then did everyone\u2019s attacks stopped. One after another, they looked towards it, yet, there were only foggy clouds in their minds.</p><br/><p>Several grids faintly began to surface on the door, and several wordings seemed to be written sporadically inside the grids. And these wordings, were all regular numbers. Zhu Yao\u2019s face instantly stiffened, as she instantly sensed the malice of the entire world.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-T-This\u2026 This is!\u201d Though, Zi Dan was the one who carried a shocked face, and even Feng Yi had widened her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoist Zi Dan, do you recognize this?\u201d Someone excitedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an ancient mechanism.\u201d Zi Dan gave it away in an instant.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened even more. That\u2019s right. The ancient mechanism \u2013 Magical Squares. I dare you people to come and complete it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoist recognizes this formation!\u201d That person continued excitedly. \u201cThen, are you able to dispel it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Dan shook his head, and took a deep breath. As though he recalled a sad past, he felt a little depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoist Zi Dan, are you really unable to dispel it?\u201d That person thought that he wasn\u2019t willing to do it instead, as he constantly urged him. \u201cThis matter is of grave importance. That Devil might be hiding inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m unwilling. I really do not have the power to do so.\u201d Zi Dan said. \u201cThis ancient mechanism is extremely complicated, and the method to dispel it has long been lost. I have once seen junior-martial brother Soi dispel it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, who was previously Junior-martial brother Soi: Your sister\u2019s complicated! Her current feelings were really complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder where this junior-martial brother with the surname Soi is? Are you able to call for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sadness being emitted out from Zi Dan became even more evident. Only after a moment later did he choke out. \u201cThat junior-martial of mine has long fallen a thousand years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>That person went silent, and only a moment later did he let out a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>Even Feng Yi, who was at the side, seemed to have recalled some sad past events as well. With a dazed look, a moment later, she muttered to herself. \u201cBrother Soi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt her legs go limp for a moment, and had almost fallen into the sea. Version 3.0 was definitely her dark history.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that there really isn\u2019t anyone capable of dispelling this formation?\u201d Everyone present quietened down in an instant, as they revealed out slightly helpless looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao weakly raised her hand. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, dozens of eyes, concentrated on her one after another.</p><br/><p>Even Feng Yi\u2019s and Zi Dan\u2019s eyes had instantly shone as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know how to dispel this!?\u201d Feng Yi suddenly took a step forward, and looked straight at her. In her eyes, various emotions were flashing, circulating back and forth, as though something was about to light up. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master has once taught me about it.\u201d Zhu Yao took out the multi-purpose excuse.</p><br/><p>As expected, in an instant, the light in Feng Yi\u2019s eyes was extinguished immediately. However, everyone revealed understanding looks one after another.</p><br/><p>Sovereign Yu Yan was after all, someone who had ascended. He had lived for more than ten thousand years, and his abilities were unfathomable. And, he specialized in formations, so knowing about ancient mechanisms like this was very normal as well.</p><br/><p>The crowd of people who were still squeezing together earlier, instantly opened up an empty path, as they excitedly looked at Zhu Yao as she was dispelling the formation.</p><br/><p>More than a hundred Nascent Soul practitioners, and adding a few Demigod practitioners, were staring at her while she was playing Magic Squares. This scene was simply too beautiful. She did not dare to look at all.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao embarrassingly walked over, and began her additions and subtractions starting from the ten-digit numbers. Currently, she was deeply regretting that she did not manage to teach Feng Yi the Magic Squares in time back then. This totally wasn\u2019t something difficult, yet everyone was looking at her with such revering eyes. The pressure on her was similar to a mountain pressing down on her, alright?</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much difference between this Magic Square and the ones she dispelled before. It was just a little more complicated. However, even if it was more complicated, it wasn\u2019t even a matter that would take her more than half an hour. Zhu Yao hesitated a little as she looked at the final grid. For a moment, she was a little uncertain if she wanted to open this door.</p><br/><p>The appearance of this Divine Residence was indeed really strange. In the vicinity around this sea, other than Ancient Hill Sect, there are several other Deity Sects as well. If a Divine Residence was hidden here, theoretically speaking, someone should have found it after so many years. Why did it not emerge for so long, and only made a sudden appearance now?</p><br/><p>Was that Devil really hiding inside? The Devil was also a remnant from the Ancient Era, so it knowing this Magic Square would be very normal too. However, with the Devil\u2019s means, since it had already set down a Magic Square to prevent people from entering, why did it want to allow the Divine Residence to emerge as well? Wasn\u2019t it simply seeking a beating?</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign?\u201d Seeing that she had suddenly stopped moving, the people at the side anxiously reminded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gritted her teeth. Forget it, counter soldiers with arms, water with an earth weir. She wouldn\u2019t know the outcome if she did not head in to take a look. Hence, she made her decision and wrote down the last formation character in the grid.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao hurriedly retreated a few steps back. The entire white door suddenly emitted out a red glow. The door which white was still snow-white earlier, was instantly enveloped completely with a red glow. At the slit of the once tightly shut door, a ray of green light emerged, and then, the door slowly opened.</p><br/><p>The door gradually opened, and not even a moment later, the opened space was already enough to allow a single person to enter.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a black light fiercely surged from the surface of the sea, and poured straight towards the door, while carrying a familiar sharp howling, as though countless of ghosts were screaming at the same time. As everyone did not make any preparations beforehand, every single one of their souls shook, and they spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. The sky instantly darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil\u2026 The Devil Race\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Furthermore, some of their Nascent Souls were even close to being shaken out of their body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheheh. I really have to thank you people for helping me open this Divine Residence.\u201d A sinister and cold female voice resounded.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She had considerably good looks in the first place, and adding that her cries were accompanied with a degree of gentleness and frailness, a feeling of pity could not help but well up within people\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>However, Nangong Cheng suffered some losses because of her before. This time, no matter how much sadder she was going to cry, not even the slightest hint of pity would well up within him. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m unaware that you\u2019ve tempered with the Extermination Formation. Since we\u2019re alive right now, it proves that we\u2019ve long known about the truth. There\u2019s no longer a need for you to act in front of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mei Xue\u2019s expression stiffened, showing a terrible face that looked as if her secret had been exposed.</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng coldly snorted. No longer having the thought of caring about such lowly people, he called out to the rest to continue on their way. The surrounding sharp screams grew even louder, and ominous winds wildly blew. It was as if something terrifying was hurrying in their direction.</p><br/><p>The faces in Mei Xue\u2019s group instantly turned miserably pale. She couldn\u2019t be bothered with anything else any longer and immediately block their path. \u201cDaoist Nangong, it\u2019s all my fault back then! That\u2019s right! I made use of you people. But that\u2019s an idea that I came up with alone, and it\u2019s unrelated to the rest. You can watch me die, but please save my three companions.\u201d SHe pointed at the three men next to her. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re willing to let them into the barrier and have them stay inside till those crowd of shadows move away, Mei Xue is willing to die to pay for her sins.\u201d</p><br/><p>When her words fell, the few men next to her were not the only ones that were stunned, even Zhu Yao herself could not believe her ears. This was illogical! Mary Sue had actually learnt how to sacrifice herself to save others!?</p><br/><p>\u201cMei Xue, you can\u2019t! Even if we die, what regrets would we have?\u201d One of the men in green robes refuted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Man Number Two replied as well. \u201cAs long as we can be with you, so what if we die right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we die, we have to die together.\u201d The other man immediately expressed his intentions as well.</p><br/><p>Everything became sensational in an instant. Mei Xue however heavily shook her head, sprinkling the tears that had yet to dry. The scene could only be described as mournful. \u201cNo! I can\u2019t pull you all down. It\u2019s all my fault, so let me bear this burden alone! Daoist Nangong, please save them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Nangong Cheng was stunned, and grew a little hesitant in an instant, as though he never expected that Mei Xue would die for the sake of others.</p><br/><p>\u201cMei Xue!\u201d The three men was still planning to stop her, when suddenly, Mei Xue forcefully pushed them away. She then pulled out a long sword out of nowhere, and with determined eyes, she looked at Nangong Cheng. \u201cDaoist Nangong, please keep to your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she had already pushed her sword towards her neck. Just as the tip of the sword was about to reach her neck\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, what are doing!?\u201d The hell, he hadn\u2019t even agreed to it yet! Nangong Cheng was stunned, and out of reflex, he reached out his hand attempting to stop her action.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank. \u201cWait, Nangong Huang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, she was a step too late. His hand had already reached out of the barrier, and the barrier opened up right at that moment. Almost at the same time, the plot changed drastically. The three people that Mei Xue pushed away restrained Nangong Cheng in an instant, while the sword that Mei Xue planned on stabbing her own neck with was now held against Nangong Cheng\u2019s neck. The barrier immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d Mei Xue who was still incomparably gentle and frail earlier, had already changed her expression. Her laughter was filled with extreme arrogance and impudicity. \u201cI\u2019ve never expected that such a stupid person like you would actually be tricked so easily. You lot deserve to die here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou venomous woman, let go of me.\u201d Nangong Cheng trembled in anger. However, this floor was a divine energy restricted zone in the first place, and with him being restrained by three people, he was basically unable to move at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of you? I finally managed to capture you, how could I possibly let go of you so easily?\u201d Mei Xue kicked him, and then looked at the rest. \u201cNone of you move, otherwise, I will kill him right here and now!\u201d The sword in her hand moved, instantly drawing out a slit of his blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cNangong!\u201d Zhonggu Lu trembled in fury. \u201cWhat can you show by threatening others? If you have the guts, then fight me one-on-one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mei Xue coldly laughed and ignored him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned and took a step forward. \u201cMei Xue, just what are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do? What else can I do in this upper floor?\u201d Mei Xue coldly snorted, her face was filled with scorn. She sent a glance to the man at the side, and he immediately received her intentions. He began to search Nangong Cheng\u2019s body, and in a few short moments, he found a bag that was filled with Nascent Divided Pearls.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe still has five of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mei Xue then nodded satisfyingly. Right from the start, her goal was to steal their Nascent Divided Pearls. Her pleads earlier were all just an act.</p><br/><p>As they held onto Nangong Cheng, the four of them retreated to a safe distance, and then she coldly laughed. \u201cThen, I hope you all enjoy your final moments.\u201d</p><br/><p>She suddenly moved away her sword and then ruthlessly stabbed Nangong Cheng in the back, piercing straight through his chest. Pulling her sword out, she then pushed him towards them. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d They then turned around and fled towards the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cNangong!\u201d Zhonggu Lu hurriedly caught the injured Nangong Cheng.</p><br/><p>Mei Xue and her gang had already disappeared without a trace, but that stab of hers was truly ruthless, as Nangong Cheng\u2019s chest was already completely dyed red. Such injuries wouldn\u2019t amount to anything if things were like before, but they were unable to use mystic arts here. Even with his divine physique, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on if his blood continued to flow like this.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao squatted down and cupped his wrist. As expected, his loss of blood was severe.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly\u2026\u201d Nangong Cheng wished that he could smash his head into the wall right now. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault! I got tricked by that bitch\u2019s scheme again! Even the Nascent Divided Pearls are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind, what use is there to bring it up now?\u201d Zhu Yao was a little irritated. Nangong Cheng\u2019s earlier action was all pure instinct, who would have thought that Mei Xue was here to steal their Nascent Divided Pearls in the first place? Her stupidity was to blame as well. Mei Xue was a ruthless character in the first place, how could she possibly plead to them? She should have realized it earlier.</p><br/><p>Initially, Mei Xue had five men next to her, while there was now only three of them left. Clearly, something must have happened. For a woman who would even use her own people, what else wouldn\u2019t she do?</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly is right, this isn\u2019t the time to pursue responsibility.\u201d Zhonggu Lu was incredibly anxious as well. Seeing blood endlessly flowing out of his chest, even his hands were beginning to tremble. \u201cLet\u2019s think of a way to stop your blood from flowing out for now! If things go on like this, you will be in trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t only one trouble right now!\u201d Yu Yan suddenly spoke out coldly.</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hand, his Life Artifact had already appeared in his hand. Raising his head, he looked to the near distance and solemnly said. \u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment his words fell, a wave of sharp screams rang deep into their ears, and they could not help but feel an immense chill in their hearts. The human-devouring shadows were here.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately pulled out that red \u201cpatch\u201d weapon as well. Fortunately, it was her Life Artifact, and was already considered a part of her body, so there was no need for the circulation of divine energy to pull it out. Though, the effects of the sword would be greatly limited, and it could no longer be considered as a divine artifact, but a normal weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Nangong, he\u2026\u201d Zhonggu Lu grew even more flustered.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao clenched her fists, and then turned to look at the person behind her. \u201cYue Ying, can you help stop his blood from flowing out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying did not hesitate and simply stepped forward. With a wave of his sleeves across Nangong Cheng, the blood from his chest immediately stopped flowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Zhonggu Lu was completely dumbfounded, as he looked at Yue Ying with a face that seemed as if he was looking at a ghost. \u201cYou\u2026 Could it be that your mystic arts aren\u2019t sealed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time to explain, those shadows are coming.\u201d Zhu Yao turned towards the front. Holding onto the sword in her hand tightly, she stood next to her master.</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu understood that this wasn\u2019t the time to ask questions. He stood up and made preparations for battle as well. Even Nangong Cheng took a deep breath and struggled to stand up on his feet.</p><br/><p>A moment later.</p><br/><p>Ding dong. Something fell in front of them, and then it rolled for a short while on the ground before shattering resoundingly. That was actually a completely used up Nascent Divided Pearl. Zhu Yao instantly understood why Mei Xue actually had the time to come up with such a long act even though they were clearly being chased by those shadows.</p><br/><p>This Nascent Divided Pearl seemed to have been placed here by them preemptively, in order to block those shadows that were roaming everywhere and buy them time for their act. Zhu Yao and her group had most likely unknowingly walked into this barrier. This Nascent Divided Pearl could not last for long in the first place, and it had already reached its limit.</p><br/><p>The instant the Nascent Divided Pearls shattered, immense number of shadows crazily pounced towards them. Piercing screams rang painfully in their ears. The place was filled with flying shadows, and occasionally, those shadows would flash their human faces that grew even more sinister and terrifying as more of them did. Even the shadows that flew past them carried a bone-piercing chill, as though they could injure them with frostbites.</p><br/><p>Those shadows seemed to have specific goals in their minds. Some charged towards her master, some charged towards Nangong Cheng, some charged towards Zhonggu Lu, and even more of them charged towards Yue Ying, except her!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little dumbfounded. Looking at the waves after waves of shadows, they split towards the people at the side and were completely avoiding her. Not a single one of them turned around and give her a glance. Not a single one!</p><br/><p>Just what was going on? Did Realmspirit give her a cheat again? However, ever since she entered the tower, she wasn\u2019t given any sort of preferential treatment. Even her World Favourable Impression passive seemed to have been completely ineffective right from the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d She looked at the people next to her with strange eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d Yu Yan swung away the several shadows with his sword, and then turned to look at her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not have time to explain when the next shadow took the opportunity to attack Yu Yan\u2019s back. \u201cMaster, watch out!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately slashed at it and that shadow instantly dissipated, turning into a mass of black smoke. However, the smoke did not scatter off, and instead began to gather together once more. In just a few moments, it once again formed a complete figure, and a human face instantly surfaced. That was a face of an old man. He had a long beard and white hair, looking extremely kind. He even looked a little familiar.</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, it turned into a sinister look, and with a sharp scream, it came pouncing towards her. Zhu Yao swung her sword and once again scattered it.</p><br/><p>As expected, in less than ten minutes, that shadow once again changed back, and Zhu Yao seemed to have accidentally caught its attention. This shadow began to change its target and launch attacks at her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was not a physical practitioner. Her sword techniques were not as strong as her divine arts, and could only be considered average. However, it was more than enough to deal with a single one. However, if this went on, nothing would change. These things could reform themselves limitlessly and could not be killed at all. They had to find a plan.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao inspected her surroundings, but was shocked by the person behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying!\u201d He was actually staring blankly in the air while standing in the center of a large number of shadows!</p><br/><p>Without even thinking, Zhu Yao charged over. With a few slashes, she cut away several shadows that were surrounding Yue Ying, instantly pulling a large number of aggro.</p><br/><p>In an instant, large number of shadows came flying towards her.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 She seemed to have become an off-tank.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

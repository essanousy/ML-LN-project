Living in the mountain were the few elite disciples accepted by the various hall masters of the sect.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had arrived in the early morning, however, she did not head over to the sect master\u2019s cave residence, but instead, went straight towards another cave residence in the middle. That place was filled with spiritual plants, and red flowers and lush green willow trees were arranged with particular elegance. The divine energy present were not far off from Dawnfall Peak either. Zhu Yao looked around as she walked, until she stopped in front of a large jade-green gate, only to realize a seal was placed on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYin Xin wishes to meet senior-martial brother Xu.\u201d Zhu Yao shouted.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the jade-green gate was opened. Before she could even enter, an azure-clothed man came forward. His face was colored with delight, as though he was very surprised from her visit.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Yin!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao smiled. \u201cI have never visited senior-martial brother\u2019s cave residence, and since I was passing by, I decided to swing by. I\u2019m not bothering senior-martial brother, am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Xu Nuoyan gave a warm smile, and gently said. \u201cFor junior-martial sister to visit my place, it\u2019s naturally something I can\u2019t hope but wish for. Even if I\u2019m currently in isolation training, it\u2019s a must to welcome junior-martial sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sure know how to talk, instantly pointing out that he gave up on his isolation training, all for the sake to see her. Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t the least bit guilty of it!</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister, please.\u201d Xu Nuoyan directed her to the living room, and personally poured her a cup of tea. \u201cJunior-martial sister, why the sudden thought of seeing your senior-martial brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao put down the tea-cup in her hands. \u201cMy mother had told me this, that senior-martial brother was my father\u2019s personal succeeding disciple. Senior-martial brother have always been kind, and even has the best talent in the sect, so she wants me to learn from senior-martial brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSect master has spoke too highly of me.\u201d Xu Nuoyan said modestly, however, his gaze towards Zhu Yao had begun to drift, revealing an affectionate look. \u201cFor junior-martial sister Yin to be able to understand me, this senior-martial brother is already very satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, Yin Xin had too many misunderstandings of senior-martial brother.\u201d Zhu Yao followed his cue. \u201cBut, I have only just awoken. Everyone simply looks foreign to me, including you, senior-martial brother. That was why my mother cancelled the practitioner-pair ceremony in my will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Nuoyan\u2019s expression sank. \u201cI understand, junior-martial sister, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore.\u201d Zhu Yao immediately interrupted his words. \u201cOn that day, when that Miss Mo made her speech, she confidently said that senior-martial brother was her husband, and that she was your legal wife. Although I, Yin Xin, do not possess a high level of cultivation, I\u2019m still my mother\u2019s daughter. No matter how one see it, I can\u2019t possibly marry to a man who already has a wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister, you misunderstood me, I don\u2019t ha\u2026\u201d Xu Nuoyan eagerly tried to explain like before.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right!\u201d Zhu Yao once again interrupted his words. \u201cOn that day, she seemed to have pulled out your token of love as proof.\u201d Zhu Yao immediately took out a hair pin. \u201cI was curious back then, so I picked it up to have a look, and realized that the \u2018Xian\u2019 letter was even carved on it? Mother said that it looked rather similar to senior-martial brother\u2019s handwriting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan\u2019s face paled. He suddenly stood up, and said with a furious look. \u201cThat lady surnamed Xian is simply too crafty, for her to actually use such a method to frame me. It\u2019s no wonder your misunderstanding of me is so deep. Junior-martial sister, I have never gifted anyone a hair pin, you must not listen to an evil person\u2019s words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really do not recognize this hair pin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Xu Nuoyan, swear to the heavens!\u201d Xu Nuoyan said with a stern look.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d Zhu Yao immediately kept the hair pin, and covertly moved her hand to her waist, pressing down on the piece of jade that was shaking faintly. \u201cJust take it as though I was thinking too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Xu Nuoyan\u2019s emotions calmed down a little, and went back to take his seat. He then once again looked at her suffocating gaze. \u201cJunior-martial sister, you do not understand senior-martial brother because you have only just awoken, I can understand\u2026 why you\u2019re unwilling. Senior-martial brother will always wait for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She was feeling a little allergic from his sweet-talk. \u201cHoho, actually, there\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand. The number of times senior-martial brother and I have met can even be counted on one hand, so how can you\u2026\u201d If he were to say that he began to love her only after seeing her for a few times, she wouldn\u2019t believe it even if she was beaten to death.</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan\u2019s expression sank, his face was even faintly carrying an indiscernible melancholy. \u201cTo you, it might have only been a few encounters, but to your senior-martial brother, it has already been a thousand year-long wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whaaat?</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan sighed. Her hair stood on ends from his intense gaze. \u201cJunior-martial sister, you might not have known about this. A thousand years ago, on the very first day I was taken into the sect, master had brought me to Dawnfall Peak to see junior-martial sister. That was the first time I met you, and junior-martial sister, you might laugh at me for this, but I\u2026 ever since that day, you captured a place in my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA thousand years ago?\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Xu Nuoyan, however, still kept that affectionate look. \u201cBack then, I had only just ascended not too long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned silent. She had unconsciously wanted to look at the jade on her waist, however, she endured it. She could only borrow the action of sipping her tea, to press onto the jade that was about to leap out from her waist. When he said that it was when he only just ascended, it meant that it wasn\u2019t too long from the time he left Mo Xianxian, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, junior-martial sister, you can choose to not believe me\u2026\u201d Xu Nuoyan, however, still continued his affectionate confession. \u201cBut please, do not my suspect my feelings for you. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have sought for the sect master\u2019s permission to marry you while you were still asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMarrying me was your intention?\u201d Zhu Yao grabbed onto this important point.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Xu Nuoyan heavily nodded, and said with a firm look. \u201cBack then, junior-martial sister was still in a slumber state. Even if you were to sleep for all eternity, I wouldn\u2019t have minded it. I merely wish to stay by your side for my entire life, junior-martial sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The longer he spoke, the more agitated he became, and in front of her eyes, his claws were just about to reach towards her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, however, felt queasy in her stomach, as she immediately stood right up. \u201cI forgot to turn off the gas. I will first take my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, shameless people are unbeatable.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister\u2026\u201d Xu Nuoyan was taken aback. Why did she suddenly want to leave while they were still chatting along nice and well? And what did she mean by \u2018turning off the gas\u2019?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pressed onto her waist, and hurriedly walked out. Just when she reached the entrance, she stopped. \u201cOh, right. I have forgotten to ask. Why did my mother want you to go into isolation training?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan\u2019s face stiffened, before he replied a moment later. \u201cIt was my fault. I was dissatisfied with being framed by that woman surnamed Mo, who brought about junior-martial sister\u2019s misunderstanding of me. At my act of impulse, I sent a few men down to vent my anger. Because of this, the sect master was furious of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sent people to kill his wife, and even wanted to twist his words, saying that it was all for her sake. This was really too much.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not tardy any further, and flew straight back towards Dawnfall Peak. Pulling out the jade on her waist, a ray of white light flashed past, and a black-clothed woman appeared right in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear all of that clearly just now?\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at her. \u201cNow, do you still think that I\u2019m the cause?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xianxian did not reply. Her delicate face had long lost that violent aura from yesterday. Instead, she seemed to be in slight state of trance. \u201cWhy? Why does he want to do this me? He clearly swore he would never hurt me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seemingly unable to bear the blow, her legs gave way as she knelt onto the ground, and she began to cry out loud. \u201cEven though I believed him, no matter how hard it was in the Divine Realm, I still believed in him.\u201d She hugged her legs tightly, forming into a ball. Her tears flowed uncontrollably. \u201cHe sent me a message, saying that he couldn\u2019t recognize me because of his troubles, and I believed him\u2026 And the moment I received the news that he was sent into isolation, I immediately rushed over. But\u2026 But\u2026 Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed as she knelt down next to her. This lady was so silly to the point where\u2026 she really wanted to lecture her to death. \u201cAfter the practitioner-pair ceremony, he sent you a message?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xianxian nodded while making a choking noise.</p><br/><p>No wonder. She had clearly severed herself from Xu Nuoyan back then, yet, she suddenly returned to kill her. Xu Nuoyan sure had his methods. While he was going circles around her in Fluorescent Wind Sect, he was holding onto Mo Xianxian at the side as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually believe whatever he says, you deserved it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xianxian did not reply. A moment later, she choked out. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 my husband.\u201d How could she not believe his words?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long have you known him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A little more than ten thousand years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even see through a person in ten thousand years.\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at her. \u201cAre you actually stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xianxian cried even more sadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop crying!\u201d Zhu Yao was a little irritated. Matters such as consoling someone, were not her specialty. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a broken love? It\u2019s not too late to wake up. There\u2019s a large number of men in this world, waiting for you to tease!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mo Xianxian did not respond. Instead, she tightly hugged her legs, slightly trembling as she cried, suppressing the feelings that she had already lost.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao wasn\u2019t in the position to say anything else. After all, in a time like this, most probably, she was unable to take in anything. The only thing she could do was sit by her side, accompanying her. Who knew that her crying would be similar to the flood of the Yellow River, where she was unable to collect herself back the moment she started? Zhu Yao\u2019s buttocks were already sore from sitting, yet, she was still not letting up.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had no choice but to return to the house, take out Goudan, and throw him towards her. Don\u2019t say that your boss isn\u2019t helping you. Right now, her heart has just been broken from love. Hurry and take advantage of this opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sis Xianxian, what\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t cry.\u201d As expected, Goudan was on the right track, as he anxiously began to circle around Mo Xianxian.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand just by looking at her. She was fooled by a man.\u201d Unknowingly, Tao Manfeng followed out of the house as well, snorting coldly. \u201cI have already told you that man can\u2019t be trusted. Only you would believe his ridiculous words. What did he say again? He had no choice? Those were all lies. There\u2019s no need for you to console her either, she deserved it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yo, her mocking mode was activated in full force, why did it sound like she was being sour? Zhu Yao turned to glance at Tao Manfeng. She was beginning to feel that there was something a little off about this lady.</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng was a little uncomfortable from her stare. Giving another cold snort, she no longer spoke after that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this matter has been cleared up, then you people best hurry and leave Fluorescent Wind Sect.\u201d Zhu Yao immediately passed down the eviction order. \u201cIn the future, do not come over to try to kill me out of no reason ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words fell, a hint of awkwardness flashed past their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, catch this!\u201d Zhu Yao threw the spatial jade towards Mo Xianxian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Mo Xianxian was startled for a moment. She could not believe that Zhu Yao would actually return the spatial jade to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d Her master had said that half of the jade had already been destroyed, and it was no longer the one from before, it now possessed divine energy similar to that of the Lightning Divine Hall\u2019s. Furthermore, that was her former character. To make it sound more nasty, that was her past corpse. There was no way she would want to have it by her side every single day. \u201cWhen encountering such matters, rack your brains more. Stop being stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xianxian clasped onto the divine jade in her hands. After a while, she said. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao waved her hands a little irritatingly, and chased the three people away. If she were to continue crying like this, she would soon drown. She was truly hoping that this lady would walk out from her former path, and stop being twiddled around in circles by that trash of a man.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

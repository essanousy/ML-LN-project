I want to lay a nest full of eggs with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Who wants to lay eggs for you? Was there really not a single demonic beast in the world that had a regular state of mind? Leaving aside the past when she was a dragon, just what was the deal with this one?</p><br/><p>This time, without needing Zhu Yao\u2019s reply, Xu Nuoyan had already summoned dozens of icicles, jabbing towards him relentlessly. The demonic immortal flapped its wings and dodged them in an embarrassing manner, though, while dodging, he still shouted at Zhu Yao. \u201cGirly, girly, look at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened.</p><br/><p>The minion dodged a few waves of icicles, and gradually, he was growing a little weaker. After all, he had only just ascended, and he had suffered a wave of tribulation lightning bolts in the lower realm. He did not have much divine energy left on him in the first place, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have even needed to rely on his wings to fly.</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan\u2019s expression sank, as he once again summoned another wave of icicles. This time, however, there were more than a hundred of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you over there that popped out of nowhere! You really want to make this mighty one furious, is that it!?\u201d The minion was angered, and even that bunch of weed-like yellow hair were standing straight up. Flapping his wings with all his might, several hundred feathers flew out. Some turned into fireballs, while some turned into sharp blades, as they struck towards Xu Nuoyan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you\u2019re courting death!\u201d Xu Nuoyan\u2019s voice turned even colder. With a wave of his hand, those fireballs and sharp blades completely turned into ashes, and in a flash, he appeared right before the demonic immortal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 How did you?\u201d Before the demonic immortal could even react, in the next instant, he was already being grabbed by the neck, and he simply felt a cold intent suffusing throughout his body.</p><br/><p>This was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother Xu.\u201d A disciple behind anxiously called out. \u201cThe demonic immortals will soon arrive, right now, we can\u2019t afford to have a conflict with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan turned a deaf ear on his words, and his grip tightened instead. The minion\u2019s face was already turning purplish black, as though he could pass out any second.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease him.\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s voice was a little cold.</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan was startled. His hand stiffened for a moment, however, he then gently released him.</p><br/><p>The minion demonic immortal was still in shock as he hurriedly pulled a distance away from the crowd, and panted as he pressed on his chest. He glanced at Zhu Yao with a pitiful gaze, and then, looked towards Xu Nuoyan who was standing unmoving at his original spot. His figure trembled for a moment, before he flapped his wings and flew away unwillingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao, he treated you in such a rude manner earlier\u2026\u201d Xu Nuoyan raised the smile he had before, though, there was now a hint of stiffness to it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply looked at him, and did not utter another word.</p><br/><p>Though, a disciple at the side butted in. \u201cSenior-martial Xu, fellow junior-martial sister, this place isn\u2019t suitable to stay for long. It\u2019s best if we hurry and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people can leave first, we will catch up.\u201d Zhu Yao replied. Her eyes were still fixated at Xu Nuoyan who was in front of her.</p><br/><p>The disciple hesitated for a moment, but in the end, on his flying sword, he flew away with the rest of the people. Shortly, other than her and Xu Nuoyan who stayed behind, the place was cleared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI simply wanted to protect you.\u201d Xu Nuoyan gently said. His tone carried a hint of concern.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a demonic beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, I won\u2019t kill him then.\u201d In an instant, his expression was a little flustered, as though he wanted to explain something to her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao. Are you\u2026 angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed deeply, and for a moment, she scorned her own intellect. Her mind really took too long to go online.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying!\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression instantly paled, and his hands lightly trembled for a few moments. After a while, he revealed a gentle smile, and let out an indistinguishable sigh. \u201cBig Sis Yao, you\u2019re still as smart as ever.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words fell, his face twisted for a few moments, slowly turning into another, familiar yet foreign face. His face still carried that light and gentle smile.</p><br/><p>It really was him! She had been feeling that Xu Nuoyan was a little strange today, yet Yue Ying never came into her mind. Only when he grabbed onto the minion earlier with that familiar method, was she finally certain of herself.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. Looking at the person in front of her, she once again sighed. \u201cWhere\u2019s Xu Nuoyan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying\u2019s smile grew a little deeper. Looking straight at her in the eye, unblinkingly, he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t Big Sis Yao dislike him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou killed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying did not reply, and simply smiled at her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly felt as though she did not recognize the person in front of her. Just when did all this begin? That child which only had a stiff expression, actually learnt how to use smiles to conceal his own thoughts and emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026\u201d Yue Ying suddenly walked towards her, not on his flying sword, but walking on empty air. With every step, a black lotus would sprout beneath his foot, carrying dense amount of devillic aura.</p><br/><p>He stopped at a foot distance away from her, and gently reached out his hands. Like when he was young, he hugged onto his waist, tightened to the point where there wasn\u2019t a single gap. \u201cBig Sis Yao, Yue Ying missed you so much. Missed you\u2026 so, so much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was very gentle, carrying hints of familial love, as though he was a child who had found his parents. Zhu Yao unconsciously felt her heart softening, however, she had no choice but to stay firm, and asked. \u201cYue Ying, are you a Devil?\u201d</p><br/><p>She could feel the arms that circled around her stiffening for a moment, in the next instant, they tightened once again. Burying his head to the side of her neck, he then nudged a little. \u201cI\u2019m big sister\u2019s Yue Ying, and forever will be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying\u2026\u201d For a moment, Zhu Yao felt a deep sense of powerlessness. \u201cYou\u2019re a Devil.\u201d This time, it was no longer a question, but an affirmative answer.</p><br/><p>His embrace tightened even more than before, as though he wanted to escape from something. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I couldn\u2019t find big sister. Big sis said so\u2026 You said you wanted me to wait for you, and you would immediately return. But I waited, and waited\u2026 I waited for so long, but you never came. So, Yue Ying had no choice but to look for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. She faintly recalled that she seemed to have indeed said such words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason you were finding me, was to kill me to vent your anger?\u201d It seemed like the person who killed her before, was indeed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Yue Ying released her, and his face evidently showed some fluster, and an abundance of regret. \u201cThat time\u2026 I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t that was you, Big Sis Yao. You changed your look, and Yue Ying wasn\u2019t able to recognize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, you clearly asked me if I was Yu Yan\u2019s disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I thought that you were Sovereign Yu Yan\u2019s new disciple.\u201d Yue Ying lowered his head, and his words were filled with anxiety. \u201cHasn\u2019t Big Sis Yao been very happy about being the only disciple of Jade Forest Peak? Big sister is one and unique, so even in the higher realm, even if he\u2019s big sister\u2019s master, he shouldn\u2019t have any other disciples.\u201d A hint of tyranny flashed within his eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao unconsciously took a step back.</p><br/><p>Sensing her opposition, Yue Ying\u2019s expression instantly collapsed, turning both anxious and flustered, as he stared right at her eyes. As though he was extremely afraid of the loathe revealed in her eyes, like the time he was a child, he anxiously tugged onto the corner of her clothes, and looked at her pitifully. \u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026 Don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m indeed angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The colors in his eyes instantly dimmed, and the hands which he grabbing onto her sleeves were trembling slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m more angry at myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, he raised his head, showing a confused expression.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath. She really couldn\u2019t blame him. She really wished that he was a pure and ruthless Devil who simply looked like Yue Ying, then she wouldn\u2019t have such complicated feelings.</p><br/><p>She did not have the rights to blame him either. The reason why he was here in the higher realm was her, and from his tone, he had to turn into a Devil to come into the higher realm. But the reason he did so, was to find her.</p><br/><p>He grew in such a particular situation, and no one had expected his birth. Even if she entrusted him to little radish, with his Penta Spirit Veins aptitude, in that world where the strong ate the weak, and the strong was revered, it was imaginable how hard it was to survive there.</p><br/><p>Hence, he saw her as his only person to depend on. Although she saved him, she had never spent any effort and thoughts to teach him. As the saying goes, a child is better unborn than untaught.</p><br/><p>Right now, she was having deep regrets. Back then, she was even able to bring up little radish all and well, so why did she not give Yue Ying the slightest bit of thoughts? Merely because he wasn\u2019t a bug?</p><br/><p>If she were to teach him now, was it not too late to do so?</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He instantly smiled. A smile that was so pure, there wasn\u2019t a single hint of impurities within. \u201cYue Ying will never ever blame Big Sis Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d In an instant, Zhu Yao felt the guilt of destroying a good young man. What should she do now? Was he still able to turn back?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis.\u201d He once again leaned towards her. His eyes were filled with reluctance, as though he had instantly found his pillar of support. \u201cPlease stop leaving Yue Ying, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want some peace and quiet for a moment.\u201d She was suddenly unsure of how she should clear up this pile of mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not let Big Sis Yao leave again.\u201d His voice instantly sank, and his tone was stubborn like that of an unreasonable child.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, let me have some time to think, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a Devil, Big Sis Yao doesn\u2019t want me anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, big sis wants to kill me?\u201d His hands which were gripping onto her sleeves, instantly tightened. A black for emitted out from the palms of his hands, and the snow-white sleeves instantly turned into ashes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying!\u201d Zhu Yao was shocked.</p><br/><p>Yet, he reached out his hands, and immediately pulled her into his embrace. The smile on his face grew even gentler, yet, Zhu Yao could feel that smile was carrying a hint of cold intent. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, Big Sis Yao. It wasn\u2019t easy for me to find you. You can\u2019t cast Yue Ying aside ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, let me go for now!\u201d This child, just how did he turn crazy with just a few words? It\u2019s been so many years, yet, not only wasn\u2019t his mother complex cured, it actually worsened!</p><br/><p>You\u2019re ill, and you have to treated, hey!</p><br/><p>His hands gripped even tighter, and Zhu Yao felt that her waist was about to break. \u201cIf I let go, big sis will cast me aside again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying.\u201d Zhu Yao suddenly felt a little afraid. The devillic aura emitted out from his body was causing her a lot of discomfort, causing the divine energy in her body to automatically resist it on its own. Only then did she truly sense that he was a true Devil. She was barely able to hold on any longer, and was about to instinctively cast down a heavenly lightning bolt to strike him.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 This was Yue Ying, the child she personally saved.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying once again buried his head next to her neck. As though he had submerged himself into obsession, he chanted with a trembling voice. \u201cBig Sis Yao, please don\u2019t leave. Big Sis Yao, please don\u2019t leave\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was unable to push him away, and he wasn\u2019t listening to her either. For a moment, she did not know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, the two of you.\u201d Suddenly, four figures appeared in their surroundings. The four people were dressed oddly, malicious aura surrounded their bodies. \u201cWhere did the demonic immortal who ascended earlier go?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

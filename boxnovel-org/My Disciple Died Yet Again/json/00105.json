And, she even allowed her to participate in the Inter-Sect Tournament, in order to build her own self-confidence.</p><br/><p>However, she never expected that the female antagonist would choose this moment to take over her body. Little radish had just experienced a great battle, her spiritual energy and mental fortitude was at her weakest moment. Clearly, the time revealed to her in her dream was tomorrow night. This foretelling was basically inaccurate, hey.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial nephew Zi Mo, you\u2019re her father, your weight in her heart isn\u2019t light, call out to her! Most probably, once she hears your voice, it might give her some strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, they could only treat a dead horse as though it was alive. She recalled that in the modern era, there were many patients, who turned into vegetables due to various reasons, reacting to their relatives\u2019 summons. Their calls were able to wake their subconsciousness, and there were even cases where the patients began to slowly recover because of this. Probably, this method, was useful in the cultivation realm as well!</p><br/><p>When Zi Mo heard this, he immediately began to call out to his daughter, and say various encouraging words.</p><br/><p>As he continued to talk, the sun began to set.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao anxiously looked at Yu Yao\u2019s reaction, however, what she was but the BUG letters on her face continuing to darken, reaching to the degree of clarity when she first saw those dark letters on Xiao Yi\u2019s face. At the pace this was progressing at, before daybreak, Yu Luo\u2019s soul would be devoured completely and cleanly.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the female antagonist\u2019s resurrection could not be altered?</p><br/><p>The hell. This old lady here simply won\u2019t believe it. Just on what basis, should the little radish she had been raising with her own two hands, be taken over by a black radish?</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me set a protection field.\u201d Zhu Yao pulled Zi Mo away, pulled up Yu Luo who was lying on the bed, and sat cross-legged behind her. \u201cI\u2019m going to enter her divine sense to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial aunt, the divine sense region isn\u2019t a trivial matter. Furthermore, my daughter is currently unconscious. If you were to forcefully break into it, I\u2019m afraid that martial-aunt will be injured as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be bothered about such things now.\u201d Radish was going to die really soon, so she had no choice but to take the risk. Zhu Yao closed her eyes, separated a hint of own divine sense, and from Yu Luo\u2019s spirit, she invaded within.</p><br/><p>As expected. The moment she made contact with her divine sense, she was blocked by a large force. Zhu Yao concentrated and desperately penetrated herself inside. Finally, a small crack was made, and she entered the inner depths of divine sense.</p><br/><p>The moment she entered, she was dumbfounded by the scene inside. What was supposed to be a clear and pure divine sense, had already been dyed in grey, and there were two masses of particles, one white, and one black, at the very top.</p><br/><p>Only a small part remained of the white mass, while that black mass was currently swallowing that white mass, bit by bit. Whenever it swallowed a small part, that black mass of air would becoming stronger and bigger correspondingly, and the space of the divine sense would grow dimmer little by little as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell. Bitch!\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but curse out at that mass of black cloud, which meant that little radish\u2019s white mass was left with but a few more bites.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle radish, you best listen carefully. If you were to get motherf**king eaten by someone else, you will no longer be my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>That white mass which was still being obediently getting eaten earlier seemed to have jerked for a moment, and a doubtful voice sounded. \u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you know it\u2019s me, you best wake up.\u201d Zhu Yao shouted loudly. \u201cThe things that this old lady had taught you for twenty years, just where did all of them go? You\u2019re actually so willing to get eaten by someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white mass\u2019 pause became even more evident, and even its action of being swallowed had stopped as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle radish. So, you worked hard for so many years, desperately practiced your Mystic Arts every day, was all for the sake of giving your body to this deceased soul that came from an unknown origin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally\u2026 not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey why aren\u2019t you resisting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still remember what you told me when I first taught you Ice Mystic Arts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I want to become strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProve that I\u2019m not trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you given up? Or were you simply lying to master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Little radish\u2019s voice suddenly became firm, and even that small little mass, had instantly brightened up by quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao smiled. So she finally had the will to fight. \u201cThen, prove to your master. Don\u2019t lose to this mass of soul that came from god-knows-where. You\u2019re Zhu Yao\u2019s only disciple. The people of my Jade Forest Mountain, are always the ones bullying people, there\u2019s a never a turn for others to bully us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Yu Yao responded resoundingly. In an instant, as though that white mass had been lighted up, it released a glaring white light. As though that light was contagious, it spread towards the deep darkness.</p><br/><p>The black mass seemed to have realized the former owner\u2019s resistance, and began to devour quicker than before. For a moment, the two sides were in a stalemate, demonstrating a trend of being evenly matched.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao thus had to ignite another flame. \u201cLittle radish, if you lose today, don\u2019t you ever call yourself a disciple of my Jade Forest Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she had thought, that white mass seemed to have gained a sudden burst of strength, forcing the black mass straight back, and had even began to devour it instead. \u201cAhmmu\u201d After giving her opponent a huge bite, just when she was about to continue devouring, suddenly, a black hole appeared above the black mass. The half of the black mass, that was left after being bitten, hid itself there, and instantly disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>The hell, it was no wonder she did not sense the appearance of a Nascent Soul aura. She had actually appeared directly in little radish\u2019s divine sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Little radish finally opened her eyes, and seemed to be extremely tired, with only a single breath left.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine now, rest!\u201d Zhu Yao laid her down, and stroked her head. After giving her a relieved expression, she finally fell into deep sleep.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao once again took a look at the person on the bed. The BUG letters on her face had already completely disappeared. It seemed like her cultivation plan this time was considered as a success.</p><br/><p>After giving a Zi Mo a glance, the two of them then retreated from the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, martial aunt, for saving her.\u201d Zi Mo gave her a deep bow, and at that moment, did he finally heave a deep sigh of relief. He then wiped away the cold sweat on his head, and the corners of his moist eyes. \u201cEarlier, I was starting to think that my daughter would really\u2026 All is well, all is well. Both my daughter and martial aunt are alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Puuuuf\u2026</p><br/><p>Just when Zi Mo was about to continue, Zhu Yao, however, suddenly spat a mouthful of blood onto his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial aunt!\u201d \u201d (\u2299o\u2299)\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell, as she had thought, masters were all big liars. What happened to the promised that the separation of divine sense was a prerequisite skill for Demigods? Clearly, back then when her master separated his, he managed it simply and properly. But why was the rebound so huge when it was her turn?</p><br/><p>It hurts like hell!</p><br/><p>The aftermath of Zhu Yao\u2019s first time in separating her divine sense, made her lie on her bed for three entire days. When she woke up, the first person she saw, was actually worried-looking Feng Yi.</p><br/><p>As Zhu Yao did not pay attention, she had almost fell off her bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister\u2026 Feng Yi, why are you here?\u201d The hell. She couldn\u2019t have seen through something, right? Zhu Yao was a little anxious for a moment. Her initial foggy consciousness instantly cleared up more than a half.</p><br/><p>What responded her was Feng Yi\u2019s calm expression, as she turned back and said. \u201cShe\u2019s fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao see Zi Mo who was standing behind her. He gave Zhu Yao an explanation of what happened. So, it seemed she had fainted right after she puked blood that day. Naturally, Zi Mo was unclear of her situation, hence, he had no choice but to bring her over directly to the Beast-Taming Mountain, and had Feng Yi, who was similarly a Demigod-stage practitioner, take a look at her.</p><br/><p>However, she was fortunate. Other than losing a bit of spiritual energy, everything else about her was normal.</p><br/><p>However, little radish had yet to wake up. Most probably because of the body take-over, her soul, after all, had taken quite a bit of damage. Hence, she required a period of time to restore it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not expect that a simple separation of her divine sense would have such a huge consumption on her part. Back then, when her master sneakily followed her to Tasyoluk, she basically did not see any sort of bad reaction though? As expected, comparisons would really make people furious.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo had planned on chatting with her regarding Yu Luo\u2019s condition. However, a disciple suddenly walked over, and said an Elder from Celestial Indus Sect wished for an audience, as he had something to discuss. However, what\u2019s strange was, the person this Elder wished to seek an audience with, was actually not Zi Mo, but her.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestial Indus Sect?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned for a moment. Why was this name so familiar?</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestial Indus Sect is south of Ancient Hill Sect, and is a Deity Sect second only to ours.\u201d Zi Mo explained. \u201cThe disciples of this Sect are usually proficient in music, and specialize in using music to bring down their enemies. I wonder how martial-aunt came to know this Elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know her though!\u201d She simply felt the three words \u201cCelestial Indus Sect\u201d were a little familiar, and that was it.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo was startled as well. Since they did not know each other, why did the Elder wish to see her personally?</p><br/><p>Harboring such suspicions, the two of them bade farewell to Feng Yi, and headed to the side hall of the Main Mountain. Zi Mo first called for a cup of tea for her, before allowing a disciple to bring that Elder into the hall.</p><br/><p>The person who came in was a youth who looked about twenty years old. Looking at his demeanor, and the the spiritual energy around him, he should be a Nascent Soul Paragon who had cultivated for more than a few thousand years. A practitioner\u2019s age could not be seen through their looks, as Nascent Soul practitioners were all capable of altering their own exterior looks. After all, not everyone was like Zi Mo, who liked to make himself look like an old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Han of Celestial Indus Sect greets the Sovereign.\u201d That person greeted while reporting his name.</p><br/><p>Only the did Zhu Yao recall why Celestial Indus Sect sounded so familiar. Wasn\u2019t this Qi Han the master of that female antagonist Mu Meiyan, whom she saw in her dream? However, in her dream, he had already broken through into a Demigod, while currently, he was merely at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><br/><p>She had just helped little radish chase away his disciple who intended to devour her own disciple\u2019s soul, why did her master come knocking on her doorsteps so quickly? Zhu Yao gave a perfunctory nod. She felt that she needed to suppress her astonishment, so she picked up the cup of tea from the table and took a fierce gulp.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Han did not mind it too much. He simply moved aside and hinted the disciple behind him to step forward. \u201cRulu, why haven\u2019t you greeted the Sovereign yet!?\u201d</p><br/><p>That disciple immediately stepped forward. \u201cThis disciple greets the Sovereign.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hugging her fist, she gave a deep and respectful bow towards Zhu Yao, with her body bent forward by a standard ninety degrees. After pausing for a moment, she then raised her head, and revealed \u2013 a face with the word \u2018BUG\u2019 written on it.</p><br/><p>Puuuuf~~~~~~~~</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s mouthful of tea, directed splattered onto her entire face.</p><br/><p>A proper flowery young girl, was instantly sprayed with tea leaves that covered her entire face.</p><br/><p>At that moment, only a crow\u2019s cawing could be heard within the hall\u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Han: \u2026.</p><br/><p>Disciple: \u2026.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial aunt, you\u2026\u201d Zi Mo was embarrassed as well. Even if he was killed, he wouldn\u2019t have thought that his martial aunt would do something like that. Even if she did not like his disciple, she shouldn\u2019t have expressed it out in front of the Elder himself, right? How was he going to clean up the mess now?</p><br/><p>\u201cHo, hoho, hohoho\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled a few times. As she desperately suppressed her thoughts of wanting to retort, she began to weasel her way out. \u201cUh\u2026 I see this little lady here, has an astonishing figure, a cultivation genius who is rarely\u2026 seen in a hundred years. Because of a moment of surprise, I\u2026 spewed. Hoho, I made all of you witness something embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

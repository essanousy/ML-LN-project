Frowning, he pushed it down. \u201cI naturally am your master.\u201d It seemed like she had to properly teach his disciple some manners. A white light gathered within his finger, and he tapped it on the center of her forehead. \u201cShao Bai had mentioned to me before that you lack of a clear goal, so I\u2026 Mn?\u201d The strand of divine sense he gathered, was rebounded. \u201cYou already possess another imprint?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Wasn\u2019t you the one who placed it? How could he forget even this as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d Yue Gu said without the slightest of mind. \u201cThis imprint is rather weak, I shall aid you in dispersing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Zhu Yao flustered, as she took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have already been taken under my tutelage, naturally, you can\u2019t carry someone else\u2019s imprint.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao reached out her hand to hold her forehead. \u201cNo matter what, this imprint cannot disappear. Otherwise\u2026 I will fight you to death, do you believe me?\u201d She hadn\u2019t made clear of the situation yet, this was after all, the only imprint which her master recognize.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu frowned. Seeing her unwilling look, he could only let it go. After sizing her up for a moment, he sighed. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then I will follow your will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao finally heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I heard from Shao Bai, not only were you egg-born, your original form is a lightning phoenix?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems so.\u201d Actually, she wasn\u2019t certain if she was actually a phoenix either.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu\u2019s frown grew even deeper, and his expression was heavily sunken. After a while, he said with a solemn voice. \u201cIn this world, every being has its own destiny, and beings of lightning are birthed to sweep the impurities of this world. Since you possess the lightning attribute, then you best resolve yourself well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d What did he mean?</p><br/><p>However, he did not seem to have the intention to continue explaining, instead, he reached out his hand to stroke her head. \u201cYou will know in the future, for now, you can rest. From tomorrow onwards, I will teach you the Lightning Devil Restriction Arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded, though still a little puzzled. Just as she was about to turn and leave, she was halted by him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Yue Gu sized her up once more, his line of sight landed on her forehead, frowning. With a twist of his hand, a writing brush suddenly appeared. And then, he raised his brush, and drew something on her forehead. With a satisfied expression, he said. \u201cDone, you can go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Zhu Yao did not know what he had done. After she walked away, and summoned a water mirror to take a look, did she find an additional \u2018Ling\u2019 word written on her forehead, and no matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t rub it off. She thought that Yue Gu was merely using it as a substitute because she did not allow him to leave his divine imprint. So, she didn\u2019t mind it at first.</p><br/><p>Until, when she saw that the foreheads, claws, ears, and even the buttocks of all the creatures on the mountain had the same imprint, she suddenly had the impulse to beat him into a pulp. Flips table. Was he treating her as a pet? Stamping his mark whenever he found a new one? Yue Gu, come over here. Let\u2019s talk about life!</p><br/><p>Yue Gu wasn\u2019t Yu Yan. This was the definite answer she found on the second day since she arrived in the extreme northern lands. Not only did he not have any impression of her, even when she told him about the matters surrounding the Jade Forest Peak and Lightning Divine Hall, he did not have any reaction at all. Yet, he did not seem to have lost his memories either.</p><br/><p>But, for some reason, he kept giving her a sense of familiarity. Every word and action of his was similar to her master\u2019s. Other than his personality being a little warmer than her master\u2019s, and not releasing a cold aura at every turn, she kept having a feeling that she was interacting with her own master.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you memorized it?\u201d Yue Gu said with a stern expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhu Yao blanked, earlier, she had been distracted the entire time. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Gu frowned, and his voice sank. \u201cThe Circulation Art which I demonstrated earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t listen clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Gu sighed, he had no choice but to continue teaching once again. Zhu Yao attentively looked at his actions, yet, the more she looked, the more he looked like Yu Yan. Every single action of his was unexpectedly familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, did you see clearly?\u201d Yue Gu asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Sorry, she was distracted again. \u201cUh\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Nan!\u201d Yue Gu\u2019s brows sharpened, turning around, he walked straight towards her. \u201cIf you are this undisciplined, how will you be able to learn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you feathered races think fondly of your homes, but since you have already come under my tutelage, you must settle your heart down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour talent isn\u2019t bad, but unfortunately, you have too many miscellaneous thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not deny. Do you know your mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know my wrongs, but can you stop lecturing that tree?\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Looking at Yue Gu who was facing that huge tree with a disciplinary look, she was a little speechless. Earlier, he was clearing walking towards her, why did he suddenly turn to another direction and head towards that huge tree?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yue Gu was startled, and a hint of red flashed past his face for a moment, before immediately reverting back to normal. Turning around, he said with a much sterner look. \u201cSince you know your wrongs, then gather your concentration, and work hard. In the future, your teacher will only demonstrate the arts once, is that clear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Zhu Yao nodded, and continued with a darkened expression. \u201cBut teacher, you\u2019re mistaking me for something else again. I\u2019m on your right. The thing in front of you is a rock.\u201d Why did he treat that rock and tree as her? Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, it can\u2019t be that your eyesight isn\u2019t good, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She swore that she definitely saw Yue Gu\u2019s face stiffen for a moment. \u201cNonsensical, your teacher is merely taking responsibility for your cultivation. I shall demonstrate it once more, watch carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao nodded, she wondered if it was just her imagination. After all, as an ancient God, if he actually had bad eyesight, then it would be too unbelievable. However, the following few hours, had completely verified her guess.</p><br/><p>Fifteen minutes later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Nan, the principles behind Devil Restriction Arts, do not lie in strength, but in binds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, can you face me while you\u2019re talking? The one in front of you is a bunny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Half an hour later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Nan, you must know that the Devil race are undying, similar to your race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m on your left. That\u2019s a tree stump.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An hour later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Nan, what you\u2019re learning is an art of sealing, not an art of destruction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m on your left, that\u2019s a bunch of weed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Four hours later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Nan, the trick behind this art is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao deeply sighed. \u201cI\u2019m behind you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d A certain teacher faked a cough, and maintained his stern expression. \u201cYour teacher has never been good at recognizing people.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, no, no. This wasn\u2019t a problem about recognizing people. He\u2019s evidently blind.</p><br/><p>Hence, six hours later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to practice this set of sealing arts often, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao grabbed onto the person in front of her, and forcefully pulled him to her direction. \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>A certain teacher\u2019s calm expression, instantly collapsed. \u201cDisciple. I think it\u2019s best if this teacher helps you change your imprint!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d So the reason why you keep wanting to place your imprint on me, is just to make it easier to recognize me? You\u2019re taking it too far now!</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhu Yao knew that there was a type of face-blindness that could not discern between time, location, people, and even objects. For example, her teacher. And most of the time in her first lesson, was spent on the numerous times correcting Yue Gu\u2019s mistake in recognizing his target.</p><br/><p>She had also begun to slowly understand just what sort of world this place was. Just as she had guessed, this world was not the Divine Realm, nor had she ever known of the existence of this world. In this place, the God races that had long disappeared in her world existed. Including the Devil race.</p><br/><p>However, the Devils had been sealed by the ancient Gods in the deep abyss of the extreme southern lands, and that place was named the Devil Sealing Abyss. And the responsibility of the four God races was to safeguard that seal, and also reseal the Devils that occasionally escape from the seal.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not know why Realmspirit had brought her to this place. And back then when she was Yin Xin, Realmspirit had even especially made her appear in two characters simultaneously. Actually, with so many Gods that possessed overflowing martial powers, there basically wasn\u2019t a need for her, right?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face was filled with doubts. Just as she was planning to close the door and have a rest, raising her head, she saw Yue Gu who was circling around her courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher?\u201d It was late in the night. Was he here to advance their teacher-student relationship?</p><br/><p>Yue Gu was startled for a moment, and then, he walked straight towards the stone table in the courtyard. Affectionately, he reached his hand to stroke the surface of the table. \u201cYue Nan, so you\u2019re the one who lives here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She left the door and pulled him back. \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m over here.\u201d Just how blind are you!</p><br/><p>Possibly because he had already been exposed numerous times, there wasn\u2019t a hint of embarrassment left on his face. He lightly said. \u201cAnd here I was wondering why a straw cottage would suddenly appear in this forest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI built it yesterday.\u201d Zhu Yao casually said. \u201cTeacher, do you want to come in and have a seat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood idea!\u201d Surely, Yue Gu walked in, and calmly looked at the furniture within the house, looking like a good master who cared about his disciple\u2019s daily quality of life. After looking for a moment, he sat in front of the table. \u201cThe place you have here is pretty well made. How did you build this straw cottage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very simple, just a few incantations and formations will settle the job.\u201d This was what her master taught her in the past.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu nodded, and then asked her a few more questions, and if she had any troubles. He then tested her on everything that he had taught her in the day. Zhu Yao answered them one after another, and then, he once again supplemented his teachings with a few new information. Zhu Yao faintly felt that him being so talkative was a little strange, but when there was no longer anything to talk about, Yue Gu was still glued to his chair, with no intentions to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026 Are you not going back?\u201d Zhu Yao had no choice, but to start chasing him away.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu lightly swept his eyes across\u2026 the chair next to him, and still with the same light tone, said. \u201cThe place you have here is pretty well made.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, and probed him. \u201cTeacher, you can\u2019t be thinking of living here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d Yue Gu nodded. \u201cYour teacher shall take up your offer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!?\u201d What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to live here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaahhh!!??\u201d Are you kidding me? Where\u2019s your morals? If her teacher were to live in this place\u2026 \u201cTeacher\u2026 I only have a single bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no worry, your teacher doesn\u2019t despise it!\u201d</p><br/><p>But I do! Zhu Yao hugged her chest. Even if he had the same face, she still had her principles, alright? She\u2019s born as her master\u2019s, and she would die as her master\u2019s!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, it\u2019s time to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She was completely dumbfounded. She never expected that her new teacher would actually be this open-minded. In her mind, various censored and blackened images popped up. Don\u2019t force my hand!</p><br/><p>With a calm look, Yue Gu walked towards her\u2026</p><br/><p>And then, calmly picked her up\u2026</p><br/><p>Calmly\u2026</p><br/><p>He threw her out of the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will teach you new arts tomorrow. Have an early rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then, with a bang, he closed the door.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She simply felt like cussing her heart out right now. The hell, he actually did not mistake her for something else this time.</p><br/><p>No wait, so he was especially here to steal her house? Highgod, do the other Gods know of how shameless you are?</p><br/><p>Was there the need to do so? It\u2019s just a straw cottage. He, a mighty ancient God, actually snatched it away from his disciple. It wasn\u2019t as though he didn\u2019t have a place to stay, after all, he clearly\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>That durian spirit seemed to have said that Yue Gu lived on this mountain peak. And other than a plain field of grass on the peak, there wasn\u2019t any other structures to be seen.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>Could it be that he simply did not know how to construct buildings, and hence, had been camping outdoors the entire time? She suddenly recalled that during the first time she met him, he seemed to be really\u2026 sleeping while standing on that field of grass.</p><br/><p>Alright. For a Highgod to live like this, teacher, you sure are an embarrassment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even when she were to spot one, she would make a detour if she had to. After all, not anyone would have the precious and deep experience of being chased by a horde of rabbits for three days and three nights.</p><br/><p>Even now, she still did not know what mutated breed the horde of rabbits was from. They were actually immune to all types of divine arts. No matter how strong an offensive art she cast, they would swallow them down with an ahmn. Even Yue Ying\u2019s devillic attacks were useless. The only differences were whether they would take a single or two bites, or two of them taking a bite together, or three of them taking a bite together.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, no matter if they fled into forests, flew in the sky, or dove deep into the ocean depths, those rabbits would always chase after them. They were simply living beings that could live in the land, sky, and sea. As though they had activated invincibility mode, they chased after Zhu Yao and Yu Yan for three days and three nights, and only now did traces of them slowly disappear.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tiredly laid on her master. She did not want to move again, at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d She felt that her common sense had been struck with a heavy blow. She wanted to head back to the zoo and look at the animals again.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan heaved a sigh of relief as well. He pulled over his disciple\u2019s bitten hand and cast an art. However, he realized that it was completely ineffective, and his brows began to furrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still useless.\u201d Zhu Yao looked at her own hand, feeling as though she wanted to cry. For some reason, the wound she received from the rabbit\u2019s bite from before could not be healed by using arts. \u201cNevermind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s face was ice-cold, he clearly had a slightly irritated mood. He kept silent as he stared at his disciple\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really fine.\u201d After all, she was a High Deity as well, though it was a little embarrassing to be bitten by a rabbit. Even without arts, it\u2019s been three days and her wound had already closed. It was already considerably healed.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was still silent, though his face was growing colder by the minute. Even Yue Ying at the side was beginning to stare at her hand.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look as though I\u2019m terminally ill, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Then, shall we bandage it up a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Only then did Yu Yan feel contented as he retrieved a white cloth from his storage ring. After tearing it into a strp, he then wrapped it around her hand. He wrapped it extremely meticulously, and at the event, he even tied a beautiful knot. While he was at it, he even embroidered it with something.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Master, you\u2019re embroidering a bunny into it, are you sure you\u2019re not doing it on purpose?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should not stay in this place for too long.\u201d Yu Yan solemnly said. \u201cIt\u2019s best that we find a settle down in a divine city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Just as Zhu Yao was about to stand up, a shuffling noise could be heard in the bushes next to them.</p><br/><p>A human figure popped out. \u201cEh? You guys\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, Yu Yan had already grabbed onto his disciple and disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh!? Wait, wait a minute!\u201d In a flash, that person immediately went to catch up with them.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, not only did Yu Yan not stop, he accelerated even faster.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned to look at the person chasing after them, and the poked in front of her. \u201cMaster\u2026 The person behind is a Deity, not a rabbit!\u201d</p><br/><p>A certain person\u2019s face stiffened, as he then stopped in mid-air.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 He had gotten used to it!</p><br/><p>In an instant, that person caught up. He looked a little fatigued, his hair was dishevelled and even his clothes were covered in stains. For some reason, his blue robe was stained with yellow on one side and white on the other, a paste flavour was even floating around him. Above his head was a string of yellow words: Unknown Deity (Level 1)</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, as the feeling of playing a net game overwhelmed her\u2026</p><br/><p>He seemed to have had a hard time chasing after them. After panting a few times, he said. \u201cWhy did you two run?\u201d</p><br/><p>The master and disciple duo\u2019s lips twitched a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you chase after us?\u201d Zhu Yao asked back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw you two running, so I started chasing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe saw you chase after us, so naturally we ran!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The man became a little confused. He then unmindfully waved his hand and said. \u201cNevermind, I finally managed to see a living person. Are you two returning to Hillriver City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hillriver City? Zhu Yao glanced at her master. There was actually really a divine city nearby.</p><br/><p>Thus, they immediately nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence, me too!\u201d That man replied. \u201cLet\u2019s go together. In this Lost Gallery, it\u2019s safer with a bunch of people together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, it was a blessing for them if someone could guide them. The master and disciple duo immediately nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d That man did not have any interest in making friends either. He basically did not make a self-introduction, as though he simply wanted to partner up and head on his way. He immediately flew up and moved past them. While casting a Dirt Removal Art on himself, he casually let out a complaint. \u201cI sure had bad luck today. I wonder which idiot offended that horde of \u2018Little White\u2019 rabbits in the grass plain. I only managed to get rid of them after being chased for such a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three idiots: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s even more unbearable is that not only did they offend the rabbits, they were even stupid enough to use divine arts to attack them.\u201d The man grew angrier as he spoke. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t know that those Little Whites relied on divine energy for their meals? The more divine arts are used, the fuller they become, and they will have even more energy to give chase. Initially, they could have been gotten rid of in a hundred kilometers, but they actually chased after this daddy here for over a thousand kilometers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of three who were chased for three days and three nights received a sudden enlightenment.</p><br/><p>The man turned around and glanced at the three people that were standing especially straight. \u201cDid you people encounter those pestering horde of rabbits?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them turned back to face him, and with an especially stern tone, they said in unison. \u201cNope!\u201d Their expressions were as pure as the white clouds in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d The man pouted and did not suspect them either. \u201cYou guys have great luck.\u201d After a moment, he suddenly thought of something and asked with a mysterious look. \u201cLet me tell you guys this, earlier, among the horde of crazed rabbits earlier, I actually saw one shrouded in lightning. Clearly, it had swallowed a lightning art. It seems like someone from Lightning Divine Palace has entered the tower again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She exchanged glances with her master beside her, and intentionally asked. \u201cSo what if someone from Lightning Divine Palace enters the tower?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, we have to find that person immediately.\u201d That man said matter-of-factly. \u201cFor so many years, only the people from Lightning Divine Palace can enter and leave the Lightning Divine Tower freely. Everyone has had enough of it. Furthermore, the previous one who entered the tower has already entered the upper ten floors, so naturally there\u2019s nothing much we Deities can do about him now. Another one has finally entered the tower, so naturally we have to find him as soon as possible. Right now, Hillriver City has probably gone insane trying to look for that person. Who would have thought that he would appear within Lost Gallery? If I were to spread this news, I would be able to make some small change too.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked as though he had thought of something happy, as his eyes even shone a little.</p><br/><p>On the other side however, Zhu Yao\u2019s heart had already sank, and as for her master\u2026 It seemed like Lightning Divine Palace did not have a good standing in this tower at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which\u2026\u201d The man suddenly turned around and glanced at the three people next to him. With suspecting eyes, he sized them up. \u201cYou three\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crap! He can\u2019t possibly have seen through us, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see the Deity that cast the lightning-type arts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Her heightened caution instantly came crumbling down. \u201cHoho, of course not!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen anyone with the Daoist title \u2018Yu\u2019?\u201d The man continued to ask. \u201cThe people of Lightning Divine Palace often like to venture alone. As long as someone is alone, that person is worth the suspicion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone, at, all!\u201d Look at my pure and clear eyes.</p><br/><p>Only then did the man close his mouth with a disappointed look, and then, he sped up towards Hillriver City.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What\u2019s happening? Zhu Yao was a little confused.</p><br/><p>Yet, Yu Jin seemed to have expected it. A smiling intent surfaced at the corner of his lips, as he summoned his divine sword as well.</p><br/><p>In an instant, two shadows flashed, and their figures could no longer be seen.</p><br/><p>In the layers of lightning clouds away from the Lightning Divine Hall, two figures were currently engaged in an intense battle. In an instant, rays of lightning greatly flashed, explosive thunders constantly roared, and there were even couple of lightning bolts flying towards the forest at the bottom.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little speechless. Was it really alright to act like that? At the very least, they\u2019re still members of the same Sect right? If her guess was correct, then that Hall Master should be the grandmaster of her grandmaster, right!? Master, are you trying to destroy the Sect? Seeing how they were used to it, and had already known to fly out of the radius of the Lightning Divine Hall, evidently, this was not the first time they had exchanged blows.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao finally realized who the Hall Master was fighting so flashily and loudly on the day he picked her up.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, she was a little worried for her master. After all, the difference in cultivation level between the two of them was an entire stage. So, she anxiously stared at the two faraway figures, afraid that her master would be at a disadvantage. However, after looking for a while, nothing serious seemed to be happening, though her neck was beginning to ache from looking upwards. This battle of theirs lasted for an entire day. In the end, unconsciously, Zhu Yao slept while watching them. When she woke up, she found herself on the bed in her house. It seemed like after finishing his fight, her master casually brought her back into her house.</p><br/><p>Ever since then, Yu Jin would often head down the mountain. Every single time, he only had a single goal, and that was to have Yu Yan take over the role of Hall Master. Threats, temptations, lies, he never ran out of tricks to do so. However, that certain person simply did not give in to any of them. In conclusion, as they were unable to see eye to eye, they would always end up fighting.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, who was initially afraid and worried, became calm and easy-going at the end. Currently, when she saw the two of them fighting, she would simply continue with what she was doing. Occasionally, when she was bored, she would move a stool over to the courtyard, and sit there with her movie-watching mode activated. Mn, if only she could have some watermelon to bite on, that would be perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle little grand disciple.\u201d With a wavy smile, Yu Jin walked over.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cGreat great grandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, at least Blossom\u2026 Yu Yao understands the rules.\u201d As he received Zhu Yao\u2019s murderous gaze, Yu Jin had no choice but to swallow his earlier way of addressing her. Haah, as he thought, she was much cuter when she was just a piece of jade. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you help me persuade your master to accept the position of Hall Master? After all, I did help you gain a human form. You couldn\u2019t have forgotten about it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched again. The days of her being used to grill meat, and supporting the bed\u2019s leg. \u201cI remember it. Very. Very. Clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Jin blanked, as though he had recalled those matters back then as well. A hint of awkwardness flashed past his face, as he concealed himself with a few coughs. \u201cKuh kuh. Little Yu Yao, currently, your master isn\u2019t in a hurry to enter the tower. Since he\u2019s idling around, why don\u2019t he accept this role? Furthermore, the identity of the one and only Hall Master of the Lightning Divine Hall is noble and mighty. Not a single person in the entire Divine Realm can compare to the person holding this title. I\u2019m actually willing to hand over a position like this to your master, isn\u2019t that a great matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to thank you then.\u201d If it\u2019s really that good, then why don\u2019t you continue to hold that position? \u201cYou can speak about this matter with my master directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>She finally understood why her master was not staying in the great palace at the peak of the mountain, and instead, was staying at the foot of this mountain. He was simply irritated by this Hall Master.</p><br/><p>\u201cChild, if your master is willing to listen to me, why would I look for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t listen to me either.\u201d She was his disciple, not his master.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will, he will.\u201d Yu Jin\u2019s face was filled with joy, as he once again approached closer. \u201cYou\u2019re his personal succeeding disciple, so naturally, he will listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re his personal preceding great grandmaster as well.\u201d If they had to compare authorities, his was much higher than hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. Your master has not entered the Lightning Divine Tower for so many years, most definitely, it\u2019s because he was waiting for you to ascend. Looking at this point, as his disciple, you are of great importance to him. Currently, you have yet to officially begin cultivating, so naturally, he would have to spend time guiding you. In any case, since he\u2019s not entering the tower for a while, wouldn\u2019t taking up the position of Hall Master be killing two birds with one stone?\u201d His face was filled with the \u2018I\u2019m doing it for your own good\u2019 expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe in master\u2019s arrangements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that she wasn\u2019t budging, Yu Jin once again added. \u201cSeeing that we have a relationship on the same bed, how can little little grand disciple be so heartless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stood right up. \u201cWhat same bed? The one lying on the bed was you. I was the one supporting the bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind the small details.\u201d Yu Jin smiled especially shamelessly. \u201cFurthermore, your master\u2019s Hall Master position will still be handed to you sooner or later. If your master accepts it now, you can prepare yourself sooner as\u2026\u201d He suddenly paused, as though he had thought of something. His eyes momentarily glowed, as he turned around and stared intensely at her. His smile became even more wavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d Why was he smiling so strangely?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle little grand disciple\u2026\u201d Yu Jin suddenly approached very closely, and his pair of peach blossom eyes seemed to have narrowed into thin lines. \u201cDo you wish to become the Hall Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if you don\u2019t wish to become one now, you can always change your mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, follow me to the hall. I will hand you the Hall Master Seal.\u201d Yu Jin basically did not have the intentions of allowing her to choose, as he grabbed onto Zhu Yao, and flew straight towards the peak of the mountain.</p><br/><p>In regards to such a forceful action, Zhu Yao had no choice but to summon the ultimate guardian beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d There\u2019s a strange uncle here trying to steal your disciple.</p><br/><p>A white light flashed, and a certain Hall Master was once again cut off halfway towards the mountain peak. The two figures once again fought intensely. As the one and only remaining survivor, Zhu Yao immediately returned to her home and pulled out a stool. After finding a position with the best view, she began spectating. Mn, let\u2019s have master make some spicy glutens next time.</p><br/><p>In this battle, they fought for exactly six hours. Compared to the previous shortest battle in these few months, it was even shorter by four hours. The reason why the battle ended prematurely, was because someone came during their fight. Wearing a blue-colored gown, that person flew on his sword, carrying a valiant aura.</p><br/><p>Not just that, he was very polite as well. Following the rules, he stayed outside the Lightning Divine Hall, where the layers of lightning formations were. Then, with an imposing tone, he began to announce with a loud and clear voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmissary of Advent Cloud Hall from the East, requests an audience with Lightning Divine Hall\u2026 Aiya\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, he was unfortunately struck down from the skies of the Lightning Divine Hall by the stray bullets\u2026 no, stray lightning bolts thrown by the two people. In the skies, his loud, clear, and imposing voice continued to echo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya\u2026 ya\u2026 ya\u2026 ya\u2026\u201d His voice continued to spread, and spread even further.</p><br/><p>Not a moment later, Zhu Yao simply heard a loud boink. A very fresh charred corpse, which was emitting out a nice grilled scent, fell right in front of her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u2026</p><br/><p>Yu Jin: \u2026</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh kuh\u2026\u201d Yu Jin finally stopped, and a hint of awkwardness flashed past his face. With a disguising tone, he said. \u201cLittle little grand disciple, this person seems to have come from the Advent Cloud Hall. I will have you deal with him then. When he wakes up, bring him over to the hall to have an audience with this Hall Master.\u201d After saying that, he turned around, and flew away.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. You piece of responsibility avoiding bitch.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Zhu Yao had no choice but to look towards Yu Yan with a pleading look.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan glanced at the charred corpse on the ground, casually pulled his own disciple towards the house, and left these two words. \u201cNot dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao heave a sigh of relief. But to leave him aside like this, was it really alright?</p><br/><p>This incident had proved that the so-called Deities did indeed possess the physique of a cockroach. On the second day, that unmoving corpse with was completely charred black, woke up by himself. Not only was his injuries healed, even his clothes had been changed to a new set.</p><br/><p>The little one respectfully bowed towards her, and his voice was still as clear as before. \u201cFellow Deity, might if I ask if this is the Lightning Divine Hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 yes.\u201d Zhu Yao responded. He couldn\u2019t want to have her settle the score, right?</p><br/><p>A hint of joy invaded the little one\u2019s face. \u201cThen, might if I ask why was I unconscious on the ground?\u201d</p><br/><p>Here it comes. Zhu Yao pointed to the sky. \u201cYou were struck by the heavenly lightning bolts, so\u2026\u201d Everything was caused by that sly fox, it\u2019s unrelated with her master.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The little one raised his head, glanced at the lightning clouds that enveloped the surroundings, and said with praise. \u201cAs expected of the Lightning Divine Hall, the Mountain Barrier Formation is especially sophisticated. Even though I was standing outside the formation, I was still struck by it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stared with widened eyes. He couldn\u2019t be thinking that the lightning bolts that struck him were caused by the lightning formation outside, right? Zhu Yao took a deep breath, and said with a stern look. \u201cYes, you were injured by the formation.\u201d Please look at my sincere eyes. \u201cBut, fortunately, it was not a serious matter. In the future, please be mindful not to casually approach it, dear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your reminder, fellow Deity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little one gave her an extremely grateful smile, and only then did he recall of the matters he was here for. \u201cI believe fellow Deity must be a disciple of the Lightning Divine Hall. This one is named Miao Lin, the emissary of the Advent Cloud Hall from the East. Under the instructions of our Patriarch, I have a matter which requires the audience of the Hall Master for. Might if I ask if fellow Deity could pass along this message.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s Deity Miao Lin.\u201d Zhu Yao replied with a courteous smile. \u201cHall Master has instructed me that once fellow Deity has woken up, I am to lead fellow Deity to meet with him directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hall Master has actually long known that I\u2019m here?\u201d Miao Lin\u2019s eyes shone with a worshiping light. \u201cAs I thought, he possesses heavenly foresight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. Young one, you\u2019re too na\u00efve. The person who injured you was exactly that bitch.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I will have to trouble fellow Deity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned around, and waved her hands at the person sitting at the courtyard. \u201cMaster, I\u2019m sending him to the hall at the peak. I will be back immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Miao Lin realize that there was another person sitting at the courtyard not far away from them. When he looked over, he was secretly a little startled. That person was actually a Heavy Deity, and the imposing aura being emitted from his body was frightening.</p><br/><p>Hearing his disciple\u2019s words, Yu Yan frowned. Raising his head, he looked towards the man next to his disciple, stared intensely at him for a moment, before giving a light response. \u201cMn.\u201d After pondering for a moment, he added. \u201cReturn early.\u201d After saying that, he continued to stare at the person next to her.</p><br/><p>Miao Lin, however, was drenched in cold sweat from his stare. Was it just his imagination? Why did he feel that this Heavy Deity seemed to have some sort of objection against him? He was clearly only here to pass a message, and had not offended him in any way, right?</p><br/><p>Bringing along Miao Lin, Zhu Yao headed directly towards the hall at the mountain peak through the teleportation formation at the foot of the mountain. However, she did not see that Yu Jin anywhere. Zhu Yao could not just throw Miao Lin aside without tending to him either, so she had no choice but to wait with him. But, they sat for exactly four hours, yet, not even the shadow of the sly fox could be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeity Yu, I wonder if it\u2019s because the Hall Master is busy with some matters, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Busy? When it came to that person, at this hour, he was most probably\u2026 sleeping!</p><br/><p>\u201cDeity Miao, please wait a moment. I will head inside to call him over.\u201d</p><br/><p>After informing him as such, Zhu Yao turned and headed towards the back of the hall. In an instant, she kicked open a certain door.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, little little grand disciple, why have you come? Have you thought it through, and changed your mind in becoming the Hall Master?\u201d Yu Jin sat right up from the bed half-dressed, as he waved his hands at Zhu Yao, calling her over. \u201cCome, come, come. Grandmaster here will cast the seal on you. It will be done very quickly, without the slightest bit of pain.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

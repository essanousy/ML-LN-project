As for Lin Xiang who was actually talking to Lan Qi before that, she turned her darkened expression to the side.</p><br/><p>Actually, Zhu Yao had nowhere else to head off to. She simply wanted to avoid making contact with Qi Ling. Qi Ling was like a chemical weapon, even if a person did nothing of note, she would still be able to push a large amount of aggro onto that person. After looking at her surroundings, she decided to walk towards Bai Yi whom she was familiar with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, make some space.\u201d One must pick the softest persimmon to pinch on, and Zhu Yao decisively chased the fox out of the shade of the tree, squatting there herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cGr\u2026 Great deity!\u201d Bai Yi, who was pushed off the shade, finally turned his line of sight back from Yi Ling\u2019s face, and looked at her with a dumbfounded look. \u201cWhy\u2026 Why are you in this forest as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d This idiot actually did not know she was in the party all this time. So this was what people called caring nothing for what was happening outside, except for the person one\u2019s interested in.</p><br/><p>Taking the opportunity when he had regained his senses, Zhu Yao decided to inquire about some gossips. \u201cLet me ask you something. Is there something going on with that Lin Xiang and Lan Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiritual Master Lan Qi was once senior-martial sister Lin\u2019s fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><br/><p>Really? She had never considered this aspect.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas once?\u201d She noted these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiritual Master Lan Qi was once engaged with senior-martial sister Lin. After that, Lan Qi was successful in condensing his Azoth Core. Since his cultivation level is now higher than senior-martial sister Lin, and he had even taken up the post of Sect Master, he was no longer compatible with senior-martial sister Lin. Thus, the reason he came to Blue Parasol Sect this time was to break off the engagement.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he was trash as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cA mere Azoth practitioner can become a master of a Sect?\u201d Zhu Yao casually asked.</p><br/><p>The fox looked at her strangely, and said with a matter of fact. \u201cThe number of Spiritual Masters who formed their Azoth Cores are small in the first place. The Sect Masters of the various sects are all Azoth practitioners, and the same goes for Blue Parasol Sect as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that the Sect Master of Blue Parasol Sect is only at the Azoth level as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the three Sovereigns?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re naturally at the Nascent Soul level!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d Zhu Yao finally understood what was wrong. Because she was at the Foundation level, she couldn\u2019t recognize the depths of the cultivation level possessed by people stronger than her. She kept hearing others calling them Sovereigns, so she had always thought that these so-called Sovereigns, like the cultivation world back then, were referring to Demigod practitioners, and that the Sect Masters were Nascent Soul practitioners. Never did she think that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the Demigod stage? Are there no Demigod practitioners?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Demigod?\u201d The fox looked confused.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cAre there no cultivation level higher than the Nascent Soul stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d The fox nodded. \u201cIf one possesses cultivation higher than the Nascent Soul stage, isn\u2019t that akin to ascending?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas no one ever ascended?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fox chuckled, as though he had just heard a joke. \u201cAscending and becoming a deity are just legends, there\u2019s no evidence to prove they exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Hello, I am legend!</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. The level of cultivation of this world was actually this low?</p><br/><p>\u201cLast question.\u201d Zhu Yao asked softly. \u201cDo you know why it\u2019s better to have more Spirit Veins?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more Spirit Veins you have, the more mystic arts you can learn!\u201d The fox said seriously. \u201cIf one only has a single Spirit Vein, then one can only learn mystic arts of that one element. For example, Fire Spirit Vein Holders can only learn arts of the fire element, so naturally, the more Spirit Veins, the better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it is!\u201d The fox raised his hand, and instantly, a ball of flames appeared above his palm. \u201cFor example, I have three Spirit Veins of Fire, Wood and Earth, so only have three types of spiritual energy in my body, which also means that I can only use mystic arts of three elements. It\u2019s not possible for me to use mystic arts of the water element.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao finally understood where the problem was. The people of this world did not know how to convert their spiritual energy! To put it more precisely, they did not hold the concept of converting their spiritual energy at all. Could it be that there\u2019s differences in their physical bodies?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently circulated her spiritual energy for a moment, converting her wood spiritual energy into water spiritual energy. In an instant, several droplets of water appeared in her palm.</p><br/><p>Since the body was not the problem, then that meant that they simply did not know the matter about converting spiritual energy. It was no wonder they treated the Heavenly Spirit Vein as trash.</p><br/><p>In battle, naturally, the more mystic arts one could use, the more of an advantageous position he would be in. Especially when your opponent possessed a Spirit Vein that countered yours, if you\u2019re only capable of using mystic arts of a single element, you would suffer a definite loss.</p><br/><p>However, the mystic arts of the five elements reinforced and suppressed one another. The people of this world only knew about the theory of suppression, but did not understand the theory of reinforcement.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, who unexpectedly found out the truth, could only say: Hoho!</p><br/><p>As expected, an uneducated world was truly frightening!</p><br/><p>You people deserve to have such poor cultivation.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she found out in time. Otherwise, when they were to finally encounter the demonic beast, and she were to habitually use her lightning-type mystic arts then, people would definitely surround her and treat her like Godzilla.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Ling, you best not take things too far!\u201d Suddenly, with a \u2018pa\u2019 sound, something fell onto the ground. Nearby, the girl Lin Xiang was presently glaring at Ms. Mary Sue with a furious look.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Lin, please, don\u2019t be angry? If Ling\u2019er has done anything wrong, isn\u2019t it fine if I apologize to you?\u201d Yi Ling sat on the ground with an innocent expression, teary light can be faintly seen in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned her head to look. Was the catfight finally about to begin?</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Xiang, what are you doing?\u201d The follower Qi Ping rushed over in an instant and pulled Yi Ling up from the ground. He then glared at Lin Xiang. \u201cWhy did you push Ling\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even touch her. She fell on her own!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pack of lies! This place is a plain field, so how could junior-martial sister have possibly fallen on her own? Do you think we\u2019re blind?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Mr. Follower, you\u2019re really blind alright.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you believe it or not, I did not push her anyway.\u201d Lin Xiang said, still in a furious tone.</p><br/><p>Qi Ping became even more furious. \u201cLin Xiang, you have always been this unruly. Yi Ling has never bothered you, so why do you have to always attack her so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? Attack her?\u201d Lin Xiang widened her eyes, her boiling anger drove her to laugh. \u201cJust who\u2019s the one attacking who, I believe she knows in the bottom of her heart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Lin\u2026\u201d Yi Ling was once again hesitant with her words, the expression on her face was filled with even more grievance.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Yi, you don\u2019t have to care about her.\u201d With an aching heart, Qi Ling consoled her. \u201cShe\u2019s just spoilt by the Sect Master, that\u2019s why she is this imperious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ping, speak clearly. Who\u2019s imperious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Ling: \u201cSenior-martial brother, forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister, don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d Qi Ping was now enraged as well, as he glared towards Lin Xiang. \u201cIf you dare to bully Yi Ling ever again, I will not be courteous with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m afraid of you?\u201d Lin Xiang instantly summoned her spiritual sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d At this moment, Lan Qi who went to investigate the area finally returned. He looked back and forth at the two people, and when he saw the wronged look Yi Ling had, his expression instantly sank. He hurriedly walked over, and instantly pulled Yi Ling into his embrace. \u201cLing\u2019er, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yi Ling did not speak, instead, she turned to glance at Lin Xiang at the side.</p><br/><p>Lan Qi\u2019s expression sunk even more, and without even thinking, he spoke to Lin Xiang. \u201cXiang\u2019er, apologize to Ling\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Xiang was stunned, as she looked towards Lan Qi with a face of utter disbelief. \u201cEven you believe that I pushed her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lan Qi\u2019s expression grew even sterner.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiang suddenly laughed. Her laughter was filled with desolateness. She coldly glanced at Yi Ling, and took a deep breath, as though she was trying to suppress the anger in the depths of her heart. With emphasis on every single word, she said. \u201cFine. Yi Ling, didn\u2019t you want him? If you like him, then go ahead, take him! From now on, the two of us are strangers.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she turned around, and walked towards the forest alone. And not a single person present took a step forward.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. As expected, a large crowd of cannon fodders would always be laid behind every single Mary Sue\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Lin will be fine, right?\u201d Yi Ling suddenly asked with a worried look.</p><br/><p>Just as Lan Qi was about to console her, Zhu Yao, who had been watching the show the entire time, could no longer help but speak up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf junior-martial sister Yi is worried, why don\u2019t you chase after her to take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yi Ling\u2019s expression stiffened, and no longer spoke.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently rolled her eyes. She knew all along. If Yi Ling really wanted to have her stay, why would she wait till she had walked so far away before speaking up?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! I\u2019m going with you.\u201d Zhu Yao deftly chased up to Lin Xiang.</p><br/><p>When she spoke, everyone present was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Xiang was even more shocked than the rest, as she looked at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe that you didn\u2019t push her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao turned to glance at Yi Ling, and meaningfully said. \u201cI have experience when it comes to incidents like this, right? Junior. Martial. Sister. Yi!\u201d When they first met back then, didn\u2019t she use the same method?</p><br/><p>Yi Ling\u2019s expression paled, however, she acted as though she did not hear anything, as she buried her head into Lan Qi\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not care about her reaction either. She had long wanted to find an opportunity to leave the team. Compared to a fake lotus like Yi Ling, she was more willing to accompany an explosive lady like Lin Xiang. After all, she might become the next cannon fodder.</p><br/><p>Roaarr\u2026 Roaaarrr\u2026</p><br/><p>Before her plan to leave the team could initiate, a loud roar suddenly reverberated. A gigantic shadow suddenly appeared before their eyes. Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank, as she grabbed onto Lin Xiang who was nearest to her, and dodged to the side with her fastest speed.</p><br/><p>On the plain field where they were resting on, a gigantic demonic beast was presently baring its teeth in the direction where the four people were standing.</p><br/><p>This demonic beast was at least three storeys tall, and its entire body was covered in scales. Its outer appearance however looked a little like a bear, and there were even three metal blade-like horns on its head.</p><br/><p>The hell, what happened to the promised fourth-ranked demonic beast?</p><br/><p>Seeing this beast, Zhu Yao simply wanted to say a single word: \u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>She picked up Lin Xiang in passing, summoned her flying sword, and soared desperately into the skies.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu!\u201d Just as she was about fly away, she was blocked by Yi Ling who was flying on her own sword, and even grabbed onto her hand. \u201cNow that the demonic beast has appeared, we should be killing it with our combined hearts and strength, how can you flee before the battle even begin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBattle your sister! Move away, if we don\u2019t flee now, we won\u2019t be able to escape in time!\u201d The hell, Zhu Yao even harbored thoughts of killing her now.</p><br/><p>Yi Ling\u2019s face however was filled with excitement. \u201cCould it be that senior-martial sister Zhu recognize this demonic beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Recognize? She totally recognized it alright! Among all demonic beasts, Zhu Yao was most familiar with this one. After all\u2026 this was the Risefire Beast which crippled her all over back then in Tasyoluk!</p><br/><p>Roaarrrr~~~~~</p><br/><p>A loud roar once again reverberated. The gigantic figure that was on still on the ground earlier blurred, and instantly appeared before the two of them.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart instantly turned cold. Oh crap!</p><br/><p>Yi Ling however turned about and cast an art, and a icicle instantly appeared in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use ice!\u201d Zhu Yao sent a slap towards her, instantly interrupting her from completing her art. Yi Ling\u2019s feet became unsteady, and then, she fell from the sky.</p><br/><p>The Risefire Beast had already pounced towards them, and Zhu Yao could only fly downwards with Lin Xiang in hand as well, barely dodging its attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Yi!\u201d Qi Ping soared and caught the falling Yi Ling. With boiling fury, he began to lash out at Zhu Yao. \u201cAre you crazy? Why did you interrupt her when she was casting an art? And you even push\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Zhu Yao ruthlessly glared at Qi Ping, stunning him with her roar.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not have the time to care about him, because\u2026 the Risefire Beast disappeared again.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, prepare your barriers, hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Other than Lin Xiang who followed her instructions, the rest looked confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are you planning to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao couldn\u2019t care less, as she desperately released her divine sense to sense the position of the Risefire Beast. Unfortunately, the difference in their levels was too large, and she was simply unable to sense it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to her!\u201d Lan Qi flew over, and his expression sank quite a bit. His cultivation level was the highest among the people here, so naturally he could sense that something was amiss. \u201cThat one is most likely not a fourth-ranked beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did their expressions change. Yi Ling then asked with a startled look. \u201cIf it\u2019s not fourth-ranked, then what rank is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Qi turned to look at Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao clenched her fists. \u201cRisefire Beast, resistant to water and fire, sixth-ranked demonic beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone present instantly held their breaths at the same time.</p><br/><p>Sixth-ranked, it was comparable to an Azoth Paragon. Lan Qi, who had the highest cultivation level among them, had only just formed his Azoth Core. Adding that demonic beasts were naturally stronger than practitioners of similar cultivation level, they basically had no shot at victory.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was someone who had truly fought against a Risefire Beast before. Back then, even with so many Azoth practitioners present, they still did not have an advantageous position over the Risefire Beast, let alone now when they were merely Foundation and Essence practitioners. That was why her first reaction was to flee, but that bitch of a Mary Sue\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Qi Ping was panicking as well, as he summoned his weapon and looked tensely at his surroundings.</p><br/><p>Lan Qi did not reply, and instead looked towards Zhu Yao again. Everyone\u2019s line of sight was guided over as well, as they all stared at her.</p><br/><p>What do we do? Wait for death, of course. This time, her master couldn\u2019t save her, as he was still buried in the soil.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Zhu, you\u2019re the only one here who has met this demonic beast before. How do you think we should approach this?\u201d Lan Qi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBuy time with the best of our abilities while ensuring our measly lives are intact.\u201d Zhu Yao looked towards Yi Ling at the side. \u201cYou have a voice transmission talisman, right? Hurry and send a message back to the sect, have them dispatch a Nascent Soul practitioner here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Ling\u2019s expression changed, and meekly said. \u201cBut master is currently in isolation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we will just wait for our deaths!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately interrupted her words.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s face ashened, and Yi Ling once again revealed that grievanced look. Though this time, no one bothered about her, as everyone was tensely waiting for the Risefire Beast\u2019s next appearance.</p><br/><p>Only then did Yi Ling unwillingly take out the voice transmission talisman. Raising her hand, just as she was planning to activate it, her sleeves slightly trembled for a moment. They were fluttering upwards, as though a light breeze had swept past them. Zhu Yao who had been focusing on the surrounding situation instantly noticed this.</p><br/><p>\u201cScatter!\u201d Zhu Yao shouted out and pushed Yi Ling in the opposite direction, while she flew backwards on her flying sword with extreme speed. In almost a blink of an eye, a black shadow appeared from above, descending right towards the place where the few of them were before.</p><br/><p>As she realized it in time, she had managed to dodge it. Yi Ling was also out of the attack radius due to her push. Lan Qi was after all an Azoth practitioner, so his reaction speed was the quickest. Bai Yi was after all a demon, so he was able to escape with his strong sense of danger. As for Lin Xiang, because Zhu Yao had grabbed onto her earlier and had forgotten to let go since then, so she naturally escaped as well.</p><br/><p>The only one who did not react in time was Qi Ping.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, she was not exactly sure of the specifics.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she did not understand, Little Wang, with a serious expression, began to explain to her. \u201cI heard from eldest senior-martial brother that, only chamber disciples are taught mystic arts personally by master. The rest of the Inner Sect disciples are taught by my senior-martial brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s actually a system like this! But, it was understandable. There were so many disciples in the Ancient Hill Sect, other than the talentless Outer Sect disciples, the rest were allocated to the Six Mountains. The number of disciples that belonged under each Mountain Lord were at least in the high thousands, and at most, above ten thousand. If all of them were to be taught by the Mountain Lord alone, he or she would be tired to death. If we put it that way, the high status of a chamber disciple went without saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, little wimp, you\u2019re sure doing well.\u201d Zhu Yao praised him as she stroked his little head.</p><br/><p>Little Wang became even more complacent. Giving her a \u201cI will be the one protecting you in the future\u201d expression, he raised his head up high like a little prideful rooster. As he dodged her hand, he continued to flaunt proudly. \u201cLet me tell you this. I\u2019m already at the third level of Essence. Even big senior-martial brother was not as fast me. Tell me, aren\u2019t I really awesome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes. You\u2019re awesome. You\u2019re the most awesome little kid ever.\u201d As she thought, he was still a kid. How could she reject his little eyes which were begging for attention and praise? At the very least, she was the one who brought him here, and she suddenly had the feeling as though she had a son who had just grown up.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi became a little embarrassed from her praises, his little face blushed as he scratched his head. \u201cThen, what about you? What level are you at right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao became silent, and the corner of lips twitched a little. Recalling that she had already spent almost a month at the Jade Forest Mountain, forget about stepping into the Essence-stage, she still did not know what the hell spiritual energy was! The absorption of spiritual energy into one\u2019s body her master told her about, she was unable to sense it at all.</p><br/><p>Unless she had really aged, and could no longer compare herself to the little turnips at all? A deep sense of powerlessness momentarily filled her entire body, and she could not help but let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi felt the change in her mood, and his sparkling eyes were momentarily dyed with worry. Pulling her hand, he hesitantly spoke out. \u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t be depressed. Even if you haven\u2019t enter the Essence-stage, it\u2019s not really a big deal. Hao Kai who came along with us just managed to sense spiritual energy as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guh. Comparing her with a little wimp, was he really trying to console her? Zhu Yao felt her mood worsening.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was not livening up at all, Wang Xuzhi scratched his head irritatedly, walked about in circles, and continued. \u201cIn any\u2026 In any case, you will definitely be really awesome really soon. If you really can\u2019t enter the Essence-stage, then\u2026 then, I\u2026 I will support you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Puf~~</p><br/><p>Hearing a little turnip say that he would support her so decisively, this was the first time it ever happened in the twenty odd years of Zhu Yao\u2019s life. Although this little wimp had always insisted that she was his wife due to the butt-spanking incident, she had always treated it as a joke. Earlier, she intentionally acted depressed, and simply wanted to tease him. However, she did not expect he would say that he would support her with such a serious expression. Zhu Yao could not help but laugh at his serious little face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you laugh. I\u2019m serious. Don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d Seeing her laughing even more loudly, Wang Xuzhi anxiously stomped his feet.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao squatted down, instantly pulled the flustered little turnip into her embrace, and stroked his little head. This little wimp, sure likes to make me laugh, and make me feel moved as well. In response to his words, she nodded heavily. \u201cI do, I do believe you. Then I will wait for you to grow up and support me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Wang snorted heavily, and finally quietened down, obediently allowed her to hug him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle junior-martial brother.\u201d From nearby, someone that looked about fifteen to sixteen years old walked over. With a face full of smiles, he looked extremely friendly. Looking at the people in the courtyard, a hint of suspicion floated in his mind, however, he walked in without pausing a single step.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother Du.\u201d Wang Xuzhi forcefully squeezed himself out of Zhu Yao\u2019s embrace, and he looked at the incoming person with a surprised expression. It seemed like this person was also one of the Sect Master\u2019s chamber disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle junior-martial brother, this junior-martial sister is?\u201d The person who came in gave Zhu Yao a light glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my w\u2026\u201d Seeing Little Wang who was about to blurt that out once again, with her nimble hands, she quickly covered his mouth. This loud-mouth little wimp, she did not wish to have a legend about her having a may-december relationship spreading around the entire sect the next day.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, I\u2019m his big sister. Blood-related!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re his elder sister.\u201d The man politely smiled. He sized her up, and realized he was unable to see through her cultivation level. In situations like this where he was unable to see one\u2019s cultivation level, either she had not learn how to take in spiritual energy, or, her cultivation level was much higher than himself. However, looking at her age, she must have admitted into the sect for a long time, so, he determined it was the latter.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Du Yuanchen, a disciple under Reverend Zi Mo. Mind if I ask, which Reverend is senior-martial sister under?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Zhu Yao, I\u2019m a\u2026 disciple from the Talisman Mountain.\u201d So as to prevent people from calling her ancestor, she made a small lie.</p><br/><p>Du Yuanchen nodded, and no longer continued questioning her. He turned and said to Wang Xuzhi. \u201cLittle junior-martial brother, it\u2019s almost time. Let\u2019s go look for master together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi was startled for a moment. He had to look for his master, but, it\u2019s been a long time since had seen Zhu Yao, so he was a little reluctant. Thus, he looked at Zhu Yao with a difficult expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on. It\u2019s also about time for me to return. Let\u2019s head out together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then was Wang Xuzhi satisfied, and followed behind Du Yuanchen. Occasionally, he would sneak a peak at Zhu Yao behind him, as though he was afraid he might lose her. They would also occasionally start up some idle chatter along the way, and Du Yuanchen would timely interject into their conversations as well.</p><br/><p>From their conversation, Zhu Yao found out that there were extremely small number of chamber disciples in every Mountain, and only people with especially good talents, would be taken in by the Mountain Lords as chamber disciples. For example, under the Sect Master, Reverend Zi Mo, he currently only had five chamber disciples. Du Yuanchen was the fourth disciple, he entered under him fifteen years ago, and currently, he was at the level of an Essence Paragon. Little Wang was obviously the youngest disciple. Looking at Du Yuanchen, he seemed to extremely like this little junior-martial brother of his. With his protection, Zhu Yao was able to slightly feel at ease.</p><br/><p>Along the way, she had encountered many Sword Mountain disciples bowing to the two people one after another. It seemed like the status of a chamber disciple was extremely high in the sect. And Du Yuanchen and Little Wang seemed to have gotten used to it, as they simply walked on while looking steadily forward.</p><br/><p>Little Wang, who had a mind of a child, was even more cocky. He held extreme respect to his own master, and along the way, he kept instilling into her his thoughts of his master being \u201cextremely awesome\u201d, and his master being \u201cnumber one in the world\u201d.</p><br/><p>Zhu yao curled her lips, she could not bear to shatter his passion to chase after his idol. She wondered what kind of expression he would make if he knew that his master had to call her martial-aunt.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, like I was saying, your master must be terribly bad, that\u2019s why you\u2019re still not as awesome as me!\u201d As though he had finally found a very legitimate reason, Wang Xuzhi said to her very sincerely. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have my master take you in as his disciple as well? Master really dotes on me, so he will definitely accept you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Wang felt as though his words sounded more and more reasonable, and with his small hands, he pulled Zhu Yao over to his master\u2019s cave residence.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was about to stop him, when suddenly, a loud bang sounded. In front of her, a black figure flashed past, and with a \u2018pa\u2019 sound, it fell right in front of them, staining the ground with a pool of blood.</p><br/><p>A flying corpse out of nowhere!? What the hell!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

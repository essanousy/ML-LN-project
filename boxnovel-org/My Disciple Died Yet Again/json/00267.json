What\u2019s going on? Why are you here?\u201d Zhu Yao passed him a piece of tissue.</p><br/><p>Bai Yuan received it. Though his tears had stopped, he still had a depressed look. Biting his lips, tears constantly flowed, as his pair of hands held tightly onto one of her hands, unwilling to let go. He was like a child whose body and heart had been hurt, filled with fear and unease.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuanyuan\u2026 doesn\u2019t know\u2026 either.\u201d He sniffled. \u201cYuanyuan missed Mistress Yaoyao, so\u2026 I used the pearl\u2026 with the thought of finding Mistress Yaoyao, in the end\u2026 I became like this\u2026 Those\u2026 Those beasts even bit me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed as she stroked his head. The feelings of being hated by little animals, were something she understood very well! Back then, she was also someone who was chased down several streets by alien dogs!</p><br/><p>Bai Yuan\u2019s tears poured out again, as he cried even more sadly than before. \u201cBeasties don\u2019t like me\u2026 Wuuuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright\u2026\u201d She stroked his head.</p><br/><p>Haah. When Bai Yuan was in Spiritual Realm, he was a beastie who could hold his head high. No matter were they demonic beasts or human practitioners, there was not a single one who did not revere him like an idol. However, the moment he came here, he was chased and surrounded by a few dogs to such an extent. Just thinking about it made her heart sour.</p><br/><p>After transmigrating into a foreign world, he was despised by little animals. The shadow in Bai Yuan\u2019s heart grew.</p><br/><p>Even after Zhu Yao pacified him for a long while, Bai Yuan continued to cry and wail. She felt as if her sofa was about to be submerged in tears. She had to also comment on the fact that consoling a hunk, who was more than a hundred and seventy centimeters tall, was definitely a strenuous physical activity.</p><br/><p>In the end, a certain master, who had long found this unpleasing to his eyes, reached out his hand and slammed the greasy alien unconscious. Peace finally returned to the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep, we will speak tomorrow.\u201d After saying that, he immediately pulled his disciple back to the room, and tightly hugged onto her as they laid on the bed. Mn. His disciple was still his. Pets or whatever, raising too many of them was too much of a hassle.</p><br/><p>After pondering for an entire night, Zhu Yao was still unable to figure out how Bai Yuan came over. If it was just purely the ability of his inner core, she felt that it was impossible. Putting aside the fact that she basically did not possess the so-called divine sense after returning here, it was hard to say if the inner core which Bai Yuan gave her was still with her. Furthermore, though Bai Yuan was a mysterious beastie, his abilities could not possibly surpass Realmspirit\u2019s. Realmspirit found it really hard to send her back here, let alone Bai Yuan. If transmigrating was really that easy, this side would have long turned into a sieve. There was no need to wait till now.</p><br/><p>Bai Yuan was frightened, and he was unable to speak clearly either. So she decided to ask him in detail another day.</p><br/><p>On the early morning of the second day, she dexterously got up, only to realize that Bai Yuan had long woken up, and he was inspecting his surroundings with a confused look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou woke up?\u201d Zhu Yao passed by him and poured a cup of water.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this?\u201d He asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere else can this be? This is my home.\u201d Zhu Yao passed the cup to him, and just as she was about to console him again.</p><br/><p>However, he did not receive it. Instead, as if he had figured everything out, he pulled out his wallet from his clothes, took out a Grandfather Mao\u00b9, and threw it at her. \u201cTake this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. She was unable to understand what he was playing at. \u201cWhat are you trying to pull?\u201d</p><br/><p>He coldly laughed, as he then threw the money on the table. \u201cWe are all mature adults. We were just playing, I urge you not to treat it so seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mature adults? Seriously? She suddenly thought of something, as she then sized up the person before her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Bai Yuan?\u201d He frowned, as he looked at her with slight scorn. \u201cThis can\u2019t be your first time, right? You\u2019re merely selling your body, yet you\u2019re trying to play a game of true love?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. With a swing of her hand, she splashed the cup of water onto him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t brush your teeth in the morning, right? Want me to help you?\u201d Knock out your teeth or anything like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201d With a stunned look, he wiped his face. \u201cI already gave you money, what else do you want? You\u2019re just a prostitute, you can\u2019t be thinking of having me take responsibility, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResponsibility? In your dreams!\u201d Zhu Yao even threw the cup at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou crazy!\u201d That man dodged to the side, and looked at her with a startled look. \u201cIf not because I was drunk, do you think I will fancy you? Let me tell you this, my standards are very high\u2026 Oi oi oi, what are you doing? Put that teapot down!\u201d</p><br/><p>With fumes going right up her head, Zhu Yao raised the teapot up, and was about to smash it on his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Yu Yan walked out of the bedroom, still dressed in his pyjamas. His face still carried a hint of sleepiness, and his black hair scattered behind his back, unknowingly emitting out an alluring look.</p><br/><p>That person\u2019s eyes instantly widened, as he stared at Yu Yan with an infatuated look. His mouth slightly opened, and he suddenly spoke. \u201cMister, may I ask if you\u2019re gay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt as if a string in her mind, had resoundingly snapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d She threw a kick at him. She could put aside him mistaking her as one of those particular workers, but he actually dared to cover her man! Zhu Yao instantly threw a flurry of punches and kicks at him. Arming herself with a broom, she chased him out, and then closed the door with a bang.</p><br/><p>That man however was still shouting out loud outside the door. \u201cHaah, wait a minute. If you\u2019re not gay, we can still become friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she walked back, her master had already changed out of his pyjamas, and was sitting on the chair.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, he\u2026\u201d Even though he clearly had the same face, why did he turn into someone else after the course of a single night?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not Bai Yuan.\u201d Yu Yan said with a sunken voice. \u201cThe spiritual energy on his body has disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, did Bai Yuan transmigrate over, or did he not?</p><br/><p>\u201cMost likely, Bai Yuan\u2019s soul has merely dwelled in that person\u2019s body for a short while. Presently, he should have already returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was no wonder Bai Yuan was dressed in such a way right from the start.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, can Bai Yuan still return?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan shook his head. \u201cI do not know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. Initially, she had even wanted to ask him about it. Never did she expect that he would disappear after a single night. Forget it, Bai Yuan after all do not belong to this world. Just from making a small trip here, his heart has suffered such damage. It\u2019s good that he has gone back.</p><br/><p>After the person, whom Bai Yuan possessed, left, he did not appear in the following two days of the weekends. Zhu Yao urged her master to love the house appliances, and told him things like everyone had responsibilities to uphold, before heading for work like usual.</p><br/><p>The moment she arrived in the company, Mouse ran over to her to pass her a message, informing her that the general manager wished to see her.</p><br/><p>Whenever a new manager takes up the position in a company, he or she will naturally want to make his or her presence known. As the overseer of the planning department, the manager would look for her sooner or later. Without carrying any worries, Zhu Yao headed straight up. The office was still in the same location, though the person inside was no longer her fellow classmate Fatty.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed, before knocking on the door. After hearing the response from inside, she then pushed the door open and entered.</p><br/><p>Only to see a purplish face with green nose and swollen cheeks. Mn\u2026 And he looked a little familiar.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, that person raised his head as well, and instantly, he spat out his tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>They spoke in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, something like fate, was simply a bitch! Never in her dreams would she think that the pervert who cover her man just two days ago, was actually her newly appointed superior. As expected, fate was really a motherfucking bitch.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d The newly appointed bitch faked out a few coughs, easing the awkwardness between them. Then, he immediately picked back up his demeanour as a general manager. \u201cUmm\u2026 Hello! I\u2019m Yu Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re surnamed Yu as well?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cWho is Fatty to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Brother Ban? He\u2019s my cousin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d This damn fatty is simply too unethical. So the person he sold the company to, in the end was still someone from his own family.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be Zhu Yao, right?\u201d He stood up, and reached out his hand towards her. \u201cWe are colleagues from now on. I hope that Overseer Zhu will continue working for the company like before. Looking forward to cooperating with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao glanced at him, and did not reach out her hand. Who wants to become friends with a love rival? Scram!</p><br/><p>The corner of Yu Tian\u2019s lips twitched. He knew that she was still angry about the matter of that day. \u201cAhem\u2026 About that. It was my fault back then. I was a little\u2026 over-the-top drunk that day. Mind telling me how did I end up on the sofa in your apartment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know how you found your way there?\u201d Zhu Yao began to make up a story. She could not possibly tell him that he was possessed by a beastie, right? \u201cOn that day, I saw you leaning against my apartment door. You would not leave no matter what, and even hugged onto my thigh, crying for an entire night. I then relented and brought you in, letting you sleep on the sofa for an entire night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Tian frowned. That\u2019s not right. He was pretty good with alcohol, and had never done such an embarrassing thing in his life. Furthermore, he could not recall that he drank any alcohol last night at all. But, when he woke up, his eyes were indeed swollen red, looking as if he had cried for a long while.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral manager, is there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you can return now.\u201d Though he was still a little suspicious, Yu Tian had no choice but to accept this reason.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned around and walked towards the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned her head around, only to see him ask with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, let me ask about something. That person in your apartment is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Oh.\u201d With such extent of beauty, he was actually really a man. He was really disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really familiar with Fatty\u2019s mother. Do you think I should send her a message, about your sexual preference?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao observed this new boss for a few days, and realized that Bai Yuan was indeed not appearing again.</p><br/><p>This person named Yu Tian was similarly unreliable. As expected of a relative of Fatty. Though he no longer raised cats, he began raising dogs instead. She had seen him pulling along a Samoyed puppy several times after work. Bai Yuan fortunately did not return, otherwise it was unimaginable how frightened he would become.</p><br/><p>After a few weeks, Zhu Yao was finally certain that Bai Yuan would not appear again.</p><br/><p>Before she could even feel at ease, a few days later, while Zhu Yao was conducting a department meeting, Yu Tian suddenly charged in. Hugging onto her thigh, he painfully cried out and shouted. \u201cLittle martial aunt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>People in the meeting room: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This world would not turn into a sieve, but Yu Tian was about to turn into one.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys continue the discussion, I will return in a moment.\u201d Zhu Yao picked up the person on the ground, and pulled Yu Tian all the way towards his office. After slamming the door shut, she locked it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle martial aunt, I\u2019m Zi Dan!\u201d He said with a sincere look.</p><br/><p>\u201cZi Dan?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re the fatty of Beast-Taming Peak?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What fatty? He was just a little wealthy looking.</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind. So, how did you arrive here then?\u201d Zhu Yao sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, I arrived here after my lifespan has depleted. Initially, I had wanted to investigate the place, but I never expected that I would encounter little martial aunt.\u201d Zi Dan looked around with a curious expression. \u201cCould this possibly be the Netherworld? I wonder where can I enter the Path of Reincarnation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you jump down from the window here, you can be reincarnated.\u201d This place was situated on the thirtieth floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He was actually eagerly walking towards the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, come back!\u201d He really believed it, hey!</p><br/><p>1.

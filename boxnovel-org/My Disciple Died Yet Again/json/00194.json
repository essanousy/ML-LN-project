Occasionally, she would find it hard to breath as well. Her master had tried using divine energy to repair her damaged meridians, but it was ineffective. The moment the divine energy entered her body, it would automatically disperse, as though she was born immune to divine energy.</p><br/><p>Her grandmaster and the Hall Master had inspected her as well, but they too were unable to do anything. Yu Yan\u2019s expression grew even heavier. He was never someone who loved to talk in the first place, but presently, he was even quieter than before.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was simply unable to figure out just what was the intention behind her return to this body. Could it be merely to have her die once more? She knew that she didn\u2019t have much time left, and this body of hers could only last for at most a few more days. Death wasn\u2019t something she was afraid of, after all, she could just switch to another character. The only thing she was worried about was another matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I wish to see Yue Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a dark prison, within the pitch-black surroundings, the only source of light came from the boundless formation seals in the air, where rotating runes filled the entire place. Within the layers of formations, a black figure was currently bound and suspended. His two arms were spread open and stuck in an unmovable posture due to the layers of runes, and his head was lowered, making it impossible to make out his current expression.</p><br/><p>When a ray of light suddenly flashed in the darkness, as though space was sliced apart, the shape of a door slowly opened, and a white figure slowly walked out from the other side.</p><br/><p>That person, who had his head lowered the entire time, finally looked up. Although his expression was pale to the point where not a single hint of redness could be seen, he did not look downcast and fatigued like an ordinary prisoner. He looked in the visitor\u2019s direction, eyes narrowed. A sharp glint could be seen from within them, filled with disdain and arrogance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d His voice was low-spirited, yet carried a hint of coldness.</p><br/><p>The visitor did not reply, but simply frowned and inspected the prisoner.</p><br/><p>In an instant, he was a little irritated, and his expression sunk even more. His words carried a threatening tone. \u201cDon\u2019t forget. If not to save her, why would I be here? You best hurry up. Otherwise\u2026 I don\u2019t have much patience.\u201d</p><br/><p>The visitor still kept quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering?\u201d He glanced at the other party, and as though he suddenly thought of something, his eyes fiercely widened. \u201cSomething happened to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d The dark aura emitted from his body instantly spread in all directions, carrying a chilling atmosphere. The surrounding runes seemed to have been infected, as they began to destabilize and had signs of collapsing. \u201cYou promised that you would save her. If anything happens to her, I will definitely not forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The visitor frowned even deeper. Glancing at the person who had fallen into madness, the visitor finally let out a deep sigh. \u201cHah\u2026 Yue Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>The figure, who looked as though was about to lose control, stiffened. The surrounding black aura instantly dispersed completely, as he looked at the person in front of him, stunned. \u201cBig Sis\u2026 Yao.\u201d His voice no longer carried the arrogance it had before.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took down the talisman on her body, and her figure reverted back to Yin Xin\u2019s look in a flash. \u201cI had wanted to use a transformation talisman to test you. I never expected that you\u2019re still like this. You haven\u2019t reflected on your actions in the least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao.\u201d His face was filled with anxiety, as he tried to explain. \u201cI\u2026 I wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t what?\u201d Zhu Yao interrupted his words. \u201cWasn\u2019t trying to vent your anger out on others, wasn\u2019t trying to kill my master, is that it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yue Ying was at a loss of words, as he slowly lowered his head. A moment later, he muttered. \u201cI only wanted to save Big Sis Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s head ached a little, as she said with a dispirited tone. \u201cYue Ying, do you actually know what you have done wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying lowered his head even more, like a child who was being lectured by his parents, his fingers dug even deeper into his palms. \u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026 doesn\u2019t like Devils?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is unrelated to you being a Devil. What I mind isn\u2019t your identity as a Devil, but your method of doing things, and your thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yue Ying was at a loss.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. \u201cWhy did you kill Xu Nuoyan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause big sister doesn\u2019t like him, so I don\u2019t like him either.\u201d A hint of hostility flashed past Yue Ying\u2019s brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you killed him just because you don\u2019t like him? I have tons of people I don\u2019t like, you know? Are you going to kill all of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying actually nodded honestly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was this close to sending a slap to his face, in order to beat him into correcting his distorted three views. \u201cThen if there comes a day I don\u2019t like you as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying suddenly widened his eyes, his expression was filled with fear and loss. \u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026 I will be obedient. Please don\u2019t dislike me, I will change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you know that a change can be made, then why aren\u2019t you giving others the opportunity to do so?\u201d Zhu Yao ruthlessly continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, be it Devils, deities, or even the practitioners in the Lower Realm, we\u2019re all the same. We\u2019re all just people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yue Ying refuted. \u201cBig sister is big sister, you\u2019re different from the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, you can just judge a person\u2019s life and death based on your own ideologies. If there comes a day when you don\u2019t like me as well, will you kill me too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will never ever\u2026\u201d He anxiously tried to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will!\u201d Zhu Yao interrupted his words, and coldly pointed out the truth. \u201cTwice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d His face instantly ashened.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao however had no choice but to continue. \u201cYue Ying, you killed me twice, and personally too!\u201d</p><br/><p>As though he had just heard something terrifying, his body began to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t because of my good luck, the one standing in front of you today would have most likely been a ghost.\u201d Zhu Yao sighed. \u201cYue Ying, I have always treated you as my little brother, a part of my family. The bad things you have done are my responsibility as your older sister. It\u2019s my fault for not teaching you well, so I won\u2019t blame you for the past two times. I will just treat it as atonement for all the wrong things you have done, so big sister can forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister\u2026\u201d His two eyes instantly brightened with hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you must remember.\u201d Her tone instantly changed. \u201cThe lives and deaths of people can\u2019t be judged by your own tastes. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a deity or a Devil, you best learn how to be a good person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d He obediently nodded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. Actually, she did not have complete confidence in twisting back this child\u2019s utterly distorted three views, but she had to at least try. So what if he was a Devil? Could it be that she had to kill him? Of course not. Even if Yue Ying wouldn\u2019t resist, she wouldn\u2019t lift a finger on him either.</p><br/><p>She was just human, she had blood and flesh like just any ordinary human being. If one\u2019s own child had done something wrong, that child could be beaten, lectured, or even be sent to jail to reform himself. However, never would the parents think of killing him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m obedient, will Big Sis Yao not leave me?\u201d Yue Ying raised his head, and looked at her with eyes of expectations.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Crap, she actually forgotten that he still had mother complex.</p><br/><p>This problem\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, you have grown up.\u201d It\u2019s time for you to be independent.</p><br/><p>His expression sank, and in the next moment, a dark light flashed from his body. The matured young man earlier, had instantly turned into a little wimp of five to six years old. \u201cWill this do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>His face was instantly filled with loss. \u201cThen what should I do so that Big Sis Yao will not abandon Yue Ying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d In reality, she was immediately about to abandon him once more. The expiry date of her current character was approaching very soon. \u201cI will be back. Before that, you have to obediently stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister is going to leave?\u201d Yue Ying was anxious, with merely a slight movement of his body, the surrounding runes shattered apart, as he flew straight towards her. Those concentrated layers of seals were like scraps of paper, completely unable to stop his advance.</p><br/><p>Not even a moment later, a little figure that was merely at her waist height hugged onto her. Unlike the frail little figure when he was young, the current him was like a meaty little ball, as he said with tears in his eyes. \u201cBig sister, don\u2019t abandon Yue Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, how cunning for him to act cute right now.</p><br/><p>However, if this matter wasn\u2019t dealt with properly, only heavens would know just what Yue Ying would do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, my injuries are not completely healed yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>His face paled, and his little head buried even deeper. \u201cThen I will find someone else that can definitely heal big sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\u2026\u201d She had initially wanted to tell him that she would be fine. However, a moment later, she changed her mind. Lowering her head, she looked at Yue Ying in front of her, and said with a sunken tone. \u201cOne must receive punishment for his wrongdoings! I have already told you big sister shoulders some responsibility for the things you did as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, she could feel the figure in his embrace stiffen for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I promise you, I will definitely come back.\u201d She wanted to imprint a suggestion in his heart. A suggestion where whatever wrongdoings he do would come to bite her as retribution. She knew that doing it this way was a little despicable, as she was using his concern for her. However, she couldn\u2019t think of any other way to prevent him from doing anything that she couldn\u2019t predict during the period she was switching her characters.</p><br/><p>In the end, Yue Ying promised her, and stayed in the seal until her return.</p><br/><p>In the next few days, her body grew even weaker. The feeling of having exhausted her entire strength merely by walking a few steps, made her feel extremely dispirited. However, she still had yet to find the reason for her return to this character. She constantly recalled the scenario she saw in the precognitive dream. Presently, Xu Nuoyan was dead, and Mo Xianxian no longer had the dimensional space. Theoretically speaking, the bug should have already been dealt with, and Fluorescent Wind Sect would not be destroyed. It was impossible for those phoenixes to come to the Divine Realm as well.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao just couldn\u2019t understand it. It looked like her body was nearing its end, but for some reasons, it felt as though there was some energy sustaining her, preventing her falling into that final step. Two days later, she no longer had the energy to even walk.</p><br/><p>Her master carried her to the stone stool outside to get some sun. She leaned onto her master, and heard his heartbeats. She felt like doing a little something, but she did not have the energy to move. The two of them were silent the entire time.</p><br/><p>A despondent feeling surged from the depths of her heart. In the past, all of her characters had enjoyed quick deaths, so she had never experienced any emotions of fear or whatsoever. This time, watching her master\u2019s expressions which grew even more solemn by the day, she suddenly felt a little afraid. Thoughts of what would she do if she couldn\u2019t resurrect this time rose in her mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

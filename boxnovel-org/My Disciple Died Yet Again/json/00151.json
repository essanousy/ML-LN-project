As expected, he was not going to help her? That\u2019s true. Just how many people had simple backgrounds among those who deities who ascended? How could someone extend his kind hands because of a few words from her? It was already a rare event for him to save her life. She heaved a sigh, and just when she was about to give up\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud crash could be heard from the door. A human figure was thrown into the room. He fell on the ground, and painfully rolled about.</p><br/><p>Mo Xianxian was startled, and she then took a closer look. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d It was actually that spiritual monster which molested her before. Back then, she was injured, and adding that she wanted to find out who was the person behind all this, she pretended to be captured by him. Who would have known that instead of luring out the mastermind, she was saved by a little Deity who passed by?</p><br/><p>Why would senior know this person, and even bring him here? Could it be in order to help her? A slight bitter yet joyful intent flashed past Mo Xianxian\u2019s eyes. It seemed like that senior was not completely heartless.</p><br/><p>As expected, those who are capable of acting would usually supplement themselves with imaginative information in their own minds. When Zhu Yao went out, she simply realized that Goudan was sleeping by the door. Hence, she casually gave him a kick\u2026</p><br/><p>She had to admit, the cold and mighty expression package was really useful. Earlier, she was even wondering how she should make the female Deity speak about the information regarding the people chasing after her, so that she could deduce who the person that appeared in the Lightning Divine Hall was. She never expected that, without even uttering a single word, that woman would clearly inform her of the entire situation just like that.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder her master often carried a cold expression, and it was no wonder the Hall Master would use such a cold and mighty business-like expression as well. Mn\u2026 Next time, let\u2019s try tilting her face forty-five degrees towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Right now, the most important matter at hand was to find the key figure You Ran, and find out just who he had offended, which caused his wife to be chased after by knifes the moment she ascended. However, if Mo Xianxian were to be brought along on their journey, putting aside the fact that Zhu Yao herself was merely an average Profound Deity who could be instantly killed off by an above average Gold Deity, that Dog-Egg couldn\u2019t even be considered a deity. Bringing along these two people at the same time, forget about protecting them, she herself would be dragged into the mess as well.</p><br/><p>Though, Zhu Yao really wondered how Mo Xianxian recognized her as someone reliable. Could it be from looking at her face? As expected, the cold and mighty mask was overpowered.</p><br/><p>She had looked at the face she had after changing into a man. It was very familiar, because\u2026 it looked exactly the same as the past \u201cSoi Sauz\u201d. She felt that this little Realmspirit was just trying to save some trouble, and was lazy to make a completely new face for her. It was no wonder when Mo Xianxian saw her, she looked as though she was looking at a stranger. There wasn\u2019t even the slightest of similarity between her male and female forms.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was worrying how she was going to protect Mo Xianxian, who knew that on the second day, she actually brought up the topic of disbanding on her own.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have thought it through. I do not have any foundations in the Higher Realm. If there\u2019s really someone who really wishes to put me in my deathbed, then, no matter where I run, it will be useless.\u201d Mo Xianxian\u2019s expression was exceptionally firm. She had long kept that gentle and frail expression of hers, as though she knew that it was useless against Zhu Yao. \u201cSo, I wish to first get accepted into the Advent Cloud Hall of the East, before looking for my husband again. With the protection of a Sect, even if the people in the dark wish to act against me, they would still be a little opposed to the idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was indeed a good plan. In the four continents of the Divine Realm, the Advent Cloud Hall of the East was the strongest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, senior, for your saving grace.\u201d Mo Xianxian gave her a heavy and solid bow, yet, she no longer gave any comments of repaying Zhu Yao or whatsoever. \u201cThis little deity shall take her leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded. Thus, Mo Xianxian turned around, summoned her divine sword, and rose into the air.</p><br/><p>Though, Goudan on the side, was looking at the beautiful woman gradually moving away with teary eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop looking. Even if you look, she still won\u2019t be yours.\u201d Zhu Yao raised her hand, and gave a slap to his head. \u201cThat person is already married. Didn\u2019t you hear that she\u2019s going to find her own husband?\u201d She really didn\u2019t know how he heard \u201cfinding her own husband\u201d, into \u201cfinding a practitioner-pair partner\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d With a pair of teary eyes that was about to pour out, Goudan sniffled. \u201cI really like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Yo, you actually found true love from playing the ruffian?</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. Boss will introduce you to more beautiful girls in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Goudan\u2019s eyes shone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Zhu Yao patted on her chest to guarantee it. \u201cI guarantee that every single one of them is more beautiful than her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, my standards aren\u2019t high.\u201d Goudan scratched his head, and chuckled. \u201cAs long as\u2026 she\u2019s a little prettier than boss, I\u2019m fine with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell.\u201d Zhu Yao sent him a kick. Just stay single till you\u2019re dead.</p><br/><p>A broken-hearted man would not listen to reasons. Ever since Mo Xianxian left, Goudan had been severely depressed, letting huge sighs in front of Zhu Yao every single day.</p><br/><p>After taking a step, \u201cHaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking another step, \u201cHaaaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After continuing with another step, \u201cHaaaaaaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaaaaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Zhu Yao was so irritated to the extent she wanted to flip a table. In the past, why didn\u2019t she feel that other than being stupid, Goudan was so irritating as well? If it wasn\u2019t because of the fact that she couldn\u2019t be too far away from him, she definitely would have sent him to Mars. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just looking for Mo Xianxian? We will head out now, is that enough?\u201d A broken-hearted man really couldn\u2019t be reasoned with.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d After a jolt, Dog-Egg squatted in front of her, all that was missing was a woof.</p><br/><p>With itchy hands, Zhu Yao sent a slap towards him. \u201cSo? Aren\u2019t you going to lead the way?\u201d She didn\u2019t know which way it was to the Advent Cloud Hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Instantly, Goudan exited the door joyfully, and flew at the front.</p><br/><p>Flying on her sword, Zhu Yao slowly followed behind. She had planned on following Mo Xianxian to Advent Cloud Hall in the first place. Her master and Sesame were still trapped in the dimensional space, if she could find the person who assaulted them at Lightning Divine Hall back then, then there was a possibility of getting them out sooner. Right now, all the clues were leading up to Mo Xianxian, so it was natural for Zhu Yao to follow after her.</p><br/><p>However, she could not openly head over together, as it would be easily exposed then. After all, the enemy was hiding in the dark, while she was out in the open. It would be bad to beat the grass and frighten away the snake. Hence, she wanted to wait for a few days on purpose. However, Dog-Egg, this piggish teammate, was simply too irritating.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she warned him yesterday not to disclose the fact that she was the female Deity who saved Mo Xianxian in the forest back then. The two of them flew towards the east for exactly half a day, yet, they were still unable to see even the shadow of Advent Cloud Hall. Goudan however, suddenly made a turn, and instead flew towards the western direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say the Advent Cloud Hall is in the east?\u201d Why the sudden change in direction?</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, it seems you\u2019re unaware of this.\u201d Goudan explained. \u201cThe Advent Cloud Hall controls the entire eastern continent, and their disciples are everywhere. If one wishes to enter the Sect, there\u2019s a need to first register at the various provinces. After passing the tests could one then enter the Advent Cloud Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem to know a lot, huh?\u201d Zhu Yao looked at him with narrowed eyes. What happened to only gaining a human form just recently?</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh. Little sister Xianxian said she wanted to head to Advent Cloud Hall, so I have been inquiring about it in the Divine City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yo, you\u2019re even calling her by her given name now?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have even heard that these provinces are situated on lands where the heavenly doors open when the cultivators from the small worlds of the Lower Realm ascends. As long as they\u2019re human practitioners who ascended into Deities, most of them will choose to enter the Advent Cloud Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>So these provinces were all merely set-up to conveniently pull in talented people.</p><br/><p>Goudan then gave her a few more basic knowledge about the Divine Realm. Only now did Zhu Yao know that other than the forces of the four different continents, there was the Scatter Alas Court, which was entirely created by wandering Deities who were unwilling to join any faction. This was also the reason why there were five groups of people representing the various factions back then at Lightning Divine Hall.</p><br/><p>The Scatter Alas Court did not have much restrictions placed on their disciples. Seemingly every single one of them was left to their own devices, and people would only occasionally appear when there were important matters. They were like the wandering practitioners in the Lower Realm, however, the wandering practitioners in the Lower Realm completely did not belong to any organizations or regulations. The Scatter Alas Court simply had an additional binding force from a pledge.</p><br/><p>And in the entire Divine Realm, other than the human practitioners who ascended from the Lower Realm, there were various spiritual monsters which awakened their spiritual consciousness. Like Goudan, and Mushmush.</p><br/><p>Because the Divine Realm was filled with divine energy at every single corner, it was extremely easy for the objects of Divine Realm to be affected by the divine energy and awaken their spiritual consciousness. As long as they had awakened their spiritual consciousness, they would have the qualifications to cultivate. After a spiritual monster\u2019s cultivation improved, they did not have to suffer the agony of the lightning tribulations. However, the cultivation of spiritual monsters was extremely difficult, and they require an extremely long span of time to do so.</p><br/><p>Especially for most spiritual monsters, due to the pre-awakening of their spiritual consciousness, their wisdom and thought processes could not be compared to the human practitioners who had lived for several thousand years in the Lower Realm. Due to these deficiencies, even if their level of cultivation was raised astronomically, they still wouldn\u2019t be a match for the human practitioners. It was extremely common for spiritual monsters to awaken their spiritual consciousness in the Higher Realm, and their numbers were usually double of the human practitioners. Hence, spiritual monsters were even less worth. Just like the pumpkin, watermelon, and sugarcane building that filled the Divine City which she saw earlier, actually, all of them were the true bodies of spiritual monsters which had long awakened their spiritual consciousness. When Zhu Yao recalled that she had actually once stayed in the stomach of a spiritual monster, she instantly felt a little uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>All of the human practitioners and spiritual monsters in the Divine Realm reside on the four great continents, but there were still other places other than the four continents. Away from the continents, was the Spirit Virtual Continent. The amount of surface covered by that place was larger than the four great continents in overall size. The reason why that was place was even more unbelievable, was because it was the territory of demonic immortals.</p><br/><p>The so-called demonic immortals, were demonic beasts of the Lower Realm which broke through into the tenth rank, underwent the lightning tribulation and ascended. The strength of demonic beasts were stronger than human practitioners in the first place, and to be capable of ascending in the Higher Realm, they would be even sturdier to a certain degree. Even the demonic immortals which had only just ascended to the Higher Realm, possessed might stronger than a Profound Deity.</p><br/><p>The human practitioners and demonic beasts were in a state of endless opposition in the Lower Realm, and the situation wasn\u2019t any better in the Higher Realm. However, the human practitioners possessed the upper hand in the Lower Realm, while in the Divine Realm, evidently, the might of the demonic immortals was stronger. Although the two were separated by land, there would occasionally be slight conflicts. With the addition of spiritual monsters, the human practitioners had the upper hand in numbers, but the demonic immortals had the upper hand in terms of strength.</p><br/><p>Today, I will stab you. I will give you a slash tomorrow then. Such conflicts continued endlessly.</p><br/><p>Simply by walking through the city, Zhu Yao heard of several spiritual monsters and deities speaking about matters regarding the demonic immortals. Every single one of them was gnashing their teeth, and had expressions that looked as though they wanted to give them a thrashing so badly. However, without any exceptions, the divine practitioners were unable to gain any advantages over them.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the relationship between the two sides were really bad.</p><br/><p>However, all of them had the same enemy to fight against now, so why were the four great continents not working together to against it, and were instead fighting among themselves?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, who were once a beast, curled her lips with thoughts of returning into the dimensional space to let out some fumes at the demonic immortal Sesame. You guys can stop challenging the divine practitioners now, in any case, just by them fighting among themselves, most probably, it would all end too.</p><br/><p>The province Goudan chose was very lively. It was said that there were several heavenly doors from dozens of small worlds all congregated here. Hence, the streets were filled with people. They finally managed to arrive at the registration point, only to realize that the place was filled with various types of\u2026</p><br/><p>Vegetables!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. There were radishes, cabbages, and even a green onion queuing in front of them at the registration point.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not even regain her senses for a long while. With a single glance, what filled her vision were various types of spiritual monsters. The only ones which kept their human forms were just Zhu Yao and Goudan. She suddenly had the feeling that she had been transported into the world of Plants vs Zombies. The two of them were zombies, and the ground was filled with plants. Would a pea be shot out from somewhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey, little lady.\u201d Someone patted on her shoulder. When Zhu Yao turned around to look, she saw a gigantic\u2026 peapod. Zhu Yao reflexively took a step back. It wouldn\u2019t actually spew out peas at her, right?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What\u2019s your name? Let\u2019s become friends, yo. I\u2019m Ying Luo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did Zhu Yao feel like she was an honest and naive lady being teased? \u201cAuntie, it won\u2019t work out!\u201d She was straight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d The girl Ying Luo blanked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a few steps forward, and cast an art to restore the formation on the pond back to its original look. Then, she took out an advanced grade substitute talisman, and pulled the girl\u2019s hand over. \u201cLet me borrow your hand.\u201d A white light flashed at the tip of her finger, instantly slicing a thin line of blood on her hand, and then had it drip a drop of her blood onto the talisman.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d The girl breathed in. She did not resist, and was instead looking at her actions with a curious expression.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao threw the talisman towards the pond, and it instantly activated. A red light flashed, and that talisman paper instantly materialized into the girl\u2019s appearance as it laid above the pond with closed eyes like she was before. The severed chains earlier, as though they had been revived, heavily wrapped around that girl once again.</p><br/><p>This substitute talisman was something she had long prepared, and she had planned to use it to deceive everyone once the girl were to awaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~~\u201d ( \u2299 o \u2299 )</p><br/><p>The girl exclaimed out, as she looked at Zhu Yao\u2019s actions with sparkling eyes. \u201cNot bad, you\u2019re actually this incredible? Oh right, what\u2019s your level of cultivation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned around to glance at her, and just as she was about to answer.</p><br/><p>The girl patted on Zhu Yao\u2019s shoulders, and supplemented with a prideful look. \u201cOh, right. I was a Nascent Soul practitioner before, but because my soul has left my body for too long, my cultivation is just at the Foundation stage right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemigod.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy cultivation is at the Demigod stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl slipped, kneeling onto the ground with a \u201cpachi\u201d sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirly, come here. Let\u2019s talk about life.\u201d Zhu Yao waved her over.</p><br/><p>The girl instantly turned submissive, as she looked at Zhu Yao with an embarrassed look.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 Sovereign. Thank you very much for saving me, Sovereign.\u201d She respectfully bowed in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, your character has already been exposed.\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Acting all respectful now was a little too late, wasn\u2019t it? She pulled the girly to the side and squatted down, activating her \u2018intimate big sister\u2019 mode. \u201cI know you\u2019re Ying Luo who sealed the Devil. I just wish to ask what plans do you have from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a disciple of Forgotten God Palace, so naturally, I will return to the sect.\u201d The girl said with a matter-of-fact look, and she continued with a smile. \u201cAfter all, that place is my home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any qualms about you returning to Forgotten God Palace, but you can\u2019t use your identity as Ying Luo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She looked confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl.\u201d Zhu Yao patted on her shoulders, and said with a heavy heart. \u201cIt has already been nine hundred over years. The impression people of the world have on you, is someone who has long perished together with the sealed Devil. If you reappear now, what do you think others will think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl was startled, and then her eyes fiercely widened. \u201cBut the Devil\u2019s seal isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know the seal isn\u2019t broken.\u201d Zhu Yao looked straight at her. \u201cBut will others believe that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The girl went silent. She was not stupid, so she naturally understood what Zhu Yao was trying to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must know that fear is a very terrifying emotion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl sank into silence for a moment, before letting out a deep sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re very right. I indeed cannot return to my past identity.\u201d Raising her head, she looked at the incarnation above the pond that looked exactly the same as her. \u201cThen, Sovereign, what do you think I should do?\u201d Naturally, she was able to guess that everything this Sovereign had done, was in order to help her conceal her identity. However, she just could not figure out why she wanted to help her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to suspect me, I naturally have my own reasons for doing this.\u201d Zhu Yao pulled out the fan she obtained from Illusory Realm Island, and opened the leaf of the fan, revealing the faintly drifting devilish energy within it. \u201cYou should be able to recognize this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is!\u201d Ying Luo was stunned. Wasn\u2019t this a mystic artifact she used to seal the Devil? Why was it in her hands?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned her head, and looked at her with a stern expression. \u201cIf I say I\u2019m a God, would you believe me?\u201d She had long figured out a good excuse.</p><br/><p>She was startled for a moment, and then she fiercely widened her eyes. She sized Zhu Yao up with a look of disbelief, and could not help but reach out her hand to touch Zhu Yao\u2019s forehead. \u201cSovereign, you\u2019re not sick, right!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious here!\u201d She instantly slapped away her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign, I don\u2019t cultivate much, don\u2019t lie to me. A true God wields the sealing arts. If you can wield them, back then, there wouldn\u2019t be a need for me to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could even finish, Zhu Yao flipped her hand. A golden imprint surfaced on the leaf of the fan, and the devilish energy which was still flowing about the fan earlier, was instantly dispelled completely. Even the black leaf had instantly reverted back to white, returning to the look of a regular mystic artifact.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour esteemed mom, you really can wield them!\u201d Ying Luo was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>Can you please remove the profanities when praising people?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have merely restored the seal on this fan to perfection.\u201d Zhu Yao continued to dupe her. \u201cTo tell you the truth, the reason why I\u2019m helping you is to simply locate all of the five mystic artifacts. I have a way to deal with this Devil once and for all. As long as the Devil is dealt with, you will be able to openly appear in front of everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked at the leaf of the fan, and then glanced at Zhu Yao. After pondering for a long while, she gritted her teeth and slammed her hands onto Zhu Yao\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAlright, big sis. This old lady shall work under you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did she feel as if she had established a mafia? This was definitely her imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will find the mystic artifacts myself, you just have to be careful not to be discovered by people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl smiled. \u201cThis matter concerns me after all, so how can I possibly let you go alone? Don\u2019t persuade me. No matter what, I will have to put in some work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why did she feel as though a troll had stuck onto her?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stuck a concealment talisman onto the girl, and since she was passing by Sword Seeking Peak to retrieve the Metal Spirit, she gathered some materials there, and stopped the chaos of the spiritual swords. She then openly returned to Forgotten God Palace, and then cooped herself in the artifact refining chamber, spending three whole days to refine a bracelet to conceal the girl\u2019s former appearance.</p><br/><p>After she wore it, she immediately sprinted next to a pond. Reflected in the water was a girl around twenty years old, and the face was not as soul enchanting beautiful as it was before, but it could still be considered pleasant-looking. Her height was a little shorter than before, and her line of sight shifted downwards, stopping at the chest which did not experience the slightest of change. Then, she forcefully raised her head and looked at Zhu Yao\u2019s, before satisfyingly retracted her gaze.</p><br/><p>Momma\u2019s egg, why the hell am I feeling so irritated?</p><br/><p>Just as she got out of the artifact refining chamber, she bumped into Wen Yu who had an excited look on his face. \u201cOld Ancestor, you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>His face immediately sank right after. \u201cOld Ancestor, the new batch of disciples is about to step foot onto the mountain. Why don\u2019t you take in a disciple for fun, before leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell was \u2018for fun\u2019? Zhu Yao pulled over Ying Luo by her side as shield. \u201cI have already taken in a disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaahh!?\u201d Wen Yu was dumbfounded. He sized Ying Luo up from head to toe. \u201cShe\u2026 She is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ying\u2026\u201d The girl who was casual with anyone stepped forward, and just as she was about to speak up, Zhu Yao immediately covered her lips, and the words she uttered out instantly changed. \u201cYingyingying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Ancestor?\u201d Wen Yu looked at the two people back and forth, unable to understand the situation for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, she\u2019s called Ying Yingying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The corner of Wen Yu\u2019s lips twitched. Yin Yinying? Such a strange name.</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, Wen Yu!\u201d Zhu Yao patted on his shoulders, and said with a heavy tone. \u201cThis disciple of mine, you see, is someone I picked out after many difficulties. Putting aside her having great aptitude, achieving the level of a Demigod in the future is not even a problem for her.\u201d Wen Yu\u2019s eyes instantly shone. \u201cI have decided to raise her up with meticulous guidance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll shall go according to Old Ancestor\u2019s words.\u201d He hurriedly nodded, carrying an excited look. So the reason why the Old Ancestor left the previous time, was in order to select a disciple for the sect. He\u2019s so moved right now, what should he do?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too are aware that I\u2019m a wandering practitioner in the past, so the cultivation techniques I learnt are different. That\u2019s why, in order to raise a good disciple, I need to bring her out to gain some experience.\u201d Zhu Yao continued to dupe.</p><br/><p>Wen Yu immediately took a step back, no longer stopping the two of them. He even wished that she could immediately head out, and then return with two Demigods. \u201cOld Ancestor, may your journey be smooth-sailing.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Zhu Yao was no longer in a hurry to leave, as she said with a complicated expression. \u201cThe matters of cultivation have always been difficult. Opportunities, aptitude, and luck, not a single one of these must be lacking, I believe we will encounter several difficulties in this journey. Furthermore, I was a wandering practitioner in the past, so I\u2019m afraid the amount of properties I have\u2026 would prove to be a great inconvenience.\u201d So give me some wages, hey?</p><br/><p>Not even following up a single word, Wen Yu took out the storage pouch next to him and shoved it towards her. \u201cOld Ancestor, feel free to leave with this, I shall handle everything in the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will leave it to you, Palace Master Wen.\u201d Her face was filled with seriousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn!\u201d Wen Yu heavily nodded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pulled onto the girl Ying Luo, rode on her sword, and fled.</p><br/><p>They were heading straight towards the west. As Zhu Yao controlled the sword, she pulled out a spiritual sword and passed it to her. \u201cHold onto this. This is something I refined at the side while refining that bracelet of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Luo was stunned for a moment. Then, after finally regaining her senses, she received it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned to glance at her, and nudged. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Why did she suddenly become so quiet? She was really not used to this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWen Yu, is the Palace Master of Forgotten God Palace?\u201d She suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 What about the former Palace Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that just unnecessary talk?\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at her. \u201cNaturally, either that person has ascended, or is already dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDead\u2026\u201d Ying Luo frowned, and only after a long while did she let out a deep sigh. \u201cSo she is already dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. Looking at the girl\u2019s relieved expression, she suddenly recalled that in the scenario, the girl seemed to be the biological younger sister of the Forgotten God Palace Master. Though it was said that familial love between people were cultivating into deities was shallow, this girl was a good, proper young lady after all. She finally managed to awaken, yet her only relative had already passed away. Her letting out a sigh was something Zhu Yao could understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where\u2019s the next mystic artifact is located?\u201d Zhu Yao diverted the subject. She had only heard that it was in the west, but she was uncertain of the concrete location.</p><br/><p>The girl did not stay depressed for a long while, and had instead instantly recovered. \u201cIf I did not guess wrong, it should be with the Heavenly Feather Race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Feather Race?\u201d What\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Feather Race lives within a barrier located at the west of the continent. Rumours say that they are descendants of the Phoenix God-beasts, bearing feathers the moment of their births, and had the power to soar towards the Nine Heavens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Descendants of phoenixes? Why were descendants everywhere in this world? Was it really alright to be this chaotic?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Feather Race always have terrible temper, and they are not at comfortable terms with human practitioners. If we break into their place like this, we will definitely be attacked by their crowd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say that earlier!?\u201d It would have been good if she had done some preparations.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask either!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Could she return this stupid person back to the sacred pond?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d She suddenly called out.</p><br/><p>A gigantic continental land suddenly appeared in the air, and it was impossible to see the other end with a single glance. It was floating as if it was a city in the sky. They immediately stepped onto that piece of land. Before they could even walk a few steps out, they were blocked by a transparent barrier and could not push forward.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao walked back and forth next to it several times, yet, she was still unable to discern just what kind of formation it was. For a moment, the two of them did not have any ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we forcefully break through it, it will definitely be sensed by other people.\u201d The girl pondered for a moment, before suggesting. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we directly used a defense related mystic artifact, converge it with one of the defensive formations placed on the barrier, and then make use of the idle time while the formation attempts to link with the artifact, to charge right through it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying, we should make use of the opportunity from converging in the mystic artifact, to forcefully add another formation core into the barrier?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl nodded. \u201cIf it\u2019s just a defense related mystic artifact and not an offensive one, it would not be sensed by anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA good plan.\u201d Zhu Yao stretched out her thumb and praised her. \u201cBut\u2026 I don\u2019t have any defensive mystic artifacts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you receive a storage pouch from Wen Yu earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh right, she had forgotten she received her wages. She hurriedly took out that pouch, and pulled out every single object.</p><br/><p>Spirit stones \u2013 Mn, I don\u2019t have a use for them right now.</p><br/><p>Medicinal pellets \u2013 Mn, these can be given to the girly for life-saving purposes.</p><br/><p>Talismans \u2013 Intermediate grade talismans, not much use. Let\u2019s give them to the girly as well.</p><br/><p>Fourth rank flying mystic artifact \u2013 Spiritual sword, low grade.</p><br/><p>Fifth rank defensive mystic artifact \u2013 A dudou1!!!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Luo: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wen Yu\u2019s taste, was a little intense, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh\u2026\u201d The girl Ying Luo took that bright red cloth, and said with a stern look. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t belong to him. Look, the mark embroidered on the dudou doesn\u2019t belong to Forgotten God Palace, it definitely belongs to some other female practitioner\u2026\u201d When she was halfway through her explanation, she stopped, and her expression carried even wider cringe than earlier.</p><br/><p>If it did not belong to him, it\u2019s even worse, alright? If it did not belong to him, then who could it belong to? Did a female practitioner give it to him? Or did he snatch it from someone else? A piece of clothing like this that sticks close to one\u2019s body, just how did he snatch it? And just what were the basic principles behind the method to do so?</p><br/><p>What should she do? The hole in her brain was too huge, no matter how she tried to fill it in, it was not enough.</p><br/><p>She never expected that even given Wen Yu\u2019s age, he was still following the trends!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we, take a look at what else is there inside?\u201d Zhu Yao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes instantly shone, activating her gossip mode.</p><br/><p>The two of them overturned the storage pouch with excited looks. Unfortunately, other than a few low rank spiritual swords, and a few sets of male mystic robes, there were no other unknown objects.</p><br/><p>Haah\u2026</p><br/><p>The two sighed at the same time. Such a pity. (Wen Yu: \u2026)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s use this then.\u201d Zhu Yao picked up the dudou, and placed it at the side. Circulating her spiritual energy, she activated the defensive formation within, and then guided the formation towards the barrier. With a flash of bright light, A round, light image with the height of a man suddenly appeared on the transparent barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Zhu Yao shouted, and along with Ying Luo, charged into it.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the barrier had already been restored to normal. Though, above the transparent barrier, there was now an additional dudou fluttering in the air.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u2026</p><br/><p>Ying Luo: \u2026</p><br/><p>Mn, hopefully, Wen Yu won\u2019t feel that depressed.</p><br/><p>Dudou: An ancient Chinese undergarment. Usually bright red in colour. For more info, click here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudou</p><br/>\n</div>"}

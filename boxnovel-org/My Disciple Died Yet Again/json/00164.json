Any pain? Any headaches?\u201d The woman endlessly said comforting words, as she inspected Zhu Yao from head to toe.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Zhu Yao pressed her hand down. She had a faint guess of what was going on, and she could not help but ask. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m your mother.\u201d Her tears were flowing even more happily, as she stroked her face, and cried till she ran out of breath. \u201cYou\u2019re my daughter, my precious daughter. Your mother, I, has yearned for so many years, and you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour name is?\u201d Unwilling to give up, Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have taken up my surname since young. My name is Yin Shi, and you\u2019re called Yin Xin.\u201d</p><br/><p>And she\u2019s exactly the cannon fodder villainess that did not even have the chance to appear on stage! Flips table. Why did the resurrection this time carry its own scenario as well!? For a moment, Zhu Yao felt her brain aching, she could not help but press on her own head.</p><br/><p>This action, however, had frightened Yin Shi, causing her to even forget her tears. \u201cXin\u2019er, what\u2019s wrong? Is your head hurting? Come, don\u2019t move. Let your mother here take a look.\u201d As she said that, she gathered a strand of divine sense, and was about to enter Zhu Yao\u2019s to inspect it. Zhu Yao instantly felt a strange sensation, as she slid her body to the side and dodged it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Looking at her disappointed look, Zhu Yao instantly felt a little anxious. This situation where she was in the scenario itself was something she had never encountered before. And, looking at the upcoming events she saw in her precognitive dream, this Yin Shi was not a simple character, so her being able to see through Zhu Yao\u2019s thoughts would definitely be a matter of time. So, why not speak for herself now? \u201cListen to me, I\u2019m actually not your daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Shi blanked, and she looked at her dumbfoundedly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao decided that she might as well expose everything now. \u201cI basically don\u2019t recognize you? I found myself here the moment I woke up. In regards to matters before this, I do not have a single clue either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Shi did not reply, she simply looked straight at her for a moment. The tears which managed to stop earlier, began pouring out once again, as she muttered out. \u201cXin\u2019er\u2026 My poor Xin\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d Zhu Yao anxiously explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to your daughter, and I have never seen her before. I was here the moment I woke up.\u201d So, please absolutely do not think that I took over her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you kn\u2026 Eh?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled, her eyes greatly widened. \u201cYou know!?\u201d This was illogical, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Though, with a heart-aching look, Yin Shi said. \u201cXin\u2019er. I know that currently, you will not recognize me as your mother. But, it doesn\u2019t matter. Mother will wait for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was there a mistake with how she expressed it? She wasn\u2019t trying to recognize her as her mother! \u201cI\u2019m really not you daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mother understands. Your mother really understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>What do you understand, hey? Don\u2019t look as though you know everything, alright?</p><br/><p>Yin Shi once again stroked her head. \u201cMy daughter has such a hard life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not\u2026\u201d I\u2019m surrendering myself over here, hey. Please be serious a little!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have been in a coma ever since you\u2019re young, and have only just woken up. Your mother understands that you\u2019re unable to accept everything in such a short time.\u201d Yin Shi then began to start the hidden event all on her own.</p><br/><p>\u201cComa?\u201d Zhu Yao blanked, as she caught onto this key term.</p><br/><p>Yin Shi nodded. \u201cWhen I was pregnant with you back then, coincidentally, it was my time of ascension. Back then, your mother didn\u2019t know of your existence, and had only found out after ascending to the Higher Realm. However, due the influence from the lightning tribulation, I was unable to sense your presence in my womb, and I didn\u2019t expect that you would still be safely given birth to. But, ever since you were born, you have stayed in a coma. Your mother has yearned for so many years\u2026\u201d As she said all of these, she could not help but begin to cry again.</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s the case. It was no wonder she would accept the fact that Zhu Yao did not recognize her so easily. However, she was after all not Yin Xin. Even if she had been in a coma ever since, and had just woken up, it was impossible for her to actually act so natural, right? Zhu Yao felt that there was a need to explain this point.</p><br/><p>Who would have known that this newly appointed cheap mother, didn\u2019t actually mind at all, and had even put up a prideful look as she said. \u201cAs expected of my daughter, who is the only deity-born in the Divine Realm, to be so intelligent the moment she wakes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not the problem you should be mindful of, right!? Zhu Yao mentally collapsed. Hence, she spent an entire hour, used various types of worldviews and perspectives, explaining to her the truth about the impossibility of Zhu Yao being her daughter. However, no matter how she explained, Yin Shi simply looked at her with a teary smile from the start till the end. Her face was filled with the \u2018as expected of my daughter, even after sleeping for so many years, she actually knows so many things\u2019 look. Zhu Yao instantly felt a deep sense of powerlessness, and felt that she might as well self-destruct her character now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Zhu Yao, not your daughter Yin Xin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhu Yao?\u201d The cheap mother\u2019s expression only then made a slight change. Her beautiful brows slightly furrowed, as she said with a worried look. \u201cXin\u2019er, even if you don\u2019t like your current name, your mother has no qualms about changing it. But, you can\u2019t simply change the surname as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Who\u2019s here wanting to change her surname?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must know, the Yin Family is a huge cultivation family in the Lower Realm, and in the Higher Realm, the Yin Family is even controlling a huge continent. Changing to another surname, would simply be a great disrespect to our ancestors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, your mother here had discussed this matter with your father for a very long time, before we decided to have you take on my surname.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, if you really wish to have the surname \u2018Zhu\u2019, then your mother here will think of a way, to have mine changed along with yours as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Is it really alright to spoil your daughter so much? Aren\u2019t you afraid I might grow in a wrong direction?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the name \u2018Yao\u2019, is simply too terrible. Why don\u2019t I change it for you? What about Zhu Xin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, Xin\u2019er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath. Grabbing onto her hand, she completely gave up her resistance. \u201cMother, you\u2019re my biological mother! I\u2019m Yin Xin!\u201d I shall admit it, alright?</p><br/><p>Yin Shi\u2019s eyes shone, and instantly hugged Zhu Yao. Dear, your baby has woken up.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt like crying. Dear dad and mom in the modern era, I\u2019m so sorry.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao didn\u2019t know just how resilient the character setting Realmspirit had given her. Even if she wanted to expose herself, she was still taken as Yin Shi\u2019s daughter. She suddenly recalled the time she first transported to this world, she had met a similar situation. She had clearly transported with her entire body intact, and before she came, there had never been such a person in the village before.</p><br/><p>However, after she transported, everyone possessed memories of her, memories that had already been well set. No matter how she explained, no one believed her, instead, people believed that there were problems with her brain. Zhu Yao was becoming even more curious about Realmspirit\u2019s identity. Just how much power must one possess to be capable of changing the memories of so many people at once?</p><br/><p>Currently, this Yin Xin\u2019s situation was similar. The only difference was, at the Zhu Village, she was someone who suddenly popped out, while Yin Xin was a character who existed in the first place.</p><br/><p>However, just where did the true Yin Xin head off to? According to the description in the precognitive dream, she shouldn\u2019t have woken up till her death. However, even if that\u2019s the case, Yin Xin was after all still an actual person. For her to occupy her body like this, gave a feeling of stealing someone else\u2019s opportunity to live.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shook her head. She decided that she would find an opportunity to question Realmspirit about Yin Xin\u2019s whereabouts.</p><br/><p>She carefully recalled the bug this time. Undoubtedly, it was a crime of murder brought about by a corpse (hers). Everything was caused by that dimensional space of hers. Mo Xianxian killed Tao Manfeng and obtained the dimensional space, then, she leveled up to take revenge against the Fluorescent Wind Sect.</p><br/><p>However, at the end, why did the ancient god-beasts, the phoenixes, want to turn the entire Divine Realm into a sea of flames? She was unable to comprehend it. Realmspirit said that the Gods and Devils would resurface in the Three Realms, so it was very natural for those phoenixes to appear. If there would be a link between Mo Xianxian and the Divine Realm being destroyed, then that could only be the matter of taking revenge against the Fluorescent Wind Sect.</p><br/><p>When Mo Xianxian destroyed the Fluorescent Wind Sect, she killed all disciples with the surname \u2018Yin\u2019. And, she had even destroyed a large half of the Fluorescent Wind Sect. Could it be that there was an item within the Fluorescent Wind Sect that was especially important to the phoenixes, and hence, she had angered them?</p><br/><p>Just what was it? To have the God race be so mindful of it?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not understand. It seemed like she could only slowly find out from this day forth.</p><br/><p>Right now, the thing she needed to understand was, how far the scenario had progressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother.\u201d Zhu Yao tugged onto Yin Shi, who was still perfectly expressing the deep importance of motherly and daughterly love, next to her. \u201cOther than mother, do I have any other relatives in the Fluorescent Wind Sect? Like a martial brother?\u201d Especially someone with the surname \u2018Xu\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d Seeing that she was interested, naturally, Yin Shi did not hide anything. \u201cThe various Atrium Lords in the Fluorescent Wind Sect are all people from the Yin Family. Oh, you have a senior martial brother named Xu Nuoyan as well. He\u2019s your father\u2019s personal succeeding disciple\u2026 Ah! Look at me, forgetting about this matter because of my excitement.\u201d Yin Shi blanked for a moment, as she looked at her daughter with a little guilt in her eyes. \u201cYour father has betrothed you to him, and today is exactly the day of your practitioner-pair ceremony. Nuoyan is still waiting at the front hall for the procession!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d Zhu Yao leapt out of the bed in an instant. The matter had already progressed to the start of the big war. Could it get even more worse that this?</p><br/><p>\u201cXin\u2019er, back then, you have always been in a coma. So\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t marry him!\u201d Zhu Yao pulled Yin Shi, and charged outside. \u201cLet\u2019s hurry there.\u201d Hopefully, she could still make it in time to alter her fate as a cannon fodder villainess. She simply had to quietly watch as the male and female protagonists fight it out.</p><br/><p>Yin Shi summoned her divine sword, as she explained. \u201cXin\u2019er, I know you have just woken up, so you\u2019re definitely unwilling with such an arrangement. But, Nuoyan is a good child. You will know after interacting with him more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Good child? Zhu Yao looked at her helplessly. This good child of yours, would come back in the future to destroy your entire sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, you said it yourself, I\u2019m already awake now. Since I\u2019m awake, in regards to matters concerning myself, I will decide on them on my own.\u201d She definitely could not marry Xu Nuoyan, no matter was she Yin Xin, or Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin\u2019er\u2026\u201d Yin Shi still wanted to persuade her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, however, interrupted her. \u201cYou said that Xu Nuoyan is a good child, but your daughter has never seen him nor spoke to him before. When he has yet to understand anything about me, he can actually easily make the decision to marry me. To actually decide on an important matter of being practitioner-pair companions so casually, I don\u2019t see how a person like that can have good intentions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yin Shi was speechless. Indeed, the Divine Realm could not be compared to the mortal realm, where the parents\u2019 orders and matchmaking words could determine their children\u2019s lifetime. Deities possessed endless lifespans, and a practitioner-pair companion would truly become a partner of an endless lifetime. Which pair wouldn\u2019t familiarize with each other, acknowledge each other, before deciding to hold the practitioner-pair ceremony? This was not merely because of prudence towards cultivation, but also respect for their respective partners. Something like having their own daughter marrying off to someone else without meeting her partner even once, was rarely seen in the Divine Realm.</p><br/><p>However, back then, her daughter had always been in a comatose state. After taking up the role of the Sect Master, she had been busy with the matters regarding the sect, and hence could not take care of her at every moment. Once, when she brought up this matter to Nuoyan, that child revealed an intention to help take care of her, hence, Yin Shi had the thought of having the two of them become practitioner-pair companions from then on.</p><br/><p>However, now, her daughter had already woken up, and no longer needed someone to take care of her. Having the two of them hold the practitioner-pair ceremony after this, was evidently inappropriate. Hence, she no longer hesitated, and brought her daughter to the great hall.</p><br/><p>The moment Zhu Yao arrived at the entrance of the great hall, she suddenly heard the sounds of battle, and an extremely furious declaration from a woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince my husband is heartless, Xu Nuoyan, I, Mo Xianxian, will sever all connections with you from now on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao anxiously leapt down from the divine sword, charged into the great hall, and shouted. \u201cWait a minute! Let me appear on stage first!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Unfortunately, the place was empty as well. They had already headed over to the Bridge of Judgment by following along the riverbank.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao couldn\u2019t float any longer, and she silently cursed at the practitioner who was on vacation using public expenditure. That practitioner really had nothing better to do, huh? They best not let her encounter him, otherwise\u2026 she couldn\u2019t do anything to him either.</p><br/><p>Ning Yun however did not give up, giving a face that looked as though he wouldn\u2019t stop until he managed to bootlick the practitioner. Moving along the riverbank with the crowd of ghosts, they walked for more than two hours, before they could finally see a bridge that stretched across the entire River of Forgetfulness.</p><br/><p>It was a stone bridge, yet it was constructed with black coloured stones, and when positioned above the silvery white river, it looked exceptionally distinct.</p><br/><p>Before they could even approach it, they were stopped by others. The one leading the other pack was a muscular looking ghost officer, dressed in a black robe with many red flower patterns embroidered on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Yun, you crossed the boundary. This place isn\u2019t your territory.\u201d That person smiled arrogantly, giving a face that looked like he was not going to let them pass.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Lin, you best hurry up and call your boss over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur boss is busy.\u201d That person simply wasn\u2019t going to let up.</p><br/><p>Ning Yun instantly flared up. \u201cYou bunch of lowly men, don\u2019t think I\u2019m unaware of your unhonourable act.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Lin\u2019s expression darkened, giving him a glare. \u201cSo what? That lord said that he simply wanted to take a look at the Bridge of Judgment. He doesn\u2019t want to take a look at your piece of land, what can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ning Yun was extremely furious. \u201cIf you have the guts, let us cross. I shall personally give the lord an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our territory, why should I let you come over?\u201d Ling Lin seemed determined, not only was he not making way, he even called over a few ghost officers over to block the road.</p><br/><p>Fumes blew out of Ning Yun\u2019s head, yet he had no idea on how to deal with this. After all, the Bridge of Judgment was indeed part of the other party\u2019s territory. The two sides entered a stalemate, with neither giving way to the other.</p><br/><p>On this side, the people were anxiously going about in circles, trying to find ways to break through, while on the other side, they were blocking the road perfectly tight. An hour passed, yet there wasn\u2019t any result to be seen.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but lose focus, and was now inspecting that bridge. There were many ghosts next to the bridge. Some were dressed extravagantly, while some were improperly dressed. There were all types of ghosts there, but all of them had hollow looks, without the slightest of sparkles in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao guessed that they were probably the souls of regular mortals. Souls which usually arrive in Underworld, unless they harboured heavy resentment in their former lives, would not have any spiritual consciousness to speak of. The souls of practitioners were usually stronger, so even if they arrived in Underworld, they would still keep part of their former lives\u2019 memories and spirituality, though not a lot.</p><br/><p>Even though they were all ghosts, the ones she saw at the Door to the Underworld was much livelier than the ones here.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao then measured the bridge with her eyes. The bridge itself was really huge, with half of it submerged within the mist. This bridge was the only structure above the River of Forgetfulness. It was called the Bridge of Judgment, and also referred to as the Bridge of Regrets. On the other side of the river was the road to reincarnation.</p><br/><p>She heard from the other ghost officers that only souls which completely did not carry any attachments from their former lives could pass this bridge. Otherwise, they would fall into the River of Forgetfulness, had everything of their former lives cleansed away, before they could reach the other side of the river.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao summarized everything that she learnt. The entire River of Forgetfulness was like a large-sized database reset program, and it even had a forceful nature. Though she was a little curious where this river started from, and where was its end destination?</p><br/><p>\u201cNewcomer, why are you spacing out? Hurry and shout!\u201d Ning Yun suddenly nudged her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Ah?\u201d She came back to her senses and was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a woman, so you have the loudest voice. This mission shall be handed to you.\u201d Ning Yun said with a stern look.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. What? She simply did not hear listen to their conversation earlier. \u201cShout\u2026 What am I supposed to shout?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we can\u2019t go over, we can only lure that lord\u2019s attention over here.\u201d He patted on her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, just shout as loud as you can. If you manage to get him over here, I will note this down as your merit.\u201d</p><br/><p>She understood now!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Zhu Yao patted on her chest. Wasn\u2019t it just shouting at someone? Just leave it to her!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao cleared her throat, got into a proper stance, and loudly shouted. \u201cThe people inside listen up. All of you have already been surrounded. Put down your weapons and surrender. All of you do not have the rights to remain silent, if you do not come out now, this old lady here will smack your buttocks till they bloom.\u201d</p><br/><p>How\u2019s that? Was that tyrannical enough? Eh? Ning Yun, why is your face so black?</p><br/><p>Ning Yun really wanted to cry now. Missy, you\u2019re a spy sent by the other party, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell he would come over if you shout like\u2026 Ehhhh\u2026\u201d He really came!?</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, suddenly, a human figure came charging from the other side. Only a flash of white light could be seen, as though a gust of wind had wildly swept over.</p><br/><p>Even Ling Lin behind them exclaimed in surprise. \u201cLord\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Ning Yun became excited. Just as he was about to speak, that white figure disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d His stomach-full of words instantly returned back into his own stomach. So, was this considered a success or not?</p><br/><p>When he turned around to look.</p><br/><p>Eh? Where did the newcomer missy go?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t have come to settle the scores with her for what she shouted earlier, right? In an instant, his heart was in a fluster.</p><br/><p>Oh right\u2026 What was that missy called again?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little dumbfounded. She simply felt something had come towards her like a gust of wind, then her waist tightened, and her entire body was now flying backwards at extreme speed. After that, the sounds of the whistling wind made her feel a little dizzy.</p><br/><p>She finally stopped, but she was already turning a little light-headed from the dizziness. As a new ghost, a high-intensive exercise like this was really an unbearable pain to the soul.</p><br/><p>She needed time to calm down.</p><br/><p>After gasping for air, she saw a head with pitch-black hair was presently pressing against her small buns on her chest. They were not huge in the first place, and now they were like a plane runway after being pressed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy buns\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao cried out miserably, as she reflexively raised her leg and sent him a kick. Instant Kill Technique \u2013 Breaking Offspring Breeding Kick!</p><br/><p>\u201cOw!\u201d That person cried out miserably, as he was hit right on target. In an instant, his body curled up like a shrimp, and he slid off her body. Rolling on the ground, one of his hands was actually still grabbing onto the corner of her robe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, you dirty bastard!\u201d You actually dare press against my little buns. Though the buns are small, they are still assets. There\u2019s a possibility that they still have room to develop too! Hss\u2026 It hurts this old lady so much.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tugged the corner of her robe, yet she was unable to get him to let go. Thus, began to pull with all her might!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao\u2026\u201d He suddenly groaned, carrying a suppressed and coarse voice.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s hands stopped. This voice\u2026 sounded familiar! She looked down at the person who curled into a ball, only to see him holding onto his bottom part with his two hands, and he was slowly raising his head to look at her.</p><br/><p>This was the face of a youth. Every part of it was familiar to her, but a little youth seemed to have faded from the part between his brows, and it was replaced with a little vicissitudes that were foreign to her.</p><br/><p>She stiffened, and then probed. \u201cMushmush?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s expression sank, and the pain on his face deepened even more. He focused his gaze on her, and as he blinked, a droplet of water fell out of those eyes which seemed to be filled with countless emotions. The sound he choked out was barely audible. \u201c\u2026 Big sis Zhu Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao completely stiffened, as though there was something which had instantly struck her. Her eyes unconsciously opened wide, and for a moment, she could not find her own voice. \u201cLittle\u2026 wimp\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He tightened the grip on the corner of her robe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is you!\u201d Zhu Yao squatted down, and pulled up the person on the ground. He measured this familiar face in detail. This was impossible! \u201cWhy are you still alive\u2026 Ah pui!\u201d This seemed to sound strange. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone to reincarnate\u2026 Ah pui!\u201d This sounded even weirder. \u201cYou\u2026 Why are you here? Am I seeing things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d He nodded. He seemed to want to say something, yet he kept having his words choked in his throat, and the mist in his eyes instantly welled up. He gone up to hug Zhu Yao in an instant, and then buried his head into her embrace like a little child. \u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, I finally get to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It really is him! Little wimp\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026 It hurts!\u201d Wang Xuzhi tightened his grip, as he went deeper into her embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cServes you right for taking advantage of me.\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but lecture him, yet her heart was feeling an unbearable pain. With her sleeves, she rubbed the tears off his face. \u201cWhen you were young, didn\u2019t you say a grown man only bleeds, and never cry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 It really hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, she really did kick him a little heavily. Let me apologize to your wife!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn brat, stop crying! Don\u2019t you know tears are contagious? Even I want to cry now.\u201d Zhu Yao could no longer hold it in, as her tears began to go out of control and flow down her face. It definitely was not because she was frail and weak, it was just because of how contagious it was. It definitely was!</p><br/><p>Little wimp. Her little wimp. That brat whom she raised when he was young. Prideful and stubborn, causing her to worry all the time. That little brat whom she had to watch out for at every moment.</p><br/><p>He finally returned.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit promised that he would allow her to see little wimp again, and he was finally keeping his promise for once. Zhu Yao had once imagined what would happen if she were to meet him again?</p><br/><p>But it was definitely not like this where she gave him a kick. Mn. And it was right at a certain part which cannot be described. Then, the two of them cried out painfully for an hour in each other\u2019s embrace. His was due to the pain, while hers was because of how contagious it was.</p><br/><p>Tears flowed down endlessly, and Zhu Yao was even moved by her own self. Just as she was about express the might of motherly love to this child whom she finally got to see again, a female ghost came drilling out of the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you two done yet? You two have already been crying all day, and your tears are already drowning my home. Can\u2019t a ghost get some sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi: \u201c\u2026\u201d Why was the ground her home?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d What a stupid place you chose.</p><br/><p>The two of them weakly crawled away. As expected, being sad like this was not their style.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, little wimp, why are you here in the Underworld?\u201d Zhu Yao only then recalled she wanted to ask Wang Xuzhi about what happened. \u201cDidn\u2019t you reincarnate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi was startled. \u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, how did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Don\u2019t mind how I got to know about it, so why are you here now?\u201d She clearly recalled Realmspirit showing the scene of him being reincarnated back then. But looking at him the way he was now, he looked exactly the same as back then.</p><br/><p>He sank into silence for a moment, before he slowly said. \u201cI did indeed enter the wheel of reincarnation, but for some reasons, when my lifespan ended and I returned to the Underworld, I regained the appearance of my past life. Then, my spiritual consciousness awakened and I remembered big sis Zhu Yao, so I went ahead to cultivate a spiritual body and entered Spiritual Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it said that the water of the River of Forgetfulness would cleanse off everything of one\u2019s past life? So how did he recover them?</p><br/><p>Haah, I don\u2019t care anymore. Being able to see him again was enough to satisfy her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, you have once again begun to cultivate into a deity?\u201d Zhu Yao measured him for a moment, and nodded satisfyingly. \u201cNot bad little brat, as expected of my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao\u2026 I\u2019m not your son.\u201d His expression darkened. He never was after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, don\u2019t mind such details.\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hands. \u201cSo, how are you doing in Spiritual Realm? Is there anyone bullying you? Tell big sis, this big sis will add him into the blacklist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing really well.\u201d Wang Xuzhi nodded. Looking at her, he heaved a long sigh of relief. As though he had recalled something, he slowly said. \u201cWhen I awakened my spiritual consciousness, I remembered big sis Zhu Yao. So, I would often stop by at the Bridge of Judgment, hoping that I can see you, and at the same time, hoping I won\u2019t get to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to see her, but this place was the Underworld after all. Seeing her here would mean that she would have fallen, and now\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi was stunned for a moment, and seemed to have thought of this point, as he anxiously started to console her. \u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, don\u2019t be sad. Even if you have fallen, it\u2019s not a big deal. We can go to Spiritual Realm and start over again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Zhu Yao patted on his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have not experienced death before.\u201d She was already used to dying, alright?</p><br/><p>He stopped speaking, though he looked a little guilty.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart could not help but tingle, as she hurriedly blurted out. \u201cLittle wimp, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d She was the one who should clearly feel guilty, after all, she promised Uncle Wang that she would take care of him, yet she failed to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your fault, big sis Zhu Yao.\u201d Wang Xuzhi smiled, and after pausing for a while, he continued. \u201cI have never blamed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she openly returned with Wang Xuzhi in tow, Ning Yun and his companions were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Zhu Yao took the initiative to greet them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, spare our lives!\u201d Ning Yun blurted out. He then knelt on the ground and loudly shouted. \u201cThis little ghost has no intentions to disrespect you, this is all that newcomer missy\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What happened to the promised love between co-workers?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

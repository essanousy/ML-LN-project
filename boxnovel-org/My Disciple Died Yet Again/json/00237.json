Then\u2026 she was eaten.</p><br/><p>Though she was merely a Foundation trash, she had after all cultivated for so many years, so her basic reflexes were still present. That was why she buffed herself with a defensive barrier at that very instant, and with a wave of her hand, she was planning to cast an ice type mystical art to retaliate.</p><br/><p>That demonic beast however suddenly loosened its mouth, and stared at her with widened curious eyes. It even blinked several times. It then approached her, and sniffed.</p><br/><p>In an instant, as though it was frightened, it leapt a huge step back. It gave her another glance, and then opened its mouth wide\u2026</p><br/><p>Puaah~~</p><br/><p>Huaaaa~ It puked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just how terrible did she taste that it had to puke in such a manner?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey hey!\u201d Zhu Yao shouted with a darkened expression.</p><br/><p>That demonic beast was given a fright, and all its fur were standing straight on ends like a hedgehog. It looked as though it wanted to retreat, but because of a misstep, its feet slipped and had almost fallen on the ground. In a fluster, it leapt a few meters back.</p><br/><p>Yo, it sure was cowardly. It seemed like it was a beast whelp.</p><br/><p>The tension in the depths of her heart was instantly swept away completely.</p><br/><p>Recalling before, it seemed like she was able to understand the demonic beast language in the past, and she wondered if this skill was still present. She then took a step forward. \u201cUmm, little beastie, can you tell me where\u2019s Ancient Azure Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>That demonic beast did not reply. It simply stared at her nervously. Then, it shifted its paws, and decisively took a step back.</p><br/><p>Was she that scary?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Ancient Azure Sect close by?\u201d She took another step forward.</p><br/><p>The demonic beast moved two steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow big is this forest?\u201d She continued to take another step.</p><br/><p>It took another three steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have to be that frightened of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another four steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop retreating!\u201d</p><br/><p>Five steps\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBehind you, there\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom~</p><br/><p>A scream pierced through the skies!</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, as she finished what she was about to say before. \u201cA hole.\u201d</p><br/><p>Where\u2019s your intelligence as a demonic beast?</p><br/><p>Sighing, Zhu Yao directly walked over.</p><br/><p>That hole was very deep, and there were even formation ripples in the surroundings. It was most likely a trap which practitioners especially set down to capture demonic beasts.</p><br/><p>That demonic beast with pitifully low intelligence was currently desperately struggling within. From the fear he had in the beginning, it slowly turned into anger and rage. At one moment, it was desperately digging into the walls, while on other moments, it would crash into the surrounding formations with all its might. However, it was simply unable to leave that hole, and its claws were mainly deflected by the formation, leaving several scars on its body.</p><br/><p>If this continued, it would torture itself to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but call out.</p><br/><p>The demonic beast was startled. It suddenly raised its head, and when it saw that it was her, it instantly quietened down as though it\u2019s \u2018pause\u2019 button was pressed. Its body trembled, and it no longer dared to dig the walls and collide with the formation. It began to weakly shrink in the corner of the walls, as though it wanted to conceal itself. Yet, all its rubbing merely caused dirt and soil to slide down the walls.</p><br/><p>Finally, when it realized there was nowhere it could hide in, it curled itself into a ball and began to let out soft, sniffling sounds. Its gigantic body continued to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Was it crying?</p><br/><p>Owuu\u2026 owuu\u2026</p><br/><p>Its voice grew louder. That pair of large, pitch-black eyes released a huge amount of water, drenching its beautiful looking white fur.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop crying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooowuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell you\u2019re crying for? I\u2019m the one who was almost eaten by you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooowuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, you fell down on your own, right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooooooowuu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It began to cry even sadder than before, and in the end, it was actually rolling about in the depths of the hole.</p><br/><p>Yo, it\u2019s even gasping for air now. Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. Haah, forget it, it\u2019s only a beast.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao glanced at the surroundings. Then, she cast a wind type mystic art, swirling up the fallen log at the side and dragging it into the hole, perfectly pressing onto the formation core in the depths of the hole. With a flash of white light, that formation instantly lost its effects.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop ou-ing, come up!\u201d</p><br/><p>That furball blanked for a moment, and then a moment later, tilting its head, it looked at the log which had turned into a bridge. It then glanced at the formation which had lost its effects. Its pair of eyes brightened as it happily leapt up. Its front paws stepped on the log, and it climbed out with just two trots. It then happily bustled about on the ground.</p><br/><p>Raising its head, it glanced at her, before it turned about and ran deep into the forest. In an instant, it disappeared from sight.</p><br/><p>Great. This ungrateful little beastie bitch.</p><br/><p>It seemed like she shouldn\u2019t hope for it to lead the way. She raised her head and looked at the night sky. Zhu Yao had no choice but to carry her miniature master and head into the depths of the forest. From the information she received from the town, Ancient Azure Sect should not be too far away now.</p><br/><p>Walking in the forest on foot was different from flying on a sword. The things she had to look out for in the surroundings were many, and it was very easy for her to lose her sense of direction. She really wanted to fly, but unfortunately, she did not have a transportation artifact! But, as long as it\u2019s a deity sect, it should be located above a spiritual pulse. There should be nothing wrong with walking towards the place with rich amount of spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>After walking for about two hours, she finally saw what looked like a mountain gate.</p><br/><p>On a gigantic stone wall, the two words \u2018Ancient Azure\u2019 was written. Next to the stone wall however, was a vast ocean.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief, as she immediately walked towards the ocean. The moment she went past the stone wall, the scenery in front of her twisted. The ocean suddenly disappeared, and what materialized was a range celestial mountains and blessed lands. Gigantic mountains floated in the sky, the place was filled with vibrant lights, and auspicious clouds filled the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask what matters this Daoist has come to Ancient Azure Sect for?\u201d A male voice rang from the left. A man dressed in a light robe walked out from the teleportation formation, and his face carried a courteous smile.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao guessed that he should be a disciple of the sect who was in charge of guarding the mountain gate, though she was still unable to see through his level of cultivation. It seemed like his cultivation level was above hers as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist.\u201d Because she was carrying a person on her back, she could only give a courteous nod. \u201cThis one is named Zhu Yao, and I\u2019m here in your esteemed sect to look for an old acquaintance.\u201d</p><br/><p>That man said with the same courteous tone. \u201cMay I ask who fellow Daoist is looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s surnamed Wang, and his name is Xuzhi. I wonder if he\u2019s presently in the sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was startled for a moment, and an estranged look flashed past his face. He sized her up for a moment, and his brows sank into a frown. His expression no longer carried the courtesy it had before, and he said with a hint of anger. \u201cI have seen many women like you, it\u2019s no use. Leave! If you wish to enter our Ancient Azure Sect, you must first have the aptitude to do so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d What did he mean?</p><br/><p>However, as he waved his hands irritatingly, he continued. \u201cLeave, hurry and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist, I don\u2019t wish to enter Ancient Azure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram, scram!\u201d He waved his hands with an irritated look. \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave now, then don\u2019t blame me for being discourteous.\u201d As he said that, he really reached out his hands and pushed her outside.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to explain, a furious roar suddenly resounded from behind them.</p><br/><p>With a swoosh, a white figure cut between them, and in an instant, the gate guardian disciple was pushed onto the ground by a paw. It furiously bared its teeth at him.</p><br/><p>It was that cowardly little demonic beast earlier. Why was it here?</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Honourable Bai Yuan.\u201d That disciple suddenly exclaimed. He looked at the ferocious beast, and then turned to glance at Zhu Yao. In an instant, he had a look of sudden realization, as he hurriedly crawled up and bowed towards that demonic beast. \u201cThis disciple was blind, and did not recognize that this lady was Heavenly Honourable\u2019s esteemed guest. I seek Heavenly Honourable\u2019s forgiveness!\u201d</p><br/><p>That demonic beast blew a blast of hot air at him, as though he was extremely furious. It turned around, not batting him another eye. However, the disciple was still throwing out apologies one after another.</p><br/><p>What was this situation? Could it be that this stupid beast was raised by Ancient Azure Sect? Furthermore, it seemed like it had a rather high status, to the point where even human practitioner disciples did not dare to offend it?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao curiously sized the beast up, and that beast trembled from her stares. Earlier, it was filled with a tyrannical aura when it was bullying other people, but when given stares by her, it instantly shrank back. It timidly glanced at her, as though it was somehow frightened by her. With a thud, it once again ran off, disappearing from sight.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Just how afraid of her was it?</p><br/><p> \u201cThis esteemed guest, I was unaware of your identity earlier and had ended up offending you. I hope you will forgive this lowly one.\u201d The disciple instantly changed out of his furious temper earlier, and was now passionately welcoming her. \u201cEsteemed guest, please follow me to Main Peak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded, as she followed him into the teleportation formation. The formation light flashed, and she had already arrived at the front of the towering main hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Wang Xuzhi?\u201d She had thought that he would immediately bring her to where little wimp was, but she never expected that the gate guardian disciple would courteously guide her to a seat in the hall.</p><br/><p>That disciple explained. \u201cUnfortunately, our Sect Master is presently in closed-door training, and it\u2019s inconvenient for him to receive you. The sect affairs are presently being temporarily managed by our Grand Elder. Esteemed guest, please wait for a short moment, this lowly one shall inform Elder of your arrival.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he left the hall, most probably heading off to inform that Elder. Zhu Yao pondered for a moment. If Wang Xuzhi was really a disciple of Ancient Azure Sect, and she wanted to look for him, greeting the manager was indeed very necessary.</p><br/><p>Then she should just wait patiently!</p><br/><p>Her master had yet to awaken, and it wasn\u2019t a good idea to carry him on her back the entire time. Thus, she pulled two chairs together and placed him on the chairs, allowing him to lie down comfortably.</p><br/><p>Only then did she begin to inspect this great hall. The longer she looked at it, the more familiar it felt.</p><br/><p>No matter was it the shapes of the chairs, the looks of the tables, the curtains hanging within the hall and even that person coming in through the door was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial nephew Zi Mo!\u201d Zhu Yao exclaimed.</p><br/><p>When her words fell, the person, who had just stepped into the hall, slipped, and had almost planted his head onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle\u2026 Little martial aunt!\u201d Zi Mo looked at her with widened eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re still alive\u2026 No, you\u2019re already dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why did these words sound so strange?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d He had a face of utter disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot just me, my master is here as well.\u201d She pointed to the person sleeping on the chairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Ancestral-martial uncle is dead as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Was there a need to curse people to death straight after seeing each other?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao really did not expect that she would encounter someone familiar again. Furthermore, it was even the former Ancient Hill Sect Master Zi Mo.</p><br/><p>Similarly, after he fell, he went to the Underworld, awakened his spiritual consciousness, achieved a spiritual body and made his way to Spiritual Realm. Then, he joined this Ancient Azure Sect and cultivated a step at a time. Finally, he managed to take up his old job as a Sect Master. Until a hundred years ago, when he passed on this responsibility to his disciple and took the back seat.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, his disciple was none other than little wimp Wang. Wang Xuzhi was presently the Sect Master of Ancient Azure Sect, and it was thus no wonder everyone would look at her with such eyes when she brought up his name. He was actually a Sect Master. Most probably, they had all treated her as someone wanting to hug his thighs, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s little wimp?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo\u2019s expression sank, and only a moment later did he speak up. \u201cWhen he returned from the Underworld back then, he unknowingly carried severe injuries. Presently, he\u2019s in isolation, tending to his injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s injured?\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s heart clenched, and after recalling for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s not right. Back then, his injuries were not serious. So why did he need to go into isolation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle martial aunt, you\u2019re aware of why he\u2019s injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao recounted to him the incident in the Underworld, and then brought up the matters about resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut back then, when he returned, his injuries were indeed of great severity.\u201d Zi Mo said with a heavy expression. \u201cMost of his meridians were damaged, and I had many times wanted to treat his injuries in his stead, but none of my treatments were effective. They were basically irreparable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Her meridians had shattered into smithereens several times, but she would always still be able to fix them up. Could it be that her meridians could be recycled, while little wimp\u2019s had a one-time characteristic?</p><br/><p>Wait a minute, the thing that injured little wimp back then seemed to be that Ghost King.</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did little wimp place the talisman that had the Ghost King sealed in it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTalisman?\u201d Zi Mo was startled, his face was filled with confusion. \u201cWhat talisman?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell! As she had thought, he had yet to deal with it.</p><br/><p>She instantly grabbed onto his collar. \u201cBring me to him, now, immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Mo understood that this matter was not as simple as it seemed. Without the slightest of hesitation, he turned around, and just as he was about to lead her out of the hall.</p><br/><p>The earth suddenly shook. Sharp ghostly cries reverberated one after another. At the front-right of the mountain peak, a pillar of black miasma rose into the sky, piercing straight through the skyline. The black miasma slowly gathered together, and a gigantic savage human figure was formed in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuzhi!\u201d Zi Mo exclaimed. Summoning his flying sword, he flew in the direction of the miasma.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, wait for me!\u201d She did not have a transportation artifact, hey!</p><br/><p>Just as she was chase after him, something tugged her waistline, and when she turned around, she collided into a chest that carried a chilling aura. \u201cMaster! You\u2019re awake!\u201d Even his height had returned to normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Yu Yan responded. Hugging onto his disciple, he flew towards Zi Mo\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>In a flash, they had already arrived at the entrance of a cave residence. That place was exactly below that Ghost King. Strands of miasma were floating about within the residence. Compared to those in the sky, the miasma was a little thin here. However, the \u2018bug\u2019 words could still be seen very clearly. These were the resentment left behind by that Ghost King.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao walked in, and sitting within the building was little wimp. He seemed to have suffered grave injuries as he was puking out a mouthful of blood. Some black wisps of air were even encircling his body. His face was pale to the extent where not a single strand of red could be seen, and Zi Mo was presently behind him treating his injuries. However, it seemed to be ineffective.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle wimp!\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s heart clenched. Why did it turn out like this?</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi weakly raised his head. Seeing that it was her, his eyes shone, and he pulled the corners of his lips. \u201cBig sis Zhu Yao, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who\u2019s injured is you. Just what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not reply. It seemed like he did not have much strength remaining.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan however stepped forward and pulled up his hand to check his pulse. With a cold tone, he said. \u201cResentment has entered his body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned.</p><br/><p>The horrifying cries outside were growing even louder. Yu Yan frowned, and instructed. \u201cYu Yao, seal it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone, and at that moment, Yu Yan\u2019s body had already flashed, as he flew straight towards that Resentment Ghost King in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle martial aunt?\u201d Zi Mo\u2019s face was puzzled. \u201cWhat did ancestral-grand uncle mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me!\u201d Zhu Yao did not reply him directly, and instead sat in a lotus position behind Wang Xuzhi. The injuries on little wimp\u2019s body was never healed the entire time, most probably due to the influence of resentment. There was basically no way to exterminate resentment, and if left as it is, little wimp\u2019s injuries would only worsen, and small injuries would turn into heavy injuries as well.</p><br/><p>Since resentment was the embodiment of all negative emotions, then it\u2019s rather similar to devilish energy. That was why her master reminded her that she should try the sealing arts.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath, and immediately sensed the presence of resentment within little wimp\u2019s body. Circulating her spiritual energy, she gathered the resentment at a single spot, and then activated the sealing arts. In an instant, golden runic symbols flashed, which then seeped into Wang Xuzhi\u2019s body and firmly sealed the bundle of miasma.</p><br/><p>Success!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

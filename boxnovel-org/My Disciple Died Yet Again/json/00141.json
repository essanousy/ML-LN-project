In these few months, she had experienced the lives of a kitchen knife, brick, barbecue grills, shuttlecock, and other related objects. She was just about to cultivate into a jack-of-all-trades. If she had not been fixed by having divine energy inserted into her occasionally, she would have shattered a long time ago.</p><br/><p>However, that sly fox did not have the slightest intention to help her gain a human form. She had not even seen the shadow of the Lightning Abyssal Spring herself. If this continued, forget about gaining a human form, she would be played to death first. In regards to the legend of the ultimate Lightning Abyssal Spring which could aid her in gaining her human form, simply with a twist, lick, dunk, just like ore- Ah pui! She was starting to doubt if it really existed.</p><br/><p>Thus, the problem came. Excavation technology- Ah pui!</p><br/><p>When she asked herself if it would be faster to die and resurrect, or cultivate a human form\u2026</p><br/><p>The answer she came up with was\u2026 Dying seemed to be a little easier.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlip over!\u201d A certain unconscientious person used a pair of chopsticks to poke the rock which had already turned a little charred from the grilling.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao flipped over without saying a single hateful comment. The intense flames under her seared with a sizzling sound, instantly burning her jade-body. While a certain culprit, was currently clamping onto a piece of raw meat, which he then threw onto the jade which was already boiling hot from the heat. In an instant, the aroma of the meat suffused into the air, while the oil flowed around Zhu Yao\u2019s face. Craaack! It was as though she could heard cracking sounds. Crack then, crack then. If the jade were to crack anymore, she could finally disconnect.</p><br/><p>The man who was just about to place down the second piece of meat, momentarily paused his fingers. Glancing at the jade which was especially obedient today, his brows slightly furrowed for a moment. The intent to die actually sprouted with this rock spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, Blossoming Jade.\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re Blossoming Jade. Your entire family is made of Blossoming Jades.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, initially, I had planned on bringing you to the Lightning Abyssal Spring today to have you gain your human form. But, seeing that these pieces of meat will not be grilled that quickly, I think it\u2019s best if I postpone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is fine!\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s vigor was suddenly increased by a hundred times, and whatever thoughts of disconnecting she had before, had disappeared. So you were planning to bring me there today? Say that earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut grilling these pieces of meat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it just grilling meat? That\u2019s nothing compared to gaining a human form! \u201cGrill them, grill them! Grill a few more pieces. Do you want to add some cumin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s eyes narrowed, as a fine light flashed past his eyes. Without making a sound, he once again picked up a piece of raw meat, and covered Zhu Yao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The meat grilling operation this time continued for an entire day. In these few days, she had been occasionally inserted with divine energy, and she felt that she was actually developing into a diamond. Her cultivation had accumulated a little as well, at the very least, she was now able to flip her body.</p><br/><p>However, she felt that she was given these abilities, all for the sake of a certain person\u2019s convenience. For example, occasionally, he would ask her to flip herself. But, no matter how high her cultivation was, she wouldn\u2019t be able to last an entire day under an intense fire, right? Although as a piece of jade, she could not sense any pain, those constant cracking sounds were something she could hear absolutely clearly.</p><br/><p>She was going to disconnect. She\u2019s definitely going to disconnect, right?</p><br/><p>Just when Zhu Yao felt that she was unable to hold on any longer, the stack of meat was finally grilled to completion. Fortunately, that sly fox stayed true to his words, and carried her to the backyard. They arrived at the side of a pool which was the size of a well. The pool wasn\u2019t huge, but strangely, the water was purple in color.</p><br/><p>And she did not know if it was because he had found a little bit of conscience inside of him, he first healed up the cracks on Zhu Yao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, you can only get out after ten days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, mn, mn, mn.\u201d Zhu Yao hurriedly responded.</p><br/><p>The man loosened his fingers, and with a \u2018plop\u2019, Zhu Yao fell into the purple-colored pool. Only at this moment did Zhu Yao understand why this pool was called the Lightning Abyssal Spring. The hell, what\u2019s inside was not water at all, but lightning. Furthermore, the might and strength of each of these bolts were comparable to the heavenly lightning brought forth from ascension tribulation. The dense amount of lightning aura filled her surroundings, as the bolts constantly drilled into jade. She once again heard the crackling sounds, and this time, she was cracking even faster than before. Although she could not feel any pain as a piece of jade, she could not endure it if those lightning bolts came running into her divine sense region, right?</p><br/><p>If she had not made constant contact with lightning spiritual energy in the past, she would basically be unable to endure it. This matter of forcefully absorbing energy was even a little stronger than the spiritual energy turbulence in the past. Zhu Yao thus could only try her best to maintain the rate of lightning energy which was suddenly pouring into her body, and guide the energy to circulate according to her will.</p><br/><p>On the first day, Zhu Yao finally controlled the lightning energy in her body.</p><br/><p>On the second day, she could already circulate the lightning energy according to her will.</p><br/><p>On the third day, her body had begun to stop cracking.</p><br/><p>On the fourth day, she began to make progress with her cultivation, and also began to restore her body.</p><br/><p>On the fifth day, from a piece of white jade, she turned emerald-green.</p><br/><p>On the sixth day, she became an even brighter emerald.</p><br/><p>On the seventh day, She had turned into a huge piece of diamond. Zhu Yao suddenly had the imagination of experiencing an hundred and eighty degrees turn in life, and turning into a rich tyrant.</p><br/><p>On the eighth day, her body once again began to crack and change.</p><br/><p>On the ninth day, her entire body was enveloped by a gentle aura, and she began to transform.</p><br/><p>On the tenth day\u2026 A chat window appeared before her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stared at the window which suddenly appeared, and suddenly had the urge to give Realmspirit a rough beating.</p><br/><p>Please set your character\u2019s configuration:</p><br/><p>[Female] (Already used) or [Male] (Already used) or [Baby] (Already used) or [Bi-gender] (Can be selected)</p><br/><p>The hell, what\u2019s with the \u2018Bi-gender\u2019 option at the end? And what\u2019s with the \u2018Already used\u2019 next to the first three options? Didn\u2019t that clearly mean that she had to choose the final \u2018Bi-gender\u2019 option? Instead of being turned into a demon, she would rather die. Realmspirit, come out here if you dare.</p><br/><p>Character\u2019s configuration selection countdown: 10. 9. 8. 7\u2026</p><br/><p>Hey, hey, hey, what\u2019s with the sudden countdown timer? Realmspirit, you\u2019re clearly making a fool out of me.</p><br/><p>3. 2. 1. Countdown ended. [Bi-gender] has been automatically selected. Character configuration in progress\u2026</p><br/><p>Flips table. Realmspirit, come out here! I guarantee I won\u2019t beat you to death!</p><br/><p>A white light flashed in front of her eyes, and Zhu Yao felt as though her vision had instantly turned wide. The scenery which she had thought was still incomparably huge four weeks ago, was currently shrinking little by little. And the shrinking out stopped when the scenery was as huge as it was in her memories.</p><br/><p>A clear, gentle breeze blew past. Zhu Yao suddenly felt a slight chill. Only then did she realize that it wasn\u2019t the scenery which shrank, rather, it was her who grew in size. The white aura on her body gradually dissipated. She had successfully gained a human form.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s first reaction, was to look downwards in fear. Phew, it\u2019s alright. There wasn\u2019t anything strange growing below, and her breasts were still intact, though, just like before, they were still lacking in nutrients.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually did it?\u201d The sly fox suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and was currently standing at the other side of the courtyard. Still wearing that slight bewitching smile, he sized her up for a moment, and nodded. \u201cThough it\u2019s a little ugly, the qualifications aren\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho\u2026 Thank you.\u201d You\u2019re ugly. Your entire family is ugly.</p><br/><p>He walked straight towards her, and seemed to want to pull her up. Suddenly, a huge wind swept past, and a white figure cut in-between them. His cold expression seemed to be frozen solid, and currently, he was staring straight at the person sitting in the pool.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly had the urge to cry. Master, took you long enough to find me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Wang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s Desire!\u201d Your sister, your sister, your sister! Why did he remember the name \u2018Yu Yao\u2019 when he appeared before the little bitch, but when it came to her, he changed it back to Desire!?</p><br/><p>However, Yu Yan heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that this time, she really was his disciple alright. Reaching out his hand, he said. \u201cFollow me back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, Little Yan Yan?\u201d A certain person who was cut off earlier, rotated his eyes between the two of them back and forth, as his brows twitched. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to explain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan finally turned around to glance at the man, and responded with the same cold tone. \u201cMy disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression stiffened, and then, sighed deeply. Clearly, she was the little rock spirit that he picked up, so how did she suddenly become his disciple? Why didn\u2019t he recall any tradition of taking in demon spirits as disciples in the Lightning Divine Hall?</p><br/><p>\u201cI say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yu Yan completely did not have any intentions to explain, as he pulled his disciple up, and left these words. \u201cHall Master, Yu Yan shall take his leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, his figure flashed, and in front of him, what\u2019s left was an empty pool.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If you want to take someone away, at the very least, let me finish what I want to say. Where\u2019s your most basic form of respect to the Hall Master?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan brought his disciple back to his nest, and only then did his several days of frustration from losing his disciple finally calm down. After seeing her sitting in the Lightning Abyssal Spring, and the aura which still remained after the formation of a body, he could already make a rough guess why he would mistake that woman for her back then.</p><br/><p>He stared at her completely foreign-looking face. What\u2019s strange was, after looking for her a moment, her face was no longer a blurred view, rather, it had been directly engraved in the depths of his heart. Among the faces that showed up when he thought of his disciple in his mind, another one was instantly added in. For him to be capable of remembering her face, she was his own disciple alright.</p><br/><p>Reaching out his hand to stroke her drenched head, but what he received in response was a pair of very well-concealed rolling eyes. Her eyes showed complete defiance, as though they were saying \u2018Do not mess up my hairstyle.\u2019 Yu Yan unhesitatingly pressed on her head, entangling her strands of hair, which were drenched in the first place, from his stroking.</p><br/><p>Mn, that\u2019s right. Even her reaction was spot on. She was definitely his disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy were you in the Lightning Abyssal Spring?\u201d Yu Yan began his first wave of questions.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao blanked, and instantly, a large wave of flames surged from her chest. \u201cIsn\u2019t it because you mistook that little bitch for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little bitch? What? Yu Yan blanked for a moment, and suddenly, he recalled that woman who posed as his disciple back then. His expression sank. \u201cShe possessed the aura of my divine sense on her body.\u201d It was the divine sense which he had left on his disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has it, so you recognized her as me? She had me by her waist, so of course she has the divine sense on her body.\u201d The flames in Zhu Yao\u2019s heart instantly surged up high. Clearly, she knew he wasn\u2019t to blame for this incident, but she just couldn\u2019t suppress her fury. Especially when she recalled when her master treated that woman the same way as her, and that woman\u2019s coy expression, she really wished she could scratch her face.</p><br/><p>Looking at his disciple who was gritting her teeth, and was seemingly extremely irritated, Yu Yan sighed. Casually, he cast a Dirt Removal Art on his disciple, and once again stroked her head. \u201cThis is your master\u2019s mistake.\u201d Although he did feel the incident was a little strange back then, that strand of divine sense he felt was indeed not fake. Even if that woman was not his own disciple, it was possible that she was related to his disciple in some way. Hence, he brought her back, and planned on clarifying things in the future.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, however, instantly pulled down his hand, and with a forceful twist of her body, pushed her own master onto the bed behind him. \u201cYou think you\u2019re fine just by admitting your mistake? It\u2019s never that simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>But, Yu Yan\u2019s expression did not change. He simply looked blankly at his own disciple who was smiling slyly, as though being pressed onto the bed by his own disciple was not really a big deal. Mn, in any case, it\u2019s not the first time. He was used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, do you still remember what I said before you ascended? If you dare to fool around with flowers and tender grass\u00b9, I will castrate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fool around with flowers and tender grass? Yu Yan blanked for a moment. Frowning, after a while, he replied with a serious look. \u201cThe Lightning Divine Hall is filled with flowers and grass, if I don\u2019t make contact with them, it\u2019s a little hard.\u201d Especially grass, which he had stepped on quite a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The bundle of fury within Zhu Yao was instantly extinguished completely with a sizzling sound, and she felt as though an illusory voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>Your master\u2019s IQ has logged off.</p><br/><p>\u00b9Fooling around with flowers and tender grass: Basically, fooling around with women behind Zhu Yao\u2019s back.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

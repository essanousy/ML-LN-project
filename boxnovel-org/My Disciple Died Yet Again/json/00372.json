Don\u2019t like them?\u201d Seeing her unmoving, Shao Bai gave an even warmer smile as he reached out to stroke her head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, second elder brother prepared others as well.\u201d As he said that, he pulled out bags and bags of snacks and stuffed them in her hands.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little stunned. She glanced at the various familiar bags in her hands. \u201cSecond elder brother\u2026\u201d Just what was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and eat them, before your teacher discovers them.\u201d Shao Bai helped combed her hair and gently said. \u201cIf he discover them again, he would once more\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you get this time?\u201d Before he could finish, a figure dressed in snow-white robes appeared from not far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d As expected, he was here as well. \u201cThis place is really strange\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish, the person in front of her frowned. With a cold face, he walked over. Then, he turned towards a rock at the side and began his lecture. \u201cYour teacher has told you several times that you\u2019ve already abstained from food. There\u2019s no benefits to your cultivation if you constantly take in mortal food.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cMaster, I\u2019m over here\u2026\u201d Please forgive that rock.</p><br/><p>The person in front of her stiffened for a moment, and then he immediately turned around with his usual look. Facing a tree at the side, he continued with his justifications. \u201cI\u2019ve mentioned it to you yesterday, and what did you promise to this teacher? Does that still count?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. Left with no choice, she grabbed onto the person in front of her and turned him around. \u201cI\u2019m over here!\u201d This face-blindness that did not discriminate across races could only belong to one person. \u201c\u2026 Teacher?\u201d He was the Far Ancient Highgod? Wasn\u2019t he already\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Did you even forget about your teacher?\u201d His frown grew deeper. With a long sigh, he said. \u201cYu\u2026 Yao. Though you\u2019re a Phoenix, you cannot slack on your cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. She had never told her teacher her name, and the only person who could possibly call her Yu Yao was her master! Just what was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d He looked at her, confused.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately stepped forward and grabbed his hands. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the person in front of her could speak, Shao Bai next to her stepped forward. Bowing forward, he then courteously said. \u201cSovereign Yu Yan, please forgive her. These snacks were something I brought over, and it\u2019s not related to her. You should be aware that Little Seventh is my only sister, so naturally I pamper her a lot more. Please do not blame her because of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sovereign Yu Yan? Master! He\u2019s really my master, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s expression slacked a little. Lowering his head, he glanced at Zhu Yao and habitually stroked her head. A familiar warmth surfaced in his eyes, and he lightly said. \u201cNo more exceptions in the future. Tomorrow\u2026\u201d He turned his head away a little unnaturally, and then after a moment, he said. \u201cHead up the mountain a little earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, his figure flashed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, wait\u2026\u201d Before Zhu Yao could even react, he had already disappeared. Her mind was growing confused by the moment. Yue Ying, Shao Bai? Master, Teacher? Just what was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? You\u2019re afraid that he\u2019s angry?\u201d Shao Bai smiled and revealed a pair of relieving eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re already about to get married, so why would he blame you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet married!?\u201d Just what kind of godly development is this?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it next month?\u201d Shao Bai gave an even gentler smile. Just as he was about to explain, he suddenly sensed something. He turned around, and with a sunken expression, he sharply called out. \u201cStop there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind a boulder, a little red figure that was about to leave instantly stiffened. He stopped in his tracks, and turned his little pitiful face around. \u201cSecond elder brother, seventh elder sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Eighth!\u201d Wasn\u2019t he with the Wood Spirit? Why was he here? And he was even his child form.</p><br/><p>Shao Bai shook his head as he reached out one of his hands. \u201cTake it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond elder brother\u2026\u201d Little Eighth\u2019s voice grew even more pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Eighth pouted with his lips up high, and then took out a bag of melon seeds from behind him, something that he was about to slip away with. Yet, he still held tightly onto the bag. \u201cI will give it to you, I will give it to you! I will give them all to you! I knew second elder brother will only pamper the ugliest seventh elder sister, and not Little Eighth the slightest bit. Little Eighth\u2019s life is so hard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Then release your grip on the bag!</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsensical!\u201d Shao Bai knocked heavily onto his little head, and then heartlessly took away the bag of snacks from his hand, which he then passed back to Zhu Yao\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh\u2026 elder sister\u2026\u201d Little Eighth hurriedly changed his target and looked towards Zhu Yao. He pointed at the other bags that she placed on the boulder. \u201cYou already have so many of them, just give Little Eighth one! Though you\u2019re ugly, I won\u2019t despise your melon seeds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d So I should thank you for not despising my melon seeds, is that it?</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister\u2026\u201d Seeing that she wasn\u2019t replying, Little Eighth had no choice but to hold her hand and began to shake it in a flighty manner.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt something crawling all over her body. This glutton has sacrificed enough morals just for a bag of melon seeds alright. Zhu Yao immediately stuffed the bag in his little hands. \u201cI\u2019m giving it to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, seventh elder sister!\u201d He voiced out in joy. Carrying the bag, he turned around and quickly ran far away. He even intentionally ran in the opposite direction he came from, afraid that she would mince her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will spoil him like that.\u201d Shao Bai sighed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shook her head. \u201cLittle Eighth is still young.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Phoenix, not an emperor.\u201d Shao Bai said with a sunken voice. \u201cMen of our Phoenix race should\u2019ve long known to be obedient at his age. How should him being such a glutton be allowed? How can he take up challenges by himself in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank, and she could not help but recall the moment when Little Eighth was trapped in that spatial dimension. The pool was filled with his fresh blood, and the mountain wall was dyed red. She felt a sharp pain in her heart, and she took a deep breath to toss away these unknown emotions.</p><br/><p>She turned around a looked at Shao Bai who had a heavy look on his face. Then, she pointed at the other bags on the boulder and said. \u201cAren\u2019t you the same towards me?\u201d The snacks were clearly things that he brought for her, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different.\u201d Shao Bai\u2019s expression instantly turned gentle, as water could flow out at any moment. He looked straight into her eyes, and his were reflected with her figure, as though she was the only person remaining between this heaven and earth. Pulling her hand, he placed it on his own cheek and then showed a smile that instantly greyed out the entire sky. \u201cBecause you\u2019re my little sister, my only\u2026 and most important little sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Dong!</p><br/><p>An olden and distant bell ring sounded, and it instantly reverberated across the entire Parasol Tree.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. Wasn\u2019t this bell\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the bell of Ancient Hill Sect.\u201d Shao Bai suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAncient Hill Sect!\u201d How was that possible? How was the world of the God race tied together with Ancient Hill Sect?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, let\u2019s take a look?\u201d Shao Bai however looked as usual. \u201cSomething must have happened at Yu Luo\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Little Radish?</p><br/><p>Before she could even reach, Shao Bai had already brought her up into the air and flew towards an enormous Parasol Tree leaf at the top. Several extremely familiar floating mountains suddenly appeared in the sky before her. The Main Mountain at the center was the largest, while the other mountains were surrounding the Main Mountain. There was one single mountain that was floating high up above the various mountains.</p><br/><p>That was\u2026 Jade Forest Peak.</p><br/><p>This really was the Ancient Hill Sect! But when did Ancient Hill Sect become neighbours with the divine Parasol Tree of the Phoenix race?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d The moment they landed, a red-robed female practitioner welcomed them. With a joyous face, she looked at Zhu Yao. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Radish!?\u201d It really was her. How was this possible? Was this all an illusion? Zhu Yao instantly pinched her cheeks and then twisted them up and down. They were warm. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMush\u2026 twrr. (Master)\u201d Little Radish\u2019s face darkened. After enduring for a long while, she pulled down Zhu Yao\u2019s hands. \u201cShould I try pinching master then?\u201d Don\u2019t force me to go against my teacher and disregard my ancestors.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She was the real deal!</p><br/><p>Shao Bai faked out a few coughs. \u201cYu Luo, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine honour Shao Bai.\u201d Yu Luo then released Zhu Yao\u2019s hands and bowed in front of Shao Bai. With a frown, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s Mu Meiyan. She has once again infiltrated into our sect\u2019s Great Mountain Barrier Formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Meiyan!\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cWasn\u2019t she dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can she possibly die so easily after hooking up with the Devil race?\u201d Little Radish looked at Zhu Yao with puzzled eyes, and then said with a worried expression. \u201cMaster, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look for now!\u201d Shao Bai reminded.</p><br/><p>With a stomach filled with questions, Zhu Yao arrived in front of the hall of the Main Mountain. As expected, there were several people engaged in battle, and at the very center, concealed within a mass of devillic energy was someone\u2019s face. It was actually Mu Meiyan who had already died in the past! Next to her were also a few familiar figures. After having a better look, they were actually Xiao Yi, Cheng Qingdiao, Wu Hua\u2026</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 All of the bugs are actually gathered.</p><br/><p>Is this the National Boss Big Giveaway?</p><br/><p>There must be something wrong with how I entered the plaza.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Radish\u2026\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She nudged Yu Luo next to her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you really try pinching me?\u201d I want to see if I\u2019m really dreaming or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Little Radish\u2019s expression looked as though she was looking at someone who had no hope left whatsoever. She glanced at Zhu Yao from head to toe several times. Suddenly, as though she had thought of something, she said with an enlightened look. \u201cOh! I know now. These the premarital doubts that master had mentioned before, aren\u2019t they? Don\u2019t worry, though Mu Meiyan has hooked up with the Devil race, you\u2019re a Phoenix of the God race. Furthermore, divine honour Shao Bai is here. Nothing will happen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPremarital?\u201d This was already the second time she heard a relevant term. \u201cWhat premarital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be, master!?\u201d Yu Luo was stunned. With a lecturing gaze, she looked at Zhu Yao. \u201cIt\u2019s only a few days left till the big day. It\u2019s already too late for you to go back on your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Just what\u2019s with this mess? \u201cJust who is marrying who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, it\u2019s your and grandmaster\u2019s. Haven\u2019t you two been engaged for several years?\u201d Yu Luo said matter-of-factly. She looked around, and then carefully leaned closer to whisper in her ears. \u201cGrandmaster has already sewn your wedding dress for several months. I had a slight glance of it, and it\u2019s incredibly beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Master\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. Master, the fact that you\u2019re not good at needlework and have instead forced grandmaster to sew your wedding dress for you, are things that I will definitely not speak to others of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d When did I force anyone to do things, hey!? Don\u2019t charge me with a crime so randomly!</p><br/><p>But, marrying master\u2026 What\u2019s with this slight excitement that I\u2019m feeling?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow far are we from the marriage date again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo long\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh! Wait, she was here to investigate just what in the world was going on here. She shouldn\u2019t be enticed by these illusions! Calm down, calm down!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister.\u201d Shao Bai held Zhu Yao\u2019s hand tightly, and instructed her with a solemn voice. \u201cWait for second elder brother here, don\u2019t run off.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, his figure flashed. Turning into an enormous red Phoenix, he flew towards the battlefield at the front.</p><br/><p>In an instant, monstrous flames began to ignite and burn\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

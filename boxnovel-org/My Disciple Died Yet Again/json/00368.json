At first glance, they were pleasing to the eye. Their bodies even seemed to be glowing, as though they were carrying special effects for making their first appearance. It would have been perfect if there was background music playing behind them.</p><br/><p>The person who called out earlier was the woman walking at the center. She wore a pink long robe and had an especially sweet smile. She walked straight over and sized up the few of them. When her line of sight landed on Yu Yan who was next to Zhu Yao, she was slightly stunned for a moment. She then took a few steps forward and lightly asked. \u201cFellow Daoists, are you worried about the matter concerning the Nascent Divided Pearls as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though her words were directed at their entire group, her eyes were fixated on Yu Yan. She strangely blinked a lot more than normal, looking as though there were some things she wanted to say, but was too shy to do so. Clearly, Zhu Yao and Nangong Cheng were nearest to her, yet she covered a longer distance to ask her master. Zhu Yao\u2019s heart turned stiff for a moment as she took a step forward. What are you doing, huh? This man has an owner.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist, we are also worried about being unable to find helpers. Why don\u2019t we work together?\u201d The woman acted as though she did not see Zhu Yao, and continued to look at Yu Yan with a face filled with smiles. Her smile carried a hint of playfulness, like the typical neighbour\u2019s little daughter next door. As for the five men next to her, they were looking at her with coddling smiles the entire time.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan glanced at the person that suddenly barged her way in front of him and habitually frowned. The chilling air around his body grew a little heavier as he pulled over Nangong Cheng who was next to him. \u201cDecide.\u201d This is your job, why are you slacking?</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng: \u201c\u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t look for me, and you\u2019re blaming me?</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist, I\u2019m the captain of this squad. May I know what you mean by working together, young lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so you\u2019re the squad captain.\u201d The woman was stunned for a moment, and then her expression changed. Her face turned red from shyness, as she meekly glanced at Yu Yan. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2026\u201d With pure eyes similar to a fawn, and the hint of redness on her cheeks, her gesture could arouse the feelings of pity in every male creature\u2019s heart, making it unbearable for others to reprimand her for her actions. As a woman, Zhu Yao expressed that this was a skill that she hadn\u2019t witnessed before.</p><br/><p>As expected, Nangong Cheng\u2019s expression immediately softened. \u201cNo worries. Daoist, do you plan on grouping with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m Mei Xue, and I\u2019m a recent newcomer in the Amway Group as well. Ten Nascent Divided Pearls are simply too many. Also, the places with the Nascent Divided Pearls on the second floor are all extremely dangerous. That\u2019s why I wish to invite all of you to work together. May I know your answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng had a joyous look. The other party had six people, and including them, their numbers would total up to eleven. Their strength would ultimately double. Even if they had to face three demonic beasts at the same time, it wouldn\u2019t pose a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence, we wanted to find more people as well. Daoist Mei Xue, your invitation is well-timed. Let me discuss about this with my fellow teammates, as long as they\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI object.\u201d Zhu Yao raised her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly!\u201d Nangong was stunned for a moment.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao patted on Nangong Cheng\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSquad Captain Huang, you and Little Teal can join their squad. My master and I shall not intrude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that, Dongfang girly. We all came from the lower first floor together, so we\u2019re already considered to be tied by fate. Why do you want to leave?\u201d Also, I\u2019m not Squad Captain Huang.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to explain, Mei Xue suddenly stepped out and butted in. \u201cThis big sis\u2026 These Nascent Divided Pearls are very hard to obtain. With every new member, there will be a higher chance of success. Also, we have already been on this floor for several days, so we are extremely familiar with the terrain. With more helpers, we can definitely reach the third floor faster. Why is big sis making it difficult for your squad captain?\u201d She said with a painful expression, as though Zhu Yao\u2019s rejection towards teaming up with them was something unfair.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes this concern you?\u201d What does this have to do with you!? This person must be sick, right? Why the hell did you pull aggro towards me for no reason?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes. She did not have a good impression of her in the first place. This time, she couldn\u2019t be bothered to care about her and continued to speak with Nangong Cheng. \u201cSquad Captain Huang, the Nascent Divided Pearls of the second floor are not in secret realms, and there\u2019s no requirement of activating them altogether at once. Though the required amount is a little more than before, it isn\u2019t impossible for us to gather them all slowly by ourselves. For now, I have no intentions of forming another group, let us say our goodbyes here then.\u201d Actually, when she saw the information earlier, she already had the intention of moving alone. The hatred towards Lightning Divine Palace was simply too large, if they were to move together, not only wouldn\u2019t they be able to cast lightning-type arts, there might be possibilities that they would be exposed somehow. If it was just her and her master, then they wouldn\u2019t have much scruples about such things.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Mei Xue realized that they were truly intent on leaving. She suddenly stepped forward and tugged onto her sleeves. \u201cBig sis, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Zhu Yao interrupted her. \u201cOne, I don\u2019t have a younger sister. Two, you already said that you\u2019ve been on this second floor for several days. It\u2019s my first day today, and I\u2019ve never heard of you in the Divine Realm either, which proves that your stay here in the tower is much longer than mine, so you\u2019re definitely older than me. Calling me big sis\u2026 don\u2019t you feel you\u2019re acting a little too cutesy? Third, this is our first encounter, so why the hell are you pestering me this much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mei Xue\u2019s face stiffened, and suddenly, her eyes reddened, as though she had just suffered some great injustice. Zhu Yao instantly received five sets of killing intent from behind. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m doing it for your own good too. I want everyone to be together\u2026 If big sis isn\u2019t willing, then I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Xue\u2019er.\u201d A green-robed man on her right suddenly stepped out. He glared at Zhu Yao for a moment, and then coldly snorted. \u201cIn this world, there are always such people who are blind and do not know their place. Not everyone is as kind as you. You do not have to feel sad for such people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The hell. I just want to leave the party, and I\u2019m not leaving your party either. How am I blind and unaware of my place? Who are these brain-deficient people?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d Mei Xue shook her head. Then, she looked at Zhu Yao again and said. \u201cI just feel that big sis will definitely regret her insistence on acting alone, and it will definitely implicate the Daoist that is with you.\u201d She then looked at Yu Yan with sincere eyes. \u201cThis Daoist, I hope that you think this through as well. The second floor cannot be compared to the first floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho!\u201d Zhu Yao side-stepped and stood in front of her master. Those eyes of hers gave Zhu Yao the feeling that she was being robbed. \u201cFrom what you\u2019re saying, for someone like me who insists of working alone, all the more I shouldn\u2019t join your group and drag all of you down. Shouldn\u2019t you thank me for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mei Xue was stunned for a moment, and instantly, her eyes turned even redder. Her expression grew even pitiful than before and the glittering from the reflection of tears could be seen. \u201cI\u2026 I, big sis doesn\u2019t like Mei Xue? Is that why you don\u2019t agree to teaming up with my group?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Zhu Yao nodded.</p><br/><p>Everyone present was dumbfounded. No one had expected that she would admit it so directly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you!\u201d Zhu Yao seriously said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where you come from, yet you insist of preventing me from leaving. There must be something wrong with me if I were to like you. I thought you knew, but you actually didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The green-robed male Deity from earlier was instantly enraged. \u201cYou dare to be impolite towards Xue\u2019er!\u201d In an instant, a powerful pressure came pressing down at her, and it was filled with killing intent.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. She never expected that he would attack her so straightforwardly, and she couldn\u2019t react at that moment. Just as the pressure was about to land on her, the side of her waist tightened as she was pulled directly into Yu Yan\u2019s embrace. In the next moment, an even more powerful pressure that carried a chilling intent was sent back. In an instant, a terrifying aura enveloped the entire Amway Hall. The green-robed male Deity was unable to stabilize himself, and he puked out a mouthful of blood from the divine energy rebound.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Ye Yu!\u201d Mei Xue cried out in surprise. She hurriedly held onto him before he could fall onto the ground. The others were not in great shape either. Though the pressure was not targeted at them, their hearts clenched, and cold sweat dripped down.</p><br/><p>The other four men instantly paled as they looked at Yu Yan with bewildered eyes. Someone who had just arrived on the second floor actually had such incredible strength.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan coldly glared at the crowd. In an instant, the temperature of the room fell by a few degrees. \u201cArgument, yes. Fight, no!\u201d Daring to injure his disciple right in front of him, were they treating him as blind?</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone present did not utter a sound. The few men with peerless looks especially had heavy expressions on their faces. The female Deity called Mei Xue on the other hand, had a hint of dazzling light flashing past her eyes as she looked at Yu Yan. Then, the light immediately disappeared as she changed into a worried expression and held onto the injured green-robed male Deity. Zhu Yao frowned. A strange feeling welled inside her the depths of her heart. She faintly sensed that something was amiss, but she couldn\u2019t figure it out.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan turned around, looked at Nangong Cheng, and coldly spoke these two words. \u201cLeaving group!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Nangong Cheng was stunned for a moment, and then he immediately nodded. \u201cOu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not stay for idle chatter either. He grabbed onto his disciple and left. This time, their exit was a success with no one daring to stop them. See? Who says violence can\u2019t solve problems?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>They flew straight towards a forest south of the divine city, seeking the whereabouts of the Nascent Divided Pearls. Recalling the incident from earlier, the strange feeling in the depths of Zhu Yao\u2019s heart grew even heavier. That Mei Xue was constantly giving her a strange familiar feeling, especially that party configuration consisting of five men and one woman.</p><br/><p>The looks and demeanour of those five male Deities were all decent. Even in the Divine Realm where the people\u2019s appearances were beautiful to the point of being off the charts, they were considered to in the upper tier, and they were not lacking much compared to her master either. Furthermore, their levels were all three, which meant that they were leaders in their own rights on this second floor. She just couldn\u2019t figure out why they would bring along Mei Xue who was level one.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! Mei Xue was level one! When Zhu Yao noticed her level, she was shocked as well. She was the first level one player that Zhu Yao saw in this lower second floor. Furthermore, from the eyes of those few men, they were not your average companions among Daoists. Instead, they looked like\u2026 the eyes of lovers! Five to one, uh\u2026 their taste was incredibly heavy.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this the standard of a Mary Sue story?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stopped her feet, as something rang in her mind. She linked up the clues and figured out what this strange feeling was. She was too similar to Yi Ling from before. They both had appearances of a white flower, they both had the Mary Sue attribute, and they were both surrounded by a bunch of men that would die for their sakes. Furthermore, they both wanted to pull beautiful men into their harems at first sight. However, why didn\u2019t her face have the word \u2018bug\u2019 on it?</p><br/><p>She was simply walking on the harem route, but not the world destruction route? Or was the Lightning Divine Tower a separate world? Why did she feel that a person like that was even more terrifying!? That girl\u2019s a human-shaped biological weapon that attracts attention wherever she goes!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d She pulled the man next to her and hugged him tight. Raising her head, she said with a stern tone. \u201cPromise me, just like how the Fifth Prince promised Xiao Yanzi, cherish your disciple and stay far away from Mary Sue Mei Xue, alright?\u201d If you dare to have a change of heart, I will take my revenge on society.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was stunned for a moment. He looked at stupid disciple a little strangely, and then, with a frown, he asked. \u201cWho is Mei Xue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright then. Face-blindness saves the world.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She took a step forward, as if wanting to tug him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a step to the side, cutting in. It blocked her line of vision from Little Bai.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Qu Yi glared at her a little furiously, feeling irritated from being blocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, fellow junior-martial niece.\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled in her face, and then glanced at Ye Qingcang at the side. \u201cAs a human, you shouldn\u2019t be too greedy. If there are things that you can\u2019t give, then you best state them clearly, don\u2019t be ambiguous till the end. From where I come from, there\u2019s a special way of addressing such people, and it doesn\u2019t sound good. You definitely won\u2019t like it at all.\u201d It\u2019s called \u2018Green Tea Bitch\u2019, and I hope you\u2019re not one. \u201cSo, if you can\u2019t give promises, at the very least, give him freedom. If you don\u2019t like him, don\u2019t destroy him either, alright? After all, he has been a senior-martial brother of yours for more than ten years.\u201d This sort of ambiguous attitude was the most hurtful of all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Qu Yi\u2019s expression was a little pale, as if she had understood something. Slowly, she lowered her head. \u201cI will tell him clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d It seemed like there was still hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand-martial aunt\u2026\u201d Ye Qingcang was a little anxious as he took a step forward. \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand, I and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Zhu Yao raised her palm, signalling him to pause and stopping his attempt at explaining. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to tell me, you should be telling Little Bai instead. You guys decide on your own, it doesn\u2019t concern me. However\u2026 You best tell him clearly. If you delay it for too long and make Little Bai cry\u2026\u201d Her tone suddenly turned chilly. \u201cI will smack you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, without looking at the expressions they were making, she turned around and followed after the stupid celestial crane that was still circling in the sky.</p><br/><p>Qu Yi was destined to be Ye Qingcang\u2019s girly. Even though there was a change in the scenario, the two of them still ended up walking on the same path. This meant that Little Bai was destined to be cannon fodder as well. They were still young, and their feelings had just budded. Rather than feeling pain and bitterness in the future, he should instead extract himself before his feelings grow deeper. After all, it was best to suffer for a short while than an eternity.</p><br/><p>Not to mention that it was not appropriate for her to step directly into this matter as well. The only thing she could do was give pointers at the right time. And, she was able to see through the girly\u2019s heart with a single glance. On one hand, she could not bear to disregard her feelings for Little Bai as childhood friends, and on the other, she was beginning to love Ye Qingcang. She was confused as well, yet she did not want to let go of either side. Initially, she had wanted to let things drag on like this till she could make a decision on her own. However, when that time comes, most likely, someone would be hurt to the very end. This was why Zhu Yao stimulated her a little.</p><br/><p>And it seemed the girly Qu Yi was not a bad person in nature, as she understood Zhu Yao\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister, catch it!\u201d The moment Zhu Yao returned to Skybond Peak, she was met with a green ball pouncing at her.</p><br/><p>She caught it with a swipe of her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeapea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea\u2026\u201d The pea cried out, desperately rubbing her chest. As it made \u2018pea pea\u2019 sounds, it began to emit streams water, drenching her entire body.</p><br/><p>Was it\u2026 crying?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>A short-clawed little Phoenix, clad in red feathers, came charging out of the house. Its two eyes shone as it looked at the pea in her hands. It pushed its little wings towards its plump belly and rubbed it. After a long while, a fiery light flashed. A ball of flames the size of a fist was summoned, and the little Phoenix immediately waved its wings and flapped them towards her. \u201cSeventh elder sister, hold it tight. I\u2019m going to fry and eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea\u2026\u201d The pea trembled, even more water streamed out of its body, instantly turning her into a drenched chicken.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply snapped her fingers, extinguishing the fiery spark which Little Eighth on managed to ignite after much effort, and looked at him with a deadpan look. \u201cLittle Eighth, stop fooling around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister, you\u2019re so biased!\u201d Little Eighth complained, as he pointed at the pea in her hand and said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even let me eat a pea. You\u2019re mistreating an underaged little animal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao flicked her finger on his forehead, and Little Eighth was flipped away like an angry little bird. Mn, the same red one.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. Peapea has just awakened its spiritual intellect, so it has limited intelligence. Don\u2019t scare it every single day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Eighth only managed to crawl up after rolling a few rounds. He furiously glanced at the pea which was pouring out water on her hand. Then, he coldly snorted and turned his head around, yet he did not come chasing after it any further.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will let you go for today!\u201d He looked as though he was saving his elder seventh sister some face.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt her head aching. She wondered just what was wrong with Little Eighth? When she was looking after him, he had behaved pretty well. From how he had lived through two lifetimes, even if had yet to turn into a mature adult, he could still be considered as a teenage Phoenix. However, whenever he were to spot Peapea, he would go crazy, thinking of all methods possible to scare it, making it run and jump about. It was still fine in the beginning, as he was just the size of her palm. Even if he wanted to, he wouldn\u2019t be able to bite through it, and the pea was not bothered by his actions either. In these few days, he had doubled in size, and he had restored some of his godly energy as well. And it was only then did he begin to have some twisted thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister.\u201d Little Eighth came to rub the little pea again with his claw, and said in a mysterious manner. \u201cWhen do you think will the Far Ancient Highgod come out from this stupid pea?\u201d</p><br/><p>When? When she calls for her master, of course. Zhu Yao inspected Little Eighth for a moment. \u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d</p><br/><p>He slightly turned his head away, and said in a slightly flustered tone. \u201cI\u2026 I have a few matters, that\u2026 that I want to ask, that\u2019s all. He\u2019s a Highgod, so he should know everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. \u201cLittle Eighth, he\u2019s not the Far Ancient Highgod.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Ah?\u201d Little Eighth was startled for a moment, and then he anxiously said. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly the Highgod, and elder seventh sister calls him master as well. So how is he not the Far Ancient Highgod?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed my master.\u201d Zhu Yao sighed, explaining. \u201cHowever, he\u2019s not my teacher. He\u2019s my master, Yu Yan, not the Far Ancient Highgod. Teacher, he\u2026\u201d She paused for a moment, before continuing shortly after. \u201cTeacher\u2026 is no longer here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Eighth lowered his head in disappointment, his entire being looked a little greyish as he softly muttered. \u201cIf the Highgod isn\u2019t here anymore, who should I ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what do you want to know?\u201d Zhu Yao stroked his feathers. \u201cTell seventh elder sister. I might know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Eighth raised his head and glanced at her, before turning away again immediately after. He continued to mutter. \u201cTch, even a smart and handsome Phoenix like me doesn\u2019t know about it, how can you know when you\u2019re this ugly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her hand and slapped at his little bird head. Watch what you\u2019re saying!</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya!\u201d Little Eighth hugged his head with his two wings and sprinted a few steps away, carrying a complaining expression. \u201cSeventh elder sister, you can\u2019t blame me for being ugly though?\u201d</p><br/><p>Haah, look at this temper of mine!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have the guts, don\u2019t run!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little red bird sprinted away, immediately disappearing from sight.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t let me catch you again!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao glared at the direction he ran off too, and then looked at the pea in her hand. Just as she was about to call her master out to discuss some matters, her divine sense unconsciously picked up the presence of someone outside the door. Furthermore, it was someone she knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand-martial aunt, disciple Ye Qingcang wishes to consult you on a matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was the bugged student here? Didn\u2019t they separate just earlier?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart was filled with doubts. Keeping the pea, she walked out.</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang was presently waiting outside the door, though his brows were tightly knitted, looking as though he had heavy matters in his heart. It can\u2019t be something related to the girly Qu Yi right? Could it be that the girly Qu Yi gave up on him and chose Little Bai? This isn\u2019t in the scenario!</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand-martial aunt!\u201d Seeing her appearance, Ye Qingcang\u2019s brows relaxed a little, as he then proceeded to give her a respectful bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something you need from me?\u201d Speak then, is there something you\u2019re not happy about? Speak about it and entertain me a little. I specialize in comforting broken-hearted youths the most.</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang hesitated for a short while, his face carried a complicated expression. \u201cThis disciple has a matter that has been swaying within his heart. I hope that grand-martial aunt is able to point me out of this maze.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>His brows furrowed even further, as he scanned his surroundings a little anxiously. It looked like he was a little afraid of something?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao waved her hand and placed down a formation, isolating their auras and figures. She secretly shook her head in her heart. Youths and their need to save faces these days! Why can\u2019t they think about it logically? They\u2019re not even superstars, so why would anyone be interested in their love lives?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you speak now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang gritted his teeth. As though he finally managed to resolve himself, he took out round cup-shaped mystic artifact from his robe.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh!?\u201d The token of love with the girly Qu Yi? Why did she feel it looked a little familiar?</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny, to tell you the truth, I picked this up after separating from you and senior-martial brother Bai in the secret realm back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. She sternly stared at the cup-shaped mystic artifact. \u201cMedicine King Furnace!\u201d The hell, wasn\u2019t this the male protagonist\u2019s pellet refining divine artifact?</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny, you know about this artifact?\u201d Ye Qingcang had a stunned look.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Not only was she aware of it, she had seen it countless times during her precognitive dream, alright? \u201cThe Medicine King Furnace can increase the chances of refining pellets by three times, and it can be considered as a divine artifact. Since you are able to turn it so small, most likely, you have already formed a blood contract with it. You can now store it in your divine sense, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang was startled for a moment, as though he never expected that she would know about it so clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou picked this up at that secret realm. A place like that\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at him, and continued. \u201cYou want to ask if anything will happen to you after forming a blood contract with it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang paled, as he explained immediately. \u201cGranny\u2026 I did not hide this from you intentionally, I simply had yet to make certain of what it was, and my blood accidentally sprinkled on it. I have only discovered it in my divine sense recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be this anxious!\u201d Zhu Yao felt he was a little hilarious. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have a duty to report every single thing to me. I won\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny\u2026\u201d He had a complicated look, as though he did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Zhu Yao patted on his shoulders. It was something that should belong to him in the first place. Even after making a detour, he still ended up picking it up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, that pervert from the secret realm\u2026 Uh, I\u2019m talking about the heretic practitioner who refined beasts. Even though he\u2019s not a good person at all, this is a good artifact, so you should keep it with an ease of mind. There isn\u2019t any bad aura emitting out from it, so it shouldn\u2019t affect you in any bad way. In the future, you must become a Pellet Refining Meister, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang was stunned for a moment, as though he never expected that she would so easily dispel the worries he had for such a long time. Actually, ever since he bound this furnace, he faintly sensed that it was an extraordinary artifact. However, because he was truly afraid that it would adversely affect his body, he had been hesitant talking about this matter. He was afraid that it would arouse the greed of others, and there was not many people he could trust around him either. After hesitating for a long while, he realized that he could only consult the granny who had constantly protected him in the secret realm.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had thought that even if she would not have greedy intentions, at the very least, she would be angry at him for concealing this matter. He never expected that she wouldn\u2019t mind in the slightest and would easily gloss over it. Not even the slightest bit of desire could be seen in her eyes, as if she would still stay unconcerned no matter how heaven-defying an artifact he were to pick up. For a moment, he was joyous in his heart, yet he faintly felt an indescribable disappointment as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny\u2026 Actually, other than this furnace, I picked up something else as well.\u201d He could not help but blurt out the words which he had never prepared to say even if he were to be beaten to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething else?\u201d He couldn\u2019t be referring to the inheritance of that Pellet Hall, right?</p><br/><p>He then took up that small jade tablet as well. \u201cThere\u2019s a few pellet recipes and pellet refining techniques within.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d It was that inheritance alright. \u201cThen work hard, youngling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang was stunned. He was unable to believe his ears a little. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Confused, Zhu Yao inspected him a little. What else do you want? You can\u2019t possibly want me to sponsor you, right? Right, he has been calling me granny after all.</p><br/><p>Gritting her teeth, she silently pulled out a spirit stone tile. After pulling it out from the floor of the great hall with great effort, she stuffed it in his hands, and said in a meaningful manner. \u201cYoungling, I can only support you this much. Go buy some medicinal ingredients used to raise your cultivation then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He looked at her dumbfoundedly.</p><br/><p>Could it be that it still wasn\u2019t enough? Hey! Learn how to be content with what you have, youngling!</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t have anymore!\u201d It\u2019s really troublesome to pull out another tile back there!</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang looked at her dumbfoundedly for a moment. Suddenly, he burst into laughter, and it grew even louder as time went by. In the end, he ended up bending down from the pain caused by the unceasing laughter.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. Why did she feel irritated?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, youngling, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Give this elderly some face. What\u2019s with you? Laughing in such a manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny, granny\u2026\u201d He finally managed to curb his laughter. As he shook his head, with slight clear-mindedness and self-depreciation, he said. \u201cGranny, you sure\u2026 made this Qingcang\u2026 feel ashamed, really ashamed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Earlier, he was actually worried that she would lust for his possessions, afraid that she would kill him and snatch away his treasures. Looking at it now, it sure was laughable. Most likely, only those who had darkness in their own hearts would feel that others were the same, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Zhu Yao glared at him a little irritatedly.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath, straightened his face, and bowed respectfully. \u201cThank you, granny, for your teachings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d What did I teach?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disciple shall take his leave.\u201d However, he did not plan on speaking any further, as he turned around and headed down the mountain.</p><br/><p>Leaving behind a confused Zhu Yao. The hell did he come here for? Just to flaunt his cheats?</p><br/><p>So what!</p><br/><p>As expected, bugs are really hateful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 plans do you have this time?\u201d A white figure appeared next to Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan glanced at the figure that just left, and then stroked his disciple\u2019s hair. Just as he was about to release his hand, he pondered for a moment before reaching out to her hand at the side, their fingers intertwined.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao turned around and pounced into his chest. With a tired heart, she leaned on his shoulder. She needed to draw in some energy. \u201cHaah, the younglings today are getting harder to manage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pouted. \u201cHe\u2019s a good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause he can\u2019t be said to be a bad person, you can\u2019t make a move on him?\u201d Yu Yan sighed. Even if he were to be a bad person, as long as her bottom line was not crossed, this stupid disciple of his would still not bear to make a move, right? He once again turned to glance at the youth who had just left, frowning. The eyes that brat had for his disciple earlier, were something he did not like very much.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

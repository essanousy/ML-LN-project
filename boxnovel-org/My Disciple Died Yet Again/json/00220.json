Why was she seeing Yi Ling hugging her thigh?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her hand and desperately pressed on the \u2018Off\u2019 button for her World Favourable Impression ability. Hurry and revert back to normal, hey.</p><br/><p>Though the World Favourable Impression ability had turned off, Yi Ling did not undergo any change at all. She shyly raised her head and glanced at Zhu Yao. \u201cIn this vast sea of people, for us to be able to meet, Ling\u2019er has no regrets in life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou made a mistake, right?\u201d Don\u2019t say such strange things, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible? I can make mistakes recognizing everyone in this world, but only senior-martial sister Zhu\u2026\u201d Her face was ripe red like an apple. \u201cLing\u2019er\u2026 will never forget her entire life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt her skin crawling from the bottom of her feet all the way to the top of her head, and her entire body trembled. She grabbed onto Yi Ling\u2019s shoulders, and instantly shook her back and forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Ling, are you alright? Hurry and wake up! Don\u2019t scare me!\u201d What happened to the promised Mary Sue? This is not a yuri novel, hey.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were instantly filled with gratitude, and her smile was now overflowing with gentleness. \u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu be at ease, Ling\u2019er is now alright. All thanks to senior-martial sister protecting me at the side, Ling\u2019er was finally able to successfully form her Azoth Core.\u201d After saying that, she shyly looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 actually so worried about me\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 so happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why the hell are you happy!? I\u2019m not happy, alright? \u201cI beg you, act normal! Behave like the Mary Sue you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>This girly is definitely infected by the World Favourable Impression ability, it has to be, right!?</p><br/><p>Yi Ling was wildly shaken by her, and even her hair bun had collapsed as well, however, she still said without any regrets. \u201cSince senior-martial sister doesn\u2019t allow me to say it, then\u2026 The good things that you did for me, Ling\u2019er will remember them by heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>What do you want to remember? Don\u2019t remember some strange things, hey!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao even had the thought of stomping her feet now. Could anyone explain to her why the World Favourable Impression ability did not discriminate its targets!? At the very least, consider the other party\u2019s gender!</p><br/><p>Sesame was also shocked by this incredible development, as it glanced at the two of them back and forth. \u201cMistress?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me right now!\u201d Zhu Yao placed her two hands on her head, then proceeded to squat down at the corner of a wall and draw circles. Her entire body emitted out an aura of fatigue. \u201cI only want peace and quiet right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Ling\u2019s face instantly paled, and within her eyes, tears began to swell. \u201cWho is Peacent Quiet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Puaah\u2026</p><br/><p>Please let me puke out blood in peace!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026 Master! I don\u2019t want to live anymore.\u201d After throwing Yi Ling back to the crowd of practitioners, Zhu Yao flew back to the mustard seed dimensional space Yu Yan was in, and pounced into her master\u2019s arms. The various grievances and frustration came tumbling out from her lips. \u201cMaster\u2026 I feel that my morals have received hundred percent damage, directly shattered into pieces, and can never be restored!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan casually caught her, and habitually combed her messy hair with his fingers. WIth a stern look, he said. \u201cMorals? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She was actually left speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah! I don\u2019t care anymore, whatever the case, my heart has suffered a severe blow.\u201d Zhu Yao sniffled, and buried herself in his chest, forcefully rubbing about. She then casually pulled over his wide sleeves to wipe her face. After a long while, she finally found some comfort.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan whose entire body was covered with tears and snot: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He helplessly sighed, as though he had already gotten used to his disciple\u2019s strange antics that occur from time to time, and then cast a Dirt Removal Art on himself. He habitually pulled his stupid disciple\u2019s hand, and checked her pulse. He then asked in passing. \u201cHow\u2019s the situation of the beast wave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Zhu Yao could reply, Yu Yan\u2019s expression suddenly changed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the object within your divine sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>Raising his finger, he tapped onto her forehead. Then with a wave of his hand, two rays of light instantly flew out, and a black fruit and a rainbow-colored feather floated in the air.</p><br/><p>She had almost forgotten about the exact matter at hand!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao hurriedly recounted everything that happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, help me take a look, will Yue Ying be fine?\u201d The reason why she was here was mainly for Yue Ying. Although she could feel his presence within the fruit, she was unable to feel at ease.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. Looking at his stupid disciple\u2019s worried expression, he was feeling irritated for some reason. The cold aura from his body unconsciously began to suffuse into the air.</p><br/><p>So unhappy. Why did he have to attend to an irrelevant\u2026 fruit?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Zhu Yao tugged onto his sleeves. Why did she suddenly feel a little chilly?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan furrowed his brows, and only after a while did he coldly voice out. \u201cHe has simply depleted his spiritual energy, and has reverted back to his true form. He will naturally be fine after recovering his spiritual energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed like she had to once again bury Yue Ying back into the hole. \u201cIt\u2019s good that he\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao.\u201d Yu Yan glanced at Yue Ying who was in a fruit state, and his expression instantly turned cold. With a stern look, he said. \u201cDivine sense is where the core of human life resides. In the future, remember not to simply store anything within your divine sense.\u201d Especially if it\u2019s an irrelevant man.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just anxious.\u201d Back then, she simply wanted to find a safe place to settle Yue Ying down, so she unconsciously stored him within her divine sense.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan stroked her head, and said sternly. \u201cThere must not be a next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Zhu Yao nodded, and with a wave of her hand, that feather in the air flew towards her palm on its own. \u201cMaster, take a look at this too. Just what is this? Back then when I saw that Devil use it, it seemed to be a flute, but when I was using it, it turned into a sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan lowered his head and inspected it for a moment. \u201cThis feather\u2026 Seems to be a feather of a certain species of birds. The spiritual energy stored within can\u2019t be estimated, and it\u2019s also another god\u2019s artifact\u2026 If your master did not make a mistake, then this should be the tailed feather of a Phoenix, and Ruling Plume is its name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe tail feather of a Phoenix!\u201d Zhu Yao was startled. She then carefully inspected this feather. With her master\u2019s reminder, she began to find it even more familiar. Recalling the appearance of a Phoenix\u2019s true form, there was indeed a tail feather like this. As someone who was a former false Phoenix with naked buttocks, she not being able to recognize it at first glance could certainly be said to be\u2026 acceptable! ORZ</p><br/><p>\u201cThis tail feather has left its original body, but it still contains spirituality. Most probably, this artifact is refined by gathering all of the energy within the body of the original Phoenix who possessed it back then. And your strength has increased because of this god\u2019s artifact as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d What did he mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao, you\u2019re already a Demigod.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled, and then she hurriedly looked within her. As expected, the Azoth Core in her body had disappeared, and her divine sense was as vast as a sea. Now she understood a little why that Chow Chow Lin Qi could be beaten into a pup by her. Recalling that prior event, her master seemed to have also restored his own cultivation because of obtaining that god\u2019s artifact, then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis tail feather has turned into my life artifact as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank. \u201cNo, it did not!\u201d</p><br/><p>+_+ What\u2019s with this special treatment!?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only owner that this tail feather recognizes, is the God that it got plucked out from!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mn, she really wanted to find the bird that shed this feather, and chat with him about life!</p><br/><p>Returning to Blue Parasol Sect, Zhu Yao once again buried Yue Ying in the hole at the back, removed the weed in passing, and sprinkled some water. Then, she reinforced the surrounding spiritual energy gathering formation. Confirming that Yue Ying was slowly recovering his spiritual energy, he heaved a sigh of relief. Though he had turned back into his original form, at the very least, his Foundation was not damaged. As long as recovery was done well, he would still be a good fruit in the upcoming year.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered for a moment, then she added another defensive formation at the side. Now it was perfect. Yue Ying, my obedient child, hurry and grow up into a healthy and handsome young man.</p><br/><p>Raising her head, she glanced at the surroundings. She wondered if it was her imagination, but she felt that the two trees at the side had turned a little greener. Furthermore, they didn\u2019t seem to be bearing fruits earlier, so why were the trees filled with fruits now?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, she\u2019s looking at me, she\u2019s looking at me now! I want to bear fruits for her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hualala\u2026</p><br/><p>In an instant, red fruits came dropping down like raindrops, smashing onto Zhu Yao\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Do you two have a grudge against me? The moment I return, you two smash my head with fruits.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, umm\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao used her legs to sweep the fruits on the ground, and walked over. Looking towards the tree on the left, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re called Tree on the Left, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaahh\u2026 She\u2019s talking to me, she\u2019s actually talking to me.\u201d The tree on the left wildly shook its leaves from excitement, while its branches were wobbling left and right like they were suffering from spasms, acting as though it was a fan who was looking at an idol of hers.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, and had no choice but to look at the one on the right. \u201cYou\u2019re called Tree on the Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah\u2026 She\u2019s talking to me too. I like you, you know? I really, really like you.\u201d The tree on the right waved its branches, but at the very least it was calmer than the one on the left, and it replied. \u201cIn the past, I was called Tree on the Right, but I have already changed my name. I\u2019m now called Tree on the Right Side of the Hole.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Tree on the Left Side of the Hole!\u201d The other one excitedly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d With you two combined together, are you two called Trees with Holes on Both Sides of the Brain? Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. \u201cUmm\u2026 I have presumptuous request, and I wonder if I can ask that of you two\u2026 trees.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words fell, the two trees were startled for a moment. Then, in the next moment, the trees were blooming with little red flowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, she\u2019s actually saying that we can help her. Aaaaah\u2026 I\u2019m not dreaming, am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will help, we will help. We want to help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Did they have to be this excited about it? \u201cYou two saw it as well, I buried a fruit into the hole. He\u2019s someone very important to me, so I hope you two can help look after him, and prevent anyone else from approaching. Is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Tree on the Right Side of the Hole instantly straightened itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will definitely look after him well.\u201d The Tree on the Left Side of the Hole silently stretched its roots out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will not allow anyone to dig it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a piece of cake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s good, thank you!\u201d Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. With this two trees keeping watch at every moment, she felt more at ease.</p><br/><p>Just as she was planning to return back into the house, an extremely gentle voice sounded from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, Senior-martial sister Zhu, you have returned?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s feet slipped, and had almost fell onto the ground. Looking at the happy figure running towards the door, her skin began to crawl again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over!\u201d Zhu Yao erected a defensive barrier on reflex. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Ling was startled, a hint of pain flashed past her eyes as she looked at Zhu Yao with a wronged look. \u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu\u2026 Do you have to be this cautious around me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Zhu Yao nodded sternly.</p><br/><p>Her expression worsened even more. \u201cBack then\u2026 they were all Ling\u2019er\u2019s fault. I\u2026 I didn\u2019t have a clear mind back then, that\u2019s why\u2026 Senior-martial sister Zhu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Please, stop saying anything that\u2019s immoral again. Zhu Yao wanted to cry, but no tears were flowing. \u201cJust why are you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Ling was startled, and only then did she recall her business here. With an excited look, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s master and the Sovereigns. They had me request Zhu Yao\u2026 request Lord to the main hall and discuss some serious matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord? Me?\u201d When did she change her title?</p><br/><p>Yi Ling nodded, her expression was filled with adoration, and she looked at Zhu Yao with sparkling eyes. \u201cLord, please do not blame me! I know you\u2019re trying to conceal your identity, and help our Blue Parasol Sect secretly, so you have always showed yourself with Foundation and Azoth cultivation levels. But the incident where you\u2026 saved me, I have already told my master. And when you sent me home back then, you didn\u2019t conceal your cultivation level, so everyone witnessed it. You\u2019re a Lord at the Demigod cultivation level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d So they actually think that the reason I\u2019m suddenly a Demigod, is because I have been concealing my cultivation level the entire time, and was just intentionally acting like an Azoth practitioner!? She had to hand it to them, the holes in their brains\u2026 had widened at just the perfect time!</p><br/><p>Then, calling her to the main hall this time was most definitely to rein her in. After all, till now, she had yet to see any sect or clan with a Demigod practitioner. She suddenly felt she could act a little proud now?</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026 Let\u2019s go then!\u201d Although she had already dealt with Lin Qi, for some reasons, the word \u2018bug\u2019 on Yi Ling\u2019s face had still yet to disappear. In other words, Zhu Yao still had to stay in Blue Parasol Sect. Then, she could just treat it as though she was going to give face to the master of this land, and see what they were up to.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, this way.\u201d Yi Ling became serious and polite as well, as she respectfully brought her towards the teleportation formation to the main hall.</p><br/><p>WIth a flash of red light, the scenery in front of her eyes changed. In an instant, they had arrived at the square of the main hall.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was instantly frightened by the scene in front of her. The entire square was littered with black dots, filled with standing disciples. By her estimate, there were at least more than five thousand people, and they were moving the same way, wearing the same uniform. They stood straight in a disciplined and orderly manner.</p><br/><p>The entire square was completely silent. Xuan Xu and the other two Nascent Soul practitioners, along with Sect Master Lin Yu, were standing at the very front. Seeing Zhu Yao\u2019s appearance, their eyes evidently shone. The four of them hurriedly stepped up, cupped their fists, bent their waist ninety degrees, and loudly shouted in unison. \u201cWe disciples greet the Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>When their words fell, in an instant, as though the loudspeakers were turned on, the several thousands of disciples in the square were like toppled onions, as all of them knelt onto the ground, and loudly shouted in unison. \u201cWe disciples greet the Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>The magnificence of this scene and their deafening voices simply could intensely stir the hearts of people from inside out.</p><br/><p>Thus, Zhu Yao unconsciously stretched out her hands and waved, and she replied with overflowing kindness. \u201cMy faithful subjects, raise your heads!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Yu: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuan Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The other Nascent Soul practitioner with an unknown name: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd of disciples: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell, it was on reflex! She even thought that she was stepping up to take the throne!</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 All of you please rise?\u201d Zhu Yao wiped away the beads of sweat that were falling from her forehead due to awkwardness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The leading four people straightened their waists. Sect Master Lin Yu then waved his hand to the back, and the crowd of disciples finally stood up one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something you people are seeking me for?\u201d Once again she wore that proud and cold mask of hers, as though that idiot earlier wasn\u2019t her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord.\u201d Lin Yu respectfully bowed, and with his hand raised, he did a \u2018please, this way\u2019 posture. \u201cThis disciple indeed has things to consult about, and I hope Lord will enter the hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The large group of people in front of her suddenly created a path in the middle, which was directly leading her all the way to the entrance of the great hall.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her feet and walked over. After walking up the steps, she then turned around to look at the crowd of disciples who were still as excited and curious as before. Waving her hands, she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe audie- Uhh\u2026 The rest can leave now.\u201d The hell, she almost told them that the audience with the empress had ended!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

My dad said, a man must be upright, so\u2026 I will take responsibility. Along our way here, I have already decided that, if I happen to get selected, I will definitely bring you along!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was even more mystified. This little wimp couldn\u2019t be referring to\u2026 her smacking his buttocks, right? Because she touched his buttocks, he decided that he had to take responsibility? For a moment, Zhu Yao was at a loss of words. Little wimp, at such a young age, you actually have such a large hole in your brain. Does your parents know about it?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn\u2026 In any case, I will definitely not throw you aside!\u201d Little wimp stamped his feet, and he began to look even more awkward.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly felt like teasing him a little. \u201cThen, what will you do if you did not get selected?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little wimp startled for a moment. Scratching his head, his small lips evidently began to pout unhappily, as though he was a little discontented with her distrustful attitude. He snorted, \u201cIf I had not been selected, I would still take responsibility. Once I grow up, I will definitely marry you.\u201d Before Zhu Yao could even feel moved, he raised his head, looked at her, and added another line, \u201cAs my concubine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bloody hell! I really feel like beating him up so badly, to the point his mother won\u2019t be able to recognize him! As though little wimp knew that she would get angry, he turned around, sprinted off and squeezed into the bunch of kids on the stage. He even turned back and made a face at her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao clenched her fists, and endured. Little wimp, just you wait. After this, I guarantee I won\u2019t beat you to death. Taking a few deep breaths, she calmed her emotions down. Looking down to the stage below, the queue did not look like it would be decreasing any time soon, as there were even more people joining in. However, the number of children staying on the stage, were still not as many.</p><br/><p>Including little wimp, there were still not even ten of them. It seemed like children who possess Spirit Veins were extremely small in number, giving a rough estimate, not even one in a hundred possess one. And, among them, children with Tetra and Penta Spirit Veins made up a larger number.</p><br/><p>Looking at the floating ball at the side, Zhu Yao could not help but grow a little curious. Not only could it float by itself, it was able to change in color. Earlier, when little beggar touched it, it was green and gold in color, while it turned red when little wimp touched it. She wondered what color it would be if she were to touch it.</p><br/><p>Out of curiosity, she stretched out a single finger, and poked it. In an instant, multiple colors began to spiral within the ball. Green, blue, gold, orange, and red. Five different colors instantly filled the entire ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cPenta Spirit Veins.\u201d The middle-aged man in-charge of the test, noticed her small movement, but was not angry at all. There would always be parents who could not contain their curiosity, and wanted to test for their own Spirit Veins as well. He had already grown accustomed to it. And this person was the lady who brought the talented boy with the Heavenly Spirit Vein, naturally, he would not fuss about it. She even possessed Spirit Veins as well, but unfortunately, it was the worst Penta Spirit Veins, and she was already at such an old age, even if she were to start cultivating now, her prospects of becoming a deity were hopeless.</p><br/><p>Hearing \u201cPenta Spirit Veins\u201d from him, Zhu Yao sighed. She was after all, someone who crossed over from another world. She thought that she would possess some overly exaggerated, heaven-bending Spirit Vein, but it was actually the worst Penta Spirit Veins. It seemed like the peasant life was still the most suitable route for her to take. But God sure was petty. Why did he not give her a Spirit Vein that\u2019s a tad bit special!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little disappointed. Just as she was about to retract her finger, suddenly, the ball which was already filled with five different colors began to stir. The five colors mixed about, a small little flash of lightning suddenly appeared, and it began to spread to the entire ball. Suddenly, with a \u2018pata\u2019 sound, the clear ball shattered on the floor.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was still in the position where she had her finger stretched out, and she froze on the spot. This\u2026 She could not have been the one who broke it, right!? That\u2026 Even though, earlier, nothing happened when such a large number of children placed their hands on it, why did it break when she gave it a simple poke?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 Will everything be fine if I apologize?\u201d Raising her head weakly, she looked at the four white-clothed men. However, none of them answered, and they were simply looking at her with dumbfounded expressions. Zhu Yao suddenly had the impulse to turn tail and run. They were not going to make her pay, right!? She\u2019s nothing but a peasant woman! Could she pay it off with a river and a field?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026 It wasn\u2019t intentional!\u201d Whatever the case, let\u2019s try admitting her mistake first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re\u2026\u201d The middle-aged man, still with that dumbfounded expression, stretched out his hand shakily and pointed at her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao weakly took a step back. She was about to cry out of fright, you know? \u201cI don\u2019t have any money on me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat we just saw\u2026 Was it actually\u2026?\u201d Another white-clothed man took a step forward, staring straight at Zhu Yao. Great, even if she wanted to run now, it was too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it!\u201d White-clothed man number three came around her as well, and was much calmer than the two before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to contact the sect about this immediately!\u201d White-clothed man number four, who was also the youngest out of the four, sized her up seriously. \u201cThis issue is of the utmost importance, we must immediately return to the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, senior-martial uncle Li.\u201d The three of them responded together.</p><br/><p>Currently Zhu Yao did not have the mood to care about why the youngest-looking man had the highest seniority among them. Because, she was about to be kidnapped by these four men.</p><br/><p>The youngest out of them, who was referred to as senior-martial uncle Li, summoned an item with a wave of his hand, and suddenly, a gigantic piece of leaf appeared. Stably stopping in mid-air, the other three men then did some hand seals. The children on the stage who were selected earlier, along with her, suddenly felt light on their feet, and they flew towards that piece of leaf.</p><br/><p>When she regained her senses, she was already standing on the leaf. Hey, hey, what happened to staying for another day?</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 They were not actually thinking of kidnapping her back to the sect and have her questioned for her crimes, right!?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute\u2026 I can explain.\u201d It really wasn\u2019t intentional, you can\u2019t blame the user for the product\u2019s poor quality, you know?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the four men completely ignored her, as though they were anxious to report her back to the sect. With a wave of their hands, a transparent barrier-like thing enveloped her and the children\u2019s surroundings. Then, the four men walked to the very front of the leaf, manipulated their arts, and flew the leaf towards the skies. They completely did not give Zhu Yao the opportunity to explain.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. Sitting at the center of the seven to eight little turnips, she had a really bad feeling about what\u2019s coming next.</p><br/><p>As she thought, the surrounding little turnips were staring at her in annoyance. Hey hey, you, the kid with the big buttocks, you don\u2019t have to look at me with such a hateful expression, do you?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou broke the deity\u2019s treasure! You\u2019re a bad person.\u201d A little girl with twintails was the first to condemn her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Big sister didn\u2019t do it intentionally!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did a bad thing, and you still don\u2019t admit it. As I thought, you\u2019re a bad person.\u201d Another little boy spoke up and denounced her.</p><br/><p>What the hell, what does this have to do with you!</p><br/><p>Seeing someone taking the initiative, the other children moved closer as well, and began to criticize her without pause. Zhu Yao suddenly felt a slight headache. Please, she was not sure of what happened herself, why were you little wimps getting so agitated for?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will pay for it, you lot are not allowed to bully her! Whoever bullies her, I will beat that person up!\u201d At the critical moment, little wimp Wang suddenly appeared, blocking right in front of her. He even raised his small fists in a threatening manner. Zhu Yao suddenly felt a little moved. At least you\u2019re conscientious, as I thought, I didn\u2019t help you for nothing. \u201cShe will be my concubine in the future, so if anyone were to bully her, it will the same as bullying me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it, I really feel like beating him into a pulp!</p><br/><p>As though they were frightened by little wimp Wang, the other little turnips no longer surrounded her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I will definitely take responsibility!\u201d Seeing everyone dispersing, with a prideful look, little wimp said to her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply looked towards his small face, and began pinching his cheeks. Emphasizing on every single word, she hatefully said, \u201cThen I really have to. Thank. You. My. Little. Husband. Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little wimp struggled to break free, weakly took two steps back and moved away from her demonic claws. With an inconvenienced look, he rubbed his small face. \u201cI have a name! I\u2019m called Wang Xuzhi! We\u2026 We\u2019re not married yet, you can\u2019t\u2026 you can\u2019t call me that!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, with a flushed face, he ran.</p><br/><p>Yo, you actually know how it\u2019s like to be embarrassed? Speechless, Zhu Yao simply shook her head.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

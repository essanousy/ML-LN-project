She hurriedly swung her sword to deflect them, slashing apart the gathering shadows. However, she was not able to dodge all of them either. After slashing apart the ones at the front, the ones at the back came charging forward as well. The first few swings were still fine, but slowly, her strength began to dwindle. After scattering a few shadows, an ominous wind came charging towards her back. She instinctively shifted to the side, but she was still a step too late. An aching pain spread from her arm as something had pierced into it. It was as if something was trying to slice off a piece of her flesh.</p><br/><p>When she turned to look, she saw a shadow was biting deeply into her arm, and her hand was already drenched in fresh blood. That figure merely revealed half of its face, but his appearance could be vaguely seen, and Zhu Yao was stunned after seeing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis!\u201d Yue Ying was startled, hurriedly walking over.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gritted her teeth as she passed her sword to her other hand and scattered the shadow. However, the bite was so deep, her bones could already be seen. This bite could not be compared to any of the injuries she suffered in the past, but back then, she still had her cultivation no matter how severe her injuries were, so she would have still been able to hold on even if she was bitten. Presently, with how her divine energy was suppressed, this pain clearly hurt even more. She could barely feel her own hand now.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis!\u201d Yue Ying was a little flustered, as he hurriedly helped stop her blood from flowing out. Something seemed to be burning with his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s face clearly looked a little anxious as well, but he was being surrounded by a large number of shadows and could not push his way through.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Zhu Yao solemnly said. \u201cDon\u2019t lose focus.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the time to be worried about such things.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s right arm was injured, and at this moment, she couldn\u2019t even hold her sword properly. However, she had no choice but to stand up again. The hell, you\u2019re bullying me because I\u2019m not a leftie, right?</p><br/><p>But it really hurts! She was basically using her own flesh and body to block attacks.</p><br/><p>Most likely because of the stimulation from her blood, those shadows grew even wilder. Their terrifying screams grew sharper, causing one\u2019s skin to crawl. They seemed to be waiting for something, as they circled around their surroundings. Then, they once again attacked her from her back.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had no choice but to shift to the side and hold up her sword again. With this action of hers, her blood began to pour out once more. Just as she was about to be submerged by an overwhelming amount of shadows, Yue Ying suddenly grabbed onto her hand, and his eyes instantly turned crimson red.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, a dark aura that was even thicker that the shadows\u2019 was emitted out from his body, instantly devouring those shadows. The shadows revealed flustered looks, and the situation instantly flipped around. The shadows that were still anxiously targeting them before were now fleeing in all directions.</p><br/><p>In just a few seconds, the area suddenly quietened down.</p><br/><p>There was no longer any shadows in the air, but they were replaced by a devillic aura that was even colder and more terrifying than those shadows. Yue Ying was enveloped within the devillic aura, and what remained was a pair of crimson-red eyes filled with anger. The light coming from his eyes were enough to send cold shivers down everyone\u2019s spines.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly calmed down and grabbed him with her other hand, desperately ignoring the devillic aura that was making her tremble. With a solemn voice, she said. \u201cYue Ying, I\u2019m fine now! Everyone is fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the anger in his eyes slowly extinguish, reverting back to their former clarity. The surrounding devillic aura then slowly began to return into his body as well, till they completely disappear. He lowered his head and looked at her hand which was dripping with blood. \u201cBig sis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Zhu Yao smiled at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d She never expected that even though these shadows were fierce, they could not match against devillic aura. It was no wonder Yue Ying was unmoving earlier. It wasn\u2019t because he was in a daze, rather, the shadows must have realized the aura emitted from his body and did not dare to approach him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevillic aura!\u201d Zhonggu Lu looked over with a stunned expression. \u201cCould\u2026 Could you actually be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Nangong Cheng\u2019s face changed as well.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. It seemed like they couldn\u2019t hide it any longer. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Yue Ying is of the Devil race. The shadows earlier were chased away by him as well. What are you two planning to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu and Nangong Cheng were stunned for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder\u2026 No wonder he\u2019s the only one who can still use mystic arts.\u201d Zhonggu Lu muttered. They were unable to circulate divine energy, but devillic energy was not restricted.</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng looked at Zhu Yao, and finally let out a sigh. \u201cSo that\u2019s the case. Da\u2026 Daoist Yue, thank you very much. With that many shadows, I thought we were dead for sure!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your stupidity at fault here? Otherwise, why would we have encountered so much trouble?\u201d Zhonggu Lu retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, can you blame me for that? It\u2019s because that Mei Xue is too treacherous, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu immediately rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>It seemed like they were intentionally ignoring the fact that Yue Ying was a Devil. After all, everyone had come a long way together, and it would be best that a conflict wouldn\u2019t occur.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief, when a her right hand was suddenly held by someone. She could not help but let out a cold gasp. \u201cSzz\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d A certain master glared at her unhappily, as he began to roll a white cloth around her injured arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, master. The blood has already stopped flowing. It will be fine in about an hour.\u201d After all, she still had a divine physique, such injuries would heal really quickly.</p><br/><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Wrap it, wrap it then!\u201d Wuuuu, master is angry at me again.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>They did not stay around, instead, they took the opportunity when the shadows were scattered and hurriedly pressed forward towards their goal. Initially, they thought that they would at least encounter another two or three waves. Strangely however, they had rushed for two days straight, but not a single shadow came attacked them again.</p><br/><p>Even if there were occasional misty shadows floating past, they completely ignored Zhu Yao\u2019s group and simply floated away after swaying about a few times. Zhu Yao thought that this was due to fear of Yue Ying\u2019s devillic energy, or there was simply too little shadows in their present surroundings. However, Yue Ying had clearly retracted his devillic energy and was not leaking out even the littlest bit. Furthermore, the sharp and terrifying screams in the air did not lessen that much either.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart began to sink, as the guess she had continued to grow clearer. On the third day, they finally walked out of the sinister and terrifying territory, and they instantly saw the light in front of them. It was as if they had suddenly walked out of the darkness and into the light, as the sinister air was completely swept away, and what replaced it was a lush green forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, we finally got out.\u201d Nangong Cheng said with joy. \u201cWe no longer have to be harrassed by those shadows. We\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might not be the case!\u201d Zhu Yao clenched her fists, her worry grew heavier.</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng was stunned as he turned to look at her. \u201cDongfang girly, just relax. Look at this place, it\u2019s completely bright. Those shadows definitely won\u2019t come here. As long as we cross this forest, we will be able to reach the light that guides us to the realm of Gods. We are no longer in any sort of danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned to look at the darkness behind her, and then once again glanced at the greenery before them, frowning. \u201cDo you guys know\u2026 what those shadows are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng was startled. \u201cWhat else can they be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSinister and ominous, undestroyable, being able to resurrect indefinitely, and carrying such immense hatred. With such characteristics, I can only think of a single thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned and coldly said. \u201cResentment!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group was stunned. Zhonggu Lu stepped forward. \u201cHow is that possible? Isn\u2019t resentment something that only exists in the Netherworld? Why would it appear in the Lightning Divine Tower? And on the final floor on the road to ascending into Gods nonetheless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve once visited the River of Forgetfulness in the Netherworld.\u201d To be exact, she met the River of Forgetfulness himself. \u201cThe River of Forgetfulness is the only thing that bridges the Three Realms, and it flows throughout every corner of the Three Realms, guiding those depressed souls back to the Netherworld and sending them to their reincarnations. Since the River of Forgetfulness can be found in all of the Three Thousand Worlds, then it can naturally be found in the Divine Realm as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng grew even more confused. \u201cWhat does these shadows have to do with the River of Forgetfulness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of the resentment of the Netherworld is being concealed in the depths of the River of Forgetfulness.\u201d Yu Yan continued with a solemn voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying, the River of Forgetfulness brought resentment into the Lightning Divine Tower?\u201d Zhonggu Lu frowned. \u201cHowever, even if those shadows are resentment, since we\u2019re already here, they wouldn\u2019t chase after us, right? Furthermore, after those resentment were chased away by Daoist Yue, they no longer appeared again. What does this have to do with the danger that you speak of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave neither of you felt anything strange about those shadows?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group exchanged glances, and even Yu Yan was confused as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I want to ask you something. In the Lower Realm, have you met someone that looks exactly the same as Sect Master Zi Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was stunned for a moment. As someone who was face-blind, Zi Mo\u2019s face was one of few that he remembered. After pondering deeply for a while, as though he had thought of something, he solemnly said. \u201cThere was a heretic practitioner who deeply specialized in the arts of transformation, and he was even capable of changing his aura. He once turned into Zi Mo\u2019s appearance and infiltrated my Ancient Hill Sect. He was then exposed by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, he was killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid master personally do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected!\u201d Zhu Yao sighed, and instantly a sense of powerlessness overwhelmed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly, just what are you trying to get with those words of yours?\u201d Nangong Cheng anxiously asked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned to look at the four of them. \u201cDid you all notice the appearances of the shadows formed by resentment?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw them\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao solemnly said. \u201cI saw a shadow that looked exactly the same as Zi Mo. That shadow was attacking my master. I even saw\u2026\u201d She turned to look at Yue Ying. \u201cXu Nuoyan! And he was attacking Yue Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her master and Yue Ying instantly widened their eyes. As though they had realized something, their faces instantly turned complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what do you mean?\u201d Nangong Cheng was anxious. \u201cAnd who is this Xu Nuoyan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who he is.\u201d Zhu Yao shook her head. \u201cThe important thing is, who they were killed by!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhonggu Lu\u2019s expression changed. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re saying, those resentment are formed by the people that we\u2019ve once killed? And that is why they were desperately attacking us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t certain in the beginning. However, have you all thought about why no other shadows attacked us again after those resentment were chased away by the devillic aura back then?\u201d Zhu Yao analysed. \u201cBecause the other resentment aren\u2019t looking for us! They would only look for their creditors.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also why at the very beginning, those resentment only attacked the four of them and completely avoided her. Because she had never taken a single human life, so naturally, there did not exist any so-called resentment seeking her for revenge. After that, she took the initiative to attack them, and only then were they lured over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would the River of Forgetfulness simply send these resentment into the Lightning Divine Tower? Also, after being filled by resentment for so many years, why hasn\u2019t there been any signs of the Lightning Divine Tower collapsing?\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s expression grew heavier. \u201cIf my guess is correct, the final test of this Lightning Divine Tower is actually a tribulation, a tribulation of karma! From the many deeds that we\u2019d planted back then, we will receive the corresponding karma. Most likely, from everything that a practitioner has done in the past, everything would be returned on this very floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026 Do you guys still feel that the place before us is really safe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Everyone\u2019s faces instantly paled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

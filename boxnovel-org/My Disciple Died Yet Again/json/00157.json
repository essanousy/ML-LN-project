Among the factions in the Divine Realm, the various sects or families would have their own unique set of arts. For example, Advent Cloud Hall specialized in sword techniques, and focused on paving their way to the Dao through their swords. Back then, those people were evidently more practiced with the five elemental arts, especially their fire-based arts, which were exceptionally incredible.</p><br/><p>Hence, she went to inquire around the sect in regards to places which specialized in fire-based arts. The answers she received were very uniform. \u201cFluorescent Wind Sect of the North.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those two people came from the Fluorescent Wind Sect.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao guessed it correctly. That tournament back then was to select the elite disciples among them. The top three disciples who won the tournament, were all brought away in an orderly fashion. Most likely, they were already being taken note by the higher brass, and were given preferential treatment. As for those who lost, they would basically be left to grow on their own.</p><br/><p>Mushmush and Goudan were also among the ones who were left to grow on their own, or to be exact, those spiritual monsters who attended the tournament that day were all left to fend for themselves. Most of them had yet to learn official divine arts, so it was very natural for them to be defeated by divine practitioners. Mushmush and Goudan were basically defeated the moment they stepped on the stage. They did not suffer any serious injuries, and when they got up, they were still behaved like good happy-go-lucky spiritual monsters.</p><br/><p>Every practitioner that was left on their own was given a few cultivation techniques for some divine arts. Every month, they could head over to the Consular Hall to receive medicinal pellets and divine stones, which could be considered as benefits for entering the sect. Though the amount evidently wasn\u2019t much, it was still better compared to the other spiritual monsters.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao only found out later that most of the spiritual monsters who did not pass that invisible bridge, had been dispatched to the various halls to deal with the miscellaneous chores for Advent Cloud Hall. Basically, these people had all given up on raising their cultivation. This was a little similar to the concept of the Outer Sect and Inner Sect system of the various sects. By passing the bridge, one would enter the Inner Sect, while those who did not pass the bridge could only be taken in by the Outer Sect.</p><br/><p>In these few days, Zhu Yao had been quietly staying put. With her current cultivation level, it was considered trash in Advent Cloud Hall. Her master\u2019s formation was about to be completed. Once he completes it, she would then have more confidence in finding the mastermind behind all this.</p><br/><p>In the recent days, Goudan had been coming over to her place every single day. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t to look for her, but to look for that little sister Xianxian of his. Unfortunately, no matter how he pestered her, the girl wouldn\u2019t even bat him an eye. She was wholeheartedly thinking about her own husband. Haah. Out of all things he could do, why did Goudan like to be a third-party? They were of different races, so how could they be in love? No happiness could be grown out of a relationship between a human and a spiritual monster, you know.</p><br/><p>As expected, in less than a few minutes, Goudan was sent flying out of the courtyard by the girl Mo Xianxian, who could not bear it any longer. With a swoosh, he disappeared into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thirty-sixth time.\u201d The mushroom gloatingly muttered out. Zhu Yao silently lit up the thirty-sixth candle in her heart. Pulling the mushroom along, they left the crime scene.</p><br/><p>Initially, they had planned on strolling a few rounds. If they\u2019re lucky, they would even be able to pick up Goudan. However, unexpectedly, they met a familiar person along the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you two are over here, this can sure be called wearing out iron shoes in fruitless searching, huh.[1]\u201d A green-clothed woman, bringing along two followers, walked over, and her smile was especially complacent.</p><br/><p>The mushroom blanked for a moment, before blurting out. \u201cLittle bi-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d The woman furiously interrupted the mushroom\u2019s words. She then ruthlessly glared at the two of them. \u201cAs expected, you two did it on purpose that day!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was actually the little bitch who posed as her. Zhu Yao was a little startled. After sizing her up for a moment, she saw a dark red diagram embroidered on her sleeves. \u201cYou\u2019re an elite disciple?\u201d Only the clothes worn by elite disciples would have such a diagram. Zhu Yao did not expect that she was actually one of the top three in the tournament that day.</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng coldly laughed. Raising her head, she coldly glanced at the two of them. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Following by the rules, you two should be calling me senior martial sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, senior martial sister.\u201d The mushroom blanked for a moment, before he readily followed her advice and called out.</p><br/><p>This time, it was Tao Manfeng who was dumbfounded, as though she had not expected that he would actually be this casual about it. Anger began to boil even more in her heart. \u201cA mere spiritual monster like you, actually dares to humiliate me in front of such a large crowd. If I don\u2019t teach you a lesson, you wouldn\u2019t know your place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d The mushroom gave a confused look, as he turned to look at Zhu Yao. \u201cRock spirit, what did I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. It\u2019s because you didn\u2019t do anything, that\u2019s why she\u2019s angry, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, you two sure have guts. You actually dare to provoke me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid we?\u201d The mushroom continued to look at Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope!\u201d Zhu Yao answered. She didn\u2019t do anything at all.</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng\u2019s fury surged. \u201cYou two scolded me right in front of my face, and you\u2019re saying that\u2019s not a provocation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did we scold you?\u201d The mushroom expressed that he was very innocent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still want to deny it? Earlier, you were even about to call me\u2026 call me\u2026 bi\u2026tch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The mushroom became even more confused. \u201cBut you are little bitch.\u201d Wasn\u2019t that her name? Rock spirit said so.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Tao Manfeng was so furious, even her face had turned green. \u201cYou\u2019re the little bitch, all of you are little bitches!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mushroom argued back. \u201cI\u2019m clearly a little mushroom. You can call me Mushmush.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently looked away. Oh Mushmush, you sure have a mushy brain, huh. You can\u2019t really have believed that her surname is little, and her name is bitch, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez. Even though it\u2019s your own name, yet, you don\u2019t allow people to call out to you.\u201d The mushroom stabbed another blow.</p><br/><p>Only then did Tao Manfeng finally understand his words. Gritting her teeth, she said. \u201cMy surname is Tao, I\u2019m called Tao Manfeng! You best remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d The mushroom revealed a face of sudden enlightenment. After sizing her up for a moment, he curled his lips and said. \u201cSo you changed your name, say that earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfft\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could faintly here the sound of Tao Manfeng puking out blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You two\u2026\u201d Tao Manfeng wished that she could pounce over and tear that spiritual monster\u2019s lips apart. She took a deep breath, and instructed the two followers behind her. \u201cYou two, help me keep a lookout.\u201d She looked at the two of them with a hazy expression.</p><br/><p>For a moment, Zhu Yao imagined a scenario where she was blocked at the door by students from a higher grade after school. Wasn\u2019t it just calling her names? In regards to settling debts, this lady was simply too petty. Zhu Yao herself had yet to settle her own debts with her, you know?</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng coldly glared at them, and divine energy came surging from her body. In her palm, lightning sparks faintly flashed. \u201cI vowed to myself, if there\u2019s anyone who dares to humiliate me, I will never let even a single one of them off.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was going to start a fight? Zhu Yao was caught off-guard a little. She couldn\u2019t have become muddle-headed from anger, right? Although she was currently an elite disciple, Zhu Yao\u2019s cultivation level was still higher than hers.</p><br/><p>However, Tao Manfeng did not have the intention to pull back now. Raising her left hand which was flashing with lightning sparks, narrow yet powerful strands of lightning began to glow at the center of her palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial Lightning Art?\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s voice resounded in Zhu Yao\u2019s mind, carrying a hint of suspicion. \u201cWhy does she know the techniques belonging to Lightning Divine Hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who gave her?\u201d Zhu Yao really wanted to spray out a mouthful of salt soda water into her divine sense region. She was now able to slightly understand why Tao Manfeng dared to make a move. The Imperial Lightning Art was a divine art which belonged to Lightning Divine Hall, and regular divine arts could not be compared to it. Even if she were to challenge someone of a higher cultivation level, it wasn\u2019t guaranteed that she would lose.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Yu Yan blanked, and only a moment later did he respond. \u201cOh, it\u2019s her.\u201d</p><br/><p>So you basically didn\u2019t recognize her back then! Just how much of a face-blind are you?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what do we do?\u201d Although she learnt lightning-based arts as well, she had yet to touch on the Imperial Lightning Art.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d Yu Yan, however, was especially calm. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you simply stand there without moving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah? Don\u2019t move? So she\u2019s just going to wait till she\u2019s struck by lightning?</p><br/><p>Tao Manfeng\u2019s art had already begun to materialize, and the lightning sparks on her palm became even denser. Suddenly, a long bolt of lightning was formed, soaring into the skies. It then came striking in the direction where she and Mushmush were.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow di-\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was just about to construct a defensive barrier, when suddenly a water dragon came descending from the sky. It pounced directly towards the bolt of lightning, and the lightning was instantly devoured after a slight sizzle. The stream of water however, continued to chase after the source of the lightning bolt, instantly drenching Tao Manfeng.</p><br/><p>Although the water dragon could block the lightning attack, it was unable to completely suppress it, hence the electrical current still existed. And all of this touched upon a certain physical phenomenon.</p><br/><p>Water \u2013 is a conductor of electricity.</p><br/><p>Hence, the water sprayed about, and the lightning sparks flashed, along with the drenched Tao Manfeng.</p><br/><p>The student Tao Manfeng, dressed in a green robe, who was acting as an extremely proud elite disciple earlier, after being electrocuted from head to toe, instantly turned into a convulsing disciple. In the air, her unfinished declaration earlier still continued to echo. \u201cNow, die\u2026 ai\u2026 ai\u2026 ai\u2026\u201d When the electrical current flowed through, her entire body convulsed. With every convulsion, the tone of her \u2018ai\u2019 would change.</p><br/><p>Hence, the entire place was filled with her various ever-changing tones of: Ai\u2026 ai\u2026 ai\u2026 ai\u2026 ai\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u2026</p><br/><p>Mushroom: \u2026</p><br/><p>Followers: \u2026</p><br/><p>Only when her entire body was charred black did her cry vanish, and she collapsed onto the pool of water head-first.</p><br/><p>Several wisps of light smoke gradually rose\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah, she really could win just by standing there without moving. Student Tao Manfeng, I really don\u2019t hate you in the slightest any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior martial sister!\u201d The two followers were both shocked, as they looked anxiously at Tao Manfeng who had already fainted from the electrocution. Yet, not a single one of them dared to head over to lift her up, as there were still sparks flying in the pool of water!</p><br/><p>Just as they were at a loss of what to do, a clear and extremely imposing, yet slightly familiar voice resounded from the sky. \u201cWho was it here that was executing a lightning technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>A white figure came flying over from afar. The person was a twenty-year-old looking youth with a heroic look. With tightly knitted brows, he looked at the water surface below which was flashing with lightning sparks.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhu Yao simply felt like heading back with her face covered. That person was actually Miao Lin, how could she have actually forgotten about him? Crap, crap, crap. This time, she was definitely going to be recognized.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, senior martial brother.\u201d The two followers instantly greeted Miao Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Miao Lin sternly nodded. He swept a glance at the few people on-site, including Zhu Yao who was desperately lowering her head. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two followers exchanged glances, and their eyes were filled with despair. \u201cSenior martial brother, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s the senior martial sister who just newly entered. She has some conflict with these two disciples, so out of impulse, she made her move against them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe knows a lightning technique?\u201d Miao Lin strangely glanced at the person who was still lying in the water like a corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, senior martial sister is indeed someone who\u2019s capable of lightning techniques among this new batch of disciples. And\u2026\u201d That disciple said with worshiping eyes. \u201cSenior martial sister said that she even knows the Imperial Lightning Art as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImperial Lightning?\u201d Miao Lin frowned, before he coldly snorted. \u201cIn this realm, other than the Lightning Divine Hall, who would dare to claim that they know the Imperial Lightning Art? Ludicrous.\u201d Miao Lin once again glanced at Tao Manfeng, and in an instant, a hint of wistful expression appeared on his face. \u201cI\u2019m someone who has personally witnessed the arts of Lightning Divine Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] \u2018wearing out iron shoes in fruitless searching\u2019: Putting in so much effort in a search, only to find them so easily.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

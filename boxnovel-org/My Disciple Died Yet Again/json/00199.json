This is my first time heading out\u2026 May I go together with great deity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do there?\u201d Zhu Yao looked at him with narrowed eyes, and then suddenly thought of something. \u201cYou can\u2019t really be heading there to buy clothes, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\u201d He strongly nodded.</p><br/><p>Right, my ass! Zhu Yao glanced at him scornfully. \u201cYou don\u2019t even bathe, so why do you need so many clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi blanked for a moment, and his fur stood on ends the next instant, replying furiously. \u201cI lick my fur frequently, alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d That\u2019s even more disgusting, alright? Even though he had already gained a human form, why did he still cling onto the way animals clean themselves?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao couldn\u2019t care less, if he wanted to follow her, then so be it. Though, she was bitter about not possessing even a single flying mystic tool, otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have needed to walk. She walked for exactly a day and a night, before arriving at the small city at the break of dawn.</p><br/><p>However, this was not a city of practitioners, but a city built by mortals. Residing inside were mortals who did not have any spiritual energy within them, and Zhu Yao was a little disappointed about it. Initially, she had wanted to at least deal with the problem of transportation tools, but her hopes were dashed into pieces.</p><br/><p>Having no other options, she could only look for suitable materials and refine one herself.</p><br/><p>Just as she turned towards the next street, a white figure suddenly charged out from the side. She turned her body out of reflex, and with a \u2018pachi\u2019, she fell onto the ground, and face-flat at that.</p><br/><p>Fortunately she dodged quickly, otherwise the person who fell would have been her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be like this?\u201d A teary face suddenly rose from the ground. In her crystal bright eyes, her tears shone. She was lightly biting his alluring red lower lip, and an unspeakable grievance could be seen from in between her brows. Anyone who saw her would feel like pampering her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt that she heard a bang in her mind, as though countless fireworks had been shot out. She unconsciously held her breath, as she stared at her face with widened eyes, not daring to even blink for a moment.</p><br/><p>It was really an re-enactment of a scene of \u2018one who had searched for her for a thousand of times in the crowd, and when she was finally found, the startled bunch of herons flew away\u2026\u2019\u00b9 Ah pui. In any case, what she meant was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s actually woman with such otherworldly beauty in this world.\u201d The fox suddenly said out loud.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was this close to spitting all over his face, however, she couldn\u2019t help but agree.</p><br/><p>Her beauty was truly otherworldly, even the three letters \u2018bug\u2019 on her face. It\u2019s otherworldly to the point of being drunk, alright?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. The three letters \u2018bug\u2019 was clearly written on the face of the young lady on the ground!</p><br/><p>Realmspirit had told her that the mission difficulty this time would increase, so ever since she logged onto this new character, she had been worrying about what the bug this time was. Would it be like last time, where she would only find out at the very end, she thought. However, she never expected that the bug would send itself to her so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Yi Ling!\u201d A blue-clothed man ran over with a worried face, and held the woman up.</p><br/><p>Yi Ling. This name sounded rather familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how to walk properly? Why did you push her down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was speechless. Was this person blind?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother Qi\u2026 Forget it.\u201d The woman tugged onto the man, giving him a generous-looking face that looked as though she did not want to pursue this matter.</p><br/><p>Yo. This blindness is even infectious.</p><br/><p>The man sighed, and gently said. \u201cLing\u2019er. You\u2019re just too kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother\u2026\u201d The woman nudged the man, and said with pouting lips. \u201cI think that this big sister didn\u2019t do it on purpose either, so let\u2019s forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Look! A real life green tea bitch.</p><br/><p>The man helplessly shook his head. Then, he turned to glare at her. \u201cHurry and apologize to my junior-martial sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Zhu Yao pointed at herself. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You pushed someone down, and don\u2019t even have a word of apology for her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother, forget it.\u201d The man shrunk to the back, and continued to tug on the corner of the man\u2019s sleeves. She was clearly giving persuasive words, yet it lit up another fire above the man\u2019s flames of fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I will seek justice for you.\u201d After saying that, he glared at Zhu Yao with dagger-like eyes. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Zhu Yao immediately replied.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Her being so straightforward had instead stunned the two of them, as though a pent-up frustration that was about to burst out from the depths of one\u2019s heart, suddenly could not find the exit to do so. Yet, he just couldn\u2019t find another reason to be furious about, and in the end, he left after giving her a cold snort.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned, though she did not really feel that she was that wronged. She had only just met the bug, and because she did not know the present situation, it wasn\u2019t advisable for her to come into conflict with them. Furthermore, saying sorry wouldn\u2019t make her lose anything.</p><br/><p>Though the fox seemed to have an infatuated look as he looked in the direction the two people left in, he seemed to be at a loss.</p><br/><p>This idiot can\u2019t have fell in love with that green tea bitch on first sight, right? Were the intelligence of all foxes this bad?</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat deity, I\u2026 I\u2019m going off to buy new clothes.\u201d He explained as he glanced at the direction the woman left in. Clearly, the drinker\u2019s heart was not in the cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You\u2019re not going to follow me anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>His face stiffened for a moment, before he explained with a stutter. \u201cWe\u2026 We have already reached the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, one\u2019s compassion for others is lost the moment one experiences love.</p><br/><p>But that woman earlier\u2026</p><br/><p>Forget it, what did this have to do with Zhu Yao herself?</p><br/><p>The most important matter right now which she had to attend to was\u2026</p><br/><p>She touched her pockets. When she was conversing earlier, she faintly felt the two fruits in her pocket nudge a little, and they were even turning a little warmer.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was worried about her master and Yue Ying, and hence did not have the mind to speak with the fox any further either. Waving her hands, she parted ways with him.</p><br/><p>Finding a secluded place, she summoned a straw cottage, placed down n number of isolation formations at the front and back, before taking out the black and white fruits.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Zhu Yao nudged the white fruit.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying?\u201d She then nudged the black fruit.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither one of the two responded, though the fruits seemed to be getting hotter, and Zhu Yao could barely grasp hold of them. She then decided to summon a huge bowl and place the fruits into it. The surrounding spiritual energy suddenly turned dense, as even more spiritual energy began gather towards her direction. Among them, wood spiritual energy made up a bigger portion of the mix.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little confused, but not a moment later, those spiritual energy began to fly towards the two fruits, and were endlessly being absorbed by them. The two fruits then began to glow red and white.</p><br/><p>Why did she feel that this scene look a little familiar? As though she had just seen it recently\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell, wasn\u2019t this the same situation when she took up her human form?</p><br/><p>Her master and Yue Ying were about to transform!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt that this was a little mysterious.</p><br/><p>Back then, she transformed within the forest. The wood spiritual energy within the forest was naturally very rich, however, being near the city, the wood spiritual energy here was scarce. After pondering for a moment, she set down a few spiritual energy gathering formations in order to prevent the two from suffering malnutrition.</p><br/><p>The spiritual energy grew even more concentrated. Probably because the two of them of were transforming at the same time, the torrents of spiritual energy even began to shake the straw cottage. Zhu Yao had no other options but to cast defensive arts at the side.</p><br/><p>She watched on as the two bundles of light grow brighter. The entire cottage was enveloped by red and white lights, blinding to the point where one couldn\u2019t bear to open their eyes. And then, two figures slowly appeared on the table.</p><br/><p>First, they were tiny. Then, they slowly grew.</p><br/><p>Ten centimeters. Twenty centimeters. Thirty centimeters\u2026</p><br/><p>Half a meter\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the light receded, and the cottage once again returned to normal. On the table were two tender-looking\u2026 little wimps.</p><br/><p>Why kids!? -faints-</p><br/><p>This was illogical!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>The child in white clothes on the left frowned, and responded. \u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying?\u201d</p><br/><p>The child in black clothes on the right smiled sweetly. \u201cBig Sis Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, it really was the two of them. Why did they turn into children? And\u2026 they were even so cute and plump. They were chubby like the babies in a new year\u2019s portrait, making it hard to suppress the urge to hug them.</p><br/><p>If not for\u2026</p><br/><p>Their buttocks being squeezed in the same bowl.</p><br/><p>The large bowl which Zhu Yao summoned earlier to hold them, when they took up their human forms, evidently could not contain their entire physiques, and in the end, could only hold their two small buttocks.</p><br/><p>And the two of them seemed\u2026 to be stuck.</p><br/><p>With a cold expression, Yu Yan emitted a cold aura while staying put. Yue Ying was presently holding onto the edges of the bowl, desperately trying to pull himself out of the bowl.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how he tried, he was unable to escape from the bowl.</p><br/><p>She suddenly recalled a line from a certain chocolate advertisement: \u2018Couldn\u2019t you have gotten a bigger bowl?\u2019</p><br/><p>Mn, if she knew that they were going to transform together next time, then she would definitely bring a larger bowl.</p><br/><p>After Yue Ying\u2019s long hours of fruitless effort, in the end, Yu Yan cast an art and tapped on the bowl, instantly shattering the bowl. The two people finally separated, gaining their freedom.</p><br/><p>After making eye contact, both of them scornfully took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026\u201d Yue Ying reached out his chubby little paw towards her with a wronged look, and Zhu Yao\u2019s face turned blood red from the cuteness. She could not help but stroke his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you two become like this?\u201d This was too illogical.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have only just taken up a form, and do not have sufficient spiritual energy.\u201d Yu Yan replied. \u201cWe can only transform into this state.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao blanked. She inspected the two of them, and her eyes widened. \u201cYour cultivation\u2026\u201d They were actually only at the mid Essence stage, even lower than hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao, no need to worry.\u201d Yue Ying raised his head, and rubbed against her palm. \u201cMy cultivation still exists, just that my spiritual energy is insufficient. My present body simply cannot sustain it either. It will naturally recover as time passes, there\u2019s no need to re-cultivate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Zhu Yao looked at Yu Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Yu Yan nodded in agreement, his voice carried a hint of fatigue, and his eyelids unintentionally drooped.</p><br/><p>Only then Zhu Yao heave a sigh of relief. She then realized his anomaly. \u201cMaster, what happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d Yu Yan shook his head. \u201cI used an art earlier, and am merely tired.\u201d It was indeed very difficult for him to cast an art in his present body. Just a small art was enough to extremely tire him, and his head uncontrollably drooped little by little.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly turned muddle-headed from how cute he looked desperately keeping himself awake with his small figure. She could not help but reached her hands towards him. \u201cHurry and get into the bowl, ah pui\u2026 Hurry and come into my embrace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 You need to rest.\u201d Come, little fellow. Let this auntie hug you.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan did not reply, though Yue Ying at the side seemed to have an opinion on this. His similar bun-like face frowned, as he reached out his small hands. \u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026\u201d His expression looked as though he was requesting to be hugged and consoled.</p><br/><p>Another arrow struck Zhu Yao\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>This feeling where the entire world was filled with cuteness\u2026</p><br/><p>Was simply irresistible!</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to change her target, suddenly, a white dumpling charged into her embrace at lightning speed, and hugged onto her neck.</p><br/><p>A hint of red rose in the white dumpling\u2019s face, but it quickly subsided right after. Using his cute voice, he sternly said. \u201cYu\u2026 Yao. Your master needs some rest, stand guard for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he turned to coldly glare at Yue Ying, before burying his head into her embrace and turned quiet.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao \u201c\u2026\u201d Such a childish act. Master, are you fighting to be spoilt?</p><br/><p>But I like it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuan Cheng, disciple of Blue Parasol Sect, pays a visit. I wonder if fellow daoist is willing to meet me.\u201d A foreign male voice suddenly sounded from outside.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. She had long figured that her master\u2019s and Yue Ying\u2019s abnormal spiritual energy movements would definitely garner the attention of nearby practitioners, so she had used formations to conceal their presences and to make it look as though there were people building their Foundation here. Theoretically speaking, Foundation-stage practitioners were very commonly seen, even if it was sensed, most people would have ignored it. She never expected that there would still be people coming forward to meet them.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered for a moment, before she walked out while hugging onto her own master who was pretending to sleep with one arm, and holding onto Yue Ying with the other.</p><br/><p>When she saw the man outside who only had an Essence Paragon cultivation, she relaxed a little. However, when she glanced at the three people beside him, her eyes narrowed once again.</p><br/><p>It sure was a small world.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d The expression of the man in the green robe stiffened, as he looked at her with a conflicted look. Even the face of the woman behind him paled a little.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, these two were the bug two-man team she encountered earlier on the street.</p><br/><p>The other was actually the fox who had a woman clothes fetish.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, we meet again.\u201d Zhu Yao blinked her eyes at the three people.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial brother Qi Ping, do you know this fellow daoist?\u201d Guan Cheng turned to look at the two people.</p><br/><p>Qi Ping looked at her a little indignantly. \u201cWe have met once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guan Cheng did not dwell into the matter any further, he instead took a step forward and gave Zhu Yao a bow of the same status. \u201cCongratulations, fellow daoist, on building your Foundation.\u201d Naturally, he believed that the abnormal movements in the spiritual energy earlier was her building her Foundation. \u201cI wonder which school and sect fellow daoist is from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c</p><br/><p>I have neither a school nor a sect.\u201d Zhu Yao honestly replied.</p><br/><p>A hint of easily distinguishable joy flashed past Guan Cheng\u2019s eyes, and he became even more enthusiastic. \u201cThen fellow daoist, are you interested in joining our Blue Parasol Sect? To be honest, this lowly one descended from the mountains this time to recruit disciples for our sect.\u201d He persuaded with all his might, afraid that she wouldn\u2019t agree. \u201cI see that fellow daoist has extraordinary aptitude to build your Foundation with your own strength, you will definitely make great achievements in the future. My Blue Parasol Sect can be considered to be one of the top great sects as well. We have large amount of resources in the sect, which I believe can aid fellow daoist in your cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur sect after all has three\u2026 Ah?\u201d Only then did Guan Cheng realize what she had just said, and he was somewhat unable to believe his own ears. \u201cFellow\u2026 Fellow daoist, so you have agreed to join?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What happened to the promised rumors that all wandering practitioners have lofty personalities, and do not wish to be restrained?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d And here she was worried that she wouldn\u2019t get the opportunity to make contact with the bug. This sure was someone sending a pillow when one wanted to sleep.</p><br/><p>Guan Cheng\u2019s eyes instantly shone. \u201cWe will be choosing disciples in the city tomorrow. Fellow daoist can meet up with us in the city in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhu Yao nodded. After pondering for a moment, she pointed at the two family members in her hands. \u201cCan I bring them along?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d Guan Cheng nodded even faster than before. With his Essence Paragon cultivation, he naturally could see that the children in her hands were practitioners as well. \u201cI wonder if these two are your\u2026\u201d disciples?</p><br/><p>\u201cSons!\u201d Zhu Yao said without a single fluster on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Guan Cheng was stunned. This young lady did not look that old, yet she already had a such a big child? And even two of them!</p><br/><p>Yue Ying was startled for a moment, before nodding his head in concert, and shouted. \u201cMom!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d As expected, he was quick on the uptake.</p><br/><p>The white dumpling in her embrace however stiffened, and his little face instantly darkened.</p><br/><p>Guan Cheng said some courteous words before bringing the group away. The student with the bug even gave her a bow before they left, which earned the stink eye of the disciple named Qi Ping at the side.</p><br/><p>As for that stinky fox, she did not know what happened between him and the two of them. From beginning till end, he had been looking at that bug with with affectionate eyes, his eyes did not shift to look at Zhu Yao even for a moment.</p><br/><p>As expected, one\u2019s compassion for others is lost the moment one experiences love!</p><br/><p>\u00b9 \u2018one who had searched\u2026 startled bunch of herons flew away\u2026\u2019: It\u2019s something like those exaggerated scenes when the main characters meet their destined ones. Like Saekano\u2019s Aki meeting Kato for the first time(?) for example.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

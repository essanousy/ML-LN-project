What was the best method to raise one\u2019s skills? Answer: Practical experience!</p><br/><p>The training method which Zhu Yao had taught of, was through actual battles. When she recalled the time she was training her sword techniques, she refined her skills through the daily abuse of her master, where even her face would swell and her nose would turn green. Now, it was little tyrant\u2019s turn. Naturally, it would only be fair if she were to beat him up till he had a greener nose and a more swollen face than her.</p><br/><p>Then, she invited a bunch of thugs\u2026 ah pui, partners. Just who was more suitable as sparring partners than demonic beasts which had lived in the forest since they were young, and had lived their lives just for battles? After she had treated the injuries of quite a bit beasties, so she should receive some visiting fees, right? Though, a large part of their injuries came from themselves trying to cripple\u2026 themselves.</p><br/><p>With helpers, Zhu Yao officially turned into a spectator. Every morning, she would head over to the \u201cdemonic beast collection point\u201d and heal a beastie. Then, she would task them to be a sparring partner for little tyrant. After completing it, she would reward them by stroking their fur, before bringing the lifeless little tyrant back home.</p><br/><p>Thus this continued on and on\u2026</p><br/><p>Three months later, she was rewarded with an undying little tyrant, and a crowd of loyal beastie fans.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d A certain youth who had already been cruelly treated by the beasties, felt like crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I really have to defeat this beastie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we change it with another one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is to train you, young man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, this\u2026 is a third rank Weeping Spirit Beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate your enemy, young man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d This was not a problem of underestimating it, this spirit beast did not have any offensive abilities at all, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate, defeat this monster! Go, all in order to save Earth! Ultraman!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell is an Ultraman? Little tyrant had no choice but to take two steps forward, and then, threw a punch straight at the furball that was looking at him with watery eyes. His fist, instantly sunk into the furball.</p><br/><p>A moment later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWuaahhh\u2026\u201d An earth-shaking cry resounded through the skies.</p><br/><p>This Weeping Spirit Beast was indeed a spirit beast with no offensive capabilities, it\u2019s only unique trait was\u2026 it was great at crying! Known as the proudest demonic beast in history, it would cry if it was cold, would cry if it was hot, and would cry if it was in pain. Just offending it a little would make it cry in front of you!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, its cry was certainly the sound of a devil to one\u2019s ears, with its reverberations being capable of lingering for three days, no matter how cute or how frail it looked. Furthermore, it had a pure personality. Just by being slightly nice to it, it would cheekily follow after you. However, it was a beastie that neither practitioners nor demonic beasts would dare to offend the most. Without a single exception.</p><br/><p>If other demonic beasts were hard to handle, there would still be methods to deal with them. However, the moment a Weeping Spirit Beast were to cry, its tears of sorrow would definitely be capable of reversing the flow of a river. It would not stop till it was satisfied. Yet, it just had to possess defensive capabilities that other beasties could never have, resistant to all type of attacks.</p><br/><p>The Weeping Spirit Beast\u2019s ultrasonic wave attack was still persisting\u2026</p><br/><p>Shaking the two surrounding audience.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d What happened to the promise of beating demonic beasts?</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d It seemed like she had gone too far this time. \u201cAhem\u2026 Little tyrant, I say!\u201d Zhu Yao patted on his shoulders. Mustering a stern and heavy tone, she said. \u201cYou must understand that there always many accidents in one\u2019s lifetime. You must learn to be firm and strong. Just treat this as a test. I shall leave this Weeping Spirit Beast in your hands. Gambatte!\u201d It was definitely not because she wanted to experience the cries of a Weeping Spirit Beast due to her utter boredom, it definitely wasn\u2019t!</p><br/><p>After saying that, she ran out with dust clouds trailing behind her. Mn, she went back to place down noise cancellation formations.</p><br/><p>Little tyrant: \u201c\u2026\u201d He was fooled, right!? He definitely was.</p><br/><p>Turning his head back, he glanced at the furball which had already turned red from the crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWuaahh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wrong, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWuaaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hit you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaahhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weeping Spirit Beast\u2019s cry lasted for an entire day and night. When Zhu Yao went to check up on little tyrant again, he was already hugging onto white furball. With a face that looked like he wanted to cry to death, he was waiting at the courtyard for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Little tyrant. Is this the spirit beast that you just took in? You have great taste!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~\u201d</p><br/><p>A certain youth who sold his body to stop the wails of a beast: \u201c\u2026\u201d Can I overthrow my master?</p><br/><p>A year later.</p><br/><p>Through the cruel acts\u2026 ah pui. Through the enthusiastic spars of the crowd of demonic beasts, little tyrant\u2019s actual combat capabilities had improved leaps and bounds. He was already capable of dealing with a fifth rank demonic beast. Though he might not be able to beat one, at the very least, protecting himself from one was no problem at all. Back then, she was once thoroughly abused by a fifth rank fox demon when she was already a Foundation Paragon practitioner, which directly resulted to her first disconnection.</p><br/><p>It could be seen that little tyrant\u2019s comprehension abilities and IQ were really high, far surpassing hers. When she thought about it, she really felt a little\u2026 envious!</p><br/><p>Haah, the radiance of a genius was definitely far out of her reach.</p><br/><p>In order to calm her heart\u2026 ah pui. In order to ensure the peace of the world, Zhu Yao decided to begin her role model raising project.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing to Wandering City?\u201d Little tyrant was startled. Keeping the sword in his hand, he said with a puzzled look. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle tyrant, I say!\u201d Zhu Yao began to lead him on. \u201cYou have already cultivated for so long, it\u2019s about time to check on your results. It all boils down to this, in order to see if you\u2019re able to apply what you have learnt.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of little tyrant\u2019s lips twitched, his face was cold. \u201cGrandma, are you certain it\u2019s not because you want to head out and play?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Little tyrant, how can you say that about your grandma? Do I look like someone that playful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She was actually unable to refute it. As expected, the older a child was, the less cute he would become. \u201cNonsense, grandma is doing this for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday, you were even talking about trying out the spirit fruit which Wandering City is known for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Why did you remember something like that so clearly? Where did that obedient and cute little tyrant go? Why did every single disciple she raise end up having such cold faces?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah!\u201d Little tyrant let out a long sigh, and with a helpless look, he said. \u201cForget it, let\u2019s go then. Let me make some preparations\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to prepare?\u201d Zhu Yao asked on reflex.</p><br/><p>Little tyrant stopped, and then he looked at her with a \u2018when will she ever learn\u2019 face. \u201cGrandma\u2026 Do you know where Wandering City is? Do you know how many spirit stones it costs to stay a night there? Do you know much a kilogram of spirit fruits costs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d She was stabbed in the chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah\u2026 Let me prepare.\u201d Little tyrant turned around and left with a sad look.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did she feel like the disciple she raised was looking down on her? It was as if her forehead was plastered with the word \u201cUseless\u201d!</p><br/><p>Her position as a parent was in danger of crumbling, what to do? Emergency, I\u2019m waiting online for an answer!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered deeply for a moment. In the end, she found the answer. Mn, it was definitely because her master did not teach her well.</p><br/><p>She then silently turned to look at the white-clothed figure next to her with a resentful look.</p><br/><p>Receiving the resentful lightwaves, light swirled within a certain master\u2019s eyes, and then, he lowered his head. Smooch! He sealed his disciple\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Alright! Her master taught her really well!</p><br/><p>In the morning of the second day, without knowing where and how little tyrant managed to gather a pouch of spirit stones, he prepared all the required items needed for the trip and then informed her that they could depart.</p><br/><p>The few people gathered at Zhu Yao\u2019s courtyard, and little tyrant\u2019s furball spirit beast was responsible for the headcount.</p><br/><p>It first leapt in front of Zhu Yao and obediently called out. \u201cMeow~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood boy!\u201d Zhu Yao stroked its head.</p><br/><p>It then leapt in front of Little Eighth, and called out. \u201cLooord\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Little Eighth who had successfully grown out all his feathers and finally had the look of a bird, responded in a proud manner.</p><br/><p>It then leapt in front of her master. \u201c\u2026\u201d It did not dare to let out a sound.</p><br/><p>Finally, it leapt back to its own master\u2019s side, and looked away. \u201cTch~\u201d</p><br/><p>Little tyrant: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this really his spirit beast? What happened to the promised contract between master and servant?</p><br/><p>The lot of them then flew in the southern direction. After flying for an entire day, they managed to arrive at Wandering City.</p><br/><p>Wandering City was where most wandering practitioners were gathered at, and it was also the biggest city for them. It was bustling with activities. There were rumours that the city lord was a Demigod Sovereign, and he was the only person among wandering practitioners who had managed to become a Demigod. Though his lifespan was approaching its limit, it was still because of him living here that no one dared to easily offend Wandering City. A long while after that, this city became the largest gathering site for wandering practitioners.</p><br/><p>Over here, birthright was of no importance, only strength and abilities mattered. Wandering practitioners and regular sect disciples did not discriminate against each other. Let alone heretic practitioners, even the various clans and sects were unable to exert their influence here.</p><br/><p>However, the reason why Wandering City was famous was not just because of this. This city was the only place where the \u201cScentless Fruit\u201d could bear fruit. It was said that this fruit was formed by chaotic spiritual energy. No matter what spirit veins one possessed, after eating it, the fruit would turn into the person\u2019s corresponding spiritual energy. Compared to spirit fruits of other types, this fruit could be eaten by anyone of all ages. Though the spiritual energy improvement it provided was not large, it was still a rare fruit that many practitioners would fight over for.</p><br/><p>It was unfortunate that the Scentless Fruit Tree could only grow within Wandering City. Even if one tried to forcefully move it, the fruit tree was unable to survive outside the city. Thus, this fruit became the specialty of this place.</p><br/><p>Of course, the reason why Zhu Yao was here in Wandering City was for this fru\u2026 Ah pui, it was of course not because of this fruit.</p><br/><p>A mere fruit was naturally unable to allow this city hold the title of number one city for wandering practitioners. What practitioners are truly excited about, was the Great Wandering Practitioners\u2019 Tournament held here once every ten years.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. The various sects had their sect tournaments, while wandering practitioners had their own tournaments as well.</p><br/><p>Similarly, they were split into three groups \u2013 Essence, Foundation, and Azoth. The difference was that the Great Wandering Practitioners\u2019 Tournament was a sports competition completely, and purely for the common masses. Though the scale was not as huge as the Great Inter-Sect Tournament, it was still very popular among many wandering practitioners.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt that compared to idols that experience regular growth paths in clans and sects, these heroes of the common people were much more able to engrave themselves in people\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle tyrant, good luck! Don\u2019t be careless, become the champion of the Foundation group!\u201d Zhu Yao patted on Little Bai\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThe champion\u2019s prize awaits you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little tyrant\u2019s face darkened. \u201cGrandma\u2026 You\u2019re not just thinking about obtaining that \u2018Scentless Fruit\u2019, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao rubbed his head. \u201cHow can you think of your grandma that way? It\u2019s a very important event. Something like the \u2018Scentless Fruit\u2019 or whatever\u2026 it\u2019s not like I really want it that bad!\u201d Geez~!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She clearly wanted it really bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Pikachu! You must become the champion, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What\u2019s a Pikachu?</p><br/><p>Little tyrant let out a long sigh. Forget it, he indeed needed to test out his abilities, after all. He handed over Little Eighth and the furball, who had gotten used to lying on his shoulders, to his grandma. Then, with a light push from his feet, he flew into the participants\u2019 venue.</p><br/><p>Because there were simply too many wandering practitioners, and that this was also the most authoritative tournament among wandering practitioners, the degree of enthusiasm people had was no less than the olympic games. This was why the preliminaries of the tournament were very easy, and no registration was needed either. The participants simply had to head over to the corresponding competition stage. The way to advance? A battle royale!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Initially, the reason why they released their pressure was to simply demonstrate the Ancient Hill Sect\u2019s might, with the purpose of frightening the rest of the Sects. However, they did not expect the godly Sovereign to be present, and in the end, everything backfired.</p><br/><p>The three Sovereigns, undoubtedly, were a little embarrassed, however, they managed to react, and they hurriedly retrieved their pressure at the quickest speed possible. They then moved forward and bowed. \u201cGreetings to martial-uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan simply glanced at the three of them, and then, continued to send his stupid disciple some spiritual energy. After confirming that she was alright, only then did he pull his hand back, and respond indifferently. \u201cMn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sovereign Yi Ran was the first to spot Zhu Yao who was standing at the side. Out of the three Sovereigns, his personality was the most friendly in the first place. He took the initiative to converse with her. \u201cCould this person be the new junior-martial sister taken in by martial-uncle?\u201d He suddenly understood why martial uncle Yu Yan unforgivingly released his pressure towards them earlier. So it was because they had harmed their junior-martial sister earlier.</p><br/><p>But, in actual fact, this was not a fault of theirs. The ones seated above this tall stage were all Sect Masters of the various sects, and their cultivation levels were at least at the early Azoth-stage. Who would have thought that his martial uncle Yu Yan would actually bring his disciple here to watch the tournament out of sudden impulse?</p><br/><p>It would not have been right for Zhu Yao, who was pinpointed out, to continue keeping silent, hence, she bowed to the three of them. \u201cGreetings to senior-martial brothers, greetings to senior-martial sister.\u201d Zhu Yao had always known that there were three Sovereigns at the Demigod-stage in Ancient Hill Sect, however, as she had always been confined, she never saw them.</p><br/><p>Other than Yi Ran, the two others simply nodded their heads politely.</p><br/><p>Yi Ran\u2019s smile was especially friendly. \u201cA couple of days ago, I heard martial-uncle had taken in a junior-martial sister, yet, we never had the fate to meet. I didn\u2019t expect that, the moment we actually get to meet each other, you had already built yourr Foundation. As I thought, you\u2019re rather extraordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother, you flatter me too much.\u201d Mn, looks like he\u2019s a rather friendly person. Zhu Yao smiled. \u201cSenior-martial brother had always been in closed-door training, so I did not dare to disturb. Please do not blame me for not doing so, senior-martial brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister, you\u2019re too courteous. If you don\u2019t mind, you can visit my cave residence whenever you\u2019re free.\u201d Yi Ran gave an even happier smile, and suddenly, as though he had thought of something, he continued to ask. \u201cRight, I still do not know junior-martial sister\u2019s name. Since you have admitted into the Jade Forest Mountain, you should have Yu as your surname. May I ask of your Daoist title?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened in an instant. Friendly, your sister! You can\u2019t dig out a person\u2019s dark secret just like that. Gritting her teeth angrily, she replied word by word. \u201cMy. Name. Is. Yu\u2026 Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words fell, Yu Yan who was beside her instantly turned and threw her a suspicious stare. Did I not bestow you the name \u2018Wang\u2019?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao returned him a ruthless glare. You\u2019re Desire, your entire family\u2019s Desire!</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned, and then, he sighed. He silently thought to himself. My disciple\u2019s stupidity is getting worse and worse. She can\u2019t even remember her own Daoist title. Then, he turned back and continued to look towards the ring. While Zhu Yao continued to silently stare daggers at his back.</p><br/><p>Seeing that there was something amiss with the atmosphere between the master and disciple, Yi Ran tactfully stopped his questioning. After giving a few polite greetings, he positioned himself a little lower, and sat on his white tiger as he watched the match.</p><br/><p>Hence, the tall stage was separated into three levels. The first level comprised of Yu Yan, and Zhu Yao, who was standing behind him. The second level comprised of the three Sovereigns. And the third level comprised of the various Mountain Lords and the Sect Masters of the different sects. With such a distinct separation in levels, Zhu Yao felt that she only required a can of cola to complete a super deluxe meal.</p><br/><p>The appearance of Sovereign Yu Yan and the other three Sovereigns undoubtedly ignited the flames in the hearts of all of the disciples present. It must be known that in every Inter-Sect Tournament, to these participating disciples, not only was the tournament used to showcase a sect\u2019s strength, it was even more so a chance for them to spread their names in the cultivation world.</p><br/><p>And the victor of every tournament would be able to obtain a chance to receive pointers from elders who were at least at the Nascent Soul stage. And today, the strongest elders of Ancient Hill Sect even appeared. Leaving aside Sovereign Yu Yan who was number one in the cultivation world, even if they were only able to receive a few pointers from one of the three Demigod Sovereigns, the participants would still benefit for life.</p><br/><p>Cultivation was not simply about absorbing spiritual energy to increase one\u2019s cultivation level. The essence of cultivation was more about one\u2019s comprehension to life and the Dao. And people who could reach the Demigod-stage, definitely had insights, of the many lives in the world and the Dao, that exceeded normal people. To receive a single pointer of them, forget about sudden realizations, it would benefit their future cultivation even more.</p><br/><p>And because of this fact, every participating disciple worked even harder, as they fought with hundred and twenty percent concentration.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Zhu Yao was unable to see them. That\u2019s right, she was unable to see them. Zhu Yao only realized this when she decided to seriously watch the competition. Damn it, leaving aside the fact that this stage is too high up, why the hell is there a formation that blocks the line of sight in place? Naturally, those with high cultivation levels would not be affected, however, she was merely a Foundation practitioner, she basically could not see what was happening on the ring at all. As she thought, a price must be paid for acting tough. It was no wonder that, other than the various Sect Masters and Mountain Lords, there were no other disciples present. It was not because they were unwilling to bring them here, rather, they had known of this fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026 May I head down and take a closer look?\u201d Zhu Yao had no choice but to discuss with Yu Yan, and temporarily shifted her gaze away from the ring.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan looked at her, and understood that she was unable to see anything from here either. Hence, he nodded. \u201cAfter the matches are done, return immediately. Do not stay for long.\u201d To prevent yourself from learning bad things. Of course, he did not say that last line out loud.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded. She looked around, and as she thought, she saw a familiar figure. Coincidentally, he was looking in her direction as well. Zhu Yao immediately activated the weapon beneath her, and hurriedly flew over.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle wimp!\u201d Zhu Yao tapped on the youth in front of her, who was looking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister Zhu Yao!\u201d Wang Xuzhi excitedly turned his head. \u201cYou\u2019re finally able to leave the mountain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded. \u201cI\u2019m prodigious, after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi did not retort about her arrogance, and simply pulled her hand, revealing a much happier smile.</p><br/><p>The person standing beside him noticed this, and with a gossiping look, he spoke up. \u201cJunior-martial brother, who is she? Aren\u2019t you going to introduce her to us? When did you meet her? You little brat, I didn\u2019t think you have this sort of taste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi\u2019s expression instantly darkened, and he glared at him angrily. \u201cThird senior-martial brother, don\u2019t be disrespectful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, you\u2019re angry!\u201d Yan Yuehong twirled a strand of hair next to him. Looking at him from the corner of his eye, his smile was filled with ambiguity. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, junior-martial brother. Even though your senior-martial brother here is cool and handsome, and beloved by everyone, I will not steal her away from you. And\u2026 your senior-martial brother doesn\u2019t really like older women, they\u2019re not my type.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Yuehong!\u201d Wang Xuzhi\u2019s furiousness was like a cat with its hair standing up, as though he could fight him to the death in the next moment.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, Du Yuanchen nearby saw her as well, and before Wang Xuzhi could explode, he placed his hands together and gave Zhu Yao a bow. \u201cThis disciple greets Grand-martial aunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, the one whose expression darkened was Yan Yuehong.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao chuckled, and had Du Yuanchen raise his head. Then, she turned and swept a glance at the person called Yan Yuehong. \u201cSo you\u2019re my martial nephew\u2019s third disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yuehong\u2019s brows tightened, and had no choice but to respond awkwardly. \u201cYes, greetings to grand-martial aunt. If Yuehong has offended grand-martial aunt, please forgive me.\u201d He simply wanted to use this rare opportunity to tease his junior-martial brother who behaved so seriously at such a young age. How would he have known that she had a higher status than him. I can\u2019t be blamed for this!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

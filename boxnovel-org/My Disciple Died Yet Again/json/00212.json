Earlier, she was still a little worried that with so many people surrounding the place, it would cause some trouble for her master. However, after arriving did she realize that she had overthought this.</p><br/><p>Forget about forcing their way in, these people could not even approach the lightning formation. The moment someone even approach it in the slightest, that lightning formation would strike that person charred black without discrimination. Thus, the large crowd of people could only look at the towering palace floating in the sky from afar.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao and Lin Xiang greeted the Sect Master, before silently standing within Blue Parasol Sect\u2019s crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master Lin, among the sects, Blue Parasol Sect has the most disciples, and the most capable people.\u201d A middle-aged man walked out, and spoke to Blue Parasol Sect Master. \u201cThis place was also found by the disciples of Blue Parasol Sect, I wonder if there\u2019s a method to enter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Yu was carrying a difficult expression as well. Initially, these ruins appeared within Blue Parasol Sect\u2019s domain, and it was already really uncomfortable to have various clans and sects force their way in to hunt for treasures without notifying him. Now, after realizing they did not have the capabilities to enter the place, they even wanted Blue Parasol Sect to stand out and take the lead? He was really unsatisfied with the behaviour of the various sects.</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master Wu, my apologies.\u201d He courteously smiled. \u201cIf we had known about any methods to enter the place, why would we have waited till now? Though I have heard that Rise Point Sect had already arrived two days ago to investigate this place, I believe you must be more familiar with the place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rise Point Sect Master was struck with a reversal, and also found out that his opponent did not know of any methods to break through the sword formation either. Not to mention, the other party seemed to grown even more cautious of him now. Thus, he no longer spoke up about having Blue Parasol Sect taking the lead, and turned around to discuss about other possible tactics with the rest.</p><br/><p>However, with the sheer large number of clans and sects, the number of opinions were large as well. For every suggestion spoken, there were definitely people who rejected it. The various sects continued to discuss about this matter, and even after a long while, there still wasn\u2019t a single conclusion. Instead, their arguments seemed to be grow even more intense as they spoke.</p><br/><p>Seeing that they weren\u2019t united, Zhu Yao felt at ease. It seemed like these people wanting to break her master\u2019s Five Way Nine Circulation Heavenly Thunder Formation was simply a joke. She really was worried for nothing. Just when were they going to stop arguing? She was about to fall asleep soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao.\u201d Yue Ying suddenly appeared behind her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment. \u201cWhy did you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI followed master here.\u201d He replied.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at her surroundings. Ho? She realized Blue Parasol Sect seemed to have expended quite a generous amount of manpower this time, as their three Nascent Soul practitioners were all here. It seemed like this place was something they had to obtain no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao, come over here.\u201d Yue Ying pulled Zhu Yao back a few steps. Leaving the crowd, he suddenly reached out to grab her waist, flew up, and landed on a branch. \u201cIt\u2019s clearer to see from up here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed below where the crowd of people of various sects were arguing without end. The position they were in was pretty high up, and it was possible to see every single person present with a single glance. It was indeed a good spot. Zhu Yao gave him a thumbs up. \u201cGood job!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying gave a gentle smile, as he turned around and passed her a bag of snacks. \u201cDo you want to eat something?</p><br/><p>Such good service? Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes instantly brightened, as she stroked Yue Ying\u2019s head. Good son!</p><br/><p>Opening the bag, she took a look inside, and was dumbfounded a moment later.</p><br/><p>What was stored inside was none other a bunch of golden melon seeds of consistent size that filled the bag to the brim. The seeds were all plump and ripe, releasing a familiar sweet scent.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s hands trembled. She suddenly raised her head, and unconsciously called out. \u201cShao Bai\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis, what happened?\u201d Yue Ying was startled, as he said with a confused expression. \u201cWho\u2019s Shao Bai?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Nothing.\u201d Zhu Yao suppressed the shock in her heart, and casually asked. \u201cWhy did you suddenly think of bringing me these?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile we were on the way here, we passed by a market run by mortals. I spotted a stall at the roadside selling these, so I bought it.\u201d A hint of disappointment surfaced on Yue Ying\u2019s face. \u201cWhy? Big Sis Yao doesn\u2019t like them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao hurriedly shook her head. \u201cNo, I love it\u2026 I love it very much.\u201d So it was just a coincidence? That\u2019s true. Yue Ying was Yue Ying himself, how he could possibly recall the matters of his past life?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Big Sis Yao worried about Yu Yan?\u201d Yue Ying spoke up coldly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded. She did not hide the fact that her master had regained his cultivation from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao, you don\u2019t have to worry. Based on these people\u2019s abilities alone\u2026 \u201c He swept his gaze below with narrowed eyes, as though he was taking this seriously, but at the same time, taking this lightly as well. Closing in on Zhu Yao\u2019s ear, he whispered. \u201cNone of them is capable of breaking that sword formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>She naturally knew that her master\u2019s sword formation wasn\u2019t simple, but she couldn\u2019t deny that one in ten thousandth probability of it breaking. After all, there was already that Mary Sue bug present in this world, there might even be something that could break sword formations in a single second.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then we will do it this way.\u201d Over on that side, someone suddenly said this out loud. As though they had finally came up with a basic plan of action, everyone went back to their respective camps.</p><br/><p>Blue Parasol Sect Master Lin Yu returned as well, but he first headed in the direction of the three Nascent Soul sovereigns, greeted them with a respectful bow, and began speaking about the results of their discussion. Zhu Yao wasn\u2019t sure of the details they discussed about, but she could hear the Sect Master speak these words. \u201cI humbly request the three Sovereigns to give their fullest aid.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the three sovereigns changed, looking as though they were hesitating. A hint of dissatisfaction could be seen from the creases of their brows. However, in the end, Xuan Xu was the first one who nodded, and the other sovereign agreed as well. Though, the only female sovereign Xuan Yin seemed to be hesitating a little.</p><br/><p>She wondered if it was her imagination, but Zhu Yao had the feeling that Xuan Yin seemed to have looked in their direction, and from her eyes, it looked as though she was seeking for help.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt it was strange. Who was she looking at? Yue Ying?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but look at Yue Ying, however, he was still peeling off the melon seeds for her with a gentle smile, and he did not even bother raising his head. It must be her imagination. Yue Ying was her disciple, and the disciples had always been the ones listening to their masters, just when was there ever a master who would ask for his or her disciple\u2019s opinions?</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the three Sovereigns had already rose into the skies on their swords, and they flew towards the lightning formation. At the same time, there were people from the various sects who simultaneously followed their lead, and after counting, there were eight of them. Furthermore, she was completely unable to see through their cultivation level, which proved that their cultivation level were all above hers.</p><br/><p>Eight people, with one person in each direction, stopped at the corners of the ruins, and they took up art casting stances one after another.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao realize what they were trying to do, and she hurriedly stood up.</p><br/><p>The hell, these people were trying to break the formation together!</p><br/><p>Yue Ying however pulled her back, and said with a smile. \u201cBig Sis Yao, it\u2019s fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao glanced at the eight people, and then looked back at Yue Ying, before she was able to endure the urge to stop them. The eight of them had already begun to cast their arts.</p><br/><p>Eight eye-piercing rays of light struck the boundaries of the formation at the same time. A glaring white light was released from the surroundings of the ruins, and one could hardly open his or her eyes from the blinding light. They could only hear a series of loud explosions constantly trembling in their ears.</p><br/><p>Thenafter, the mighty pressure which had been enveloping the surrounding area suddenly disappeared. Even the gigantic lightning sword that had been encircling the ruins suddenly stopped moving as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccess!\u201d Xuan Xu\u2019s face was filled with excitement, and his eyes instantly brightened. The faces of the other seven were filled with joy as well.</p><br/><p>Just as they were about to fly in with their swords, that gigantic lightning sword seemed to have been affected by something, as it began to glow much brighter than the white light before. A pressure that could envelop the sky and topple the earth instantly came pressing down on the eight people.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good! Hurry and flee!\u201d Xuan Xu\u2019s expression changed, as he turned and attempted to flee.</p><br/><p>However, it was already too late. Eight gigantic swords suddenly flew out from the formation. They instantly turned into eight lightning rays of light, and with an irresistible force, directly flew in the directions of the eight people. Before they could even react, they had already been struck off the sky by the heavenly lightning bolts, and were pinned to the ground.</p><br/><p>Their dantians shook from the lightning strikes, and their divine senses turned unstable. Even their nascent souls were faintly aching from the attack, and some even had their cultivation fall by a small level. The once almighty Nascent Soul practitioners were presently lying on the ground together, unable to move an inch.</p><br/><p>The smell of charred meat faintly suffused in the air.</p><br/><p>Let alone the various disciples, the various sect masters themselves were unable to react to this sudden group collapse situation. None of them expected that the Nascent Soul practitioner team that represented the strongest force of this world would be eliminated this easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 How is this possible\u2026\u201d Some rubbed their eyes in disbelief.</p><br/><p>But this was not the end.</p><br/><p>Before the crowd could even react, a terrifying pressure had already enveloped them. The venue which was still loud and bustling earlier, like toppled onions, fell onto the ground one after another. As though they were suddenly pressed by something, every single one of them crawled on the ground, unable to move an inch.</p><br/><p>Some low-leveled disciples with poor foundation had even puked out blood and fainted right after.</p><br/><p>Other than Zhu Yao and Yue Ying who were still on the tree. That terrifying pressure seemed to have especially detoured around the two of them, not affecting them in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>Though she understood that her master was a little overprotective, wasn\u2019t this too obvious?</p><br/><p>Should she\u2026 try to go along with everyone?</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya!\u201d Zhu Yao lightly called out, fell onto the branch below and hugged onto it. She turned to look at Yue Ying who was still sitting upright, and then casually pulled him down as well.</p><br/><p>Low-key, do you know what low-key means?</p><br/><p>A cold voice transmitted from the skies. The voice wasn\u2019t loud, yet it clearly resounded in everyone\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s matter will only be dealt with a small punishment. If such offense is made once again, there will definitely be heavy consequences!\u201d</p><br/><p>That voice carried spiritual energy, and with every word he said, the many people present could not help but puke out another mouthful of blood. After a single sentence, a large half of the disciples on the ground had already fainted. This terrifying strength was truly unheard of.</p><br/><p>The Blue Parasol Sect Master was drenched in sweat. Suddenly recalling Zhu Yao\u2019s words, he finally felt fearful. She mentioned that the person who could set up such a formation must definitely be a powerful expert, which he did not believe in the beginning. Now, he had no choice but to believe her words. He never expected that there was still a cultivation level in higher than the Nascent Soul realm, and it was so terrifyingly higher as well. For a moment, he was so regretful that his intestines were turning green. Among the people that came here today, Blue Parasol Sect had the most people. If they had truly angered that person today, then their sect would have been destroyed.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, from the meaning behind his words, this powerful expert did not plan on pursing their offense.</p><br/><p>However, that pressure had still yet to be retracted. Was there still something else?</p><br/><p>As expected, a fiery red figure suddenly flew out from the ruins. A man dressed in a profound robe appeared before the crowd.</p><br/><p>The pressure on the crowd instantly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was dumbfounded for a moment, and then, she suddenly widened her eyes.</p><br/><p>This person\u2026 Who was he?</p><br/><p>Just as the crowd of people were making guesses if this person was actually that powerful expert, he said. \u201cMy lord has an order. A tribulation will soon befall upon this world, since you people have found this place, then it can be considered as the work of destiny.\u201d The profoundly dressed man swept a glance at the crowd. \u201cHe will bestow a mystic artifact to the world in order to pass this tribulation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mystic artifact!</p><br/><p>The crowd\u2019s eyes instantly shone. Who would have expected that a situation like this would happen? They began to crawl up one after another. After all, they were all here to search for treasures. They never expected that after kicking a metal plate, a treasure would unexpectedly fall off from that metal plate.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow daoist.\u201d Lin Yu greeted the man, and courteously said. \u201cMay we know of your lord\u2019s name? And what is the name of this palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man raised his head and said without a mind. \u201cMy lord is Lord Yu Yan of Jade Forest Peak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She finally believed that this person was dispatched by her master.</p><br/><p>But if you want to act cool, at the very least, change your name, hey! Is it really alright to use the name Jade Forest Peak like this?</p><br/><p>Jade Forest Peak was a mountain, but this was clearly a palace! Only ghosts would believe you, right!</p><br/><p>\u201cI see!\u201d Lin Yu said in an understanding manner. \u201cEarlier, we have made countless offenses, and I hope your esteemed lord would forgive us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, there\u2019s someone who actually believes his words!</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow daoist, about the mystic artifact which you said your lord will bestow us\u2026\u201d Finally, he came to the main point. In an instant, everyone\u2019s eyes shuffled over one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cChoose a destined person to follow me into the palace to retrieve it.\u201d The man said.</p><br/><p>Lin Yu turned joyous, and just when he was about to volunteer himself. \u201cThen I shall\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChoose her then!\u201d That man looked around, and when he saw Zhu Yao on the tree, his expression instantly brightened. He walked over with huge strides, and then waved at her while standing under the tree.</p><br/><p>As though his image had suddenly changed, his eyes shone as he looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s you then. Come, follow me into the palace, meow~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, as she finally recognized this person before her.</p><br/><p>This habit of wanting to reach out his paw towards her, wasn\u2019t this that Risefire Beast? When was it capable of taking up a human form?</p><br/><p>And what was with that \u201cmeow\u201d earlier? What happened to that esteemed and cold image earlier?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at me with drool on your face, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the palace, to the palace!\u201d The Risefire Beast raised its two hands towards her. In front of her eyes, it was as though she was looking at that four-legged beastie, reaching its two front paws towards her, and pleading her to hold its paws with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. Lin Yu who was at the side was casting glances at her, hoping that she would agree immediately.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed, and understood in a second that her master must have something to instruct her with. Thus, he came up with an excuse, and dispatched the Risefire Beast to find her.</p><br/><p>So, she immediately leapt down from the tree. \u201cThen I will have to trouble fellow daoist to lead the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>With slight disappointment, the Risefire Beast looked at its two paws which merely caught empty air. Pouting its small lips, it looked as though it was about to cry, but it still obediently turned into a ray of white light and flew in the direction of the ruins.</p><br/><p>Riding on her sword, Zhu Yao followed close behind.</p><br/><p>The huge sword that was encircling the ruins automatically split itself, revealing a passageway behind it.</p><br/><p>When the Risefire Beast returned to the ruins, it turned back to that huge beastie, and brought her to the teleportation formation. Those pair of bell-like beast eyes finally could not endure it any longer and large amount of disheartened tears came pouring down, as though it had suffered the worst of grievances.</p><br/><p>A familiar, tender voice resounded. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like me\u2026 She doesn\u2019t want to hold my paws\u2026 Doesn\u2019t want to hold my paws\u2026 Wuuuuuu\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. Sighing, she stepped forward and hugged its four hoofs, before walking into the teleportation formation.</p><br/><p>The scenery changed, and she once again returned to that mustard seed dimensional space.</p><br/><p>A figure dressed in a snow-white robe appeared before her eyes. With a light smile, he reached out his two hands towards her.</p><br/><p>Another one!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

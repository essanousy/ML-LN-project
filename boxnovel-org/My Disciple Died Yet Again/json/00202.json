How people lived were their own problems, and she was not interested in interfering either. However, she hated bitches, especially one such as Yi Ling. She didn\u2019t know what Yi Ling told her follower Qi Ping, but on the second day, he had already furiously came knocking on her doorsteps, saying that she wanted to seek justice for her.</p><br/><p>In regards to such idiots, the only way was to ignore him, and allow him to throw whatever tantrum he wanted. She had long placed down a formation at the entrance, so no matter how fiercely he roared, he wasn\u2019t able to enter. The noise outside thus quelled in just a few days.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s plan was simple. Before Yi Ling\u2019s main death-seaking event happens, she had to restore as much of her cultivation as possible. When it came to her master and Yue Ying, they were transformed from fruits, and in a certain sense, fruits were similar to seeds. This also explained why they could only grow while buried in the soil.</p><br/><p>In regards to this, she planned to make a long-term plan. Using isolation training as the reason, she was going to bury the two children into the soil.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent encountering idiots such as Yi Ling again, she decided to dig the hole at the backyard.</p><br/><p>Today, she was going to plant two little children, and when spring comes, she would be rewarded with two handsome men.</p><br/><p>Heheh. When thinking about it, she became a little excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d Yu Yan frowned. \u201cWe will fall into deep slumber during this phase, you must be careful on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have already greeted the manager of this place, and told him that we will be in isolation training for the next few years. No one will come.\u201d So you two can just grow up with a peace of mind.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was still worried. After all, he was very aware of his disciple\u2019s death-seeking abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore your master recovers his cultivation, you\u2019re not allowed to act rashly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan habitually reached out his hand to stroke her head. Suddenly, he raised his head and smooched on her lips, and said with a solemn voice. \u201cBe obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Her master actually took the initiative to express his love. She still feel excited about it.</p><br/><p>If only he could have kissed her without first place a chair under his feet.</p><br/><p>She watched as the little shota ran off to bring a chair, place it heavily in front of her, and then used both his hands and feet to climb up. After a long while, pouting his small lips, he then landed a smooch on her lips.</p><br/><p>Other than expressing thanks for his hard work, Zhu Yao really couldn\u2019t bring up any romantic thoughts.</p><br/><p>She had to hurry and let her master grow up. She must! And immediately!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao thought that with the growth speed she saw back then, her master\u2019s and Yue Ying\u2019s cultivation would recover their cultivation really quickly. She never expected that after burying them for five years, the two four to five year olds had only grown up to about twelve to thirteen years old, and their height had merely doubled.</p><br/><p>Her master\u2019s face already had the look she was familiar with, only Yue Ying\u2019s was different. He was no longer that the tall and skinny man she knew, rather, he was becoming even whiter and moist, looking even more like\u2026 Shao Bai.</p><br/><p>Although she knew that they were the same person, this change still made her feel a little strange.</p><br/><p>In these five years, they had been in a state of deep slumber. Although she had placed down formations in the surroundings, she was still worried, and thus decided to guard them by the side while raising her cultivation. Because of this half-heartedness, her cultivation level naturally did not increase much, and had merely rose from the first level of Foundation to the second level.</p><br/><p>Though her master had instantly reached the late stages of Foundation.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d This feeling of being surpassed by someone from the back, was simply too irritating. The authority she had as their mom was gone just like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026\u201d The young man on the left suddenly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying, you woke up.\u201d Zhu Yao walked over and hurriedly dug the person out. She never expected that Yue Ying would be the first one to wake up. \u201cHow are you? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying replied her with a smile, his entire face turned ever so gentle. \u201cBig Sis Yao, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m already in my complete form.\u201d</p><br/><p>He already had a faint image of a young man, and his head had already reached her shoulders. The moment he smiled, it was as though flowery light effects were blooming all around him, an astonishingly beautiful scene.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart ached. He was becoming more like Shao Bai.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao?\u201d Seeing that she was in a daze, Yue Ying tugged her sleeves. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much.\u201d Only then did Zhu Yao regain her senses. Concealing her thoughts, she pulled up his hand and checked his pulse.</p><br/><p>After her resurrection, she had subconsciously prevented herself from thinking about Shao Bai. Back then, when she forcefully sent him into the light of guidance, it was merely to save his life. However, she never expected her actions were counterproductive, not only she not save him, she had instead made him fall even deeper into the Devil\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying was, at the same time, him, but not him as well. She could not forget Shao Bai, and she was unable to treat Yue Ying as him either. Just like how Mushmush had the exact same look as Wang Xuzhi, she was unable to treat Mushmush as him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026\u201d Yue Ying held her face with his hand, and his expression instantly sunk, a hint of something flashed past his eyes. \u201cWhy are you sad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment. She lightly coughed, and then slapped away his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be nonsensical. Your body is fine, and your cultivation has already reached Foundation as well. But master\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She worriedly looked at the person who was still in the hole. Yue Ying was already awake, so why wasn\u2019t there any reaction from her master?</p><br/><p>Theoretically speaking, she was at the Foundation level when she transformed, and now even Yue Ying was awake at the Foundation level, yet her master was already at the late stages of Foundation, so why wasn\u2019t he waking up?</p><br/><p>Could it be that she had to sprinkle some water?</p><br/><p>She\u2019s not growing flowers, hey!</p><br/><p>Before she could even figure this out completely, the Sect Master had already dispatched some people over.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Sect Master has an order, please bring junior-martial brother Yue Ying to the main hall.\u201d The disciple who came to send the message looked at her with an irritated and disdainful look, as though he scorned her to the extreme.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not know how she had offended him, but she could guess the reason why the Sect Master had called her. It was most probably regarding Yue Ying\u2019s tutelage matter. After hesitating for a moment, she then followed the disciple towards the venue. Before that, she once again reinforced the formations around the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to enter the hall, a pink figure came forward, and with an enthusiastic look, she sprinted towards\u2026 Yue Ying, who was by Zhu Yao\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial brother Yue, you\u2019re finally here.\u201d Yi Ling\u2019s face was filled with joy of having their long-awaited reunion. After sizing Yue Ying up, her eyes instantly brightened up several times, and her face actually revealed a hint of shyness.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat. This Mary Sue couldn\u2019t be thinking of hooking up her family\u2019s Yue Ying right? He\u2019s still a child!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been five years, junior-martial brother Yue, have you been well?\u201d Yu Ling suddenly turned her head to give Zhu Yao a meaningful glance, and gently said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. If you have any grievances, please feel free to tell your senior-martial sister, I will help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was Yi Ling trying to say that she would mistreat Yue Ying? Zhu Yao frowned, as she pulled Yue Ying behind her and stood in front of Yi Ling, blocking her line of sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister Yi, it\u2019s been awhile.\u201d You Mary Sue with no restraints, don\u2019t touch my son. \u201cI wonder if your talisman techniques have improved?\u201d Would it still self-destruct?</p><br/><p>Her expression stiffened, as though she had recalled that incident when the talisman she used exploded on its own. She then unwillingly greeted. \u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing\u2019er, so this is junior-martial brother Yue you have often talked about, the one with the All Elemental Spirit Veins.\u201d A green robed man walked out behind Yi Ling. He looked about twenty years old, with a rather dashing face, he wore a crown on his head while holding onto a jade flute in his hand, giving an elegant gentlemanly look.</p><br/><p>He sized up the two people in front of his eyes, and then turned to look at Yi Ling with a gentle look.</p><br/><p>\u201cLan Qi.\u201d Yi recovered her naive and charming expression, and looked towards Yue Ying. \u201cThis is Yue Ying, the disciple whom my master is taking in this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression sank a little, giving Yue Ying a serious look, before saying with a smile. \u201cAt such a young age, he already possesses a Foundation cultivation level, his aptitude is indeed outstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>When hearing this, Yi Ling\u2019s face was filled with shock, and the eyes she were looking at Yue Ying with turned even brighter. \u201cJunior-martial brother Yue, you built your Foundation! When did it happen? Why didn\u2019t you inform me?\u201d She suddenly looked towards Zhu Yao with a lecturing gaze. \u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu, now this is a wrong on your part. Building one\u2019s Foundation is a huge matter, how can you not at least inform the sect about this? If something happened, do you know of the consequences?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan Qi nodded as well, and the eyes he were looking at Zhu Yao with carried a hint of dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>The hell! This Mary Sue is sick, right!? She really can\u2019t stop framing me at every moment. What does my son\u2019s Foundation building have to do with you? Why is there a need to inform you?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for junior-martial sister to worry. You should be aware that my family\u2019s Yue Ying has a good aptitude, so building his Foundation could be said to be an easy feat, unlike someone else\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao narrowed her eyes at her. If her eyes were seeing things right, she was still in at the Essence stage. It had already been five years, yet she had yet to build her Foundation!</p><br/><p>Yi Ling\u2019s expression paled. Evidently, she understood the meaning behind her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Her eyes reddened, as though she just suffered the heaviest of grievances. \u201cI\u2019m merely worried about Yue Ying, that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that a certain someone was suffering, the knight, Lan Qi, naturally became unhappy as well. He looked towards Zhu Yao with a frown, and faintly released his Azoth might. \u201cThis junior-martial sister, why the need to harm someone with your words?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, just which pair of eyes of yours did you see me harm her? As expected, all men that approached Mary Sue had their intelligence degenerated?</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, Lan Qi.\u201d Yi Ling sniffled, and put up a strong front. \u201cMaster and Sect Master have already been waiting in the main hall for a long time. Junior-martial brother Yue, today is the big day where you will be taken under a master\u2019s tutelage. Let\u2019s hurry along.\u201d After saying that, she reached out his hand to pull Yue Ying.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Before her hand could even make contact with said person, it was deflected by a spiritual pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing\u2019er!\u201d Lan Qi\u2019s figure flashed, as he grab onto her deflected body. His expression instantly sank, and with flaming eyes, he glared at Yue Ying. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was planning to lecture him, he was interrupted.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying who had been keeping quiet the entire time, finally turned his head to look at the two people. \u201cI don\u2019t like people touching me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those eyes were cold to the point where not a single emotion could be seen. It was clearly a face which did not carry a single expression, yet, Lan Qi suddenly felt a cold intent instantly seeping into his bones. Fear unknowingly surged within him, and cold sweat trickled down from his head. And just like that, he swallowed back the words he were about to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, let\u2019s go in.\u201d Yue Ying turned his head back. When he pulled onto Zhu Yao\u2019s hand, a blooming smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Zhu Yao did not feel like entertaining this pair of idiots either, as she entered the hall with Yue Ying.</p><br/><p>The two people were thus left behind with dumbfounded expressions. Yi Ling never expected that she, who had been surrounded by men who had never treated her badly, would encounter Yue Ying\u2019s rejection.</p><br/><p>Lan Qi tightened his fists. He could still feel that his hands were still trembling slightly. He was clearly merely a Foundation disciple, yet why did he have such a terrifying aura?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

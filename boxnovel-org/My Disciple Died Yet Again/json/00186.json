When teaching Zhu Yao mystic arts, occasionally, he would bring various wild animals for meals, have her cook them, and then, finish them all by himself.</p><br/><p>In order to have a certain someone understand the importance of sharing, she purposefully stopped working for two days. In the end, Yue Gu compromised on her having to cook two portions each time, which meant her workload had now doubled. Hence, this neet who had never left his home for several tens of thousands of years, began to walk throughout the mountains for hunting expeditions. Today, he brought a rabbit, tomorrow, he brought a chicken, and the day after\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mistress, save me!\u201d Zhu Yao looked at the durian that was approaching her, and was speechless for a moment. What\u2019s the meaning of bringing back a durian?</p><br/><p>\u201cHighgod\u2026 Highgod wants to eat me. Uuuuu\u2026.\u201d The durian spirit cried to the point that tears were oozing out from its nose. He no longer had the proud and domineering look he showed when he was introducing himself back then.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, as she looked at a certain calm-looking teacher. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of having me grill this today, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Gu raised his head, and said with a serious look. \u201cA living creature.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d As expected, she shouldn\u2019t have harbored any hope when it came to his common sense. \u201cThis can\u2019t be grilled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. I can\u2019t be grilled, can\u2019t be grilled.\u201d The durian spirit immediately responded in agreement, Yue Gu instantly revealed a face of disappointment.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201cBut\u2026 it can be eaten raw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Durian spirit: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mistress, how can you be like this? Back then, it was I who guided your path.\u201d The durian spirit cried even more than before, as he pounced towards her leg, and cried as he rubbed against it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt that her leg was dealt with 1000 damage.</p><br/><p>Kicking him slightly away, she then gave a certain teacher an explanation, about the differences between plants and animals that had turned into spirits, and the range of food that were edible. Only then did Yue Gu dishearteningly let go of the durian spirit.</p><br/><p>Yue Gu\u2019s mood was a little depressed, and it was all due to not being able to have a meal. Hence, he decided to teach his disciple a harder mystic art today.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil Smiting Inscription.\u201d Yue Gu said with a stern expression. \u201cThis is the only mystic art in the world that can be used to directly exterminate a Devil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s actually a method to kill a Devil?\u201d Wasn\u2019t it said that Devils could only be sealed?</p><br/><p>Yue Gu nodded. \u201cThe moment the Devil Smiting Inscription is evoked, it can completely disperse the devillic core of a Devil. However\u2026\u201d His expression sank. \u201cEven if that\u2019s the case, the Devil will simply turn into regular devillic aura, and as long as it encounters another Devil, it can then be made use of. In the ancient era, the Gods had once used this art to exterminate many Devils. However, the dispersed devillic aura had actually strengthened the remaining Devils even more, which thus led to the fall of many Gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was the reason why he was the only remaining ancient God left.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be teaching this mystic art to you, but unless it\u2019s an absolute necessity, do not evoke it.\u201d Yue Gu instructed with a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded.</p><br/><p>Only then did he give her the details about the mystic art, and also, guide her in the circulation method of her godly energy. Zhu Yao understood why he said not to use it unless absolutely necessary. This mystic art made use of all of the godly energy in one\u2019s body, and suppress them into a single point before releasing them all in an instant. The moment this art was evoked, at the very least, one\u2019s godly energy would not be able to recover for three days. It\u2019s a method that\u2019s used to kill enemies in exchange for a large rebound.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you memorized it?\u201d Yue Gu asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, close.\u201d In terms of theory, she had already completely understood it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I will demonstrate it once for you.\u201d Yue Gu took a few steps forward, chanted the incantation, and a white light appeared on his palm. The light grew even brighter, to the point where even the surrounding scenery turned a little blurry and unclear. Then, the white light suddenly retracted, and gathered on his palm, forming a white-colored pearl. Yue Gu\u2019s hand moved, and that white pearl soared towards the sky, immediately followed by a white circular flash of light. Like fireworks being released in the dark night, it flashed for an instant, as though there was some sort of energy being dispersed in all directions, and then, it finally disappeared into the horizon.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see it?\u201d Yue Gu asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was startled for a moment. Are you sure what you released earlier wasn\u2019t fireworks? A strong mystic art like this should have made a larger commotion, right? Wouldn\u2019t blowing up the sky a little be more suitable?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince there\u2019s no Devils in this place, the effects naturally are not that evident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so it\u2019s like shooting blanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis mystic art must definitely not be casually used.\u201d Yue Gu pondered for a moment, before continuing with his instructions. \u201cThis mystic art uses quite the amount of mind energy, even out of my entire lifetime, I can only barely evoke it twice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwice?\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, and then, turned to look at his stern and serious expression. \u201cTeacher, you used it once earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yue Gu was startled for a moment, and only realized it after. \u201cThen I can only use it once more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d A mystic art of this level, and you actually wasted it so casually. Is that really alright? Where\u2019s your common sense?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly had the impulse to shout out loud, grab him by the collar, and shake him into his senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle\u2026 Little Mistress.\u201d The durian spirit that left earlier, unknowingly, crawled back. Standing far, far away, it was hiding behind a tree, and was only stretching out its stalk, glancing weakly in her direction. If Zhu Yao had already retracted her divine sense, she really wouldn\u2019t have noticed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She was just about to give Yue Gu some lessons on common sense, you know?</p><br/><p>The durian spirit weakly looked at Yue Gu by Zhu Yao\u2019s side, as though he was afraid he would eat him, and cautiously said. \u201cSomeone from the Phoenix clan came. He\u2019s waiting at the foot of the mountain. I\u2019m here to inform you of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Phoenix clan? Could it be Shao Bai? Zhu Yao departed from Yue Gu, and flew after the durian spirit.</p><br/><p>The moment she landed on the ground, she saw a sky-blue figure standing underneath that tall, durian tree. He had a portrait-like face, his expression carried a warm enveloping smile. Zhu Yao startled for a moment from this scene, as though the moment she opened her eyes, the view in front of her would disappear with the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister\u2026\u201d He lightly called out, his voice contained an indescribable warmth and lingering emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Bai.\u201d Zhu Yao walked over, throwing away those strange emotions.</p><br/><p>He lightly flicked his finger on her forehead, and said, acting as though he was angry. \u201cHow haughty of you, you have to call me second elder brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head, giving him a glare, as she began to flip through her past grudges. \u201cWhat? You finally found the conscience to see me?\u201d Back then, she could forget about him playing that dirty trick to send her here, but he even placed her under the durian tree as well. That was simply unbearable.</p><br/><p>Yet, his smile grew even deeper, as he stared focusedly on her face, and gently said. \u201cYou\u2019re still angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. Am I that petty?\u201d She really was that petty, though.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s this second elder brother\u2019s fault.\u201d He sure admitted his mistake pretty quickly, using a tone that felt like he was coaxing a child. \u201cSee, isn\u2019t this second elder brother here to see you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who cares? Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. Don\u2019t treat me like a child, alright? Even though she was clearly older than him by a margin. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come straight to the mountain peak?\u201d Wasn\u2019t he familiar with Yue Gu?</p><br/><p>Shao Bai was startled for a moment, before pointing to the durian tree, and said. \u201cThere\u2019s a barrier within the mountains. Unless the Far Ancient Highgod disperses it, no one else will be able to enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d No wonder he had to place her down on the durian tree back then, so it was to wait for Yue Gu\u2019s approval in letting her in. \u201cThen, I will look for teacher to permit you to enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Shao Bai pulled onto her hand, and with a slight amount of force, brought her to his embrace, and gave a long sigh. \u201cSecond elder brother is just here to see you, I will be leaving soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao blanked, for a moment, she had forgotten to resist. Raising her head, she looked at his satisfied expression, a strange sensation suddenly sprouted in the depths of her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing that you\u2019re alright, second elder brother feels at ease now.\u201d His expression was filled with an unregretful look. His hand gently stroked the hair behind her back, and his eyes carried emotions as deep as the sea. \u201cYou must behave well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Zhu Yao faintly felt that something had happened. After a careful look, Shao Bai\u2019s face seemed to look a little pale, and a hint of fatigue could even be seen on his forehead.</p><br/><p>Shao Bai\u2019s hands paused for a moment. As he slightly released her a little, his smile grew a little deeper. \u201cWhat can happen to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. \u201cSpeak human.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond elder brother just wishes to see you happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao did not speak, and simply stared at him.</p><br/><p>After a while, he finally admitted defeat, sighed, lowered his forehead in line with hers. \u201cLittle sister, you\u2019re just too clever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression sank. For some unknown reasons, she did not want to hear these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond elder brother is going to safeguard the Nether Abyss at the extreme southern lands.\u201d He looked as though he did not really mind it, yet, he deeply stared into her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNether Abyss?\u201d Zhu Yao blanked for a moment. Why did this name sound so familiar? After pondering for a moment, she suddenly widened her eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the place you were trapped in before?\u201d Never would she forget the bony and scrawny look he had back then, hence she unconsciously remembered the name of that place. \u201cWhy are you going there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai simply gave a light smile, his expression unexpectedly carried a hint of satisfaction, as he rubbed his forehead against hers a few times. Zhu Yao shrank her head a little uncomfortably.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, there has been frequent movements among the Devils, and the various clans have dispatched people over as support. The Nether Abyss is even more so in a chaotic state. So, the Patriarch has dispatched me to safeguard it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy the hell you?\u201d To put it simply, that place should be the shadow of his childhood, right!? Was it really alright to dispatch him?</p><br/><p>His expression sank, yet, his smile did not waver. \u201cThe Nether Abyss is different from the Devil Sealing Ground. What\u2019s being sealed there is devillic aura. If any Devil were to enter that place, it will bring about a huge disaster. I\u2019m\u2026 rather familiar with the place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt as though she had been pierced by something. Him bringing up these past matters so nonchalantly had made her feel even more uncomfortable. She could not help but cover that smile of his, that suddenly turned a little blinding, with her hands. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go, then don\u2019t go. Qian Yu won\u2019t blame you either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Bai was startled for a moment, and for a while, he didn\u2019t regain his senses, as though he had never expected that she would persuade him to give up. After a while, he laughed out. This time, it wasn\u2019t that watery warm smile he had earlier, but a true smile. As he laughed, he held her head, and said. \u201cLittle sister\u2026 Heh, little sister\u2026 my dear little sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. What\u2019s with that face of his that looked as though it was saying she was being immature?</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing to the Nether Abyss was my own idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, it seemed she had given it too much thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, nothing will happen to me.\u201d His expression instantly turned much relaxed than earlier, and even that small hint of fatigue had disappeared without a trace. \u201cOnce I return safely from the Nether Abyss, second elder brother will come see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded, then suddenly, she recalled something. \u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

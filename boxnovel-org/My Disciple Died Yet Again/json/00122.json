After taking a few steps, she once again turned around, and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, congratulations Sect Master Wu, for finding your true love. Although she had already lost her virginity, I believe you won\u2019t mind it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words fell, Mu Meiyan\u2019s expression instantly paled as well.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao however, flew back to Jade Forest Mountain in a good mood. Actually, the matter about Mu Meiyan losing her virginity, was something she had merely guessed. After all, in her dream, she had never given up on hooking up with Yue Hanxin\u2019s men, and would use every method available to do so. Now that a thousand years had already past, Zhu Yao simply would not believe that she had maintained herself as a virgin.</p><br/><p>And as expected, she guessed it right.</p><br/><p>In the cultivation world, practitioner-pair companionship was treated really seriously. As long as it\u2019s not a matter which could only be solved with death, a woman\u2019s virginity would usually be given to her practitioner-pair companion. Those with irregular relationships, would all be taken as furnaces. Hence, when Wu Song wanted to cancel this engagement, it would definitely bring about a huge influence onto Yu Yao. This was also the reason why Zhu Yao used her identity as the personal succeeding master, to deny this marriage, and change the entire situation into where Yu Yao was the one who did not want him and rejected his proposal.</p><br/><p>And at that time, Zi Mo was present as well. He was absolutely pleased, and had even spread out embellished news about this matter.</p><br/><p>And Wu Song was even a Sect Master now. Although she did not know how he had surpassed her authority and taken up the position, high positions would always come with misgivings.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he had always thought it was true love between them, yet, her body had long been given to someone else. She really wondered now that Mu Meiyan was no longer his benefactor in this timeline, nor was she the moonlight in his heart, just how far could their so-called true love go?</p><br/><p>Of course, they could simply suspect that Zhu Yao had casually made a nonsensical remark, as no one was able to determine if a person still held onto his or her virginity with just a glance. But, she was after all someone who came from the Jade Forest Mountain. Jade Forest Mountain was a place that no one in the cultivation world could understand in the first place. Even if what she said was false, the masses would still believe that it\u2019s true. Furthermore, the expression Mu Meiyan showed back then could only be true, and not false.</p><br/><p>Mu Meiyan had always believed that her own plight was all caused by the Mary Sue, Yue Hanxin. However, although Yue Hanxin was very hesitant with her own feelings, and constantly left feelings of love everywhere, at the very least, her body was pure and well. She simply got flirted on, and nothing absolute had actually happened. Between a man and a woman, if one was willing to hit, while the other was willing to get hit on, what did that have to concern a passer-by like her? If Mu Meiyan did not harbor such huge amount of jealousy in her past life, she would not have landed herself in such an ending as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, master.\u201d Yu Luo moved the corner of her lips, as though she was trying to smile. However, she was completely unable to smile at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thanking me for?\u201d Zhu Yao turned her head and glanced at her.</p><br/><p>Yu Luo lowered her head. \u201cThank you, master, for stepping forward to protect this disciple\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah.\u201d Zhu Yao understood that right now, she was feeling miserable. Hence, she could only step forward to hug her, and stroke her head, just like the time when she was young. \u201cLittle radish, it\u2019s hard to find a three-legged toad, but a man with two legs can be found anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Luo looked at her, and mist once again rose in her eyes. \u201cBut\u2026 I can\u2019t put it down. I really don\u2019t understand how the feelings we have developed for so many years, isn\u2019t able to beat their mere few years of knowing each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you be a little more optimistic? He\u2019s able to give up on the feelings the both of you have developed for so many years, so naturally, he\u2019s able to give up on other feelings as well. You simply came to understand this truth much earlier than you should have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Luo turned silent. Recalling that Mu Meiyan, her eyes sunk a little. \u201cWhy did he have to save that person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Luo.\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s expression turned stern, and said with a low voice. \u201cYou think that woman is the cause of everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut all this happened after she came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t her, it might be someone else as well. Yu Luo, if a dog wishes to bite someone, it\u2019s not something that can be decided by the roughness or length of the leash tied to it. One that bites, will always bite. One that doesn\u2019t bite, even if you don\u2019t tie it with a leash, will simply wag its tail when it sees people. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu Luo\u2019s face was completely at a loss. \u201cBut back then, we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you buy a dog, you won\u2019t know if this dog will bite people or not after it grows up, right?\u201d So ultimately, Zhu Yao had mistakenly brought back a dog, and had even allowed it to stroll to where Yu Luo was.</p><br/><p>Yu Luo turned silent, as though she had understood her words. The stiff and hateful expression on her face, slowly faded away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Luo.\u201d Zhu Yao patted on her head. \u201cMaster knows you\u2019re feeling miserable, but this is the truth. No matter how much you think about it, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. In regards to a few matters, it\u2019s not because you didn\u2019t do them well, rather, it\u2019s because you did too well, which caused you to lose what you could be proud of. So why should you feel sad and hurt for a person who had trampled on your pride?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, feelings are like investments.\u201d Zhu Yao continued to enlighten her. \u201cOnce you invested, and found out that you\u2019re still not receiving any returns, it\u2019s not because the market wasn\u2019t good. Rather, it\u2019s because the target you have invested in was simply not worth it. However, right now, there\u2019s still time for you to recover your finances, so why don\u2019t you try choosing someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are investments?\u201d Yu Luo blanked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d She had habitually used the set of words she would always use to console her best friend. \u201cMn. I\u2019m saying that this person called Wu Song basically isn\u2019t someone worthy of your love. There\u2019s a huge queue of good men out there waiting for you to choose. So, stop hanging onto a single tree, and start trying to hang on other trees.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Seeing how her master was developing her persuasion towards a joking direction, Yu Luo\u2019s expression finally looked better than before. She could not help but mutter out. \u201cWhich master would allow her own disciple to go hang herself?\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just a metaphor, geez. \u201cIn any case, women must treat themselves better, do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Luo\u2019s expression sank, before she nodded a few moments later. \u201cMn. Master, I will try my best to\u2026 forget him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood girl!\u201d As expected, she was now on track. \u201cOh right, why is your cultivation merely at the late stages of Azoth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Theoretically speaking, since even those little radishes were already at the Nascent Soul stages, with her own disciple\u2019s Heavenly Spirit Vein, no matter the case, she should have reached the Nascent Soul stages, or even better. Putting aside the Demigod stage, at the very least, she should have been at the late stages of Nascent Soul, similar to Wu Song.</p><br/><p>Yu Luo\u2019s expression paled, and a moment later, she carefully answered. \u201cInitially, I had already nourished my Nascent Soul. However, because, back then when Wu Song saved Mu Meiyan, he had suffered heavy injuries. In order to save him, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have given him your virginity, right?\u201d Zhu Yao fiercely stood up. The hell, that trash.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Yu Luo hurriedly explain. \u201cBack then, I had used all of the spiritual energy in my body, however, because someone interrupted me when I finished the treatment, my meridians were twisted, and my cultivation suffered a blow.\u201d When she was circulating her energy back, Mu Meiyan suddenly barged in, which thus caused her to\u2026 However, she did not bring this matter up, as she was afraid her master would get angry.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s brows were already close to becoming vertical from frowning, and at every given second, she had the impulse to castrate someone. Could it be that all men who approached Mu Meiyan, would possess some hidden trash personality? Even after Little Radish saved him, he actually still had the gall to cheat on her. What a bastard.</p><br/><p>If she had known of this, back then, she wouldn\u2019t have saved him. Zhu Yao felt frustrated. Ever since she came out of that scroll, things had been spiraling out of control, heading back to the ending she had seen in her dreams, and in great strides at that. Yet, she had completely no idea how to stop it at all.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she recalled something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people are still in touch with Chen Ning.\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s words were decisive. In the storage pouch which Wu Song had taken out back then as the so-called compensation, she had swept her divine sense into it. She realized there were some scrolls of Mystic Arts which were very familiar. They were exactly the things she had seen in the fifth floor of Chen Ning\u2019s Qiwu Pavilion.</p><br/><p>Oh right, that strange scroll was also something she had taken from Chen Ning. In an instant, another name had been added into the list of people she wanted to castrate.</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign Chen Ning?\u201d Yu Luo blanked. \u201cCurrently, Chen Ning is already Azureflight Sect\u2019s Demigod Sovereign.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Why did that second-rate beast join into the mix as well?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little unclear of the situation as well. \u201cBack then when master went missing, Sovereign Chen Ning insisted that he would not leave, and said that he wanted to wait for your return. Hence, he had been staying inside the Sect, and in these years, he had been giving guidance in various areas as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. She had wondered how Azureflight Sect managed to rise so quickly, so he was the reason behind that. Chen Ning was a tenth-ranked beast, which was comparable to a late-stage Demigod Sovereign. Based on his prestige alone, it had already raised Azureflight to great heights. Not to mention, Chen Ning was rich. Behind him, he possessed an entire Qiwu Pavilion, which basically monopolized half of the entire practitioners\u2019 market. It\u2019s simply impossible for Azureflight to not attract attention of this scale.</p><br/><p>The main point was that this rich person, was someone she herself had brought. As expected, death would not come if one did not seek it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle radish\u2026\u201d Unfortunately, she was running out of time. Although she was furious at Wu Song, she knew that right now, there wasn\u2019t time for her to care about this piece of mess. Just as she was about to tell Yu Luo of her isolation plan, she was suddenly tugged by someone.</p><br/><p>Once again, Yue Ying had popped out of nowhere. His body was a little dirty, and his face was still as expressionless as ever. Opening his mouth, he called out. \u201cSis\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d I already told you not to call me Sis Yao, I\u2019m a good person! At that instant, Zhu Yao felt that something was definitely wrong with her brain when she wanted to teach Yue Ying how to pronounce her name back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t\u2026 Find. Yao\u2026 Don\u2019t go.\u201d Yue Ying choppily said a few words.</p><br/><p>However, Zhu Yao understood. So the reason why he became like this, was because he had been searching for her? As she had thought, this child had a mother complex, right? She casually cast a Dirt Removal Art on him, and persuaded him a little. Then, she gave Yu Luo a few instructions, told her about her plans for isolation, and passed Yue Ying over to her as well. Right after, she returned to the depth of that cold river.</p><br/><p>Ever since Wu Song took the Sect Master position, this was the first time he felt so frustrated. When he returned to the Sect, he found out that the news of him being rejected after trying to marry the Jade Forest Mountain\u2019s Sovereign Zhu Yao\u2019s disciple, had already been spread to the entire cultivation world.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, he did not really mind. After all, he was a man. Although it did not really sound good hearing that he was rejected, it was not considered a huge matter. Also, it was indeed his fault for being unfaithful to Yu Luo.</p><br/><p>However, right after, he did not know why, but the Celestial Indus Sect had come looking for him, and they wanted him to hand Rulu, the traitor of their Sect, over. Only then did Wu Song felt that things had become a little serious. Azureflight Sect had been developing at a rapid pace in these recent years, however, ultimately, they were still a Sect that had just been newly established, and did not have much insurance.</p><br/><p>Celestial Indus Sect however, was a Deity Sect which had been passed down for millions of years. In the recent years, they had even gained another Demigod Sovereign. No matter how one see it, Azureflight Sect wasn\u2019t a Sect that they could make enemies with. And the person who came, was even acting in the name of Sovereign Qi Han.</p><br/><p>He said that the Sect-mate Rulu had harmed in the past, was exactly Sovereign Qi Han\u2019s disciple. Wu Song had suspected this as well, but Rulu simply cried very sadly, and said that she was framed. As the daughter of the Sect Master, for what reason would she harm a junior-martial sister from the same Sect as her?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

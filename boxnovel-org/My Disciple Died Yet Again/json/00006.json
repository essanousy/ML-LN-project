Looking at Zhu Yao, he then continued. \u201cAncestral Grandmaster, are you planning to take this woman as your disciple?\u201d He initially thought that, given this woman\u2019s age, he would at most take her into the Peak as a inner sect disciple. He did not expect he would directly take her as a disciple.</p><br/><p>The man calmly looked at the group of people, and corrected him. \u201cPersonal succeeding disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The red-clothed lady had a face of disbelief, took a step forward, and said. \u201cAncestral Grandmaster, even if she\u2019s a rare holder of the Lightning Spirit Vein, you can only take in one personal succeeding disciple\u2026 Given her age\u2026 isn\u2019t it a little inappropriate?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man turned and looked towards the red-clothed lady, with a face that was still as cold as ever, he sounded out skeptically, \u201cWhat does this have to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The red-clothed lady was at a loss of words, the only thing she could do was to shift her gaze, staring fiercely at Zhu Yao who was beside him. She did not even do anything, and was simply standing there the entire time, so why the hell was she staring at her? For a moment, she suddenly had the feeling that she was in a mental hospital the entire time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdmit me as your master!\u201d The certain ice caveman adjusted his muzzle aim, and continued to fire at Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression silently darkened. \u201cUmm\u2026 I say, bro, why don\u2019t we take some time to discuss about this? Why do I have to definitely admit you as my master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a Lightning Spirit Vein holder!\u201d The cold-looking caveman said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Zhu Yao nodded. \u201cMay I ask, is there a rule or law that states that, as a Lightning Spirit Vein holder, I have to definitely admit you as my master?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ice caveman frowned even deeper, but he still truthfully shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where did your mom get the confidence that, I will definitely admit you as my master?\u201d Do you believe I will spit a mouthful of cola onto your entire face?</p><br/><p>This cold-looking caveman seemed to have been troubled by this question, and only after a long while did he slowly voice out. \u201cOnly my Jade Forest Mountain, possesses the Mystic Arts Lightning Spirit Vein holders train in, so you definitely have to admit under my guidance.\u201d He lowered his head, and looked directly into her eyes. \u201cWhat does this have to do with my mother having any confidence in this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Take a deep breath, one must not bite someone in a harmonious society. \u201cWhy do I have to definitely train in these Arts?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said naturally. \u201cIf you want to become a deity, then you have to learn this set of Arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho!\u201d Zhu Yao pulled her hand back, and laughed coldly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t wish to become a deity. Thank you. Bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ice caveman seemed to have been shocked by her way of thinking, as he stood rooted to the ground, totally stunned. Hence, Zhu Yao took this opportunity to happily sneak away. Unfortunately, not even two minutes later, the ice caveman suddenly came chasing after her again. It was not because she was not doing her best, rather, her opponent was simply too strong. Although Zhu Yao ran, as though he was the wind, the ice caveman instantly caught up to her. Without speaking anything else, the moment he grabbed onto her, he flew towards the skies, and headed towards the mountain with the tallest peak.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply saw blurred images in front of her, and her head once again struck onto the ice caveman, naturally\u2026 she received a third lump!</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>When she regained her senses, she was already standing on a green plains, and the ice caveman was even standing right in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdmit me as your master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Ice, can you please change your lines?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ice caveman paused for a moment, and said, \u201cI\u2019m taking you as my disciple!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Is there a difference?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy surname is Yu, not Ice.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy given name is Yan. Since you\u2019re now under my guidance, you will naturally have to use my surname as well. I bestow you the name\u2026 Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s \u2018Desire\u2019!\u201d \u00b9 Who told you to bestow me a name? I simply do not want to become a deity.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re \u2018Yu Wang\u2019. I told you before, I don\u2019t have a sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The hell, I never thought that it would be so difficult to communicate in Mandarin. Zhu Yao began to cry in her heart. \u201cBro, I beg you, please, let me go. I really don\u2019t wish to become a deity. Please allow me to scram back home!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was startled for a moment, before answering with the same icy tone. \u201cI\u2019m taking you as my disciple, not as my sister. You should be calling me master, not brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Where\u2019s the nearest cliff!? Please, tell me!</p><br/><p>\u00b9 Yu Wang /, sounds exactly the same as , which means \u2018desire\u2019 in English.</p><br/><p>Side note: In Wuxia/Xianxia, masters have the tendency to bestow new names to their disciples, and the disciples will use their masters\u2019 surname as well. The master\u2019s name , if directly translated into English, is Jade Word, while the name he bestowed to Zhu Yao, , is Jade Prosper.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

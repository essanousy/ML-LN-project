Everyone, please do not misunderstand senior-martial sister Zhu.\u201d It would have been better if she hadn\u2019t said these words, but the moment she said them, it was as though Zhu Yao had certainly done something bad. The disciples\u2019 eyes on Zhu Yao were instantly filled with suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Ling, don\u2019t be afraid, your master is here.\u201d Xuan Xu released his own Nascent Soul pressure, and with sharp blade-like eyes, he glared at Zhu Yao. \u201cNo one in this world has the capabilities to threaten my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Yi Ling was moved, yet her expression showed even more hesitation. After a while, she gritted her teeth and stubbornly said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s really nothing. Senior-martial sister Zhu treats me so well, I can\u2019t\u2026 I really didn\u2019t see anything at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at this master and disciple duo who had already entered two-person skit mode, Zhu yao simply wanted to roar out. Are you people blind? I haven\u2019t even said a single word!</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu\u2019s frown deepened, and his body was already faintly emitting out killing intent. \u201cJust what did you do to Ling\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to know too.\u201d Zhu Yao nodded approvingly, and she turned to look at Yi Ling. \u201cYi Ling, just what did I do to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Ling was startled, her tears were like disconnected pearls, running off like a stream. Her sad and frail look lead to the aching hearts of everyone present. As though she was frightened, she shrank in Xuan Xu\u2019s embrace, and said while feeling a lump in her throat. \u201cI\u2026 I really didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>From this frail look, it was as though Zhu Yao had really done something to her. The hell, I\u2019m just asking you a question, why the hell are you crying?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take this too far.\u201d Flower protector Qi Ping was the first to rush out, and he glared at Zhu Yao with a furious look. \u201cYou were the one who did something wrong, yet you actually dare to threaten junior-martial sister Ling!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d These people must have tofu for brains, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what guilty acts you have done.\u201d Qi Ping turned ever more furious, and he looked as though he could charge out and slice her at any moment. \u201cYi Ling treats you so well, putting aside how you always go against her, you\u2019re actually threatening her in front of everyone now? Don\u2019t think just because you have formed your Azoth Core, we can\u2019t do anything about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao smiled out of anger. \u201cI really do want to know, just what have I done? Why don\u2019t you people say it out loud so that I can feel guilty about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother Qi\u2026\u201d Yi Ling charged out again to pull Qi Ping, and added another matchstick into the fire while she was at it. \u201cDon\u2019t blame senior-martial sister Zhu. I\u2026 It\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing\u2019er, you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d Xuan Xu once again took Yi Ling in his embrace, and with a sunken expression, he coldly looked towards Zhu Yao. \u201cYour master has already made a decision.\u201d As he said that, he no longer suppressed the pressure from his body, as it came pressing towards Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>The hell, this master and disciple wanted to kill her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank. It seemed like in front of Mary Sue, there was no logic to speak of. She could always flee back to the demonic beasts\u2019 side, at least, it was better than being with this brain-deficient bunch of animals who only thought with their lower halves.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Just as she was about to set up defenses, Yue Ying walked out from the side, as though he was completely oblivious of the atmosphere around them. Tugging onto her sleeves, he said. \u201cYou came back safely?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zhu Yao habitually nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial brother Yue!\u201d Yi Ling looked at Yue Ying worriedly, and reminded out of goodwill. \u201cHurry and get away from there, senior-martial sister Zhu\u2026 She\u2026\u201d Her words stopped halfway through, her face was filled with pain and disappointment. Though she didn\u2019t say anything, it was as though she had revealed everything.</p><br/><p>Almost all of the disciples had determined that Zhu Yao must had done something grave akin to betraying the sect.</p><br/><p>However, it was as Yue Ying did not hear them, as he continued to look at Zhu Yao. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re alright. Earlier, when mother risked her life to charge out of the barrier, Yue Ying was really frightened, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao turned to glance at him, only to see Yue Ying smile even gentler than before. His face was becoming like Shao Bai\u2019s in the first place, and now, it seemed like soft light was being emitted out in all direction from this smile of his. For a moment, it was as though the slightly dim battlefield had brightened a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just knew mother will be fine.\u201d He slowly said. \u201cEarlier, that bolt of heavenly lightning flashing in the horizon was personally summoned by mother, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone. In an instant, she realized this little one\u2019s intentions, and nodded in concert. \u201cThat\u2019s right! The lord of that dungeon told me that demonic beasts wouldn\u2019t usually appear in a group. If a beast wave occurs, there will definitely be a cause.\u201d She intentionally amplified her voice, glanced at everyone in the surroundings, and then, with some lies mixed within, she said. \u201cSo I decided to find an opportunity to cross the barrier. As expected, I realized there was a tenth-ranked demonic beast commanding them. Fortunately, the lord bestowed me with a Purple Extreme Heavenly Lightning Talisman, and I was then able to retreat unscathed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment her words fell, the entire place was thrown into an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple Extreme Heavenly Lightning! It\u2019s actually the Purple Extreme Heavenly Lightning!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the tribulation lightning one must endure during ascension?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a talisman actually exists in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat must be a talisman treasure, right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder there was such a huge surge in spiritual energy in the sky earlier, and the moment the thunder roared, all of the demonic beasts retreated.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of their faces were filled with excitement, and even Xuan Xu\u2019s expression was slightly affected as well. However, in his embrace, Yi Ling\u2019s face darkened. Initially, when she saw Zhu Yao return from outside the barrier, her first thought was naturally Zhu Yao had colluded with the demonic beasts and betrayed the sect. However, she never expected that the entire matter would suddenly turn around. The disdain everyone had for Zhu Yao in the beginning was instantly turned into adoration. An uncomfortable feeling instantly rose in the depths of Yi Ling\u2019s heart, as she unconsciously tugged onto Xuan Xu next to her.</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu who was stunned by the revelations of the Purple Extreme Heavenly Lightning finally regained his senses, a few suspicions rose in his heart yet again. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you frightened off the beast wave by bringing down a tribulation lightning bolt? How can Purple Extreme Heavenly Lightning talisman exist in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. \u201cGo and ask that lord yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Xuan Xu\u2019s expression instantly darkened. Evidently, he recalled the incident where he couldn\u2019t even get across that person\u2019s sword formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, junior-martial niece Ling\u2019er, what did you see earlier?\u201d Zhu Yao looked at Mary Sue with a smile.</p><br/><p>Yi Ling\u2019s expression paled, a hint of fluster flashed past her eyes. After a while, she awkwardly said. \u201cLing\u2019er\u2019s eyes must have been blurry? I thought\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou thought?\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled, looking as though she wanted to hear an answer no matter what.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Yi Ling couldn\u2019t say she had thought Zhu Yao was a traitor. Thus, she once again exposed that pitiful look of hers. \u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou best don\u2019t start crying again\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao coldly smiled. \u201cEarlier, I didn\u2019t even say anything, but the moment you started crying, I was blamed for doing something that supposedly goes against my conscience. If you start crying again, there might even be people blaming me for destroying the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Qi Ping\u2019s expression instantly stiffened, and then it paled at the next moment. Yi Ling felt that she was even more unjustly treated than before, and her tears were at the brink of falling.</p><br/><p>Evidently, everyone recalled her earlier accusations that came out of nowhere. Her harem members were still alright, after all, they had all lost their brains, and were simply looking at her saddened look with aching hearts. The rest of the disciples were looking at her with hints of doubts.</p><br/><p>Yi Ling tightly clenched her fists, and after a while, she said with her head lowered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Senior-martial sister Zhu, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your senior-martial sister!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately interrupted her words, and in an instant, brought about the glares of all the men in her harem. Zhu Yao could not be bothered with these morons, and instantly pointed out the facts. \u201cYou should be calling me senior-martial aunt.\u201d It had been so long since she formed her Azoth Core, yet Yi Ling was still calling her senior-martial sister. She wasn\u2019t a male lead after all. Why would I want to be at the same level of seniority as you? I want to be a level higher, pressing down on you, what can you do about it huh?</p><br/><p>Turning her head, she looked towards Xuan Xu who was glaring coldly at her. With a heavy heart, she said. \u201cSovereign, now this is a wrong on your part. There\u2019s really a problem with your education methods! She\u2019s this old now, yet she is still unable to distinguish levels of seniority. It\u2019s best you stop thinking about romance, and spend more time teaching your disciple. There\u2019s a saying like this. No matter how poor you are, you musn\u2019t make your disciple poor, and no matter how hard it is, education is a must!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was saying these especially sincerely, and even she herself was being moved from her own speech, you know?</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu\u2019s and Yi Ling\u2019s expressions instantly darkened one after another.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao successfully made a reversal, and her mood instantly turned pleasant. Secretly, she gave her obedient son Yue Ying next to her a thumbs up. Though all of her words were true, from that situation earlier, if not for Yue Ying\u2019s reminder, she really had no idea how to make a turn around. That god\u2019s artifact of hers would have definitely been exposed.</p><br/><p>The beast wave this time thus ended. Because of everyone\u2019s fear of the dungeon\u2019s lord, not a single person suspect Zhu Yao\u2019s words. Just as the disciples were about to tabulate the number of deaths and return home, an unforeseen event suddenly occurred.</p><br/><p>The transparent barrier that separated the two continents suddenly emitted out a faint red light. As though it was being covered with a layer of red plastic film, it shrouded the entire continent. That red light flashed for a moment, and shockingly, there were faint traces of the barrier breaking. Like spiderwebs, crack lines began to appear at the top.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good! The World Protection Barrier is disappearing.\u201d An Azoth elder exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Fluster and fear instantly surfaced in all of the disciples\u2019 faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe moment the barrier breaks, the demonic beasts will no longer have a need to fear and will definitely cause havocs everywhere. When that time comes, I\u2019m afraid we will no longer have any means to fight back.\u201d All of the people present were walking back and forth from anxiety.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao clenched her fists. What she was worried about wasn\u2019t the demonic beasts. Though demonic beasts were fierce and brutal, they would not take the initiative to start a conflict with humans. What she was truly worried about was that Devil!</p><br/><p>A Devil existed in that continent, and Zhu Yao was still uncertain just how many there were. However, seeing him control the beast wave, she knew that he definitely wanted to come over to this side. If the Devil had made an appearance here, then that would truly become the moment where they would have no means to fight back!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there no way to fix the barrier?\u201d Zhu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu coldly snorted. \u201cThis barrier existed here since the ancient era, and its inheritance has long disappeared. Presently, in this world, just who would know the method to fix it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ancient era? Why was it when she heard the words \u2018ancient era\u2019, she felt that it was a heavy joke?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what, we can\u2019t just sit around and wait to die. Where\u2019s the core of this formation?\u201d Only after looking at the core would she know if she could fix it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Everyone turned silent.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be right? This barrier was here for so many years, yet not a single person knew where the formation core was? Should I say, these people deserve this? Or these people deserve this? Or these people deserve this?</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, find the formation core. We will speak later on.\u201d Zhu Yao could not be bothered to waste her breath with them. Bringing along Yue Ying, she began to ride her sword and search the surroundings.</p><br/><p>The other disciples looked at each other for a moment, before they too got up and searched for the formation core.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao swept the entire forest three times, yet she was completely unable to see any trace of the formation core. Theoretically speaking, the formation core would be located at the spot with the strongest fluctuation in spiritual energy. However, no matter how she released her divine sense, she couldn\u2019t sense it in the least. She was already getting a little anxious. Was there really no hope left for the barrier?</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress\u2026\u201d Sesame who was in her divine sense suddenly called out. \u201cI sense there\u2019s something in front\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn front?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled for a moment. In front of them was the exit to the forest, and theoretically speaking, the formation core shouldn\u2019t stray very far away from the barrier itself. \u201cCan you sense anything concrete?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Sesame\u2019s voice carried a hint of confusion. \u201cI keep getting the feeling that there\u2019s something calling me over.\u201d</p><br/><p>What could it be? Zhu Yao pondered for a moment, and decided to go along with Sesame\u2019s words and flew over there.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Yao\u2026\u201d Yue Ying however tugged onto her sleeves all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned back to look, and only to see him perspiring profusely, and his face was as pale as paper. \u201cYue Ying, what happened?\u201d Cupping his wrist to inspect him, she realized there wasn\u2019t any anomalies in his body, but he merely had tiny strands of spiritual energy left in his body. Only then did she recall that Yue Ying had only just built his Foundation recently, and he had just experienced a great war, so he didn\u2019t have much spiritual energy left.</p><br/><p>After that, she descended. Carrying him to the side, she settled down and sent him a little spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou rest here for now, don\u2019t follow me!\u201d Zhu Yao stroked his head. \u201cI will take a look ahead, and I will come back in a while to get you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d He obediently nodded. \u201cBig Sis Yao must come back quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Zhu Yao once again flew up, and the further she headed in the direction Sesame spoke of, the more she felt a certain premonition. That place was definitely the key to this formation. They then arrived at a practitioner\u2019s town.</p><br/><p>This was the nearest town from the barrier. Because of the beast wave, the people here had already scattered and was now empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, at the very center.\u201d Sesame agitatedly said.</p><br/><p>At the center was the town square, and within it, stones with various engravings were laid out, forming a simple round diagram. Painted on them were also messy looking symbols. The place looked just like a normal flat ground, but presently, a blue robed man was sitting on that said ground, and the symbols on the stones were emitting out a white formation light.</p><br/><p>This was the formation core!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao and her little companion was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder no one could find the formation core even after so many years. Who would have guessed that something this important would be placed so openly, at the center of a town of practitioners, in a place where everyone could see?</p><br/><p>And that man\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a closer look. That person sitting at the formation core seemed to have already entered a meditative state. The formation on the ground was presently emitting out a dissolved light. Probably because it came from a long bygone era, the formation diagram seemed to be incomplete. However, mystically, the dissolved areas within the white light seemed to be slowly being restored.</p><br/><p>He was restoring the formation!</p><br/><p>Although she did not know who he was, she did not have any plans to interrupt him.</p><br/><p>In just a few moments, the formation became more complete, and the white light emitted out a stronger radiance as it slowly rose into the sky. Like a virtual projection, a strangely shaped object gathered above the man. The object looked unclear, though it looked like a gigantic demonic beast, and its four hooves could be faintly seen.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly heaved a sigh of relief. This was the last step to restoring the formation. As long as this phenomenon was complete, then the formation would\u2026</p><br/><p>A loud explosion sounded.</p><br/><p>Right at the moment when the phenomenon was about to be completed, a fireball suddenly descended from the sky, instantly smashing that phenomenon and scattering all of the white light.</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>\u201cA demonic beast actually fled to the town.\u201d Riding on her sword, Yi Ling appeared above with look of righteousness. Casting an art with her fingers, she once again summoned a fireball. \u201cDie, demonic beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Zhu Yao summoned a stream of water and struck the fireball, extinguishing her art.</p><br/><p>Lowering her head to take a look, that man had already puked out a large mouthful of blood from the formation rebound and fell onto the ground. She suddenly had the impulse to squish that Mary Sue to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu, how can you\u2026\u201d Yi Ling descended with a censuring look. She\u2019s actually protecting a demonic beast?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you blind!? Can you study a little more in your free time? That earlier was a phenomenon brought about by the formation!\u201d Now they were really doomed. Now that this person was half crippled, who was going to restore the formation now? As expected, this Mary Sue was a bug!</p><br/><p>Yi Ling was stunned, and only then did she realize there was a person on the ground. \u201cHe\u2026 How?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately flew down. \u201cHey hey hey, are you alright?\u201d She worriedly carried him off the ground to take a look.</p><br/><p>Shocked!</p><br/><p>The hell\u2026 It can\u2019t be, right?</p><br/><p>While he was panting, the man opened a slit of his eyes and looked towards Yi Ling\u2019s direction. Suddenly, his eyes shone. As his puked out blood, he muttered to himself. \u201cThis world actually has such a div-\u201d</p><br/><p>Smack!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her hand and sent a forceful strike to his nape, instantly knocking him unconscious.</p><br/><p>Divine my ass!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

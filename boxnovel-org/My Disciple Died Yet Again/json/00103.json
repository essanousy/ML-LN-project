Though, occasionally, when he had problems in regard to formations and Mystic Arts, he would consult her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao began to feel that there were many Mystic Arts in this world which could be merged with the knowledge of modern era, and the unleashed might was very stunning. There were many similarities between the two worlds. This world simply used Divine Arts to explain things, while that world of hers believed all these were Science.</p><br/><p>Five years passed in a blink of an eye. Yu Luo\u2019s cultivation had already reached the middle levels of Foundation, and the day of the Inter-Sect Tournament had finally arrived.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was actually a little anxious. Because, in a few days, the rebirthing female protagonist was about to step onto this grand stage.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao only pulled her disciple to the site on the very day of the final match. There wasn\u2019t any difference between this Great Inter-Sect Tournament and the previous one, even the three Sovereigns had arrived neatly at the scene.</p><br/><p>As always, one of them was sitting on a mythic bird, one was sitting on a white tiger, while the other was sitting on a jade lotus.</p><br/><p>Only she herself\u2026 had flown her sword there.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 Had she accidentally fell by a level? However, if she were to use those mystic tools which her master had left her, she was afraid that it might give a huge blow to their confidence.</p><br/><p>Among the three Sovereigns, she was not all that familiar with the other two, and they had only nodded at her in acknowledgement.</p><br/><p>Only Feng Yi turned her head to look at her. At that moment, Zhu Yao even thought that she had seen through something, and her legs had almost turned jelly. Fortunately, Feng Yi did not make any other movements. Most probably, that persuasion she did at that moonlit night had taken effect, and she was now treated as a friend of hers.</p><br/><p>Most likely, Zi Mo did not expect that she would come, and when he saw Yu Luo behind her, he became even more stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle martial aunt, what are you\u2026\u201d Zi Mo stood up, anxiousness filled his entire face. Why did she bring his daughter out for? There\u2019s so many outsiders today, what if some incidents were to occur?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao realized that all the seats were already taken, hence, she sat straight onto Zi Mo\u2019s seat. I\u2019m sorry, stealing his seat was a Jade Forest tradition. I can\u2019t help it.</p><br/><p>Yu Luo gave Zi Mo a greeting, and then, stood right behind her.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo was so anxious, fumes were about to rise from his head. However, there was nothing else he could do, and could only suppress the suspicion in his heart.</p><br/><p>Little martial aunt must have her own reasons for bringing his daughter out here\u2026 right? He was really worried for his precious daughter.</p><br/><p>On the ring, the Essence final match was ongoing. She still remembered back then when she first came here to watch, her master was still by her side. And there were\u2026 many other people, whom she couldn\u2019t remember too clearly.</p><br/><p>Back then, she felt as though everyone on the ring was very incredible. However, when she looked at them now, she felt that they were all really average. She could even easily see through their weaknesses.</p><br/><p>Just as she was feeling bored, suddenly, a resounding notice entered her ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder of Azureflight Sect, along with the disciples of my Sect, has arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>Puf~~~~~~~</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly lost her composure, and had almost fell off the chair.</p><br/><p>Azureflight Sect? It can\u2019t be!</p><br/><p>Everyone present was a little doubtful as well. The final matches of the Great Inter-Sect Tournament were already ongoing, why was there still a Sect coming in at this juncture? It\u2019s too late, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Zi Mo, was after all, the host. Although he was a little doubtful, he still turned around to welcome them.</p><br/><p>A group of five people came flying over from afar. The one at the very front, was a very young man. He looked as though he was only fifteen or sixteen years old, and was a little baby-faced. His plump cheeks, made people feel like pinching them, yet, his cultivation was at the Nascent Soul Paragon stage.</p><br/><p>Behind him were three boys and one girl, and they looked to be around fifteen to sixteen years old. All of their cultivation were at the elementary levels of Foundation.</p><br/><p>When they flew over, Zhu Yao had already recognized them. Weren\u2019t the four people at the back, Wu Song, Radish Number Two, Radish Number Three, and Radish Number Four?</p><br/><p>However, just when did the Azureflight Sect ever have an Elder at the Nascent Soul stage? Wasn\u2019t that place supposed to be a field of little radishes? When did an old radish pop out? And she didn\u2019t even know about it?</p><br/><p>That old radish did some polite talk with Zi Mo, suddenly, his eyes shone, and he charged right towards her.</p><br/><p>First, he bowed towards her, and then, he looked at her with an excited expression. \u201cIsn\u2019t this Sovereign Zhu Yao? I have long heard of your great name, and being able to meet you today is extremely fortunate of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao reflexively leaned to the back, as she looked at this baby-faced old radish who acted all familiar with her.</p><br/><p>Who the hell are you?</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, mistress, Sesame missed you so much.\u201d Just when she was having her suspicions, she heard a familiar voice being transmitted over. Sesame?</p><br/><p>After looking around for a moment, she did not see any figure of a beast anywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress. Here, here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked forward, only to see that old radish blinking his eyes rapidly. Suddenly, she understood.</p><br/><p>She then transmitted her voice over. \u201cSesame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, mn, mn, mn. I\u2019m mistress\u2019 little beastie, Sesame.\u201d The old radish continued to blink.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, when did you have a human form as well?\u201d Why didn\u2019t she know about it before?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle beastie is tenth-ranked, naturally I\u2019m able to transform. Mistress, I miss you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>With an excited look, the old radish widened his eyes at her, looking as though he could pounce towards her and rub against her in the next moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Zhu Yao coldly replied. His face instantly sank.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear Elder, how should I address you?\u201d Zi Mo timely interjected.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy surname\u2019s Sei.\u201d Sesame replied with a teary look.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo was startled for a moment. Just earlier, he was still looking all brilliant and sunny, what happened to him now? This Elder \u2018Sei\u2019 sure was fickle.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Sei, have you brought your disciples here to participate in the Great Inter-Sect Tournament?\u201d Zi Mo had never heard of the Azureflight Sect, and guessed that they should have come from a certain small Deity Sect. He politely asked. \u201cAlthough all Deity Sects are eligible to participate, the tournament has already entered the final matches. If esteemed Sect wishes to participate, I\u2019m afraid you will have to wait till the next tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here to participate.\u201d Sesame replied haughtily.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Then why the hell are you here for? The corner of Zi Mo\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cThen Elder, you\u2019re\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, we\u2019re here to look\u2026\u201d Sesame looked at Zhu Yao. After receiving a glare in return, he weakly changed his replied. \u201cWe\u2019re here to look around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho\u2026 Elder sure is humorous.\u201d If he wasn\u2019t a guest, Zi Mo really wouldn\u2019t wish to be polite with this Elder who seemed to have some loose screws in his brain. After instructing a disciple to arrange a seat for him, he no longer bothered about him.</p><br/><p>However, this Elder seemed to be really interested with the Demigod Sovereigns, and had even especially moved his chair right beside martial aunt Zhu Yao. With an excited expression, he seemed to really wish to converse with her.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo was a little speechless. In the cultivation realm, strength was mattered most, and worshipping the strong seemed to be a natural instinct in everyone\u2019s bones. However, a shameless Elder like this who acted in such an obvious manner, was very rarely seen. Looking at that excited face of his, which seemed as though he was about to start drooling, he\u2019s simply\u2026 too shameless!</p><br/><p>But why were the four disciples he brought along standing so bluntly over there as well? This was a grandstand for Nascent Soul practitioners, you know.</p><br/><p>Did the Sect rules of Azureflight Sect allow such behaviour?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao began to feel a slight headache as well. Although it could be said that she had no choice but to harvest a bunch of little radishes, after all, she herself was still a member of the Jade Forest Mountain, which belonged to Ancient Hill Sect. Relying on his cultivation as a Demigod, it was not that she could not establish a new Sect. However, if she did so, she would have to leave Ancient Hill Sect. This was also the reason why she had never told Zi Mo about Azureflight.</p><br/><p>If he had known of this issue, he definitely wouldn\u2019t dare to chase her out of the Sect, but, he would definitely take that bunch of little radishes into Ancient Hill. However, with just the potentials the bunch of radishes possessed, most likely, they would all be arranged to the Outer Sect, and she would be unable to take care of them all either. In that case, it would be less restraining for her if she were to establish her own Sect instead.</p><br/><p>However, this Sesame was a pig-head. She had been hiding these matters from everyone, yet, he actually brought them out for a blind stroll, and openly at that. Zhu Yao was so furious, her teeth began to hurt, yet, she couldn\u2019t express it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, are you happy from seeing Sesame? Are you glad? Aren\u2019t you really surprised?\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s expression turned cold, and Sesame began to transmit his voice over desperately.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, there\u2019s already four people who built their Foundation in the Sect. Isn\u2019t Sesame very dependable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, you\u2019re thinking of rewarding little beastie, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, have you thought of wanting to hug me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt as though her blood vessels on her head had popped out. \u201cShut your mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMis~~tress\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay another word, and I will castrate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mind was finally quiet. Zhu Yao rubbed her swelled-up forehead, glanced over to Wu Song at the side, and transmitted her voice. \u201cWhy are all of you here in Ancient Hill Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Song was startled for a moment. After looking around, he then realized it was Zhu Yao who was transmitting her voice. His eyes shone, and replied in his mind. \u201cElder Sesame said that, we have already built our Foundation, so we should come out and experience the outside world. Hence\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, it was that second-rate who instigated this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, do not blindly listen to Sesame\u2019s commands. He\u2019s after all, a demonic beast. Although he possesses a high rank, in regards to human affairs, he still lacks experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Song nodded, expressing that he had remembered her words.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao then found out a few matters regarding the Sect. He, Radish Number Two, Three and Four, had all recently built their Foundation. Building their Foundation within five years, among Tri and Tetra Spirit Veins Holders, this speed was already pretty extraordinary. And, according to the groups Zhu Yao had arranged them in, these four people all belonged to the same group, while the other member, Radish Number One, was in the process of building her Foundation as well. Zhu Yao was a little stunned. This was an unexpected creation. Back then, the reason why she arranged them into groups, was to have them practice and coordinate their attacks against enemies. She never expected that their levels of cultivation would rise together as well.</p><br/><p>She then asked about the situations regarding the cultivation of the other groups of little radishes, and realized that the situations within each of their own groups were similar as well. The levels of cultivation among members of the same group were all really close. This wasn\u2019t actually an occasional phenomenon. Zhu Yao felt that there was a need to personally witness their cultivation circumstances now.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, the next match will be the finals for the Foundation practitioners.\u201d Yu Luo suddenly sounded out.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sternly looked. As she had said, the competition for the Essence group had already ended, and two Foundation Paragons were currently flying onto the ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, go on then!\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, I didn\u2019t hear my name.\u201d Yu Luo\u2019s expression was a little anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zhu Yao came into sudden realization. \u201cI didn\u2019t register your name for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yu Luo was a little stunned. What happened to the promise of allowing her to participate?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust head directly onto the ring!\u201d Zhu Yao said without a mind. Registering or whatever, was really troublesome, you know!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, there\u2019s already two people on the ring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen fight both of them, go! Round the both of them up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu Luo was silent for a moment. Looking at the ring, as though she had decided something, she replied resoundingly. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she immediately flew towards the ring.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded satisfyingly. Her disciple had to be this cool, dazzling and tyrannical. Wasn\u2019t the title of champion simply all about defeating the strongest person?</p><br/><p>The two finalists looked at the female practitioner who suddenly appeared in the middle, and was momentarily stunned. What kind of situation was this? What happened to the promised final match? Why were there three people?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Rubbing his large reddened eyes, he weakly said. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stroked his head. It\u2019s good that he\u2019s no longer crying. She then started piggybacking the child. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Big sis shall bring you to find some food.\u201d</p><br/><p>In order to create her brilliant image as his life benefactor, Zhu Yao brought him to the most luxurious restaurant in the city, and picked out a table full of the most expensive food. As expected, the child stared at them with sparkling eyes, yet, he still looked at her a little fearfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on, eat. They\u2019re all picked out for you.\u201d She had already abstained from food, so naturally, there was no need for her to eat. And if she were to eat them, she would have to stay in the toilet for quite some time. So, she quietly sat at the side, and watched the child as he hurriedly swept the table.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao then pondered how she was going to prevent this child from stepping onto the path of a Devil Practitioner. She might be able to try changing his fate, give him some money, enough for him to make a living or something like that.</p><br/><p>With this saving grace as a comparison, even if Mu Meiyan were to be reborn in the future, and she were to save him again, it would simply be icing on a cake. She would no longer become the light in his heart. Or Zhu Yao could even use this goodwill, to instill into him some principles such as \u2018everyone has a part in protecting world peace\u2019. Mn, this was very necessary.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had formed her idea, and the boy had finished eating as well, as his little stomach was bloated up. Yet, he still looked yearningly at the half-finished dishes.</p><br/><p>Looking at her a little hesitantly, he then asked. \u201cBig sis, can I bring these remainders back\u2026 and eat them later?\u201d</p><br/><p>The careful expression of his, caused Zhu Yao to feel as though her heart string was being pulled. She once again stroked his head, and said. \u201cOf course you can. If it\u2019s not enough, tell big sis. I will call for a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, big sis.\u201d The boy looked at her with a face filled with gratitude. Picking up the flask on the table, he wanted to pour a cup of water for her, only to realize that there wasn\u2019t any water left in the flask. He then obediently said. \u201cI will go over to get some water for big sis. Big sis, wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded, suddenly, she recalled little radish who was on Jade Forest Mountain. If this child possessed a pretty good Spirit Vein, she could bring him back and raise him up along with little radish. However, from her dreams, he seemed to possess the Tri-Spirit Vein. With a potential like this, even if he entered the Inner Sect of Ancient Hill Sect, there would still be risks. Also, she felt that she shouldn\u2019t bring him into the cultivation world.</p><br/><p>As Zhu Yao pondered about it, she waited for the child to return. However, this wait, continued for an hour, yet, what returned was not the boy, but a vicious-looking fat lady.</p><br/><p>The moment the fat lady came up, she said as she pointed at Zhu Yao. \u201cOn the second floor, nearest to the window. It\u2019s her alright, hurry and capture her.\u201d The two men behind her, began to walk over while holding ropes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was baffled, however, how could a mortal with no spiritual energy be able to approach her? Before they could even walk up to her table, they were deflected away by the spiritual energy protecting her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually still dare to resist.\u201d The fat lady placed her hands on her hips, and then, she said while pointing at her. \u201cLet me tell you. Your little brother has already sold you to our Spring Garden. If you\u2019re sensible enough, then obediently return with me and attend to your guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little brother? Attend to guests? After pondering for a moment, Zhu Yao realized what was going on.</p><br/><p>The hell, that stinky brat. He had sold her to a brothel. What happened to the promised \u2018gratitude for saving his life\u2019? This damn brat.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was fuming with anger. Her cold and prideful mask, shattered and fell onto the ground. This damn brat, once I catch you later, I will definitely have to smack his buttocks till they burst open.</p><br/><p>She casually cast a Forgetting Mystic Art at the three people who were here to capture her, and had them forget the matters about capturing her. Then, she walked out of the restaurant. Just when she was about to use her divine sense to search for him, she suddenly realize that her hand felt empty.</p><br/><p>Momma\u2019s egg. That little wimp actually stole the storage ring which her master had left her. That ring had her master\u2019s imprint, and initially, she had to set her own imprint on it, before it could be considered as hers. However, she had been reluctant to remove her master\u2019s imprint, and adding that she was already able to directly retrieve items from it in the first place, she had never put this thought into practice.</p><br/><p>She did not expect that, because it did not possess her imprint, she actually did not realize it when a mortal child had stolen it. This was so embarrassing.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao released her divine sense, and immediately found the child\u2019s location. He was currently walking into a pawn shop. As expected, he was planning to pawn off her ring.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of someone who did not possess spiritual energy, that was nothing more than a regular ring. Only a practitioner was able to recognize that it was actually a storage mystic tool.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao once again concealed her figure, and willing herself, she instantly teleported to that pawn shop. She was just in time to hear that child\u2019s pleading voice.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. She really wanted to see just what this little brat wanted to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cShopkeeper, I beg you. I\u2019m really in need of silvers. My little brother is already bedridden for three days, please, do me a favor. Let me pawn this off to exchange for his medical fees.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the person standing behind the counter was not moved at all. \u201cShoo, shoo. You actually wish to pawn off such a tattered-looking ring. Our pawn shop isn\u2019t a place that takes in broken things. Hurry and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. Tattered-looking? Recalling those mystic tools and treasures kept inside the ring, her master would cry.</p><br/><p>The little boy looked as though he was really in dire need of money, as he pleaded that person many times, yet, the shopkeeper still did not agree to it. Finally, he started to feel irritated, as he picked up his broom and chased the boy away.</p><br/><p>The boy fell to the ground by his constant pushing. He could only stand up using his bluish bruised hands, and limp away regretfully.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao followed after him.</p><br/><p>Only to see that little boy walking into a secluded alley, and then, he walked towards a broken-down temple. Taking a deep breath, his face which still carried that dispirited look earlier, instantly revealed a smile.</p><br/><p>He loudly shouted. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened the door and walked in. A boy who wore the same tattered-looking clothes as him, but was taller than him, walked over. He stared ruthlessly at the little boy, and said. \u201cYou still dare to return? Where\u2019s the silvers? Have you managed to get some silvers?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little boy\u2019s smile stiffened on his face, as he lowered his head, looking as though he was admitting his mistake. \u201cN\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you will get some?\u201d The bigger boy became furious. \u201cThen, what will happen to Tiger? He\u2019s already sick to that extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I will think of something.\u201d The little boy explained.</p><br/><p>The big boy however, did not listen, as he shouted out loudly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s been decided that today was the deadline. Since you didn\u2019t manage to bring money, you\u2019re no longer able to stay in this house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro Monkey, tomorrow\u2026 I will definitely bring some back tomorrow.\u201d The little boy became anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cShoo, shoo.\u201d Monkey pushed him away. \u201cYou have already said that line for an entire month. This time, no matter how what you say, it\u2019s still a no.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their argument, startled the people in the entire temple. Dozens of children walked out in groups from inside the temple, and there were both boys and girls. Most probably, these were the little boy\u2019s companions, and it might be possible that they wouldn\u2019t be very soon.</p><br/><p>Because in that group of people, none of them stood out to speak for him. There were no sympathy, and no pity. They simply pointed and chattered about him, and they were filled with inexplicable rage for him.</p><br/><p>The words that children used were always more straightforward and more hurtful than adults.</p><br/><p>The boy was unable to argue. He simply harbored tears that he could not afford to fall, as he looked helplessly at the group of companions which he had been desperately trying to assimilate into, and anxiously shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro Monkey, I saw him on the streets today.\u201d A child who had just entered suddenly squeezed in, and said while pointing at the little boy. \u201cHe stole Tyrant Zangjian\u2019s purse today. I coincidentally saw the three of them chasing after him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Monkey\u2019s face instantly paled, and his face was filled with fear. \u201cYou actually dare to steal that evil tyrant\u2019s purse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was only doing it for Tiger\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Monkey became even more furious, as he stomped his feet and said. \u201cYou\u2019re just causing trouble for us. Hurry, chase him out. We must have Tyrant Zangjian and them see this. We musn\u2019t let them know we\u2019re with him, otherwise, he will drag us down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, hurry and chase him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the people responded one after another, as they forcefully pushed the boy out of the temple entrance. Standing unstably, the boy instantly fell into the drain outside, staining his entire body with a mud. His clothes which were initially made of thin fabric, were instantly drenched.</p><br/><p>However, he simply sat in the drain, dumbfounded, not moving a single inch, as though he had been shocked by how heartless his companions were.</p><br/><p>He sat for a long while, before he finally slowly crawled up. Like a wandering ghost he left the broken-down temple. As he walked, he rubbed away the tears that were constantly flowing out of the corners of his eyes, yet, he did not let out a single cry.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had always been following behind him, her anger had already dissipated quite a bit. She now understood why he did not dare to accept her goodwill, and instead, sold her away. Most probably, he had experienced too many situations like this. He understood the cold and warmth of humans, so he no longer dared to easily believe people. After all, even the companions he had lived with could betray him, much less a person he just met.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao followed him for a while, before she realized that he did not have a clear destination, and he was simply wandering aimlessly in the city. When he arrived at the restaurant she had brought him over for a meal, he stopped. Raising his head, he glanced at it, before silently walking away.</p><br/><p>Damn brat, now you know big sister\u2019s pain. Hmph. If I don\u2019t have you experience some pain, you won\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, Zhu Yao did not reveal herself, she simply waited for him to think it through by himself. Otherwise, if she charged out once again, she believed that he would definitely be able to do something like selling her once more.</p><br/><p>The child shakily walked in the city for three days. Most probably because he had became truly hungry, he seemed to be walking a little weakly.</p><br/><p>Shakily, he walked towards a farmer\u2019s house. However, behind him, a few people suddenly popped out, blocking his path.</p><br/><p>\u201cStinky brat, we finally caught you.\u201d This group consisted of a total of five people, and all of them were adult males. Three of them even looked familiar. They were exactly the three people who beat up the boy the other day. The way they walked, however, was a little strange.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s brows twitched. This was the typical scenario where enemies had forgotten the pain after their wounds had recovered!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t because you stole my purse, stinky brat, I wouldn\u2019t be in this state where I\u2019m unable to bear any sons. Watch me as I beat you to death today.\u201d Tyrant Zangjian glanced at his little brothers beside him, and the few of them rushed in and circled around him. \u201cLet\u2019s see just which ghost or god will pass by today to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little boy took a step back out of fear, yet, his face instantly sank again. He looked despairingly at the people that were already rushing over. He did not even resist, and simply allowed the few people to capture him. This time, no one would be coming to save him. Most probably, death was a form of relief as well.</p><br/><p>Their rage, however, did not decrease even the smallest bit just because they were facing a child. Instead, they pushed the child onto the ground, and then, with their wooden bats raised, they ruthlessly smacked towards the child.</p><br/><p>Just when one of the wooden bats was about to hit the child, something strange happened. The wooden bat suddenly escaped from their hands and flew away in the opposite direction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She did not dare to say about those Deities who ascended, but these practitioners, were still human. 70% of a human body was made up of water, and a Water Spirit Vein holder could control water. Just in which way was it trash?</p><br/><p>As expected, it\u2019s really frightening without education.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Luo have never heard of these offensive Arts. Did master create these for me?\u201d Finally, Yu Luo\u2019s eyes began to turn misty.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Something like that.\u201d Actually, these were all taught by her Chemistry and Physics teachers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026 this disciple will definitely not betray master\u2019s expectations.\u201d Yu Luo respectfully kowtowed in front of Zhu Yao, her eyes were filled with sparkling light.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief as well. Ever since she knew she possessed the Water Spirit Vein, although she did not voice it out, this little radish had always been feeling a little negative about it. Although her cultivation had never fallen behind, in the end, she simply did not wish to disappoint Zhu Yao. She always had this obstruction in the depth of her heart, believing that she possessed a trash Spirit Vein, and not only would she be unable to honor her school, she might even bring about countless of troubles. Hence, it was unavoidable for her to depreciate herself. However, on this day, the trace of uncertainty under her eyes, finally disappeared completely.</p><br/><p>With her current willpower, even if what happened in her dream would become reality, and her body would be taken over, she would still fight against it with all her might. However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle radish, to Water Spirit Vein holders, this offensive Art is a little too brutal. You can only use it to fend for yourself, so, unless you\u2019re in desperate straits, do not use it easily. Understand?\u201d Although knowledge could change one\u2019s fate, it could also bring about a disaster as well. There might even be a possibility that it would disrupt the current balance between the different Spirit Veins. She did not wish to stop this bug, only to end up having her own disciple become another bug on her own.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Yu Luo knew that this offensive Art was beyond ordinary. Raising her right hand, she said seriously. \u201cAt this moment, disciple Yu Luo shall swear upon the Soul Demon Oath. I shall not use this Art unless I\u2019m in a desperate situation, nor will I pass down this offensive Art to anyone else. If I were to violate this oath, this disciple is willing to die under the Soul Demon, and be unable to reincarnate forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Good girl, you have to become a good and upstanding lady, alright!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao then gave her few more instructions before releasing her to practice on her own. After all, since she had only just built her Foundation, her first priority right now was to stabilize her realm as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress\u2026\u201d Sesame called out unhappily, as it shook its own injured tail. \u201cMistress, the reason you called me here, is to hurt my tail? Wuuuu\u2026 Mistress, how can you treat little beastie like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at it. You\u2019re a ninth-grade beast, no wait, you\u2019re a tenth-grade beast now. Do you have act like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it nothing more than a small wound!\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hands without a mind. \u201cWith such thick skin and huge muscles, are you telling me you can\u2019t even handle such a small wound?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s a small wound, it still hurts.\u201d Even its brittle glass-heart had shattered as well, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen endure.\u201d Zhu Yao could not be bothered with it any longer. \u201cJust take it as though your auntie\u2019s husband has came along today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame was startled for a moment. Auntie\u2019s husband? What\u2019s that? Its ancestors were all beasties which bore single children, so it didn\u2019t have any other relatives though?</p><br/><p>Ever since that one lesson, little radish had been focusing on practicing Ice-type Mystic Arts in these recent days. She had only just built her Foundation, so her realm was not yet stable. Zhu Yao decided to have go into closed-door training for a period of time, to stabilize her realm before continuing.</p><br/><p>Little radish knew that she should not be anxious right now either, as she obediently went into closed-door training under the cold lake. Zhu Yao set down a few defensive-type formations in the vicinity. She then casually sealed the Jade Forest Mountain\u2019s formation, preventing everyone from entering. After pondering for a moment, she went over to greet Zi Mo, had him pay attention to the situation of Jade Forest Mountain, before leaving Ancient Hill Sect.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao calculated, it was about time for her to bring back a male partner.</p><br/><p>According to her dream, in Mu Meiyan\u2019s harem, there was an especially important figure, and that was a devil practitioner with a Heavenly Devil Physique. He was initially a Tri-Spirit Vein mortal. Following her memories of her past life, Mu Meiyan searched for him, and saved his life a step before Yue Hanxin. From then on, she became the light in this person\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>However, this person was a little unfortunate. He was captured by a heretic practitioner later on, and suffered numerous tortures. Out of coincidence, he found a tattered ancient scroll regarding the Ancient Devil Cultivation. After practicing in it, he realized he possessed the Heavenly Devil Physique, and from then on, his cultivation rose explosively.</p><br/><p>In the end, he even succeeded in stepping into the Ways of the Devil. And, at the end, in order to save Mu Meiyan, he directly succumbed into the Devil. Driven by the Devil\u2019s characteristic, he even opened the seal of the Ancient Devil Race.</p><br/><p>Hence, the cultivation world which was initially pretty much destroyed by the great war, once again welcomed a wave of disaster due to the emergence of the raging Devil Race.</p><br/><p>Right now, that person should still be in the mortal realm. Although it\u2019s said that little radish\u2019s takeover was the beginning and cause of everything, this person\u2019s darkening and Devil transformation, was the last straw which brought about the end of the world. Hence, so as to prevent all causes, no matter if Mu Meiyan succeed in her rebirth, Zhu Yao had to make two types of preparations.</p><br/><p>After Zhu Yao finished her preparations, she made a trip to the mortal realm. Following her memories, she arrived at a small city in the south. Concealing her figure, she used her divine sense to search for that person. Currently, he should still be a child.</p><br/><p>As expected, in an instant, she found what she was looking for. That person was at a secluded corner in the west of the city. And, he seemed to have encountered a small trouble as well. Willing herself, Zhu Yao instantly arrived at the roof of the site of crime.</p><br/><p>This place should be a tattered old ruins, as it seemed to have been a long time since the house was last occupied. Not far in front of her, three people were confronting a little boy. That three people were three male adults, and currently, their faces were in rage, as they ruthlessly stared at that boy who had already been forced back into a corner of the wall.</p><br/><p>The boy was wearing tattered clothes, and there were even several dirt stains on them. He was extremely thin, as though it had been a long time since he had eaten a good meal, and his face was covered in dirty yellow.</p><br/><p>\u201cStinky brat, why aren\u2019t you running anymore!?\u201d A man spat out. Roughly, he pushed the child\u2019s shoulders, instantly throwing the child\u2019s weak and small body onto the wall.</p><br/><p>The child seemed to be in extreme pain, as he was unable to crawl back up in a short notice. Yet, he still stubbornly gritted his teeth, not letting out a single sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo actually dare to steal from my body, you must be tired of living.\u201d Another man picked the child up, and ruthlessly gave him a slap, various types of curses kept spouting out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Another man was jeering at the side as well. \u201cThat\u2019s right, beat up this brat who doesn\u2019t know his place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao realize that the little boy was tightly holding onto a purse in his hands. So he had stolen something, no wonder he was being beaten.</p><br/><p>The man who got his purse stolen, gave the child a few slaps. After seeing that blood was oozing out from the corner of his lips, and seemed to have fainted, he then retrieved his own purse. Casually, he flung the child away, and then, carefully inspected the contents of his own purse.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro, what do we do now?\u201d Another man asked. Although this child was detestable, killing him would be more troublesome.</p><br/><p>After taking his purse, he swept a glance at the boy who was still curling up on the ground. Suddenly, he smiled sinisterly, and passed a glance at the two people beside him. \u201cMy dear brothers, do you want to release some fire?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two instantly understood, as their eyes flashed with a several specks of light. However, one of them then said a little hesitantly. \u201cBut this is a boy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d That man who got his purse stolen, slapped on his head. \u201cDo you know? Right now, the most trending hobby among the rich folks is to raise a boy like him. After we\u2019re done playing with him, we can even sell him away, and earn a sum of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss is as wise as always.\u201d The other two men instantly nodded. With lewd smiles, they walked over to the child. With a ruthless jerk, they pulled away the child\u2019s shirt. Although the child\u2019s face was stained with a dirty yellow, his body was very white and clean, causing their eyes to be filled with the light of wolves.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the child regained his consciousness. Realizing what these men were about to do, he struggled with all his might. \u201cRelease me, release me!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, how could a mere child struggle free from three grown men? The man raised his hand, and once again gave him a tight slap, causing half of his face to swell up.</p><br/><p>The child began to see stars from the beating, and the strength he was putting in his struggle decreased as well. Yet, at this moment, he was really flustered, and he could no longer help but cry out. However, he was unable to stop these people, as his pants had already been ruthlessly pulled down by these men.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Zhu Yao understood that it was time for her to act. In her dream, the reason why he engraved Mu Meiyan\u2019s kindness in his heart was because she had helped him when he was in a crisis.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao descended from the roof, and with a slight cast of a Wind-type Mystic Art, she flung the three men away. The three men were flung a good couple meters away, and they only managed to stop after smashing onto a broken wall.</p><br/><p>Oh courageous youth, stand up now and create miracles!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Who is it?\u201d The three people crawled up, looking entirely fatigued, yet, they were unable to see a human figure in their vicinity.</p><br/><p>Crap, she had forgotten that she had concealed herself.</p><br/><p>The three people searched around for a long while, a slight chill began to surge in the depth of their hearts. One of them said. \u201cBig bro, it couldn\u2019t have been a ghost, right? I heard that in the past, this place was actually the old city sector, and usually, there\u2019s those types of things\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That big bro seemed to much bigger guts, as he spat at his little bro. Not believing in the occult, he once again went forward and grabbed the little boy.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. Did these people think with their lower halves? Then, they had best not blame her for taking away their thinking tools. With just that behavior of theirs, if she had not been around, they would have really underwent same-sex relationships one after another.</p><br/><p>And their target was even a child who was only around ten years old. They were basically worse than beasts.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao once again cast out wind blades. This time, three blades, were sent directly to their lower halves. In an instant, the three of them held onto their blood-flowing lower halves, as they rolled around in pain on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cA ghost, a ghost, big bro, there\u2019s definitely a ghost.\u201d The faces of the three men turned pale. Though, it was unknown if it was because of the fright, or the pain.</p><br/><p>All three of them tumbled about as they fled.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao removed her concealment, revealing her figure. Walking to the corner, she saw that child was still sitting over there. His pair of eyes was staring blankly in the air, without a hint of anxiousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Are you alright?\u201d Zhu Yao tried to ask. The child had completely no reaction at all, he simply hugged himself even more tightly.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he was given quite a fright. Zhu Yao paushed for a moment, before reaching out a hand. \u201cWhere do you live? Big sis will send you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>The child finally had some sort of reaction. Stiffly turning his head to look at her, Zhu Yao tried her best to respond to him with a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>Finally, the child cried out loudly.</p><br/><p>She hugged the child up, and helped him wipe his tears away as she consoled him. \u201cAlright, alright. It\u2019s fine now. Big sis has already chased those bad people away. Stop crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yet, the child cried even more sadly, as he tightly grabbed onto her clothes, and wiped his snot on them.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s always a need for a grace period. Zhu Yao decided to not persuade him anymore, and allowed him to cry all his want.</p><br/><p>Yet, he actually cried for exactly two hours. Zhu Yao was a little curious, just where did all these tears from? Wasn\u2019t he thirsty?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

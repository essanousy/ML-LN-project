How could a Demigod-stage practitioner appear here? Just who the hell are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grandma!\u201d Zhu Yao once again raised her own sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The old man was extremely furious, his face had turned pale. He took a deep breath, as though he was trying to suppress his own anger. Only after a moment did he laugh coldly. \u201cLittle girly, don\u2019t be too complacent. Do you really believe that with a Demigod-stage practitioner here, you\u2019re able to beat me? All of you shall die here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She suddenly had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>The old man snorted coldly. \u201cWho do you think these ruins belong to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was instantly stunned.</p><br/><p>The old man began to laugh even more arrogantly. \u201cIt was simply a coincidence for this old man to obtain this \u2018Wood Spirit\u2019, however, because of someone\u2019s plot, I died. And then, it just happened that my soul was absorbed into this mustard seed dimensional space that fell from the Higher Realm. And by fate and coincidence, I then dwelled in these ruins. That sealed mystic beast is the owner of this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s heart tightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mystic beast that came from the Higher Realm. Do you think a mere Demigod-stage practitioner from the cultivation world can go against a divine beast that came from the Higher Realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head towards the sky, yet, she was unable to see the figures of her master or the mystic beast, she was only able to see occasional black and white specks of light flashing past. She could not help but feel a little flustered. In the cultivation world, a demonic beast required to reach the eleventh-rank, comparable to a late Demigod-stage practitioner, and experience the Ascension Lightning Tribulation, before being able to ascend to the Divine Realm. If this mystic beast came from the Higher Realm, then it was at least an eleventh-rank mystic beast. However, in usual situations, she would never believe that her master would lose, however, currently, her master only had a part of his divine sense, he was basically unable to use his full strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d The old man laughed very complacently. \u201cLittle girly, when up against this mystic beast, you people have completely no chance of victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart tightened, and stared at that gloating old man, flames of fury began to rise within her. Haaah, this hot temper of mine!</p><br/><p>She did not care what she was holding onto with her hand, and simply threw it towards him with a swing of her hand. With a \u2018Dong\u2019 sound, it landed right on target.</p><br/><p>With a \u2018bu\u2019 sound, the old man smashed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any chance at victory against that thing, however, I have all I need to deal with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao got angry, she forgot all of the Arts and Techniques she had. Raising her fists, she began to pummel them at the old man\u2019s face. \u201cThis is what you get for being a big mouth! This is what you get for speaking nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man seemed to have never expected that she would be so unclassy and directly use her fists either, and he basically had completely no way to retaliate. In just a few moments, his head were all filled with buns from her bashing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo, aiya, I\u2019m dying, I\u2019m dying, I\u2019m dying! Stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly your sister would stop, you\u2019re already dead. I don\u2019t mind if you were to die even more thoroughly.\u201d Zhu Yao began to bash with even more force, and neither did she forget to step on his butt with her feet, strongly grinding them a few times. You damn gay old man!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girly, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts\u2026 How can you do this to an old man\u2026 Aiyo, gentler, gentler!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak. How can we seal that mystic beast again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not telling?\u201d She continued her bashing, her target, was his face!</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo, little girly, young lady, gentler! I\u2019m dying, I\u2019m dying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo are you going to speak?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I really don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Continue bashing\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you beat me to death, I wouldn\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why is it that, earlier, when we entered, it did not break out of the seal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I don\u2019t know either.\u201d The old man felt like crying. \u201cAfter I was trapped in these ruins, I regretted. Because, no one could get past that formation on the door. I had waited for several tens of thousands of years, and there were countless people who had arrived outside the door. Yet, all of them were eaten by that mystic beast. You people were the first to enter here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao recalled Xiao Yi\u2019s protagonist cheat, and determined that what this old man said was not false. Could it really be that only he could enter this place? Zhu Yao picked the chest that the old man dropped at the side.</p><br/><p>The \u201cWood Spirit\u201d was still staying inside obediently.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sapling, I\u2019m bringing you out of here. Are you willing to follow me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChick~\u201d The Wood Spirit in the chest raised its branches, doing a cheering action.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhu Yao found some comfort. Picking up the sword on the ground, she raised her head and looked towards the sky. If they were unable to beat it, then she would flee with her master. She had already found the thing she needed anyway.</p><br/><p>As to something like reputation\u2026 What\u2019s that? Can it be eaten?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a big step forward, yet, suddenly, a golden light shone at the side. Turning her head to look, Xiao Yi\u2019s body was currently emitting out a golden-colored light. A golden-colored layer suddenly floated out of his body, slowly forming into the shape of a sword.</p><br/><p>The color of that sword was actually extremely unusual. It was dyed entirely in red, just like fresh, flowing blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cMetal Spirit!\u201d The old man who had just crawled up, looked at that sword with a shocked expression. \u201cThis\u2026 This is the Metal Spirit! But\u2026 Why is it red?\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the Metal Spirit? Zhu Yao had always known that Xiao Yi managed to comprehend his Sword Intent because of his possession of the Metal Spirit. However, only now did she know that the Metal Spirit was actually sword-shaped as well. But, clearly, Xiao Yi was still unconscious, so why would the Metal Spirit appear by itself? And it did not seem to be very friendly.</p><br/><p>The light emitting out from the Metal Spirit became even brighter, and it\u2019s color was still that unusual red. It was formed by the spiritualization of spiritual energy in the first place, so it should have been the purest and cleanest existence in the world. However, it\u2019s current state, forget about purity, it looked as though it was demonized.</p><br/><p>\u201cChick?\u201d The little sapling seemed to have been infected by that red aura as well, and it\u2019s initial white and tender branches were slowly dyed in red, even its green leaves were beginning to change in color. After shaking for a moment, it actually floated up, and flew towards the Metal Spirit.</p><br/><p>That Metal Spirit was calling out to it!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sapling!\u201d Zhu Yao called out, however, the Wood Spirit did not have a single reaction. As though it had been mesmerized, it continued to float towards the Metal Spirit.</p><br/><p>In a panic, Zhu Yao kept the Wood Spirit within her own divine sense, isolating it from the outside world.</p><br/><p>Only then did the redness on the Wood Spirit\u2019s body begin to fade, returning to its initial color. Because of this short moment, it seemed to have tired itself out excessively, the entire sapling curled, slowly shrinking into a ball.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s instincts were telling her, there was something wrong with that Metal Spirit.</p><br/><p>The Metal Spirit which had lost its guiding target, became even more violent, and began to take in a large amount of metal spiritual energy from the surroundings. In an instant, stones and sand flew, the surrounding air began to surge, and even the the sky began to sway.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, the formation here has been broken.\u201d The old man\u2019s figure began to fade for a bit.</p><br/><p>Amidst this, a bang was heard. A mystic beast fell from the sky, and it\u2019s gigantic figure was covered entirely in blood. Immediately after, a white figure flew down as well, his clothes were as white as snow, and was not tainted in the least.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Zhu Yao instantly heaved a sigh of relief, and could not help but step forward and praise him.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan coldly said. \u201cLeave this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s sprinting steps paused, and after a careful look did she realize that her master\u2019s presence was very unstable, and even his figure had begun to fade.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d He was injured.</p><br/><p>While that demonic beast had stood up once again, it\u2019s entire body emitted out an even stronger pressure than before, roaring as it charged towards Yu Yan. As though it had been utterly angered, it\u2019s pair of bloody-red eyes stared straight at him.</p><br/><p>Just as it was about to pounce over, suddenly, the sky and ground suddenly shook. Earlier, what Zhu Yao saw was a barren land in front of her, and when the scenery changed again, they were actually still standing in the ruins.</p><br/><p>The palace was collapsing at the speed visible to the naked eyes, and a ray of golden light surged upwards, breaking through the ceiling and rushed straight towards the sky. The metal spiritual energy from all directions drew towards that pillar of light.</p><br/><p>The mystic beast seemed to have caught itself within that pillar of light, and was unable to stand steadily. Hence, it could only jump to and fro, leaving the radius of the pillar of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cMetal Spirit?\u201d Raising his head to look at the pillar of light which suddenly appeared, Yu Yan began to frown deeply.</p><br/><p>He formed a hand-seal with a single hand, yet, he did not attack, rather, he summoned a flying sword. He still did not turn his head back, and simply said this with a tone that was filled with sternness he had never used till then. \u201cFly out of this place with this sword. This sword will protect you until you reach the entrance of the Secret Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe metal spiritual energy particles have gone berserk, I\u2019m afraid this entire Secret Realm might even sink under them.\u201d Yu Yan said. \u201cRemember to fly out with all of your strength, do not hesitate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about you, master?\u201d Clearly, he was already injured.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan finally turned around, stretching his hand, he stroked her head, carrying that face which was still as cold as ever. \u201cHurry and leave. I\u2019m just a thread of divine sense. Even if I disappear, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you be fine?\u201d Are you taking me as a three-year-old child? One\u2019s divine sense originated from the real body, and was a part of one\u2019s soul. If one\u2019s soul was missing, how could the real body be fine? \u201cIf master isn\u2019t going, I\u2019m not going either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe obedient.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank. \u201cMaster will wait for you at Jade Forest Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLies! I\u2019m not a child, you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>It looked as though Yu Yan was about to say something, however, the mystic beast had already charged out of the metal spiritual energy\u2019s grasp, persistently pouncing towards Yu Yan.</p><br/><p>The hell, this damn hateful little animal.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and leave!\u201d Yu Yan waved his hand, and Zhu Yao had already been sent dozens of meters away, as he turned around and took it on.</p><br/><p>That spiritual sword that had been summoned by Yu Yan, stopped right before Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tightly clenched her fists. She was basically unable to help at all, however, she was unable to leave behind her master and go off alone.</p><br/><p>There must be another way.</p><br/><p>After looking around the surroundings, she realized, that old man whose head had turned Buddha-like after being bashed by her, was carrying Xiao Yi and sneakily moving towards a pillar on the right.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn gay old man.\u201d Zhu Yao picked up a rock, and threw towards him. With a \u2018pa\u2019 sound, she struck on target.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo!\u201d The old man cried out. \u201cLittle girly, I have already given you the Wood Spirit, what else do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being so sneaky for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s expression changed, yet, it instantly returned to normal. \u201cHoho, little girly, you have misunderstood me. I was simply afraid that this kid would get injured, so I pulled him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not believe in the slightest, and coldly stared at him. Hugging her fist, she strongly cracked it, emitting out a crackle. Are you telling or not?</p><br/><p>The old man swallowed his saliva, and only then did he answer honestly. \u201cUh\u2026 Little girly. Look, that berserk Metal Spirit doesn\u2019t seem it will stop anytime soon, and instead, will charge right out of the Secret Realm. When that time comes, the Secret Realm will collapse. If, by then, the Metal Spirit still doesn\u2019t stop, there might be a possibility that it will implicate the entire cultivation world. I see that Demigod-stage practitioner has a high cultivation level, if he were to make a gamble with his full strength, he might be able to stop it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao ruthlessly stared at him.</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s shrunk his neck. \u201cUhh\u2026 I\u2019m saying that under this pillar, incidentally, there\u2019s a teleportation formation. Although it\u2019s unusable now, if this Secret Realm collapses, or when the disturbance of the metal spiritual energy reaches its peak, the natural laws of this place might slacken for a moment, and when that time comes, we can be automatically transferred out of here.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

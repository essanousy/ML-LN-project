Why? Zhu Yao was a little confused as she instinctively sensed the conditions of her body, and realized that there wasn\u2019t any anomaly. Theoretically speaking, the Sun-shrooms were formed by resentment, so even if she carried the World Favourable Impression ability, as resentment was something without sentience, it should not harbour any favourable impression of her. Also, what was the light that flew into her body? It definitely wasn\u2019t resentment, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have healed her injuries but shot a hole through her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly, are you fine?\u201d Nangong Cheng looked at her worriedly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shook her head.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying and Yu Yan walked over as well. They had initially wanted to check her pulse, but realized that not only weren\u2019t there any injuries on her body, even the bloodstains had disappeared.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t any plants on the grass field now. Even the Cob Cannons that were exposing their yellow tips earlier had all returned to the earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you feel any anomaly?\u201d Yu Yan looked at his stupid disciple and could not help but feel worried, checking her pulse once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on as well.\u201d Zhu Yao shrugged as she explained her situation earlier.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned as he tightened his grip on the hand he was holding. \u201cDo you have any plans?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe the plants here must be separated by regions. The further we go, the bigger the difficulty.\u201d Zhu Yao solemnly said. \u201cWe can\u2019t use mystic arts right now, and Little Yellow and Little Teal are both injured as well. Most likely, it will be really hard for them to reach the Light of Guidance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all our fault.\u201d Nangong Cheng said with a self-reprimanding look. \u201cWe\u2019ve dragged you guys down. Why don\u2019t you three continue on while fellow daoist Zhonggu Lu and I recuperate here. After we\u2019re done, we will catch up with you three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yellow is right.\u201d Zhonggu Lu nodded and said. \u201cOnly the three of you have hopes of becoming Gods. In our current situation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?\u201d Zhu Yao did not like to listen to such things. \u201cWho said we\u2019re going to throw you two aside? We were together since the first floor. If we really have to split up, this isn\u2019t the right time either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Nangong Cheng frowned and turned to look in front of them. \u201cWe won\u2019t know what will appear before us. Our injuries are too severe, and we will simply be burdens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019re burdens, we\u2019re carrying you two on our own will.\u201d Zhu Yao squatted down and solemnly said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t throw you two aside. Even if I have to carry you two, I will carry you two over to that side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng was stunned. He exchanged glances with Zhonggu Lu, and then suddenly leaked out a laugh. \u201cDongfang girly, you\u2019re a really\u2026 really different Deity practitioner.\u201d Putting aside Deity practitioners who were usually heartless, even among Demonic Immortals, they would have been thrown aside in such situations, let alone in this top floor where dangers could be found everywhere. Everyone said that the Heavenly Dao was heartless, and ever since they began on this path, they had already gotten used to slaughter and betrayal. With how long they had lived, the concept of this so-called friendship had already turned faint. Never did he think that in such a situation, that there would actually be someone who would say that she would carry them over if she had to.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust recuperate your injuries here for now. After your injuries are better, we will set off.\u201d Zhu Yao patted on Nangong Huang\u2019s shoulder and said. \u201cIf my guess is correct, there shouldn\u2019t be any danger nearby now. But\u2026\u201d She raised her head and looked about two hundred meters away. \u201cIf we cross the sunflowers\u2019 boundary from earlier, I\u2019m afraid another wave of new plants will appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned and held onto her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve already made your decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said affirmatively, and not in a questioning manner.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao chuckled. \u201cMaster, I have an idea. I want to step out of that sunflowers\u2019 boundary alone and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s expression turned cold. \u201cThat place is definitely even more dangerous. How are you going to deal with it alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026 I have a feeling that these plants don\u2019t really wish to harm me.\u201d She stroked her healed chest.</p><br/><p>His frown grew deeper. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why were you injured before?\u201d Though he knew that his disciple\u2019s body was abnormal, from the situation earlier, the Cob Cannon and Pea Shooters did not have any intentions of avoiding her in their attacks in the least.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d He made a lot of sense. \u201cActually, I\u2019m talking about those sunflowers and mushrooms. Master, you saw it yourself, right? Those two plants gather sunlight\u2026 Uh, I mean, they\u2019re formation cores. They are the keys behind the appearances of all the other plants, that\u2019s why they are intentionally planted in such faraway positions. However, I feel that those plants are friendly to me. They must be different from the rest of the plants. Even if they\u2019re formed by resentment, they\u2019re definitely mixed with something else. I might\u2026 be able to speak to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was still frowning. Clearly, he could not agree to her risking her life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have no other way now, and we can\u2019t possibly sit here and await death.\u201d Most importantly was that \u201cchi\u201d noise. She felt that this was a little strange. In the past, Wood Spirit was the only one who would call out in such a way. However, the Wood Spirit was in the faraway Desolate Land and it had long gained a human form. How could she possibly appear here?</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng and Zhonggu Lu spent an entire two days to recuperate, and their bodies were finally in acceptable conditions. Though her master had already agreed to Zhu Yao taking the lead and let her enter the next region alone, he still stood guard at the boundary, so that he could provide aid the moment things were to go awry.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath before finally walking out of the place where the sunflowers last appeared. She had only walked a few steps when the earth began to shake once more. The others behind her instantly tensed up, instinctively gripping onto the swords in their hands.</p><br/><p>A moment later, with a poof sound, a sunflower appeared as expected. However, it was not a hundred meters away, but had instead appeared right next to Zhu Yao. Its large petals spread open, and it looked at her while blinking its eyes.</p><br/><p>It seemed to be stunned for a moment. Suddenly, it let out what seemed to be a joyful sound. \u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stiffened and then waved her hand at it. \u201cHi~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi?\u201d The sunflower let out a confused sound, as though it did not understand her words.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had no choice but to change into the language of Chis, and let out the sound she learnt from it. \u201cChi chi?\u201d</p><br/><p>That sunflower instantly replied with incomparable joy. \u201cChi chi chi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi chi chi?\u201d There\u2019s nothing wrong with this reply right?</p><br/><p>Thus, the conversation between a human and a sunflower began to develop in a strange direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi chi chi chi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi chi chi chi chi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi chi chi chi chi chi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi chi chi chi chi chi chi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait! What am I doing?</p><br/><p>Why are we comparing who has more \u201cChi\u201ds, hey?</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible!\u201d The unknowing spectator Nangong Cheng had a revering look. \u201cDongfang girly isn\u2019t actually able to understand the sunflower\u2019s words!\u201d</p><br/><p>Spectators: \u201c\u2026\u201d I really want to break off relations from him!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah! Umm\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao instantly found back her own mother tongue. Though she said she wanted to chat with the sunflowers about life, she actually didn\u2019t know where she should begin, hey? \u201cI say, Sunsun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d The sunflower straightened up like a pole, looking as if it was listening seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 Just what are you? Also, do you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi\u2026\u201d It tilted its head, letting out a long sound. Suddenly, it stretched out an enormous leave and wrapped around her wrist. It then let out a crisp voice. \u201cLord!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Lord\u2019 again?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018lord\u2019? Why are you calling me that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sunflower began to sway left and right. As if it was shouting out a slogan, it called out. \u201cLord, lord\u2026 Sunlight, sunlight\u2026 Lord, lord\u2026\u201d With every movement it made, it would shout out once.</p><br/><p>As though spring had appeared after the rain, even more sunflowers began to pop out form the ground. They lined up on her left and right, as though they were a welcoming group. Then, they began to sway as well.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the entire grass field was filled with their echoes. \u201cLord, sunlight\u2026\u201d The same voice, their neat movements, and their uniform slogan made them look as if they were conducting a parade.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little confused. It seemed like she had just received an incredible welcome.</p><br/><p>The number of sunflowers continued to grow, and they were even spreading all the way forward, opening up a path all the way to the region where the Light of Guidance was. She suddenly felt as if she was making a friendly visit to the kingdom of sunflowers. Now this is a true green VIP passageway! So should she walk? Should she walk? Or should she walk?</p><br/><p>The group of four spectators at the back were stunned as well. What\u2019s with this friendly and harmonious scene?</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly\u2026\u201d Nangong Cheng shouted out. \u201cThis\u2026 Just what is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Zhu Yao shook her head. \u201cThe intelligence of these sunflowers isn\u2019t high. Most likely, most of them are just moving on instinct. I\u2019m not sure if I can speak through to them either. Master\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao looked at Yu Yan. \u201cYou\u2019ve never eaten a single medicinal pellet, so their hatred for you should be the least. Why don\u2019t you try walking over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan nodded. He glanced at the surroundings before stepping out of the boundary. Almost at the same time, the sunflowers that were still happily welcoming her earlier, instantly quietened down. They turned to look at Yu Yan one after another.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart tensed. However, in the next moment, those sunflowers once again turned around and continued to sway and chant out, \u201cLord\u2026 Sunlight.\u201d Yu Yan safely arrived next to Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>As she had thought, these plants would only react to people who had eaten too many medicinal pellets.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying was up next. Different from Yu Yan who was ignored, when Yue Ying walked over, all of the sunflowers seemed to have leaned backwards in disgust. Zhu Yao guessed that the devillic aura emitting from his body was making them avoid him out of instinct.</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng and Little Teal remained. Zhu Yao could not help but push her focus up to a hundred and twenty percent. Yu Yan and Yue Ying were different. These plants were formed by the resentment of plants and flowers. The sunflowers ignored the two of them was because they had never eaten a single pellet, so they did harbour any hatred for the two in the first place. As for Nangong Cheng and Little Teal however\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNangong Huang, you take the lead.\u201d Zhu Yao solemnly said. \u201cBe careful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng naturally realized the situation as well. These plants most likely were targeting the two of them the entire time. In an instant, the guilt in his heart grew deeper. If the two of them weren\u2019t here, most likely, the three of them had already arrived at their destination. The moment he thought of this, he could no longer bear to cross over with his raised foot.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongfang girly, why don\u2019t\u2026 you three leave first.\u201d If one can pass through, then he should head on first.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d Zhu Yao felt like cussing out now. \u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you spouting now? You\u2019re being wishy-washy here. Are you still a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m a male beast!\u201d He\u2019s not a human in the first place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

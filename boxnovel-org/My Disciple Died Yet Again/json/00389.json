Merely that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Startled, Zhu Yao loosened her grip. \u201cYou want my master to manage the Divine Realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, mn, mn\u2026\u201d He nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Zhu Yao frowned. \u201cMaster\u2019s cultivation is indeed incredible, but you should know what sort of place the Divine Realm is. Even if we put aside those Deities that were ejected from the Lightning Divine Tower, among those outside, which one of them would be willing to listen? It would\u2019ve been possible when Lightning Divine Palace was still the manager of the Lightning Divine Tower, but now that the tower is gone, if those Deities were to come together\u2026 Furthermore, there\u2019s only a couple of us in the Lightning Divine Palace.\u201d If every one of them were to simply spit water at us, we can still die, alright? Let alone manage the entire Divine Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026\u201d Realmspirit once again patted on her hands, hinting her to let go.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes before releasing her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther people might not be able to, but Yu Yan can definitely do it.\u201d As he rubbed his face, he took in some cold air and said. \u201cThough the current Divine Realm isn\u2019t ideal, all of the Deities are still under the Heavenly Dao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, you sound as if my master isn\u2019t under\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned for a moment, and then she suddenly widened her eyes. \u201cThe hell, you did that on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Indeed, the people of the Divine Realm were under the control of the Heavenly Dao, but there was one person who wasn\u2019t, and that\u2019s her master. Because the Heavenly Dao\u2019s control on him had just disappeared, and she was the one who personally shattered it \u2013 the circle of \u2018infinity\u2019 symbols that was swirling around him.</p><br/><p>Back then, her hands were itchy because she wanted her master to be free of the Heavenly Dao\u2019s control and prevent him from walking into the Light of Purification.</p><br/><p>Back then, to while away time, Yu Jin released the Disciplinary Order and declared that the Lightning Divine Palace was a place that enacted punishments in the Divine Realm. In the end, Realmspirit really began to treat Lightning Divine Palace as Divine Realm\u2019s management office.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, it was a rather tragic story. Among the two people next to her, one was going to become the future manager of the Devils, while the other one was immediately about to take up the position of chairman of the Divine Realm. So she was sent here to this world to help Realmspirit pick out talents? What was she? A HR manager?</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit, you can\u2019t possibly have counted me in as well, right?\u201d Zhu Yao looked at him with narrow eyes. I don\u2019t wish to work for you any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHohohoho\u2026 How can that be!\u201d Realmspirit chuckled. Why did she feel she was about to be trolled? \u201cOh right, Yaoyao. Your mission this time has been completed. It\u2019s time to receive your mission reward!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was dumbfounded. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the Plane Movement Permits!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You can freely choose to travel between two planes limitlessly, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that something you made up to trick me? Weren\u2019t you the one who controlled my movement between the planes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Realmspirit said with a serious face. \u201cThough I\u2019m the spirit of the Three Realms, I\u2019m only limited to this plane. Other planes have their own managers, and I have no authority to enter them. In order to cross between two worlds, I naturally have to obtain permission from the plane manager from your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cManager?\u201d Why did she think of a president of a country or a chairman of some sort? There couldn\u2019t really be a management office or an agency like that, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, the world you live in is actually really vast as well, and it\u2019s not smaller than the Three Thousand Worlds. The things you understand on earth are just a small part of it. Though, when I sought help back then, your manager recommended you to me. It seems like it has been proven that he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the manager of our world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course!\u201d He said with pride. \u201cIsn\u2019t this just for the sake of developing friendly ties between planes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Friendly ties, your sister! Are you trying to build harmony between planes? Then what am I? A representative sent for a friendly visit to your plane?</p><br/><p>\u201cStop with the bullcrap. Where\u2019s the permits?\u201d She immediately stretched out her hand. \u201cHurry and give them to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Realmspirit\u2019s expression stiffened. \u201cYaoyao, actually, if you\u2019re coming from that world, I will definitely welcome you with open arms, and I won\u2019t even need a permit from you. The difficult part starts when we have to send you to your plane from here. That\u2019s when the permit is needed. That\u2019s why when you\u2019re going back and forth from here to your plane, there\u2019s actually no need for a permit. The permit is actually issued by your plane to the citizens of my side. I don\u2019t have the authority to hand new permits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak human.\u201d What do you mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, I can\u2019t make this permit. You have to look for your world\u2019s manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d Zhu Yao raised her hand and slapped the back of his head. \u201cIf you can\u2019t make it, why the hell did you spout so much nonsense?\u201d</p><br/><p>He pitifully rubbed his head. \u201cI can\u2019t make it, but I can bring you to the manager of your plane to make it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s hand stopped. \u201cHow are we going to get there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already set the route.\u201d He raised his hand with an excited look, and instantly, the two screens merged into one. Then, it slowly enlarged itself, and the numbers 1 and 0 constantly flashed within the combined screen. They looked especially familiar. Were they similar to binary codes?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a mystic treasure that your plane manager gifted me.\u201d He said with an expression of reverence. \u201cIt can analyze the routes of all matters that happen in the Three Realms in advance, and find the loopholes almost instantaneously. It even has various other features. Do you still remember the conversation windows that you often see? They were all displayed by this mystic treasure. The cheats that you carry are all sent by it as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell. So those stupid conversation windows and the cheats that were filled with potential retorts to be made, were all made by this object. Why did she feel like she had entered a game world? This object was clearly a high-tech, intelligent piece of equipment, wasn\u2019t it!? Just what kind of person was the manager of her plane? Why did she feel like he was becoming even more incredible?</p><br/><p>\u201cDone!\u201d Realmspirit excitedly said. \u201cThe route towards the management office has been constructed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head to take a look, and her face instantly darkened as the corners of her lips twitched.</p><br/><p>Why the hell did it turn into a door? And a pick one at that, hey? Do you think this is Doraemon\u2019s Anywhere Door?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, we have to stick an address on it!\u201d Realmspirit pulled out a pen and a piece of post-it note out of nowhere. In a flash, he wrote a row of words on it, and with a raise of his hand, he stuck it onto the door with a slam.</p><br/><p>Destination: Plane Management Office.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Let me think where I should start retorting from!</p><br/><p>It really was the Anywhere Door, hey! One could navigate through just by sticking a paper on it. As the manager of a plane, was it really fine for it to be this easy?</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao!\u201d Realmspirit pulled onto Zhu Yao, his face was filled with never-before-seen seriousness. \u201cThe Management Office is right behind this door. My abilities can only be applied on this plane, and I am unable to intervene in your world\u2019s matters. You can only rely on yourself to obtain the permit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, why did you suddenly turn so serious? You\u2019re making me anxious too, hey.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what kind of person is my world\u2019s manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit was silent for a short while, but his expression continued to sink. He looked at Zhu Yao tremblingly, and after a long while, he said. \u201cI can only say\u2026 he\u2019s a very\u2026 stern person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stern! In other words, he wasn\u2019t a good person to speak with. Then would she still be able to make the permit?</p><br/><p>Why don\u2019t I\u2026 first present a gift?</p><br/><p>No matter what, she definitely had to obtain the Plane Movement Permit. She did not want to be seperated from her master for all eternity. Zhu Yao took a deep breath, prepared herself mentally for a long while, and then finally held onto the door handle. She turned it strongly, and the door creaked.</p><br/><p>A ray of white light instantly enveloped her, and the scenery before her changed, revealing a room.</p><br/><p>Along with the warm decorations, the place was furnished a complete set of tables, chairs, coffee table, shoe rack, sofa and television. There was even a man dressed in an apron with his hands holding onto a mop, and was mopping the floor seriously. He took steps back as he mopped, and when he reached the entrance, he even coldly shouted. \u201cRaise your feet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu!\u201d Zhu Yao instinctively took a step back and stood on the entrance mat.</p><br/><p>She silently stood there for several minutes, looking blankly at the foreign-looking man as he mopped the floor twice. He even cleaned the tables, wiped the mirrors, dried the clothes, and even made breakfast.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao then thought that something must had been wrong with the way she opened the door. Why don\u2019t she try going back to open it again?</p><br/><p>How could the Plane Management Office be such a homely place!? Furthermore, it even had a two rooms and a living room.</p><br/><p>Eh, wait a minute! Why does this place looks so familiar?</p><br/><p>Why were the two cups on the table so similar to the pair she bought from a street stall? Also, the floral cloth on the coffee table, the sofa that was filled with scratches, and even pot of chlorophytum placed next to the television was so similar to the one her best friend Guoguo was growing.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to eat!\u201d The man placed down the bowls and chopsticks, and then shouted out loud. Compared to the tone he used when he told her to raise her feet, it was basically filled with gentleness.</p><br/><p>When his voice fell, the door on the left creaked open. Walking out of it was a girl dressed in a panda pyjamas.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuoguo!\u201d Zhu Yao widened her eyes.</p><br/><p>The girl turned her head around and was stunned for a moment. \u201cYaoyao, when did you arrive? Why didn\u2019t you give me a call? Have you eaten breakfast yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen come over.\u201d She said as she pointed at the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Zhu Yao changed her shoes, washed her hands, and settled down on reflex.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! Something\u2019s off?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d Zhu Yao suddenly leapt up from shock. She pointed at the foreign-looking man who was sitting on the other side and nibbling on a bun. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her good friend Feng Guoguo calmly glanced at her, and then said. \u201cA passerby\u2026 who likes to court death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou casually brought a passerby into your house to clean and make food for you?\u201d And what\u2019s this about liking to court death? That\u2019s right. This place was the home of her good friend Guoguo in the modern era. It was the place where she settled down in after moving out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring him back here!\u201d Guoguo still had that stiffened expression on her face. \u201cHe followed me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuoguo, are you alright?\u201d Zhu Yao held her forehead. \u201cHe followed you here and you let him stay? What if he\u2019s a bad person? No, I\u2019m going to call the police.\u201d</p><br/><p>She picked up the cellphone that Guoguo placed on the table. Just as she was about to call 110, the cellphone suddenly made crackling noises as sparks flew out. The screen instantly turned black.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fourth one now.\u201d Guoguo suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What\u2019s with that \u2018fortunately, you\u2019re rich\u2019 expression on your face? The cellphone isn\u2019t the point here, hey!</p><br/><p>With nibbling buns as his main profession, and sneaking glances at Guoguo as his sub, the man who had been silent the entire time suddenly raised his head and glanced at Zhu Yao. His eyes were as cold as ice. Zhu Yao unconsciously began to tremble. She looked at the wrecked phone in her hand and instantly understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 the Plane Manager.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As he touched his face, he said with a stunned expression. \u201cCould there actually be a formation that automatically slims you down when enter the Netherworld!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlim down my ass. Look clearly, this isn\u2019t you at all, hey!\u201d With your fat figure, no matter how you slim down, you can\u2019t possibly slim down into a lightning bolt so quickly, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cNot me?\u201d Only then did Zi Dan understand the situation. He looked carefully at the person in the mirror. \u201cLittle martial aunt, you\u2019re saying that my soul has possessed this person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded.</p><br/><p>He frowned. \u201cBut why do I not sense any ripples of this person\u2019s soul at all? Could it be that he has already died?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d Zhu Yao patted his shoulders. \u201cBelieve me. Just a moment earlier, this person was still alive and well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer you right now.\u201d Zhu Yao sighed. \u201cEverything can only be explained tomorrow.\u201d Who could be certain that he would not return a night later, just like Bai Yuan? \u201cJust stay here for now. Once I have settled the things here, I will figure out a way to investigate your current situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Dan nodded.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao walk out. Before she left, she could not help but instruct him again. \u201cOh right, do not touch anything here unnecessarily. Some of them might be really dangerous mystic artifacts.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she returned to the meeting room. After giving all of her instructions in a hurry, she then brought Zi Dan back home.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the high-end technological genius was unable to figure out just what was going on either. Though, the energy attached to Zi Dan\u2019s body this time, was not the spiritual energy emitted by Bai Yuan, but ghostly energy.</p><br/><p>It seemed like Zi Dan\u2019s lifespan had indeed depleted, but was unable to reach the Netherworld because of some mistake while entering the Netherworld, and had instead arrived in the modern era.</p><br/><p>In his former life, Zi Dan\u2019s cultivation had already reached the Demigod stage, however, he failed his ascension. She then heard from him that Little Radish was already a Demigod as well, and her cultivation level seemed to be even higher than his. Zhu Yao was slightly able to feel at ease now.</p><br/><p>They chatted for an entire day.</p><br/><p>In the early morning of the second day, she heard a gasp the moment she woke up. \u201cThe hell, why am I here again?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Zi Dan had returned as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe door\u2019s over there. See yourself out!\u201d Zhu Yao pointed to the door.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian left through the door with a confused look. No matter how he racked his brains, he could not recall why he was here in his employee\u2019s apartment again. Could it be that he had a sleepwalking habit?</p><br/><p>He returned to the company with a confused look, only to strangely discover that every single staff seemed to be looking at him with strange eyes. He felt that things were amiss. It couldn\u2019t be that he had done something embarrassing while he was sleepwalking, right?</p><br/><p>He pondered for a few days, yet he could not recall anything concrete. He wondered if it was just his imagination, but their gazes seemed to be turning even weirder, and occasionally, there would be small chatters behind his back. This feeling of being the only one in the dark was simply too terrible. He was anxious to the point of grasping his heart and lungs. Finally, he could no longer endure it any longer, and called Zhu Yao to his office.</p><br/><p>Presently, it had been a week since he last woke up in Zhu Yao\u2019s apartment.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much? You simply hugged onto my thigh and called me martial aunt a few times.\u201d Zhu Yao nonchalantly explained. This was something the entire office saw, there was nothing she could do to cover it up.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d Yu Tian refuted without a second thought. Was he someone who lacked principles to such an extent? How could he possibly do something like hugging someone\u2019s thigh? Furthermore, he did not have the slightest of interest in flat-chested women, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! I have to trouble you not to verbalize your retorts.\u201d What do you mean by flat-chested? Your entire family is flat-chested, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d It slipped out of his tongue at the spur of a moment. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else, you can leave now.\u201d In any case, he would not believe her in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao curled her lips, turned around and left.</p><br/><p>Ever since then, Yu Tian would appear before her with different identities, once every week. Bai Yuan, Zi Dan, Little Radish, Sesame\u2026 Basically, anyone whom she knew of would appear. Every single time, they would appear for a day, and punctually disappear in the early morning of the second day. They were basically more punctual than aunties, and they came four times a month!</p><br/><p>With her boss being constantly possessed, Zhu Yao felt that his life would not go very well in the future.</p><br/><p>Even Yu Tian felt that something was amiss with him. Whenever he looked at her gaze, it would always be filled with various emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cOverseer Zhu\u2026\u201d Yu Tian felt that it was time to speak his heart out to his employee. \u201cDo you think that something is wrong with me recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart clenched. \u201cGeneral manager, what are you referring to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, in these few months, I have been unknowingly waking up on your apartment\u2019s sofa. Do you think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because your apartment\u2019s sofa is especially comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, what brand is it? Introduce it to me, can you? You can even directly sell it to me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>==!!</p><br/><p>Was the sofa the main point?</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, we can always discuss the price\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately walked out and slammed the door shut. She, who was worried that he had realized the truth, had truly been thinking too much.</p><br/><p>However, if he was going to continue being possessed like this, even if Yu Tian were to continue to stay oblivious, others would still be able to notice that something was amiss. Just what should she do?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can ask Realmspirit.\u201d Yu Yan suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince he was able to send you back here, then others are no exception.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying, this is Realmspirit\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered for a moment. Indeed, Realmspirit was the only one who possessed this ability. Flames of anger instantly surged. The hell, he was actually plotting against her behind her back. She charged into her room, and carried out the laptop that was stashed at the very bottom of a box.</p><br/><p>The moment she turned it on, before she could even connect to the internet, Realmspirit\u2019s QQ automatically popped out.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Dear friend, you have finally remembered me. Wuuu\u2026 If you were any later, I would have run out of battery!</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cEven you will run out of battery?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit: Of course, my dear friend! Hurry and plug me into an electrical outlet! Hurry! Save me!</p><br/><p>Three exclamation marks instantly appeared on the screen!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened, as she turned around and plugged the laptop into the electrical outlet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saved\u2026\u201d A familiar voice sounded from the laptop. \u201cPlease take good care of your electrical appliances, hey.\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re a virus which infiltrated a laptop, who are you to talk about taking care of electrical appliances?</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak. Bai Yuan, Zi Dan and the rest, what\u2019s going on with them? Why are they possessing my boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, I simply figured that you might be lonely. That is why I\u2019m pulling them over to chat with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChat with my sister! A normal, functioning human being is about to turn into a lunatic because of you, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d Realmspirit said without a mind. \u201cI chose him because he is someone with firm and strong willpower. He will not be defeated by such small matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he had a firm and strong willpower, he had to suffer being possessed? \u201cDon\u2019t fool around, hey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that young maiden doesn\u2019t wish to see them?\u201d Realmspirit asked in return.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung maiden, you must understand the pain I\u2019m going through for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. She had indeed been exhilarated from seeing people she knew. Everyone had his or her own selfish desires, and she was no exception.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d Yu Yan pulled her into his embrace, and only then did Zhu Yao regain her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirt, don\u2019t sneakily twist my way of thinking.\u201d She was this close to being drawn into his scheme. \u201cMy wish to see the people I\u2019m familiar with, and your actions of constantly having others to possess Yu Tian\u2019s body, are two separate matters. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m unaware of what you\u2019re doing. Aren\u2019t you simply trying to summon my unwillingness, and have me return?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit turned silent. After a while, he said with a solemn voice. \u201cYoung maiden\u2026 You\u2019re truly the only person who can help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly grew a little furious. \u201cRealmspirit, I don\u2019t owe you anything. Helping you is not my responsibility, nor is it an obligation of mine. Putting aside the fact that I have yet to decide if I\u2019m going to return, even if I do return, you can\u2019t force me either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already told you this once before. The bugs you made me fix, were all problems originating from the Heavenly Dao itself. The setting of ignoring and stepping on lives is the root of the problem that causes the birth of bugs. And right now, you\u2019re sending one person after another to possess Yu Tian\u2019s body. Did you ask for his own opinion on this? Is there any difference between what you\u2019re doing now and those bugs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m doing this to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re doing this to save the world. Does saving a world mean that you can ignore the lives of others in another world? What does Yu Tian have to do with your world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Realmspirt was silent for a moment, as if he was contemplating on her words. After a long while, he said with a low voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had always believed that he was different, so even if she had been trolled by him over and over again, she had never blamed him. After all, he was the only one who was aware that a problem existed in that world. People who introspect themselves have never been bad people. This time however, he had indeed gone overboard. Even if she could be said to have an obligation towards Realmspirit due to being his friend, who did Yu Tian offend then? Why must he be pulled into this mess? \u201cRealmspirit, you can think of saving your world, but you must first make sure that what you\u2019re doing is clear and right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand\u2026\u201d Realmspirit\u2019s voice turned soft, and he said with a heavy tone. \u201cThank you, Zhu Yao. You\u2019re right. That place over there is my world, and we should be the ones who are responsible for it, not you. I shouldn\u2019t use such methods on my friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s fury instantly sank by a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, there won\u2019t be any souls being sent here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will eliminate all the influences on this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding those people that were sent here, I will bring them all back as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yan too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn\u2026 What!?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned.</p><br/><p>A golden light suddenly flashed from the laptop, and her waist suddenly slackened. Her master who was still sitting next to her earlier, instantly disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, Realmspirit, what did you do to my master?\u201d She clasped onto the laptop and shook it about. \u201cReturn me my master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026 Wait a minute\u2026 Dizzy\u2026\u201d Realmspirit pleaded. \u201cYoung maiden, don\u2019t be agitated. Listen to my explanation, the laws of the world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her master was kidnapped, what else could be said about that!?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute\u2026 Young maiden, release that electrical cord. Don\u2019t pull it, we can always discuss things out!\u201d She actually wanted to stop his battery supply. That was too frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my master?\u201d Zhu Yao turned to glare at him. After all, her master did not possess anyone and had come to this world with his own body!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here, he\u2019s here!\u201d The display on the laptop screen changed, and a video interface appeared. The foot of the mountain was showed. Flowers bloomed and the willows flourished, and two familiar straw cottages could be seen as well. Her master, who was still dressed in modern attire, was standing in front of the cottages. This place\u2026 was the foot of the mountain situated at Lightning Divine Palace?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart felt empty. \u201cYou sent him back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no. I wasn\u2019t responsible for this.\u201d Realmspirit\u2019s conversation window wildly shook.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

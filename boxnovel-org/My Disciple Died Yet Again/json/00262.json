A black imprint instantly appeared on Yue Ying\u2019s body, carrying a soul devouring might. It grew large in an instant, and the black mystic patterns on it were like a sharp blades, as they pierced straight towards Wang Xuzhi\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle wimp!\u201d Zhu Yao fiercely widened her eyes, as if she had returned to that moment when Xiao Yi said Wang Xuzhi was already dead. Her heart instantly stopped, and as though it was out of reflex, she immediately activated a mystic art which she had left in little wimp\u2019s divine sense before this.</p><br/><p>At almost the same time, when the black mystic patterns were just about to penetrate into little wimp\u2019s skin, his figure blurred, and the person who was enveloped by darkness, had instantly turned into Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>The black devilish formation was struck on her body, and the pain that came from her bones and limbs was something she had never experienced before.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Yao\u2026\u201d Yue Ying was stunned right there and then.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d Yu Yan cried out of shock, and he immediately summoned his own sword intent. An enormous white dragon flew straight forward while carrying immense pressure. Yue Ying was defenseless for a moment, and was instantly struck a few meters away. Yu Yan held onto his heavily injured disciple, and even his hands were shaking uncontrollably. \u201cYu Yao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Various light particles suddenly appeared, as they slowly scattered out from within her body, and then, they disappeared without a trace. He inserted spiritual energy into her body, only to be scattered the moment it entered.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan grew even more anxious. The black formation Yue Ying used earlier was probably targeted on the soul. He had a premonition, that if his disciple were to leave this time, she</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Zhu Yao!\u201d Little wimp pulled onto her hand, and tears instantly poured out. Body Movement. When had she planted a mystic art like this in his own divine sense?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao felt that the corner of her lips was leaking out blood, and it felt like something was pulling her entire body, as if she was about to be torn apart alive. \u201cYue Ying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Yao\u2026\u201d Yue Ying was just standing three steps away, wearing a blank look, as if he was trying his hardest to deny something. \u201cWhy? Is he really that important to you?\u201d To the point where you would not hesitate to save him even if your soul scatters? Soul devouring. The mystic art he activated earlier could swallow one\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what did you to big sis Zhu Yao?\u201d Wang Xuzhi madly walked over to Yue Ying, grabbed his collar, and threw a fist at him.</p><br/><p>After being given a punch, he lightly moved his fingers and fixed Wang Xuzhi on the spot. Then, he suddenly laughed. \u201cSoul devouring\u2026 That\u2019s fine\u2026 That\u2019s fine as well! In the future, big sis\u2019s soul shall merge with mine, and we will never be apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wang Xuzhi was stunned, as the colour of despair emitted out from his eyes.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan hurriedly cast an art. Several mystic imprints flew out, restricting the flow of the black mystic symbols in her body and binding her unstable soul.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was no longer able to feel anything around her, as the sense organs in her entire body were enveloped in pain. After taking in a single breath, she shouted. \u201cYue Ying\u2026 Come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying was startled, and he obediently walked closer a moment later. He stopped next to her, but his eyes were ash-grey. \u201cThis is fine as well\u2026 Big sis can finally accompany Yue Ying forever.\u201d He wanted to express a happy look with all his might, but not the slightest of joy could be seen under his eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stiffened her hand. With all the strength remaining in her body, she raised it and swung it over.</p><br/><p>Pa. Giving him a resounding slap in the face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying\u2026 It\u2019s time for you to grow up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Yao\u2026\u201d He looked at her confused, and then, his eyes carried madness that he never once had before. \u201cDid you slap me because of Wang Xuzhi? As I thought, he\u2019s the only one in big sis\u2019s eyes. Even a mystic art like Body Movement which required the continuous consumption of your divine sense was left in his divine sense as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBody Movement, there\u2019s one\u2026 in your divine sense too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yue Ying was stunned, and he widened his eyes in disbelief. Instinctively, he reached out his hand to touch his own chest. As she had said, he could feel a strand of divine sense that did not belong to him, and also\u2026 it seemed to have been there for a very long time. It seemed to have been left there at a much earlier time than Wang Xuzhi\u2019s.</p><br/><p>His eyes instantly flashed with panic, as he looked at her in a fluster.</p><br/><p>Did she not\u2026 abandon me?</p><br/><p>With a sunken voice, and emphasis on every single word, she said. \u201cYou have never been alone. No matter if it\u2019s the past or present, you have never been. No one has abandoned you, the person who has truly abandoned you is yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis\u2026 I only have big sis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still remember Little Radish?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He was startled.</p><br/><p>Though she had saved Yue Ying, Little Radish was was the one who raised him up, taught him mystic arts, and taught him everything he knew. He said that he was abandoned the entire time, did not wish to be abandoned again, and did not want to be alone. However, where in his heart did he place Little Radish then? It was not that there wasn\u2019t anyone who treated him sincerely, but he was simply completely oblivious to them all. He trapped himself in the circle he drew, and even if others took the initiative to walk ninety-nine steps, he still would not be willing to take that one step.</p><br/><p>With the way he was, where he would only be willing to follow alongside her and would go crazy the moment he was separated from her, how different was he from a child who could not leave his parents\u2019 side?</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ying\u2026 Why can\u2019t you grow up?\u201d Zhu Yao said with a sunken tone. \u201cDon\u2019t just focus on yourself\u2026 Otherwise, I will never ever see you again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying was stunned, and finally, he could not help but reach out his hand to grab the corner of her robe. As if he was pleading, he said. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 Big sis Yao, I\u2019m at fault. I know my wrongs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s vision was already turning blurry, and this time, it was different from before. She felt a silence as if everything was returning to nothingness, and even the voices next to her began to sound illusive.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s face paled. The black mystic symbols on Zhu Yao\u2019s body were sinking deeper, and even the few mystic symbols used to stop them were being engulfed, as the black mystic symbols spread towards her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop the formation, now!\u201d He turned to glare at Yue Ying at the side.</p><br/><p>How, his face was completely blank, as he muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t stop it\u2026 It\u2019s basically impossible to stop this formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a flip of his palm, Yu Yan struck towards Yue Ying\u2019s chest, and a white dragon penetrated through Yue Ying\u2019s body. What he used was a killing move, and he did not hold back in the slightest. However, even if that was the case, he had merely cleansed a little of the devilish aura on Yue Ying\u2019s body, and had merely injured him heavily.</p><br/><p>He really wanted to take his life right at this moment, however, his disciple\u2019s condition was worsening, and had no choice but to gnash his teeth. He had tried all of the mystic arts that could be used. Mystic arts, divine arts, sealing arts, and he had even thought of extracting her soul and switching to another body in the future.</p><br/><p>However, they were basically ineffective. The light particles scattering out from his disciple grew. With each scattering particle, her soul would weaken by a certain extent. In the end, even the body he was hugging onto, was beginning to turn transparent.</p><br/><p>His eyes were crimson red, as a heart-wrenching pain exploded out from the depths of his heart. This was his disciple, his only disciple whom he had been holding onto with his hands. There were still many things he had yet to teach her, so how could she disappear just like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao, Yu Yao\u2026\u201d Wake up, don\u2019t disappear, give your master a response.</p><br/><p>The light emitted from her body grew even more, and just as the black imprints were about to gather at her chest.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the two Lights of Guidance, like searchlights, instantly turned and shot straight in Zhu Yao\u2019s direction. The constantly scattering light particles earlier began to madly pour back into Zhu Yao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>A string of red words surfaced.</p><br/><p>\u201cTarget has received damage that has gone beyond her resistible threshold, forced rollback initiates!\u201d</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, Zhu Yao\u2019s entire body released out a powerful purple radiance, spreading throughout the entire world. A rich voice, as if it had come from the Nine Heavens, resounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Yao, my friend, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment those words fell, that purple light suddenly retracted, and then, it disappeared along with the person who was enveloped within the purple light, as if that person had never existed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Yao, wake up, wake up!\u201d A plain, monotonous voice sounded next to her ears. Zhu Yao felt her shoulders being nudged by someone, and when she opened her eyes, she saw a familiar refreshing face.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuoguo?\u201d Zhu Yao sat up, but she felt an aching sensation all around her body. She could not help but suck in some air. \u201cAiyo, my back\u2026 Ouch ouch ouch ouch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were lying asleep on the table, how can it not hurt?\u201d Feng Guoguo sighed, as she passed her a cup of plain water. \u201cWhy are you hiding at my place again? What did the empress back at your home do to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe empress back at my home?\u201d Zhu Yao felt a little confused. Her mind was in a mess, and she had a slight migraine. After drinking the cup of water and calming down, she slowly remembered everything.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying, little wimp, master\u2026</p><br/><p>She suddenly stood right up, and looked around. \u201cWhy am I back here?\u201d This development was strange. Even if she had died, at the very most, she would switch to another avatar. Why did Realmspirit send her directly back here?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Guoguo looked at her with a slight puzzled look.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I was at Spiritual Realm in the first place, and I was about to ascend, in the end\u2026\u201d She blurted out.</p><br/><p>Guoguo however reached out her hand to touch her forehead, and said with a concerning tone. \u201cYou\u2019re not having a fever, right? I already told you to quit that dayless and nightless job of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. Was everything she experienced just a dream?</p><br/><p>She turned around to look at her own computer, only to see the game\u2019s event details which she had left half-completed, and her QQ interface was hanging at the corner of the screen. Just as she was about to search for Realmspirit\u2019s QQ ID to ask about this matter, she reached out her hand. \u201cWhere did my mouse and keyboard go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, stop working! Is there a need for you to be this desperate? If you had thrown them away, just buy new ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>No! Those were all real. She remembered when she first transmigrated, she was holding her mouse in her hands. It was not thrown away, but was instead brought to the cultivation world.</p><br/><p>Feng Guoguo\u2019s cellphone suddenly rang. \u201cHello? Oh hi, auntie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, it\u2019s me, Guoguo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m back from my trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Yao, is it? She\u2019s not here. She might have gone to work\u2026 Uh, she often works overtime on Saturdays.\u201d</p><br/><p>She turned to lookat Zhu Yao, and did a hush gesture. \u201cYour empress back at home is on the phone.\u201d I shall help cover for you.</p><br/><p>Before she could even finish, for the first time, Zhu Yao had instead snatched the phone from her hands. \u201cMom\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, yearning, sentiment, and grief overwhelming smashed into her, and her desire to meet the person on the other side of the phone grew. Her voice unconsciously began to choke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn brat, you\u2019re finally taking my call.\u201d A familiar voice sounded from the phone. \u201cI\u2019m warning you now. If you don\u2019t come back home soon, I will skin you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Tears began to flow from the depths of her heart. \u201cMom, I miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The person on the other side of the phone paused for a moment, as if she had found her reply a little unexpected. A moment later, she gently said. \u201cWhat is it? Did you get bullied at work? You\u2019re already a grown adult, yet you\u2019re still acting spoilt in front of your mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Nothing, I just miss you, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, nevermind. If you really don\u2019t want to go match-make, mom will not force you either. Come back home when you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, mn. I will come back immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao continued to chat with her for a short while, before hanging up the phone reluctantly. It had really been a long time since she last heard the voices of her family members.</p><br/><p>Guoguo looked at Zhu Yao a little strangely. \u201cYour mom is calling you back home for dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you not afraid of your empress back at home all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mom.\u201d The corner of her Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Those distant memories instantly returned to her mind, clearly and brightly. Her mom was a typical idle old woman. After retiring, whenever she had nothing to do, she would love to urge her sons and daughters about their marriages. However, her family did not seem to have any affinity for the opposite sex. Between her and her brother, she was twenty-eight, while he was at the independent age of thirty, yet both of them were still single. Zhu Yao could imagine the pile of handsome and talented youths that would be waiting for her when she gets back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s fine as long as you have thought it through. It\u2019s about time for you to find a partner too.\u201d Guoguo carried a concerned look, and said with a heavy heart. \u201cYou\u2019re not that young anymore. If you keep on staying here, it would be hard for me to find another tenant to share the place with!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d You\u2019re just trying to chase me out right, and it\u2019s not like this old lady isn\u2019t giving you rent! I made a wrong friend!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which\u2026 You\u2019re one year older than me yourself, right?\u201d What qualifications do you have to talk about me?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m different from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stepped forward. \u201cHow are we different?\u201d Other than our chest, what\u2019s different?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have money!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Poor-ass \u2013 Shot right in the heart!</p><br/><p>Speaking of Feng Guoguo, her entire life was like a legend. They had been classmates ever since they were in primary school, and had always been good girl friends. However, she was an orphan, and had to rely on government policies to study all the way to university. When she became an adult, she was then found by her parents\u2019\u2026 lawyer. Back then, her family members had already passed away several years ago, and nothing was left behind, except for money!</p><br/><p>From what she said, the number of zeroes on the bank account, could be counted to the point where her fingers would start to numb.</p><br/><p>This house which Zhu Yao was renting was hers!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had her own house as well, but it had only been renovated just recently, and required some time to air. Furthermore, because of her empress\u2019s intrusive matchmaking arrangements, she wanted to move out even more.</p><br/><p> \u201cNevermind, I\u2019m not going to compare wealth with you.\u201d She couldn\u2019t win anyway. \u201cOh right, why did you return so quickly? Didn\u2019t you say you were going to leave for half a month?\u201d She looked at the time on computer. It had only been a week, right?</p><br/><p>A strange emotion flashed past Guogo\u2019s face, as if she had recalled something incomprehensible. Suddenly, she mysteriously asked. \u201cYao Yao, do you believe there\u2019s mermaids in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled, as she reached out her hand to touch her forehead. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly have transmigrated as well, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She slapped away Zhu Yao\u2019s hand. \u201cYou sound as if you have transmigrated yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d But she did transmigrate though.</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind, it\u2019s best that you continue thinking about finding a hunk somewhere and bring him back home to give your empress back home an explanation.\u201d After saying that, she walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>The room instantly quietened down.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao collapsed on her bed. Like lanterns, the incidents in the other world flashed past her eyes, her heart would occasionally twist in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Would she be able to see him again?</p><br/><p>This couldn\u2019t do. She had to hurry and buy a mouse and keyboard, so she could ask Realmspirit clearly. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to be forced to break up with her first love, especially in such an unclear manner as well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

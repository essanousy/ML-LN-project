She merely told him all the things that she thought to be unreasonable, which she had seen and heard of. She could not guarantee that whatever she had said were true, but she simply felt that the world shouldn\u2019t just center around strong people, but also benevolent people. There was nothing wrong with the initial Heavenly Dao that guided living beings to the top. After all, without conflict, there wouldn\u2019t be improvements. If people did not have progressive mindsets, then the Three Realms will forever be stuck living in a prehistoric society. But during progression, people should not abandon their beliefs. As they say, \u2018when one drinks water, one must not forget its source\u2019. No matter how powerful a Deity one is, he or she was still once a human.</p><br/><p>\u201cRealmspirit, there\u2019s still something that I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Zhu Yao looked at Realmspirit and said. \u201cIf my guess is correct, that is the final bug, right? I understand why you wish to severe the seven emotions and six desires of those who become Gods.\u201d If Gods truly had the power to fight against the Heavenly Dao, then \u2018Gods\u2019 would truly be too dangerous. Furthermore, according to the principle of the strong eating the weak, among these people who had climbed to the very top, which one of them wasn\u2019t someone who would use all possible means to obtain his or her objective? With just the slightest birth of evil intentions, the Three Realms would be faced with countless tribulations beyond redemption.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 If you do not wish for them to become Gods right from the start, then why come up with the Lightning Divine Tower? By doing so, you\u2019re giving the Deities the opportunity to become Gods, and you\u2019re guiding them to cultivate into Gods.\u201d Her master\u2019s irregular behaviour earlier was because of the Heavenly Dao\u2019s control, wasn\u2019t it? The seal of \u2018infinity\u2019 symbols that she broke was actually a law of the Heavenly Dao. All of the Deities revered the Lightning Divine Tower so much, and even desperately wanted to enter it to become Gods. They would unhesitantly throw away their opportunities to hold onto their eternal life. Other than suggestions made by the Heavenly Dao, she really couldn\u2019t think of any other reason behind such behaviour.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit sighed. \u201cYaoyao, have you ever thought that actually, the Realm of Gods might have never existed in this world in the first place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Never existed!?\u201d Zhu Yao was shocked. \u201cThen the place I just saw was\u2026\u201d There was that barren place. She wasn\u2019t blind after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat place is simply a temporary dimension, that was opened to accommodate the people that had been unexpectedly purified of their seven emotions and six desires. Realmspirit seriously said. \u201cYaoyao, I told you before. I\u2019m the spirit of the Three Realms. Three realms, not four.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. Divine Realm, Human Realm, and Netherworld. From what he said, there was truly only three realms. If the Realm of Gods was included\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are you trying to say? Speak clearly, hey.\u201d Why was he making her even more confused now?</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, within the Three Realms, what do you think is the main cause that would result in the immediate collapse of the Three Realms?\u201d Realmspirit posed a serious question.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pondered for a moment, and she then suddenly widened her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s resentment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Realmspirit nodded. \u201cResentment is birthed from living beings, yet they cannot die along with living beings. It is undying, indestructible, and filled with malice. If it enters any one world, it can result in the collapse of that world. Before you helped me with finding a method to eliminate resentment, even the River of Forgetfulness had to suppress it beneath the river. If we wanted to exterminate resentment then, there\u2019s only a single way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLight of Purification!\u201d Zhu Yao continued.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit nodded. \u201cThe Light of Purification is the first strand of sunlight at the beginning of the world\u2019s creation. It is the purest thing in the world and can purify everything in this world, including the seven emotions and six desires. That\u2019s why I designed the Lightning Divine Tower and led the River of Forgetfulness into it. It\u2019s all in order to purify the ever-expanding resentment kept under the River of Forgetfulness and prevent it from entering the Three Realms. However, I am after all an existence formed by the will of the Three Realms. Since the Lightning Divine Tower is designed by me, the tower naturally contains the aura of the Heavenly Dao. Furthermore, all of the practitioners in the world cultivate in order to reach the Heavenly Dao. That\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people of the world then believed that the Lightning Divine Tower that you designed is actually the passageway to raising their level. That\u2019s why they entered the tower to seek a beating?\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded.</p><br/><p>The hell. In the end, it was all because those Deities were courting death on their own.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose souls who have their consciousness purified have no other places to return to, and because of the Light of Purification, they are unable to return to Netherworld through the River of Forgetfulness to reincarnate. That was why I opened up an accommodation, which is the Realm of Gods you saw back there. As long as they regain even the slightest bit of sentience, they will be able to follow along the River of Forgetfulness and reincarnate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What\u2019s drawing water with a sieve? This is! So there wasn\u2019t a Realm of Gods to begin with. A God\u2019s final resting place was simply reincarnation all over again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s with the previous Realm of Gods?\u201d She suddenly remembered about the God races. Those races which were met with such a tragic end.</p><br/><p>Realmspirit was silent for a moment, and then solemnly said. \u201cThey are survivors from the former world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFormer world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, this plane of ours has once met with destruction, and not just once\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d What did he mean by \u2018not just once\u2019? Wasn\u2019t the great war between Gods and Devils the only one? That was why the Human Realm was split into the Three Thousand Worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since the world\u2019s creation, this plane had always been in a cycle of rejuvenation and destruction.\u201d Realmspirit frowned, as if he had recalled something saddening. \u201cEvery ending was the same. Living beings would fight against each other, and then resentment would be birthed, which finally led to world collapses, and then its rejuvenation. This plane had been restructured in many, many different ways, and many different races had once existed in it. However, all of their endings were met with destruction, again and again, never-ending. Finally, this plane is no longer able to bear many more rejuvenations of such scale, and I appeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath, and then continued. \u201cBecause it does not wish such an ending to repeat, the world materialized a spirit and wanted to stop this entirety. However, I realized that even if I gain sentience, I was unable to walk out of this cycle. That world with the God races was the first world I experienced after I awakened. However, it was still destroyed. After the rejuvenation, I had the world split into Three Thousand Worlds, all in order to reduce the casualties to the very minimum. I believed that even if one collapses, I can still save it in time. However, resentment continued to accumulate, and I can already foresee the final ending. That\u2019s why I sought help in another plane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao was a little confused. \u201cYou mentioned that resentment causes world collapses, but back in the time where God races existed, there wasn\u2019t any resentment though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResentment is just a term used in this world.\u201d Realmspirit said. \u201cIn the previous world, it didn\u2019t use the same terminology.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned for a moment, and then her heart sank. \u201cDevillic energy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s head ached. In the end, devillic energy and resentment were one and the same? The only difference between them was that one of them was birthed in the former world, while the other was birthed in this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevillic energy was also the most fundamental reason behind that world\u2019s collapse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao frowned. \u201cIf devillic energy is just a remnant from the former world, then what\u2019s with those people who fall into Devilhood? Putting aside Yue Ying, what about Fa Yu? He clearly was a resident of this world, so was he still able to become a Devil?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, resentment is birthed from the feelings of unwillingness and hatred during a person\u2019s death. However, what if someone is able to give birth to this form of hatred before his death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying resentment comes after death, but one will fall into Devilhood when experiencing it before death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit nodded. \u201cThough, falling into Devilhood is better than giving birth to resentment. Because at the moment of death, what disperses is just devillic energy, and it will not give birth to resentment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut a Devil might cause even more innocent deaths, so the amount of resentment birthed would be much larger, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed! Especially after the change in the Heavenly Dao, if future practitioners need to hold onto their beliefs, then there will definitely be people who lose their beliefs as well. I\u2019m afraid that there will simply be even more people who fall into Devilhood, so there\u2019s a need for someone to constrain them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Constrain? Zhu Yao was startled. \u201cYou\u2019re saying Yue Ying!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy him? He\u2019s still a child. Furthermore, he doesn\u2019t have any relations with the other Devils\u2026\u201d Halfway through, she suddenly stopped. With widened eyes, she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s of the God race.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit nodded. \u201cHis existence is necessary. He\u2019s neither a God nor a Devil. He\u2019s a Devil God.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDevils are initially people who walk on another extreme path that\u2019s out of the Heavenly Dao\u2019s domain. They are the darkest side of living beings, a race that abandons their humanity.\u201d Realmspirit sighed and said. \u201cWithout the restraints of the Heavenly Dao, they might turn into an existence similar to \u2018resentment\u2019. That\u2019s why only a Devil can restrain a Devil, and Yue Ying is the only Devil God in the world. He is the only one who can control the Devils.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut a Devil God is still a Devil.\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd from what you\u2019re saying, the Devil race is a race that ignores the laws of the Heavenly Dao and walks on an extreme path, then a Devil God would be the same, right? How are you so certain that a Devil God will listen to the words of the Heavenly Dao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit smiled, and looked at her seriously. \u201cIsn\u2019t he already following the will of the Heavenly Dao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned, and then she immediately had an answer. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>He revealed an even cheaper smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, why am I being pulled into this again? I just wish to see him become a good child\u2026\u201d Uh, now that she thought about it, she was really the only one who could restrain Yue Ying\u2019s devillic nature. Even in front of her, other than that one time where he attempted to kill little wimp, he did not lose his sanity like other Devils and become slaughter machine.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao swept a glance at Realmspirit, and then stared at him intensely. \u201cThis can\u2019t possibly be your plan right from the start when you sent me to the God races, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit stiffened, and then let out a silly laugh. \u201cAiyaya, young maiden, don\u2019t be that way. I just wanted you to show your face around, I never expected that you would really be able to do it. You\u2019re awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Zhu Yao threw a kick at him. \u201cHurry and speak. What other things were your schemes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung maiden\u2026\u201d He showed a crying face. \u201cHow can you call them schemes? Aren\u2019t they just friendly support between friends? I simply foretold the endings a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao grabbed onto his cheeks and strongly pulled them to the sides. \u201cStop changing the topic. Hurry and talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts, it hurts, it hurts\u2026 Young maiden, this is your face, you know. How can you do such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, I\u2019m not the one hurting anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She made so much sense he actually had nothing to refute with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, only one.\u201d He weakly stretched out a finger. \u201cIt\u2019s related to the aftermath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAftermath?\u201d Zhu Yao released her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, just as you\u2019ve said. There has already been changes to the Heavenly Dao. Only those who doesn\u2019t lose their beliefs will be able to open the Door of Ascension, but\u2026 \u201c He rubbed his cheeks. \u201cWhat are we going to do about those people who are still in the Divine Realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Indeed. The Divine Realm now was filled with Deities who slaughtered their way up here.</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning Divine Tower has been destroyed now, and the Light of Purification has been withdrawn. These Deities can no longer cultivate into Gods, so will they truly stay in the Divine Realm peacefully?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Naturally, they wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t throw them all into the reincarnation wheel for reconstruction, so I can only provide constraints.\u201d</p><br/><p>Constraints again!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao paused for a moment. As though she had thought of something, she immediately exploded. \u201cGreedy beast, what else are you trying to do to my master?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

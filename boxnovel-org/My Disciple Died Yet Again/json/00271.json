The ones next to him are number two, number three, and number four.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Zhu Yao sternly inspected that pea, and simply could not see any differences at all. \u201cI see that he looks like a sleek round jade-coloured pearl, while exuding overflowing spirit. Why don\u2019t I name him\u2026 Little Pea then!\u201d </p><br/><p>Little Qian: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire room was silent for a minute.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand\u2026 Grand Qian, what about the ones next to him?\u201d The peapod mom asked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao swept her eyes at the peapod, and pointed at the peas one at a time. \u201cLittle Pea\u2026 Big Pea\u2026 Gigantic Pea\u2026 Extraordinary Pea!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d The corner of Little Qian\u2019s lips twitched. Just as she was about to speak up\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d The peapod dad excitedly slapped his thighs. \u201cAs expected of Grand Qian, the eldest dandelion in a hundred miles. Many thanks to Grand Qian for bestowing our children these names.\u201d</p><br/><p>The peapod mom looked as if she was about to cry from excitement as well. \u201cThank you Grand Qian, for bestowing such good-sounding names to our children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHohoho\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao patted on their shoulders. \u201cYou two have good eyes. There\u2019s not many people who can match my taste in this world!\u201d As expected, there were still people who understood her taste in this world. She had to tell her master about this when she gets back. </p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Pea, Big Pea, Gigantic Pea, Extraordinary Pea, hurry and thank Grand Qian for the bestowal of your names.\u201d The peapod mom faced the peapod and said.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, white light glowed from the pea pod. Four green streams of light shot out from within and neatly landed next to Zhu Yao. In a blink of an eye, four white, tender and chubby little boys popped out naked. They stood right in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Grand Qian, for aiding us in breaking from our shells.\u201d Four similar-looking children raised their heads up as they expressed their thanks to Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery obedient!\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hands at them.</p><br/><p>Only then did the children pounced towards their own father and mother. The six of them looked as if they were celebrating the new year, exuding out immense joy.</p><br/><p>The peapod dad and mom once again expressed their thanks to Zhu Yao. \u201cMany thanks, Grand Qian. If not for you, we would still be wondering just when our children would break out from their shells.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, it\u2019s something that should be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them expressed countless more thanks, before bringing the four children back home.</p><br/><p>She glanced at the family who understood her tastes, and suddenly, a question rose in her mind. \u201cLittle Qian, a pea can only break out of its shell after receiving a name?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded. \u201cNot just the peapod, all demons need to have a name to materialize into a human form.\u201d</p><br/><p>So a name was used to materialize a human form.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly demons who have lived over a thousand years have the ability to bestow names. The peapod husband and wife was really happy because grandma was able to bestow four names at one go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Was giving a name that hard? Lowering her head, she looked at the pod which was flattened due to the children breaking out of their shells, and observed that a green light was faintly flashing from within. She tugged open the pod, and retrieved a fist-sized pea that was located at the furthest right.</p><br/><p>Was this\u2026 missed out?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dis seed.\u201d Little Qian glanced at the pea in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Qian explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a seed discarded by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDiscarded?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, the peapod clan is different from ours. Within every peapod, there would always be a dis seed that\u2019s used as nourishment for the other peas, to enable the other children to grow. A dis seed only has a physical form, but not a soul. This one is a dis seed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. There was such a rule as well. \u201cThen is this pea still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA dis seed isn\u2019t living.\u201d Little Qian affirmed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. However, she clearly sensed life energy within this pea though. Was it just her imagination?</p><br/><p>In the end, Zhu Yao still kept that pea, and casually placed it in the wood spiritual energy gathering formation. What if it ended up growing up?</p><br/><p>After making the preparations, Zhu Yao began to meditate and cultivate. Though she was unaware of what bug she was supposed to fix this time, with her present cultivation level, even if she encountered a bug, she would most likely be suppressed. Raising her cultivation was her path to victory.</p><br/><p>Her master was presently not by her side, and this place did not seem to be the Divine Realm either. Only by raising her cultivation level could she hope to look for her man.</p><br/><p>For some reason, though the plants and trees in her present location could become demons, the spiritual energy was very scarce. This was especially so for wood spiritual energy. Even after placing down a spiritual energy gathering formation, the wood spiritual energy gathered was still really limited.</p><br/><p>Just by raising to the first level of Essence took an entire night of meditation. Three days had passed, yet the spiritual energy gathered was barely enough to push her to the second level of Essence. Zhu Yao who had never experienced such difficulties in cultivation, encountered her first wall.</p><br/><p>It seemed like she had to be more ruthless now.</p><br/><p>After reinforcing the spiritual energy gathering formation in the surroundings, she greeted the Qians, and went into closed-door training.</p><br/><p>In order to draw in more spiritual energy, she made use of her old method of revolving the spiritual energy in her Dantian, spiraling them in a single direction, so that the inertial oscillation could bring in even more spiritual energy. As expected, this method was much better than waiting blindly for spiritual energy to be drawn in by themselves, and the spiritual energy in her body began to fill up.</p><br/><p>Time flowed.</p><br/><p>The amount of spiritual energy grew, and her cultivation rose correspondingly as well. Third level, fourth level, fifth level\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPea~\u201d An heavy impact suddenly struck her chest. As Zhu Yao was not in a stabilized state, her old bones were this close to being shattered. When she opened her eyes, she saw a green ball tightly leaning on her chest.</p><br/><p>The hell, which bastard threw a ball at her while she was in a meditative state!? Do you know that you have to respect your elders and love the young!?</p><br/><p>\u201cPea\u2026\u201d The green ball suddenly moved, leaking out a clear single-syllable sound.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was shocked and had almost thrown the ball away. After taking a closer look, she found it a little familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cPea~\u201d It let out a sound again.</p><br/><p>Pea? Zhu Yao was stunned. Only then did she recall about the pea that she placed in the spiritual energy gathering formation. She turned around to take a look, and as expected, it had disappeared.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be, right? She had merely meditated for a short while, yet it had grown so huge? That\u2019s way too much nourishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cPea\u2026\u201d That gigantic pea lightly called out again. It looked far larger than the four peas that were in the peapod previously.</p><br/><p>What should she do now?</p><br/><p>Oh right, a name. It could only materialize a human form after receiving a name.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, I say, little green pea. You shall be called Peapea from now on, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPea!\u201d The pea responded determinedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeapea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Nothing happened.</p><br/><p>The hell, what happened to the promise of materializing after receiving a name? Could it be that she was in the wrong state for bestowing a name? Let\u2019s try again.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeapod?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTofu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPeasy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, no reaction at all. Even though it was born in the same peapod, why was it unable to materialize a human form?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao picked up the green pea ball and scanned it with her eyes. Other than being a little fatter, there was no difference at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cPea~\u201d It called out again, before rolling into her embrace. As though it was fatigued, it stopped completely after a short while. Slowly, it reverted to its former fist-size state.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao faintly sensed that something was amiss. However, her present cultivation was too weak and had yet to cultivate a divine sense, so she was basically unable to inspect the pea\u2019s situation. She could only put the matter aside for now, as she kept the pea. Just as she was about to inspect the formation before continuing with her cultivation, she heard a few cries outside, followed by faint, flustered footsteps.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She opened the door, and was faced with Little Nthqian running over. They looked so similar it was hard to distinguish them from each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, the Heavenly Fire, the Heavenly Fire has come!\u201d The girl pointed at the sky with a flustered look.</p><br/><p>Zhu yao raised her head, only to see a sky of fiery light. A red formation was presently revolving in the sky, and with every passing second, that fiery light grew brighter.</p><br/><p>Flame Guiding Formation!</p><br/><p>An elementary-level fire type art.</p><br/><p>The formation was not huge, but it was pointing straight at her home!</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, hurry and leave this place. The Heavenly Fire is about to set this place ablaze.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, in the next moment, the fiery light descended from the skies, charging straight towards her home.</p><br/><p>The hell. It couldn\u2019t be! Her property! Her wealth!</p><br/><p>Startled, Zhu Yao cast an art, and a formation materialized the next moment. A triangular formation enveloped the top of the building in the instant the fiery light was about to reach. She no longer had any face, so she couldn\u2019t let her property disappear either.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? There\u2019s actually a demon who knows mystic arts.\u201d A tender voice rang out from the skies.</p><br/><p>An exquisitely dressed child was presently standing atop a feather-shaped mystic tool, as he stared at her curiously. His hands which were used to cast an art earlier had yet to be placed down.</p><br/><p>She understood where the Flame Guiding Formation had come from now. It was by this unbearable child!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what demon are you?\u201d The unbearable child pointed at her, and said with a cocky look.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. This little wimp looked like he was merely seven or eight years old. At such a young age, he actually dared to set the forest on fire. He sure was unbearable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never seen a demon who knows mystic arts before. Tell me your name, and I shall take you in as my pet!\u201d The little wimp rubbed his nose, and said with an esteemed tone. </p><br/><p>Who wants to be your pet!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took in a deep breath, suppressing the fury in the depths of her heart. \u201cLittle one, burning someone else\u2019s house is wrong. Hurry and go back home.\u201d Watch out, otherwise I will smack your buttocks.</p><br/><p>The child descended from the sky, and sternly said. \u201cBe my pet, and I will go home! Though you\u2019re a little old\u2026 No, you\u2019re really old. As long as you\u2019re able to run decently, I won\u2019t despise you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. How on earth could there exist such a child that deserved to be spanked?</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho\u2026 I\u2019m not going to be your pet.\u201d Demons have their own pride as well!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not feel like arguing him. This child was at the fifth level of Essence as well. That Flame Guiding Formation took up considerable amount of his spiritual energy earlier, so she was not worried that he would throw it again.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, wait a minute! I\u2019m serious.\u201d The little wimp was anxious as well, as he chased after her.</p><br/><p>Little Nthqian seemed to be extremely afraid of him as well, as she leaned closer to her in fright. \u201cGrandma.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re called Grandma!\u201d The little wimp showed a joyful look. \u201cI know now.\u201d</p><br/><p>What do you know? Zhu Yao turned around, only to see that he had already begun to cast an art. A formation instantly materialized, and in the center of the formation, a summoning contract inscription could be faintly seen. She had seen such an inscription once. It was during the time when her master made Sesame sign the contract with her.</p><br/><p>The hell, this little wimp was truly wanting her to become his summoned beast. No, a summoned demon!</p><br/><p>This was simply unbearable!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

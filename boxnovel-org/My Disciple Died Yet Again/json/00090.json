This lady here has laid her sights on you, and you will be mine in the future. If you dare to have other girls touch you, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re my master, this lady here will castrate you all the same!\u201d</p><br/><p>Probably because she was speaking in a very serious tone, Yu Yan was slightly stunned. His blurry eyes instantly cleared up by quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Staring at his disciple who was still lying on his body unmoving, a moment later, he thought of a possibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 want to form a practitioner-pair with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else do I want otherwise?\u201d Zhu Yao once again smooched, leaving another mark on him. \u201cHave a discussion about the importance of the development of human reproduction?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu Yan did not reply, however, his face suddenly began to heat up out of nowhere. Unclear feelings began to surge up haphazardly from the depths of his heart. Happiness? Joy? Or was it excitement? He was unable to discern them, and he simply felt as though his face was glowing hot.</p><br/><p>However, to form a practitioner-pair with his disciple, did not seem\u2026 to be a very unacceptable idea.</p><br/><p>However, Zhu Yao was dumbfounded by his current look. Why was her master\u2019s face red? And it was even turning redder, as though he was about to burn up! He couldn\u2019t still be an innocent virgin, right?</p><br/><p>Master, say something. Don\u2019t just make your face red.</p><br/><p>If your face stays as red as that, as you look at me with eyes filled with expectations, I basically won\u2019t be able to resist thinking of you every minute and every second, you know!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt her wolf\u2019s blood boiling. Her hands moved, she could no longer contain her morals, as she began to take advantage of his stark naked chest. You forced me!</p><br/><p>Just when she about to begin eating, a certain master seemed to have suddenly reacted. With a light push, Zhu Yao was pushed down the bed.</p><br/><p>In an instant, Yu Yan had already tidied up his clothes, and stood up.</p><br/><p>However, he still did not cast his gaze at her, there were still some red blushes that had yet to fade from his face, and he strived to maintain a stern expression as he spoke. \u201cStop this nonsense. How can such things be decided so easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rubbed her buttocks which was hurting from the fall, and when she crawled up, he had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>She shivered from the cold wind which blew in from the open door.</p><br/><p>She suddenly had the impulse to flip a table. Momma\u2019s egg! This lady here has already taken off her pants, and you tell me this!?</p><br/><p>Ever since Zhu Yao acted that tyrant role, her Consort Yu\u00b9 had never returned to Jade Forest Mountain. She flipped over the entire Jade Forest Mountain, yet, she was still unable to see his figure at all.</p><br/><p>Was he angry? Was he freaked out? Or could it be that he did not have any feelings for her at all, so he ran?</p><br/><p>The more Zhu Yao thought about it, the less she figured out. Clearly, the atmosphere they had between them on that day was pretty good. Although he ran away in the end, she could not believe that her master had no feelings for her at all. However, even though she searched the entire Jade Forest Mountain, she could not see his figure at all. And there were many newly placed formations in Jade Forest Mountain, as though they were placed to completely isolate the mountain itself. Even though her cultivation had already been completely restored, as someone who had never researched on formations at all, she was unable to leave this Jade Forest Mountain, and thus, could do nothing but wait.</p><br/><p>After waiting at the mountain peak for ten days, her master, who had ran away from home, finally returned. Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone, and instantly leapt down from the roof of the house.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan however, slightly shifted his body, and pulled out a small little child from behind him, and this child was even damn familiar. She was exactly the little pudding she saw half a year ago, who claimed she was her own junior-martial sister.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s legs froze, and at that moment, she felt something stifling had stuffed the depths of her heart.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan however, held onto that child, and walked towards her with big strides. Stopping two feet before her, with a gentle expression, he said. \u201cYu\u2026 Yao. Your master shall introduce someone to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pulled the little girl forward, and the child looked at her sheepishly.</p><br/><p>This was the first time she had ever seen her master adopt such a gentle expression, and he had even remembered half of her name, which was rarely seen. Yet, it was because of this disciple beside him. Her heart cramped, and in an instant, she felt like crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at that child. \u201cBao Bao, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d The little girl\u2019s eyes shone, and she looked at Zhu Yao excitedly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao lightly raised her lips, and smiled. However, she then raised her head and looked straight at Yu Yan. Was this his way of rejecting her? Because he now had a new disciple? But\u2026 She still wanted a clarification. \u201cMaster, tell me honestly. Do you like me or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression stiffened, and then, he hurriedly shifted his gaze. \u201cAhem\u2026 Stop with the nonsense. Finish hearing what I want to say. This child is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe new disciple you took in, right?\u201d Zhu Yao once again interrupted his words. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan looked at her a little strangely.</p><br/><p>Yet, Zhu Yao looked at him even more seriously, and continued with her questions. \u201cSo, do you like me or not?\u201d Momma\u2019s egg, give me a straight answer.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu Yan was once again speechless due to her straightforward words. After a moment of silence, he acted as though he was angry, and said. \u201cStop fooling around!\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re fooling around, your entire family\u2019s fooling around.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan coughed twice, and finally managed to gather back his calm. \u201cSince you two already know each other, then, bring her around to have her familiarize herself with the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao suddenly felt a chill in her heart, and she seemed to now understand why her girl friend would always like to call her in the middle of the night after a break-up. Because she really wished to make a call now as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on, she\u2019s the one!\u201d Yu Yan nudged the child beside him.</p><br/><p>The little girl instantly gave a flowery smile, and charged towards Zhu Yao. Hugging onto her leg, she shouted out loud. \u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was pushed two steps back by this little twerp\u2019s charge, and she suddenly widened her eyes, as she looked at this little girl with a face of disbelief. \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, master, master!\u201d The little girl excitedly called her three times. As though she was still not satisfied, she even rubbed her face against Zhu Yao\u2019s leg with all her might. \u201cI have waited for a very long time. Master, you\u2019re finally back. I finally get to see master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute\u2026 Chotto matte!\u201d I\u2019m lacking in brain juice, let me first recharge them. \u201cWho did you call master? Who is your master again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl was startled. Her face which was still like a little sun earlier, instantly turned cloudy with a small rain shower. \u201cMaster\u2026 Master, don\u2019t you want me anymore? Bwaaaa\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t cry!\u201d As she had thought, children were definitely her life\u2019s nemesis. Zhu Yao squatted down, and with clumsy hands, she began to console her. However, the little girl was like a bull, as she stuffed her head into Zhu Yao\u2019s embrace, and began to cry harder.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao could only silently seek help from Yu Yan beside her. Just what the hell was happening? Wasn\u2019t she her junior-martial sister? How did she become her disciple?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan gave a calm look, as though he had nothing to do with it. \u201cI have already handed you the person herself. You shall handle the arrangements for her yourself, however, she\u2019s still not allowed into the mountain for a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what was he going on about? Zhu Yao gave an inexplicable expression. \u201cJust who is she? I don\u2019t even know anything about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan gave her a contemptful glare. Earlier, didn\u2019t you say you knew?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Alright, I was courting death. Master, please tell me.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan glanced at that crying creature, who was said to be his grand-disciple, and was evidently getting a little impatient. He never had patience for anyone else, and that included his grand-disciple as well. \u201cBack then, didn\u2019t you suggest to take her as your disciple in front of Zi Mo? In the days\u2026 you weren\u2019t here, your master have already helped you make the arrangements, and have her enter the Jade Forest Mountain when she\u2019s five years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Mo? Disciple? Zhu Yao desperately searched through the memories in her mind. She seemed to have told Zi Mo about this matter, but the person she wanted to take in back then was\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pulled the little girl away, and only then did she seriously inspect that small little face of hers. After a closer look, she realized there really were the faint letters, \u201cBUG\u201d, on her face. \u201cShe\u2019s Zi Mo\u2019s daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, how did she grow so big in a blink of an eye? But why did the letters on her face become lighter instead?</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Yu Yan frowned. \u201cIn these recent years, she have been slipping into the Jade Forest Mountain several times to find you. So I got her to see you today, to save the trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d So the master she spoke about that day, was her. Because she had never seen her own master, so she decided to climb up in the middle of the night to see her in secret?</p><br/><p>Stroking the soft little dumpling who was in her embrace, her heart instantly softened to the point of turning silly. So cute! Gently helping to wipe her eyes dry, she persuaded with a gentle voice. \u201cBe a good girl, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, will you not want me?\u201d The little dumpling was fearful.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d At that moment, Zhu Yao felt her earlier frustrated self was simply stupid, as she kissed her cheeks. \u201cBao Bao is so cute, master can\u2019t wait to spoil you, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she coaxed her with a few more words, and then, kissed her a couple more times. Only then was she finally able to console her disciple\u2019s little injured heart, and she no longer cried. Zhu Yao still wanted to continue coaxing her, however, standing at the side, Yu Yan\u2019s expression turned dark, as rage began to surge out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>He coldly spoke up. \u201cSince you have met her already, then head down the mountain! Remember my words, you\u2019re not allowed to climb up the mountain on your own for a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little disciple fearfully glanced at her own grandmaster, looked at her own master with reluctant eyes, before she finally turned around and walked down the mountain step by step. Before she left, she did not forget to turn her head and loudly shout things like \u2018master, you must definitely remember me!\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart softened from hearing these words. It really was great to have such a good and obedient disciple. She silently decided that, even if the little dumpling was a BUG, she would definitely save her completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things\u2026 you spoke of the other day.\u201d Only when he sensed that the little girl had already left Jade Forest Mountain, did Yu Yan finally hesitantly speak up.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled, as she turned her head over. The other day? The day when she was a tyrant?</p><br/><p>Seeing that serious expression of his, Zhu Yao could not help but feel a little anxious.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan however, had calmed down. Even the red blushes on his face that Zhu Yao forced out earlier with her daring words, had faded quite a bit. Taking a step forward, he said with a stern expression. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m unable to promise you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Momma\u2019s egg, after such a long time, you still want to reject me? At that moment, Zhu Yao was a little upset.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan, however, raised his head and looked towards the sky. As though he had decided on something, he took a deep breath, and slowly spoke. \u201cThe initial reason why I wanted to take in a disciple, is to simply pass down the Arts of my Jade Forest Mountain. And when you were successful with forming your Azoth Core, and could fend for yourself, it was supposed to be my time to ascend. However, I never thought that\u2026\u201d He never thought that his disciple would be so worrisome, and that he would be unable to put her down.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan took two steps forward, looked straight into his disciple\u2019s eyes, which were evidently showing a hint of sadness, and habitually reached out his hand to stroke her head. \u201cThere\u2019s too many strange things surrounding your body, I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m unable to find out the cause in just a short notice, and I feel powerless because of that. So\u2026 I have decided to ascend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanii!!??</p><br/><p>\u00b9https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consort_Yu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As if they had formed the shape of a tree?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two little ones shook their heads. \u201cGrandma, this place is completely dark, and we can\u2019t even completely discern anything in our lines of sight. Earlier, we had only managed to recognize you because you called out. Along the way here, we did not see any red light at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Then what did she see earlier? Were her eyes blurred?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao faintly sensed that something was amiss. No matter was it the strange formations from earlier, or the red lights.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head out for now!\u201d No matter what they were, they could be settled after leaving the floating mountain.</p><br/><p>She instantly brought the two back the way she came. She did not take long to come here, as long as she take a turn here and enter this pathway\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell, where\u2019s the pathway?</p><br/><p>Earlier, she had clearly come from this direction, yet all she could see now was a stone wall. There wasn\u2019t any pathway at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny?\u201d Ye Qingcang voiced out, puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHell!\u201d Zhu Yao really wanted to curse out. \u201cWe have been trapped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her master had mentioned that there were many unknown formations here. Now that she thought about it, there was a great chance that they had fallen into a formation the moment they entered the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, what do we do now?\u201d Little tyrant frowned, a hint of worry surfaced on his face.</p><br/><p>They could only take it a step at a time now. \u201cYou guys establish your defensive barriers, and follow behind me. Be extremely cautious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two little ones nodded. They summoned their flying swords and cautiously followed behind her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked around, and suddenly discovered that beneath her feet, the red strands of light from earlier had appeared once again, and they were stretching straight in a single direction.</p><br/><p>Were they\u2026 giving her directions?</p><br/><p>She pondered for a moment. She then cast a fire-type art, brightening up the surroundings a little as she carefully walked along the guided path. Right now, they had no choice but to take a look.</p><br/><p>The further they went in, the more spacious the surroundings grew, and sounds of water dripping could be heard. That unbearable stench in the air had dissipated quite a bit, and she caught a faint whiff of the scent of floras. For some reason, an uneasy feeling instantly surged from the depths of her heart.</p><br/><p>This scent\u2026 She seemed to know this scent from somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao, stop!\u201d Her master\u2019s voice suddenly resounded from the depths of her heart.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned as she immediately stopped her feet.</p><br/><p>A few meters away from her, a large amount of purple flames suddenly began burning out of nowhere, and even the mountain rocks next to her were beginning to melt.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma!\u201d Little tyrant grabbed hold of her hand, and immediately pulled her a few steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d The three of them were all dumbfounded. They had never seen flames of such colour.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s even weirder was, they were actually unable to sense even the slightest bit of the searing heat.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s mind was in a mess, a thought seemed to be flashing within it. She felt as if she was about to recall something, but she just could not grab hold of it.</p><br/><p>The purple flames burned for exactly an hour, and then, as if it had not appeared before, disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>A bloody red mark suddenly surfaced on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does this diagram look so much like a bird?\u201d Little tyrant voiced out.</p><br/><p>Ye Qingcang continued. \u201cIt seems\u2026 to be a Phoenix.\u201d</p><br/><p>Phoenix! Zhu Yao was startled. She took a step forward and carefully inspected the mark. It was as if a bell had rung in her mind.</p><br/><p>Blood formation, strange scent, red strands that others could not see, purple flames. Instantly, everything connected together.</p><br/><p>Extending out her legs, she printed to the very front.</p><br/><p>The hell, why did she forget about this? Shao Bai had clearly taught her this.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma?\u201d Little tyrant and Ye Qingcang exchanged glances, before giving chase right after.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao headed straight in the direction of the red strands, furthermore, she had even used mystic arts, wildly sprinting forward. When she arrived at the end of the red strands, on a gigantic stone wall, what she saw was a gigantic diagram of a phoenix formed by these red strands.</p><br/><p>She blanked a little from seeing this diagram. Divine Charm!</p><br/><p>An art of attraction unique to Phoenixes. With their souls as guides, they provide directions. Only people whom the caster wished to see could see them.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that formation earlier had such impressive power. It was no wonder though there were so few teleportation formations, an endless amount of demonic beasts could be transferred in. It was no wonder no matter how high ranked the beasties were, they could not resist against the formations.</p><br/><p>Those were blood formations. Formations established with the use of blood from a God race.</p><br/><p>And that God race\u2026</p><br/><p>She hoped that her guess was wrong.</p><br/><p>A hoarse voice suddenly resounded from the back of the stone wall. \u201cUnder the Heavenly Dao, no one can resist it. Even the God races are no exception\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank, as she immediately summoned her sword intent and charged into the stone wall.</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, the wall with the diagram of the Phoenix collapsed, revealing a dark space.</p><br/><p>After clearly looking at the man standing amidst the shattered rocks, Zhu Yao felt as if she was smashed head-on by an iron basin falling from the air.</p><br/><p>The hell, it really was him!</p><br/><p>\u201cPhoenix with a lightning attribute, Seventh\u2026\u201d Excitement flashed across that man\u2019s face. When he turned to look at the entrance of the hole, he was startled for a moment, and then his face instantly drooped. \u201cWhy is she so old? Who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old\u2026</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. She clenched her fists, the thoughts of beating him into a pulp surfaced in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little tyrant and Ye Qingcang caught up at this moment. Seeing Little Eighth within, they were startled for a moment, subconsciously clenching onto the swords in their hands. Zhu Yao waved her hands at the two of them, hinting them not to worry.</p><br/><p>She took a step forward, and sighed. \u201cLittle Eighth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. This was the youngest Phoenix in her family back then, who was tamed with just a single melon seed \u2013 Little Eighth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh\u2026 Seventh elder sister?\u201d His face was filled with disbelief, as he stared blankly at her old face. Tears seemed to be welling in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s really you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but feel a little moved. How long had it been? She never expected that he could see him once again. Just as she was about to step forward and give him a hug filled with warmth and love\u2026</p><br/><p>He suddenly said. \u201cHow did you become so ugly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Can you make conversation? What do you mean by becoming ugly? I have merely gained a few life experiences.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really my seventh elder sister?\u201d Little Eighth circled around her, his face was filled with worry. \u201cWhat to do? You were already extremely ugly without a tail, now you have turned into this. I wonder if you have turned so ugly to the point it\u2019s beyond the realm of Phoenixes, and had ascended to the realm of mortals?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Zhu Yao threw a kick, yet he simply dodged to the side, instantly stepping a few feet apart. His smile was filled with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister, your personality is still the same as ever. Even though you\u2019re ugly, you don\u2019t allow others to mention about it, geez!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d May I ask if my cultivation will drop if I beat this stupid little brother into a pulp?</p><br/><p>He retracted his smile, and then sized her up for a moment. The light in his eyes however dimmed little by little, and an unclear emotion surfaced. Then, he lightly called out again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d If you say one more word about my age, I\u2019m going to beat you!</p><br/><p>However, he suddenly gave her a brilliant smile, his eyebrows gently curving. \u201cGreat. To be able to see seventh elder sister one last time. Little Eighth is really happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart skipped a beat, faintly sensing that something was off with his expression. She took a step forward, wanting to reach out her hand to grab him. \u201cLittle Eighth, why are you being so strange? And why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he suddenly retreated, avoiding her hand. He said with slight resentment. \u201cSeventh elder sister, I\u2019m serious. Though you have always bullied me since young, I really missed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Eighth\u2026\u201d She frowned. For some reasons, hearing him sound so lovely made her worry in the depths of her heart. She had a bad premonition. \u201cJust what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was startled for a moment. With a sunken expression, he said with an extremely forced smile. \u201cSeventh elder sister, I\u2026 seemed to have\u2026 thrown the face of the Phoenix clan.\u201d Though he was smiling, his tears suddenly began to fall, and they streamed down faster as time went by. The little Phoenix who was once extremely prideful and had always scorned her, was actually in tears right in front of her. His face was filled with grievances. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have believed the words of mortals. That human practitioner tricked me, and had me use my soul to create this dimensional space, imprisoning me here forever. He even wants to take my inner core.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her heart trembled. Imprison! He was imprisoned here as well?</p><br/><p>She suddenly thought about that cultivation wacko. Could it be him?</p><br/><p>Initially, she had thought that he was a pure maniac, just like those perverted scientists in the many movies she had watched, where they would unhesitantly kill so many beasties to create chimeras. She never expected that not only did he kill so many demonic beasts, he had even laid his hands on a God race!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Eighth, how\u2019s your body?\u201d She anxiously stepped forward.</p><br/><p>Little Eighth still continued to avoid her. \u201cI was actually imprisoned by a human practitioner. Seventh elder sister, are you going laugh at me\u2026 for not being a good Phoenix?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Eighth\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s heart tensed. She had never seen him carry such an expression, and the uneasiness in the depths of her heart grew even heavier. \u201cYour seventh elder sister is here\u2026 No matter what, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She stepped forward wanting to pull him, yet her hand landed on nothing but air. Her hand had actually passed through his body.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned!</p><br/><p>That was impossible! She went to try grabbing again, but without any exception, all her attempts had passed through his body.</p><br/><p>This was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d Little Eighth laughed bitterly, his figure began to turn faint like a dissipating image. \u201cSeventh elder sister, Little Eighth was too stupid, and died due to his stupidity\u2026 very, very long time ago\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire space suddenly shone brightly in red. Only then did Zhu Yao realize the situation around the room. It was as if an explosion had occurred next to her ears, as she stood rooted onto the ground. She looked at the front wall with widened eyes.</p><br/><p>There was a red Phoenix. A Phoenix that was no longer breathing. Its large figure covered the entire gigantic body of the mountain. On its fiery feathered body, dozens of gigantic black nails were pinning it onto the walls of the mountain, and on the surroundings of the mountain body, countless blood-red formations were engraved.</p><br/><p>Large amount of fresh, fiery-red blood was endlessly flowing out of those black nails, dripping onto the blood pool beneath.</p><br/><p>Next to her ears, Little Eighth\u2019s whisper sounded. \u201cBeing able to see seventh elder sister after death, Little Eighth is really happy.\u201d At the same time, his figure grew fainter.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Eighth!\u201d Zhu Yao could not believe this reality. She tried to touch him several times, but every single time, her hands would simply pass through him. Finally, she watched as he disappeared before her eyes.</p><br/><p>She was unable to do anything!</p><br/><p>A piercing pain could be felt in the depths of her heart, as if a needle was stabbing right into it. She could not help but press her hands against her chest, yet she still found it hard to breathe due to the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s voice resounded in her ears. \u201cWhat you saw, was but a strand of divine will he left behind. He has long since\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d It\u2019s exactly because she was aware of it, that made her feel such pain. Because she was late for his final moments as well! At first she thought it was a reunion between the two of them, but it was actually farewell!</p><br/><p>She definitely would not forgive the person that killed him!</p><br/><p>Red light suddenly shone brightly at the center of the blood pool. Slowly, a human figure surfaced from within. He was actually that cultivation wacko she encountered earlier! However, an aura of death was faintly circling around his body, but with the scouring of a God\u2019s blood, that deathly aura was slowly being suppressed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly understood. This was the human practitioner that Little Eighth mentioned, the one that lied to him. She understood his goal now as well.</p><br/><p>This body\u2019s lifespan had clearly been depleted. He killed Little Eighth, in order to use his God\u2019s blood to extend his life!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes widened greatly, as she clenched her fists tightly. Endless rage swirled around her entire body. She immediately summoned her sword intent, and threw it straight at the person in the pool of blood. However, at the moment of contact, it was blocked by a red formation.</p><br/><p>On the right of the blood pool, a figure appeared with a flash. An image that looked exactly the same as the person within the pool appeared at the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you lot again!\u201d That man coldly snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re actually here again to seek death!\u201d</p><br/><p>He first glanced scornfully at little tyrant and Ye Qingcang, and then looked a little warily at Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao tightened her fists once more, unable to control the trembling of her body. Gritting her teeth, she slowly spoke. \u201cLittle Eighth\u2026 You did this to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was stunned for a moment. \u201cYou know this Phoenix!\u201d Following after, a hint of surprise flashed across his face. \u201cThen you should know how its inner core can be retrieved, don\u2019t you? Quick, tell me? With the inner core of a God race, I will be able to resurrect completely. I do not have to once again appear in the form of a divine sense, and I can even ascend to the Higher Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes reddened from the unsuppressable fury in the depths of her heart, as she gritted her teeth. \u201cI know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and tell me.\u201d His face was anxious. \u201cAs long as you tell me, mystic arts, spiritual medicine, treasures, I can give you anything you want! Anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want your life!\u201d She immediately circulated the spiritual energy in her entire body as she controlled her sword intent, willing it attack him once again. She had never felt such an eager desire to eliminate someone before.</p><br/><p>The man was stunned. With a twist of his hand, a spiritual sword was materialized and it flew straight towards Zhu Yao, immediately scattering Zhu Yao\u2019s sword intent. \u201cPresumptuous!\u201d He coldly snorted. Suddenly, he released all of the spiritual energy in his body, and a gigantic black serpent floated out. With its mouth wide open, it launched a counter-attack with overwhelming force.</p><br/><p>This was his sword intent.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt an irresistible pressure coming towards her, and she was seemingly about to kneel from its spiritual pressure. However, she gritted her teeth and stabilized herself, her spiritual energy once again gathered into a spiritual sword which flew towards the serpent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d The pea emitted out a white light, and Yu Yan\u2019s figure body once again appeared. With a wave of his hand, he materialized a wall of wind, blocking the enemy\u2019s attack. He reached out to grab Zhu Yao, wanting to stop her reckless actions.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao reached out to grasp the pea kept within her, and gave it a great pinch.</p><br/><p>\u201cPea~\u201d The pea opened its mouth in pain, and then threw it towards the two little ones behind her. In the next moment, the pea grew larger and swallowed the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao\u2026\u201d Only then did Yu Yan realize what she was about to do and wanted to stop her. However, it was already too late, as his figure was transferred out of this space along with the pea, disappearing from site.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao once again gathered the spiritual energy in her entire body, materializing her sword intent as she faced the man head-on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take revenge for Little Eighth on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only this person alone, she had to be the one to personally beat him into a pulp!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

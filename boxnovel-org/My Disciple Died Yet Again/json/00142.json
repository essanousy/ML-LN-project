Yu Yan gave a clueless look.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt a little weary in her heart. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about this topic. Back then, I asked you a question. You said that you will tell me after I have ascended. You can tell me the answer now, right?\u201d Do you like me or not?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe question back then?\u201d Yu Yan blanked. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about\u2026 being practitioner-pair companions, is that correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. So, what\u2019s your answer?\u201d Zhu Yao stared intensely at his eyes, with an expression that looked as though she would eat him up if he rejected her.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression, which was still ice-cold from habit earlier, grew slightly red. After a while, he replied. \u201cIn regards to this matter\u2026 We can talk about it after you have put on some clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was initially an interrogation with an intense atmosphere, but it was ended because of her naked body. Zhu Yao felt that even the morals of her next lifetime had been entirely spent. Yet, the person involved did not even have the slightest bit of reaction at all. After pulling out a large bundle of clothes, he even asked her with a calm look. \u201cDo you want pink? White? Or pink and white?\u201d Not only did they come with full sets of inner and outer wears, there were even aprons as well.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao really wanted to pound her fists onto the ground and cry out painfully. What happened to the promise that all men were animals who only think of their lower body? Why was one of them left out?</p><br/><p>Because of this ruckus, Zhu Yao lost all of her intensity.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to change back into your former state.\u201d Yu Yan pulled away the blanket, dug out the stupid disciple who was buried within and acting dead. Tapping on the core of the jade with the tip of his finger, a pure lightning energy was inserted, forcefully changing the jade back into her human form. \u201cYou have only gained your human form not too long ago. There\u2019s no benefit to your cultivation if you regularly return to your former state.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao continued to act like a corpse. Her heart had suffered a huge blow, and she did not wish to get up at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe obedient.\u201d Yu Yan stroked her head, as he glanced at his disciple who was emitting out a dispirited aura. His brows furrowed, as he instantly picked her up from within the blanket. \u201cYour master shall teach you the cultivation technique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zhu Yao responded, but she was still unable to garner even the slightest bit of enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>It was rare to see his disciple as unenthusiastic as this. Yu Yan was at a slight loss. He faintly sensed that she became this dispirited due to the matters yesterday. Actually, it wasn\u2019t because he did not want to answer her, but\u2026</p><br/><p>After hesitating for a moment, he clenched his fists. Then, taking the opportunity, he placed her in his embrace, and slowly spoke. \u201cYu\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d Zhu Yao curiously looked up at the certain enlightened person who suddenly took the initiative.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank. Looking at the nearing pair of rose-colored lips, he unconsciously pressed towards it. The two lips connected, and unlike the puzzling and numbing feeling he felt before, he felt strangely hungry for more. He could not help but wish to taste it even more.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little muddled. The scenario was developing too fast, and her brain basically could not keep up with the change. She simply felt that dazzling stars were in front of her eyes, as though countless fireworks were being endlessly released at the same time. That was when she felt it was a little hard to breathe\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026 Wait a minute.\u201d Zhu Yao quickly pushed away her master who was evidently still trapped in his lust. \u201cLet me catch my breath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Yu Yan\u2019s eyes looked a little clearer. Seeing his disciple\u2019s lips which were evidently swollen red, the arms which he was embracing her with once again tightened, as he suppressed the urge to press his lips against hers again. After a moment that felt like eternity, he spoke. \u201cYu\u2026 Yao. You have only just gained your human form, and your cultivation level is too far from mine. I\u2019m afraid you might not be able to endure the divine energy in my body, so we must not be anxious in regards to matters regarding us becoming practitioner-pair companions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhu Yao felt a little giddy in her head, and for a moment, she could not clearly understand what he meant.</p><br/><p>However, a little embarrassed, Yu Yan released her. He tried his best to fixate his line of sight right below her forehead, as he did not dare to look at the place which he ravaged earlier. \u201cIf you really wish\u2026 Ahem, once you have raised your cultivation, naturally, we can do it then. Your master will wait for you.\u201d After saying that, throwing her aside, he headed outside, and his tone had intentionally turned a little colder. \u201cSo, shouldn\u2019t you be hurrying to practice the cultivation technique? I will wait for you at the peach blossom garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he had already stepped outside. With flying steps, he ran off, as though he was being chased by something behind him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he mean?</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao recall what the words he said earlier. Her cultivation level was too poor because she had only just gained her human form, and thus, she could not endure the divine energy in his body? Why did she have to endure the divine energy in his body? He couldn\u2019t have thought of something impure, right? Wait a minute. According to her master\u2019s usual way of interpreting words, then practitioner-pair companions would mean\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly recalled a certain island action film\u00b9.</p><br/><p>Master, come back. Let me explain!</p><br/><p>After listening to Yu Yan\u2019s teachings, Yu Yao finally had a certain degree of knowledge towards this new world. After ascending, one still had to cultivate. However, different from the cultivation world, they would not have to absorb the corresponding spiritual energy to raise their cultivation level. Instead, they had to take in divine energy. However, divine energy was not differentiated by the five elements. Most probably, it was due to the ascension lightning tribulation which eliminated the restrictions of the Spirit Veins, allowing everyone to have the same exact starting point.</p><br/><p>All Deities who had ascended to the Higher Realm, after a series of cultivation, would still be categorized based on their cultivation level. The poorest was termed Earth Deity, and following after it are Profound Deity, Gold Deity, Heavy Deity, and High Deity respectively.</p><br/><p>Her master\u2019s cultivation level was currently at the early stages of Heavy Deity. That person who had made the best use out of her completely, and had helped her gain a human form, was actually a High Deity, who was even more incredible than her master. This point was something Zhu Yao was especially unable to accept. She felt that she was unable to return to the good times when she could stay reckless and arrogant because of her mighty master. Initially, she had thoughts of frying a certain someone, yet, the thoughts were shattered by a blow from reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the Hall Master of Lightning Divine Hall. Remember to stay far away from him.\u201d Yu Yan heavily emphasized.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Hall Master?\u201d It sounded pretty incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, he\u2019s the person who is in charge of the Lightning Divine Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d The hell, that person was actually a manager. \u201cThen, what\u2019s he called?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was startled, as a hint of confusion flashed past his face. Only after a moment later did he straightened up his expression. \u201cYou\u2026 can simply call him Hall Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Master, be honest. You basically did not remember his name, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, if you do not have any concerning matters, do not head to the Hall.\u201d He\u2019s a bad example for you.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d She obviously wouldn\u2019t head up there to seek abuse. With a single glance, it could be seen that demon wasn\u2019t a good person. Furthermore, no matter how it was, he was still her master\u2019s immediate superior, so it\u2019s best for her to be a little modest. \u201cOh right, master. How many disciples do our Lightning Divine Hall have?\u201d She had to understand the leadership structure of the Lightning Divine Hall.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned, as he pondered for a moment. \u201cCurrently, including you\u2026 Three!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh!?\u201d She didn\u2019t mishear, right? Master, don\u2019t fool me. \u201cUh\u2026 Master, what you mean is, other than the two of us, in the entire Lightning Divine Hall, the only one left is the Hall Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mn, my ass. What happened to the promised \u2018tall, large, and mighty\u2019? What happened to the promised awesome and overpowered Sect? Furthermore, since there were clearly only three people, why was there a need to choose a Hall Master? Why did she feel this Sect was at the bottom of the barrel? Wait a minute, wasn\u2019t it said that the people of the Lightning Divine Hall were largely comprised of ascended Jade Forest Mountain disciples? Then, other than master, there should still be a large number of old ancestors, right? Where were they?</p><br/><p>As though he had sensed her doubts, Yu Yan pointed to the peak of the tall tower. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s a disciple of the Lightning Divine Hall, after cultivating to a Heavy Deity, they will cultivate inside the tower. According to legends, a heavenly secret is sealed inside. If it\u2019s comprehended, one can enter the Realm of Gods.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRealm of Gods? The God race?\u201d Wasn\u2019t it said that the Gods were all dead?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Realm of Gods and the God race are different. The Gods of the God race are of an ancient race.\u201d Yu Yan explained. \u201cWhile the Gods of the Realm of Gods, are High Gods of the Heavenly Dao. No one has seen an actual High God. They are people who control the laws of the Heavenly Dao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laws of the Heavenly Dao? They\u2019re so incredible? Then, weren\u2019t they the controllers of the Three Realms?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Grandmaster is also within the tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d And here she was wondering why there was only the three of them in this huge Lightning Divine Hall. \u201cThen, what about that Hall Master? Didn\u2019t you say after achieving the cultivation of a Heavy Deity, we will have to enter the tower?\u201d That Hall Master was a High Deity, a level higher than a Heavy Deity, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, Little Yan Yan should hurry and take over the position of Hall Master, so that I can enter the tower.\u201d Before Yu Yan could answer in time, he was interrupted by a voice filled with seductiveness. After a rain of flower petals, the red-clothed man appeared within the peach blossom forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHall Master.\u201d Yu Yan called out, however, his tone was freezing cold. Reflexively, he stuffed his disciple, who was by his side, behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah, Little Yan Yan, you\u2019re still so cold, huh.\u201d Yu Jin seemed to have gotten used to his attitude, as he turned his head and glanced at Zhu Yao who was hiding behind him. \u201cI say, Blossoming Jade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s Blossoming Jade!\u201d Zhu Yao, who now had someone who could support her, instantly became tougher. She had to firmly reject that name.</p><br/><p>The great master Yu Yan, as expected, shifted a step to shield her, hiding his disciple even more thoroughly. With a justifying tone, he corrected. \u201cShe\u2019s my personal succeeding disciple, Yu Wang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s Desire!\u201d Being called Desire was even worse, all right? Zhu Yao instantly felt irritated. Such a casual naming sense like this, was this a tradition in the Sect?</p><br/><p>\u201cStop fooling around!\u201d Yu Yan raised his hand, and once again stuffed his disciple towards his back. Then, he glanced towards the person on the other side. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d If there are matters, spit them out. If there\u2019s nothing, scram.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah~\u201d Yu Jin let out a heavy sigh. \u201cI say, Little Yan Yan, at the very least, I\u2019m still your senior. Is it really wise for you to be this ruthless?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wise.\u201d Yu Yan nodded without a fluster on his face.</p><br/><p>Yu Jin\u2019s feet slipped, and he had almost fallen onto the ground. This Yu Yan actually shamelessly admitted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not take over the role of Hall Master.\u201d Yu Yan once again stabbed with another blow.</p><br/><p>Finally, Yu Jin could no longer maintain the smile on his face. \u201cThis is the order of the Hall Master, you dare to disobey it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yet, the other party unhesitatingly replied. \u201cI dare!\u201d</p><br/><p>Towards his reply which did not leave the slightest room for negotiations, Yu Jin, however, completely did not look furious at all. Instead, he smiled even more enchantingly. \u201cThe role of the Hall Master, has been passed down from generation to generation in the first place. I have waited for a very long time, and it\u2019s time for you take over as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master never accepted it.\u201d Yu Yan stabbed with another blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me of that traitor.\u201d Yu Jin seemed to have recalled something, as he finally became irritated. \u201cI was after all, still his grandmaster. I can forget about him not obediently taking over the role of Hall Master, but he even silently entered the tower behind my back. Otherwise, why would I need to look for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Historically, the disciples of the Lightning Divine Hall would all enter the Lightning Divine Tower to comprehend the laws of ascending to godhood. However, it was impossible to leave the huge Lightning Divine Hall unattended, hence, they would always leave one person to manage the place. This person would thus be the Hall Master. Initially, it had been well passed down generation by generation, yet, an irregularity occurred when it came into his hands. Firstly, a complication arose during his disciple\u2019s ascension. He had no choice but to send him into the tower, in hopes that his own master could save his disciple. However, who would have known that after he placed his disciple into the tower, he would never come out?</p><br/><p>And after that, his grand-disciple ascended as well. He was a very obedient disciple, and was usually very respectful towards him. Just as he was about to hand over the role of Hall Master to him, who would have figured that right after cultivating into a Heavy Deity, he had actually quietly ran into the tower himself, causing Yu Jin to simply yearned for nothing all these years.</p><br/><p>And right after, it\u2019s this Yu Yan. This person actually did not have any intentions to enter the tower, but even between life and death, he simply wouldn\u2019t take over the position.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn regards to being the Hall Master, it\u2019s not up to you to decide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00b9It\u2019s best for you guys not to know.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

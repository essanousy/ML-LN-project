Causing junior-martial sister to have concerns is a fault on my part. From today on, I shall care for her with all my heart, and I hope that High Deity will feel rest assured to hand her over to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hand her over to him? Yu Yan\u2019s expression instantly turned as dark as the deepest part of a pot, and then, looked towards his own disciple.</p><br/><p>His every word was so cold, it felt as they could sprout out flowers of ice. \u201cPractitioner-pair ceremony?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Zhu Yao jumped out of fury. Clearly, it had already been cancelled. Don\u2019t say things that can cause misunderstandings, hey. \u201cWho became practitioner-pair companions with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister, are you blaming me?\u201d Xu Nuoyan\u2019s expression turned even sadder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, from today on, I will definitely not allow anything sad to happen on you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does anything that you do have to do with me?\u201d This person must had gone insane, right? Why did he come over here and say such misleading words? Wasn\u2019t Mo Xianxian the person he loved? \u201cI have already said it on that day. Our practitioner-pair ceremony was cancelled, and for us to marry is impossible. It never happened on that day, and it will never happen in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial sister, I know you\u2019re angry at me.\u201d He gave a \u2018do not act so angry\u2019 look. \u201cBut, I will wait for the day when you think it through. Ever since the day Sect Master betrothed you to me, I, Nuoyan has already decided that you will be the only person in my life, and I will not allow you to suffer from the least bit of grievances. High Deity\u2026\u201d He suddenly turned towards Yu Yan again. Putting up a look expressing determination towards a senior, he raised his hand and vowed. \u201cMy heart towards junior-martial sister is clear under the sun and moon, if there\u2019s the least bit of pretense, I\u2019m willing to be struck by five lightning bolts to the head, willing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Xu Nuoyan blanked after halfway through his vows, and for a moment, he couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cHigh Deity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom boom boom!</p><br/><p>Five clear heavenly lightning bolts, struck straight towards Xu Nuoyan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s really five lightning bolts straight to the head, huh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh Deity!\u201d Xu Nuoyan exclaimed, while he hurriedly rose to the sky with his sword. He fled to the outskirts of Dawnfall Peak, and chasing relentlessly after his buttocks were five heavenly lightning bolts.</p><br/><p>Only then did Yu Yan turn to look at his stupid disciple.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt her heart trembling for a moment. \u201cMaster, let me explain!\u201d She really was unfamiliar with him.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression however, turned even colder. Grabbing onto Zhu Yao, in a flash, they had already returned into the straw cottage.</p><br/><p>When she came to her senses, Zhu Yao had already been pressed onto the bed by someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cPractitioner-pair?\u201d A certain master had gone completely insane. Zhu Yao was seemingly able to see flames of fury surging around his body. With emphasis on every word, it was as though he was voicing them out while gritting his teeth. \u201cYou? And, him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was completely unable to move from the way he was pressing on her. The aura emitting from his body was filled with a cold intent, and their faces were even more so, extremely close. A tyrannical CEO-like attitude such as this, could this be the legendary\u2026 Bed bang? Her master was being furious out of envy, and he wanted to be forceful on her? Then after this, would some shameful acts occur?</p><br/><p>Although the atmosphere was wrong\u2026</p><br/><p>I\u2019m suddenly kind of looking forward to it, what to do? (\u256f3\u2570)</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d Seeing that she wasn\u2019t replying, Yu Yan\u2019s tone raised.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. This was it. This ecstatical \u2018mn\u2019! Tyrannical CEO Yu had taken over!</p><br/><p>Out of excitement, Zhu Yao instantly hugged him back, and said with a serious look. \u201cCome, do not pity me just because I\u2019m a tender flower. I can take it!\u201d Let\u2019s do a little something that surpasses our relationship as master and disciple.</p><br/><p>Where should we start? Stripping our clothes, or taking off our pants?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d CEO Yu instantly dispersed.</p><br/><p>The fury that enveloped Yu Yan, after seeing his disciple\u2019s expectant look, instantly vanished. In the end, it turned into a long sigh, and his heart squeezed for having a disciple that did not act accordingly to the situation.</p><br/><p>With his body buried under her hair, he gently smelled the scent of her hair, calming down his unstable emotions. He had always treated matters coldly and quietly, and an impulsive emotion like this was a little foreign to him. However, when he thought that his only disciple was being taken away by someone else, he felt like zapping someone out of explosive rage.</p><br/><p>Although his disciple was stupid, she still belonged to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Wang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s Desire!\u201d Can we please make love properly?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master\u2026 does not like how that person looks at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao simply felt as though her heart was filled with warmth, so full it felt like something was wanting to pour out. After a long while, she replied. \u201cMn, I don\u2019t like it either.\u201d I only like how you\u2019re looking at me.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was silent for a little while, yet, his embrace became even tighter, as though he was wanting to confirm something. All she could hear was his gentle breathing sounds.</p><br/><p>After a long while\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Wang, let\u2019s become practitioner-pair companions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was \u2018every cloud has a silver lining\u2019? What was \u2018past dark willows and flowers in bloom lies another village\u2019? And what was \u2018good and evil will always be rewarded\u2019\u2026 Ah pui, the last one had strayed off. In any case, when she heard her master taking the initiative to bring up about the matter of practitioner-pair companions, ever since she had transported to this world, Zhu Yao felt that she had finally encountered something that was comforting to her soul. And when she thought about it, she was a little excited too!</p><br/><p>Then, she began to ponder a little. As a girl, shouldn\u2019t she be a little reserved, and passively reject his proposal a little? Then should she welcome the idea and reject it, or should she act ambiguously? Just what kind of expression should she make to perfectly express her little embarrassment?</p><br/><p>So frustrating!</p><br/><p>Just as she was still fighting with the imaginary people inside her mind, Yu Yan suddenly stood up, and pulled her into a sitting position.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stared with widened eyes. It couldn\u2019t be, it\u2019s only their first time, and they\u2019re doing such a position!?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan raised his finger and tapped on the center of her forehead. A technique used to guide and circulate divine energy was instantly added into her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan released her, and then, sat next to her cross-legged. With a serious look, he said. \u201cThis is the Practitioner-Pair Art. You simply have to guide out the divine energy at the same time as I, and then, circulate it according to the instructions.\u201d Didn\u2019t she want to be practitioner-pair companions with him all this time? He had fulfilled her wish.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d There\u2019s no need to be completely naked, and there\u2019s no need to harmonize the Yin and Yang?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell!\u201d I have already taken off my pants, and you tell me this!? \u201cIsn\u2019t it said that Practitioner-Pair Art can only be done between husband and wife? Then, at the very least, there should be a little procedure that should be done between the couple, right?\u201d She was unwilling to accept this!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu Yan blanked. He seemed to have thought of something, as a hint of red flashed across his jade-colored face. His eyes wavered for a moment, before replying. \u201cThe practitioner-pair methods in the Divine Realm are different from the Lower Realm. There isn\u2019t a need for it to be that complicated. As people who have gained divine physiques, naturally\u2026 cough\u2026 naturally, carnal lust is of least importance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Yu Yan blanked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stared straight at his face, and with emphasis on every word, she said. \u201cI said, it\u2019s important to me!\u201d This lady here wants to be a carnivore!</p><br/><p>\u201cNon\u2026 Nonsense!\u201d Yu Yan tried hard to furrow his brows. \u201cYou\u2019re a practitioner. How can you be indulged with desires to this extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not going to cultivate anymore.\u201d She pounced onto him, and reversed their positions from earlier.</p><br/><p>As Yu Yan was inattentive for a moment, he collapsed onto the bed. \u201cYu Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Zhu Yao instantly kissed his lips\u2026</p><br/><p>Fragrant!</p><br/><p>A fresh meat came on its own accord, and there\u2019s no reason to let it go either. Without any reservations, Zhu Yao touched his robust body, and her hand went lower. Lower. And lower\u2026</p><br/><p>On that day, till the very last moment, Zhu Yao still did not get what she wanted. It was simply not because she did not try hard enough, rather, the enemy camp was too despicable. Force wasn\u2019t able to hook up this tyrannical lord. And she was even fixed onto the same position for exactly four hours, listening to a lecture on moral education.</p><br/><p>A certain master began the story from the first ever practitioner in history who obtained a divine physique, stretched the content to the allegiance towards various constructed cultivation sects, and then, to the importance of harmony within the Divine Realm. He then proceeded on to an extremely important subject regarding the continuity of deities, quoting from people from the days of new and old. His persuasiveness, his earnestness, and his decisiveness\u2026 had completely extinguished the little candle in Zhu Yao\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>In the end, the conclusion that Zhu Yao came up with was: \u2018I might as well have a little something going on Xu Nuoyan.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d At the very end, he pulled her into his embrace. Mn, the type where she pulled up from the bottom of the bed. That\u2019s right. She was kicked off the bed!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are too many mysteries within your body. Your master promises you that I will help you clearly investigate them. Once all of these matters are settled, when that time comes, no matter what you do\u2026 I will definitely not stop you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t kick me off the bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright then, to obtain such a promise from him, Zhu Yao felt that she could still endure it a bit longer.</p><br/><p>Hoho\u2026 When that time comes, will steamed or braised be better? Kuh\u2026 She still liked the original taste better.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin\u2019er? Xin\u2019er!\u201d Yin Shi nudged her own daughter who was evidently distracted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem!\u201d Zhu Yao cleared up her thoughts, and instantly retracted all of the pink bubbles from around her body. \u201cMother, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She strangely looked at her own daughter. \u201cAren\u2019t you the one who came to look for me? What happened? Could it be that your wounds have opened again? Where? Let your mother take a look\u2026\u201d Yin Shi instantly became anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine!\u201d Zhu Yao then brought up the main topic at hand. \u201cMother, today, other than telling you that I\u2019m safe and sound, I want to ask you when did you know of this Mo Xianxian person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, when Yin Shi heard this unknown name, not only did she not reveal the slightest bit of disgust, she even blanked for a moment. With a strange look, she asked. \u201cMo Xianxian? Who is she? Is she a disciple of our sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, you don\u2019t know here?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled. \u201cShe\u2019s the person who claimed to be Xu Nuoyan\u2019s wife on the day of the practitioner-pair ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s her!\u201d Only then did Yin Shi recall the matter. Glancing at her daughter, she sighed and said. \u201cHaah, speaking of this matter, it really cannot be blamed on that child, Nuoyan. He had told me that he had never seen that lady before, let alone being practitioner-pair companions with her. I see that it\u2019s just people with ill motives wanting to frame our name, and purposefully wanting to start a conflict. Currently, the four great continents look peaceful on the outside, but we have been constantly moving behind the scenes. And adding that currently, only you and your mother, I, remained in Fluorescent Wind Sect, we\u2019re naturally being targeted.\u201d Yin Shi revealed a look of helplessness. \u201cBut Yin Xin, there\u2019s no need for you to worry. Right now, you have admitted under the tutelage of Lightning Divine Hall, most likely, they will no longer dare to set their eyes on us. Although we have still not found out who was the person behind the incident on that day, Nuoyan is unrelated to this. So you mustn\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Nuoyan really don\u2019t know that woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, you trust him that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the case!\u201d Yin Shi thought that she was having a child\u2019s fit, thinking that her mother was pampering outsiders more than herself. So, she said with a little delight. \u201cA disciple who have ascended from the same world as him, personally proved this matter. In the Lower Realm, he indeed did not have practitioner-pair companion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. Them being husband and wife or not, was something she knew very clearly. However, now he had even specially invited a witness to testify, just what was he planning?</p><br/><p>The guess that had been in the depths of her heart, was finally clear now.</p><br/><p>Initially, she had thought that the hatred Mo Xianxian had for Fluorescent Wind Sect, was because of Yin Shi breaking up the pair of lovebirds.</p><br/><p>However, when she turned into Yin Xin, and took the initiative to cancel the marriage, Xu Nuoyan was actually ungrateful towards his former wife. And he had even appeared several times before Zhu Yao, having the intentions to repair the relationship between them. Now, he had even denied the relationship he once had with Mo Xianxian. This attitude which was completely different from the one she saw in her precognitive dream, made her suspect his motives and schemes for acting the way he was right now.</p><br/><p>In the dream, Mo Xianxian hated Yin Shi. Not only was it because Yin Shi had injured her during the practitioner-pair ceremony, Yin Shi had even more so sent people to kill her multiple times, preventing her from having a single place to rest in the Divine Realm. However, when Zhu Yao looked at her cheap mother\u2019s expression now, before the practitioner-pair ceremony back then, she basically did not know who Mo Xianxian was? Hence, it was impossible for her to be behind the incidents where Mo Xianxian were hunted down in the Divine Realm.</p><br/><p>And the only person who knew she existed, was Xu Nuoyan who was having a different attitude from before.</p><br/><p>She suddenly recalled that when Dog-Egg first made things difficult for Mo Xianxian, he had once said that he was guided by a Gold Deity. Xu Nuoyan\u2019s cultivation, was coincidentally at the Gold Deity level!</p><br/><p>The person who wanted to kill Mo Xianxian, was Xu Nuoyan himself!</p><br/><p>Why did he want to kill her? In order to marry Yin Xin?</p><br/><p>However\u2026 Why did he suddenly change his mind in the end, and reverted back to finding Mo Xianxian?</p><br/><p>\u201cXin\u2019er.\u201d Seeing that she was having a frustrated look, Yin Shi pulled her hand, and patted on it. \u201cI know you have just woken up, and do not have much contact with anyone. So, I can understand that you do not wish to be practitioner-pair companions with your senior-martial brother Xu. But, there\u2019s no need for you to reject him so eagerly either. Nuoyan is a good child. After interacting with him for a long time, you will naturally know of it. A human heart can be seen after many days, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018A human heart can be seen after many days.\u2019 If he really was how she guessed him to be, then this person\u2019s heart had been buried a little too deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, you trust him that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Shi smiled, and said with a confident look. \u201cHe\u2019s your father\u2019s personal succeeding disciple. No matter how, he\u2019s a family member who knows his roots.\u201d</p><br/><p>But this family member, would destroy Fluorescent Wind Sect in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, there\u2019s a matter I need to talk to you about.\u201d Zhu Yao didn\u2019t want to harm the innocent, but she did not want to stay passive and be beaten either. \u201cBack then, when I left with my master, I once saw that Mo Xianxian along the way. Back then, she was being chased, and the chasers seemed to be precisely disciples from our Fluorescent Wind Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChased? I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Yin Shi blanked, and a moment later, a thought came into her mind. As a Sect Master, how couldn\u2019t she not possess an extraordinary and shrewd mind? After pondering for a moment, she was about to come up with a connection. Although Mo Xianxian had caused a huge ruckus in Fluorescent Wind Sect, no matter how, she was still a disciple of Advent Cloud Hall, so Yin Shi wouldn\u2019t have the final say in the matter, let alone using a despicable method like sending people to hunt her down.</p><br/><p>But the people weren\u2019t sent by her, then who could it be?</p><br/><p>Yin Shi stood up with a solemn face, and walked back and forth in the center of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin\u2019er, were you not mistaken? Those people who went to hunt her down, were they really disciples from my sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure either, it\u2019s just that I seem to have seen a phoenix-like insignia on their sleeves.\u201d These people were naturally all imaginary, however, Zhu Yao understood that Yin Shi would definitely investigate this matter.</p><br/><p>Yin Shi took a deep breath, and her expression sank even deeper. A while later, she said. \u201cXin\u2019er, return for now. Mother will deal with these matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded, and she obediently returned to Dawnfall Peak. The things she should tell her were already told. She did not wish to heavily rely on the precognitive dream she saw, only to lose her own judgment of the matter. Hence, she could not entirely rely on the scenes in the dream to predict Xu Nuoyan\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>The truth should tell if he was innocent or not.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She then pinched his cheeks and pulled them outwards. \u201cHurry and swap out from this face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! It h-h-h-hurts\u2026\u201d Realmspirit hissed as he breathed in the chilling air. He couldn\u2019t avoid her demonic hands either. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for this either! You\u2019re the reason why I have this form.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s hands stopped in mid-air. \u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, you already know about my true body, right?\u201d Realmspirit said with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t have a fixed appearance in the first place, so the me you\u2019re seeing right now, is the appearance of the most beautiful person in your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was dumbfounded, and at that moment, she understood what he meant. The person with the most beautiful appearance in her heart was naturally her master. After sizing him up for a moment, she could not help but grow a little suspicious. \u201cAre you truly the spirit of the Three Realms?\u201d</p><br/><p>He instantly gave a large grin. \u201cCorrect. Beautiful maiden, you\u2019re actually able to figure it out so quickly. You\u2019re so smart.\u201d As expected of the one chosen by me?</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough of that!\u201d Zhu Yao rolled her eyes, but her heart felt a little stuffy. \u201cSo the things you told me before were all true. And this is what you meant when you said that there\u2019s a problem with this world when I was first brought here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d He nodded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. She finally understood everything that she hadn\u2019t been able to figure out before, including why he had such incredible powers. Why was he able to grant her such strange cheats? Why were the River of Forgetfulness, Bai Yuan, and Wood Spirit all so familiar with him? Why could he claim that even the Heavenly Dao could change? The spirit of the Three Realms, a spirit formed by the Three Realms. He was this world, and the Three Realms was his true body. Even the Heavenly Dao and luck were all part of him, so he could naturally change them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re the Three Realms, then those bugs should have been easy to fix on your own. Why did you still have to drag me over to fix them?\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head. \u201cYaoyao, I can predict everything in this world, and I can clearly see everyone\u2019s paths, but I don\u2019t know how to cure them. Though I know where the bugs are, I don\u2019t understand the specific methods to fix them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zhu Yao was a little confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cA medical practitioner can\u2019t cure himself.\u201d Realmspirit solemnly said.</p><br/><p>In other words, though he was the one who was sick, he was powerless to stop it? \u201cBut there are so many people in the Three Realms, so you can find anyone here to do it. Why do you have to go so far to another plane to drag me over here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe living beings of the Three Realms are all part of it themselves, so they can\u2019t clearly see the problem themselves, so how can they possibly fix it? No one in this world can do it, but you\u2019re different.\u201d His eyes shone. \u201cYou come from another plane, everything you know and the thoughts you have are all greatly different from ours. You can see things in a way that we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Zhu Yao frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not an incredible figure, and I don\u2019t have any astonishing talents. Furthermore, in our world, I\u2019m just a regular person without any special traits that you can find a bunch on the streets. If you just want someone from another plane to help you find loopholes, isn\u2019t it better to find someone more outstanding? Why pick me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit retracted his smile and looked at her straight in the eyes. With an especially serious tone, he said. \u201cBecause we are friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d So you\u2019re the type that trolls your friends?</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, I trust in our friendship. Of course, the most important thing is\u2026\u201d He solemnly said. \u201cYou have stronger conviction and principles than anyone else, and you never wavered even once. Even after you were in the Three Realms for so long, you kept holding onto your untainted heart. That\u2019s why\u2026 you\u2019re the most suitable choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell me right from the start?\u201d Zhu Yao frowned. If he had truly treated her as a friend, why the need to hide everything from her?</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cI want you to see this world with your own eyes and have you personally understand everything. Only by doing that can you find the most suitable method to fixing the problems that occurred.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, if she had known Realmspirit was the Three Realms right from the start, she would have simply given him suggestions on fixing the bugs and not understand the world in depth. It\u2019s like playing a game. Only by going deep into understanding the game can one find the best way to fix the bugs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s with this tower clearing mission?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can be considered as the final dungeon, I guess.\u201d He solemnly said. \u201cOnly by reaching the peak of the tower can you understand everything about me. When that happens\u2026 It\u2019s also the time for the real patch to be implemented.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was shocked. \u201cReal patch? Didn\u2019t I fix a lot of bugs already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, everything has yet to start.\u201d He shook his head, his smile grew even more dazzling. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve understood everything, I will leave all the decisions to you. And you, my friend, is my final hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d What final hope? Zhu Yao wanted a clarification, but his figure had begun to fade. Even the space itself was beginning to dim.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will always believe you, my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Clarify yourself. Zhu Yao grabbed onto his hand, but she instead was faced with a pair of familiar eyes. The face was the same, but the demeanor had completely changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The person in front of her stroked her head, carrying a relieving, chilling intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d She\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be afraid.\u201d Yu Yan however thought that she was anxious and pulled her in a little. \u201cMaster is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao realize the surroundings had changed. Mountains and rivers filled the lands, stretching beyond her line of sight. It wasn\u2019t any different from the Divine Realm. \u201cThis is\u2026 inside the tower?\u201d The map is a little too big, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place should be the lower ten floors of Lightning Divine Tower.\u201d Yu Yan solemnly said. \u201cTeacher once mentioned that the High Deity level is the lowest cultivation level one would have in Lightning Divine Tower. It\u2019s best that we take caution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOu.\u201d Zhu Yao nodded. Looking around, she did not see any human figures, though not far behind her, a black light flashed. Right after the flash, Yue Ying appeared.</p><br/><p>She knew that he would follow after her. Zhu Yao frowned, but chose to ignore him as usual.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201dWhat do we do now?\u201d When it came to clearing the tower, they still had to figure out where they should clear from!</p><br/><p>Yu Yan suddenly pulled out a gold talisman. \u201cTeacher once said that if I enter the Lightning Divine Tower, I can use this talisman to contact him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster! Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone. There\u2019s a \u2018find guild member\u2019 feature, say so earlier! \u201cHurry, hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He cast an art and instantly activated the talisman. A golden light flashed, but in the next moment, the talisman began to burn and turn into ashes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seemed like teacher has already entered the upper ten floors.\u201d Yu Yan sighed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could faintly hear a notification saying: Finding guild member\u2026 failed!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see then.\u201d Yu Yan had no other options either. After all, everything here was too foreign. They could only take a step at a time.</p><br/><p>The two of them turned and flew forward. Zhu Yao was still thinking about Realmspirit\u2019s words and did not pay much attention to her surroundings. After flying out of a forest, they arrived at a grass plain. Zhu Yao released her divine sense and scanned the surroundings, only to realize the plain was outrageously large. Her divine sense was actually unable to cover its entirety. After scanning around, she still did not see a single human figure. They could not even ask for directions.</p><br/><p>For a moment, she was a little hesitant, not knowing whether they should continue moving forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d She turned and looked at her all-powerful master.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. \u201cThis grass plain is boundless, and it seems even after venturing a thousand kilometers, we would not find a single town. It looks like we have to turn back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Great, we have to head back. Zhu Yao expressed that she was tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rest for a moment before moving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Left with no other choice, Zhu Yao sat down. She wondered just what was going on in the tower? The population density was a little too small, wasn\u2019t it? Even after flying for so long, let alone a person, they did not even spot a single living being. Even in this boundless grass plain, there were only a few long-eared rabbits.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned and looked at the rabbit that was currently squatting next to her, nibbling on the grass without the slightest sense of danger. She wondered just what breed it was, as it was actually not afraid of humans.</p><br/><p>It even had such a rotten street name called Little White\u2026</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>Name!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rubbed her eyes. Was she seeing things? Why was she seeing two yellow words hanging above the rabbit \u2013 Little White? And below the name was a long red HP bar.</p><br/><p>As a qualified game developer, she could not help but poke it with her itchy hand. A row of words then instantly floated above the rabbit\u2019s head: HP \u2013 1</p><br/><p>She had a bad premonition\u2026</p><br/><p>In the next instant, the yellow words \u201cLittle White\u201d turned red. The rabbit that was still one-mindedly nibbling on the grass just earlier turned its head and unceremoniously bit on her hand.</p><br/><p>Blood flowed out\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy! It hurts\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hand forcefully, immediately flinging the rabbit away. However, a bone-deep wound was left on her hand.</p><br/><p>What a terrifying rabbit!</p><br/><p>The moment the rabbit landed on the ground, it dove into the patch of grass. After that, shuffling noises could be heard from the grass, as one red \u201cLittle White\u201d after another popped up like lights being turned on. It looked like the colour were infectious, as red instantly filled the entire grass plain.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 It seemed like, she accidentally started a battle!</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao?\u201d Yu Yan was just about to ask. \u201cWhat is it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Zhu Yao grabbed onto her master and madly flew into the forest they came from. Shuffling noises followed after them from behind.</p><br/><p>When she turned to look, her heart almost leapt out of fright. A large mass of red names rose into the air and chased straight after them. Aren\u2019t they rabbits? Why can rabbits fly? What you guys have are long ears, and not wings, hey! The biology teachers are going to cry!</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao\u2026\u201d Yu Yan pulled his flustered and stupid disciple and stopped in the air. With a solemn voice, he said. \u201cNo need to panic! Leave it to your master.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a short incantation, he summoned a bolt of purple lightning and struck it to the back. Just as the horde of mad rabbits were about to be zapped, the rabbit at the very front suddenly flapped its ears and propelled itself upwards. Ahmm! It swallowed the lightning\u2026 swallowed it\u2026 swallowed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao weakly turned her head. \u201cMaster\u2026\u201d What happened to the promise of leaving things to you?</p><br/><p>His expression was still as calm as usual. With a wave of his hand, he called out his Life Artifact and grabbed onto his disciple. After taking a deep breath, he said with a serious look. \u201cLet\u2019s run then!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a speed ten times faster than earlier, he turned around and madly flew off\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, on their first day in the tower, the master and disciple duo ran to as if their life depended on it, while being chased by a horde of little white rabbits.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

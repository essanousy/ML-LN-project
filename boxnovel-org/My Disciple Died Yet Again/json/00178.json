From a filling and plump mushroom, he turned into a dried-out mushroom from all that crying, as though all of the water content had flowed out from his body in the form of tears.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s buttocks were already aching from sitting beside him, and only then did he finally stop his wails. Zhu Yao casually cast a few recovery spells on him, and he then reverted back to his human Wang Xuzhi look.</p><br/><p>Picking up the half piece of jade on the ground, he looked as though he had lost his soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cMushroom, where are you planning to go?\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but ask.</p><br/><p>Mushroom sniffled, kept the piece of jade, and then said. \u201cI\u2019m going to return to the forest, and plant Rock Spirit back into the soil. I want to see if he can grow back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d That\u2019s a rock, not a mushroom. How could it possibly grow back? Wait a minute, he couldn\u2019t possibly be thinking of burying that stone back into that pile of dirt, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, for helping me retrieve Rock Spirit.\u201d Mushroom nodded towards Zhu Yao and Xu Nuoyan. After such a long time since they met, he seemed to have learnt a few manners.</p><br/><p>\u201cMushroom.\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but call out to him. \u201cUmm\u2026 Are you still going to seek trouble with those two people?\u201d He best not act crazy, and seek them for revenge.</p><br/><p>Mushroom\u2019s expression instantly turned furious. \u201cI\u2019m going to exact revenge for Rock Spirit!\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected!</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom how I see it, the Rock Spirit in your hands shouldn\u2019t have been killed by those two people earlier. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have carried this \u2018corpse\u2019 on them everywhere they went, right?\u201d Zhu Yao emphasized on the word \u2018corpse\u2019.</p><br/><p>Mushroom blanked for a moment, and his expression looked a little hesitant. \u201cThen\u2026 Who killed Rock Spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>She killed herself!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Even if she knew, she couldn\u2019t tell you. Without her looking after him, with his low-level cultivation, and with how naively stupid he was, if he were to sillily send himself to death, how would she save him? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you first return to the forest and plant it in the soil for now? It might really grow back. Once it wakes up, you can ask it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mushroom nodded. \u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Phew~</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. She finally managed to divert his attention.</p><br/><p>Mushroom\u2019s expression looked better than before too, as he hurriedly bid her farewell, and flew towards the forest where the Lightning Divine Hall was on his flying sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your mind at ease now?\u201d Xu Nuoyan stepped up, and looked at her with a smile. \u201cYou sure treat that mushroom well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment. Earlier, he did not make a single sound for the entire time, so she had unconsciously ignored his existence a little. He sure was patient to accompany her in her long wait.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to Cloudhold City then.\u201d Zhu Yao summoned her celestial sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Xu Nuoyan however blocked her way. Reaching out his hand, he waved past her face, removing her disguise. She then returned to her former look. \u201cYu Yao looks better this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shivered. A strange feeling rose in the depths of her heart. At that moment, she suddenly felt that Xu Nuoyan was a little dangerous. She took a step back out of reflex, building a little distance between them.</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan however did not continue to lean closer to her, as he flew on his flying sword alongside her.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhu Yao did not dawdle like before, and instead, accelerated towards Cloudhold City.</p><br/><p>Cloudhold City was situated on a island, and at the very center of the island, a large pillar of light was piercing into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Door is already opened. It seems like the ascending individual is about to arrive.\u201d Xu Nuoyan said.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao realize that it was the light of guidance. Hence, she flew directly towards that pillar of light.</p><br/><p>At the source of the light, was what seemed to be altar-like place situated at the center of the island. Light was currently emitting out from the circular formation at the center of the altar.</p><br/><p>There were already several people standing in the surroundings. Looking at the insignia on their sleeves, they were all disciples of Fluorescent Wind Sect.</p><br/><p>They directly landed at the center of the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother Xu.\u201d Those disciples evidently recognized Xu Nuoyan, as they enthusiastically walked over to greet him. However, they were not that familiar with her, so they simply sized her up with a short glance, and paid no further attention to her.</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan did not have any intentions to explain either, and asked. \u201cHas the ascending individual arrived?\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of several disciples instantly paled. They exchanged glances between them, before one of them at the center stepped forward. \u201cSenior-martial brother Xu, we are unsure of the cause, but the ascending individual has still not arrived in the higher realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d Xu Nuoyan frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been about seven hours.\u201d The disciple replied.</p><br/><p>About seven hours? Zhu Yao was a little startled as well. The light of guidance would only appear in the lower realm when the ascending individual passes the ascension lightning tribulation, guiding the individual on the path of ascension. Since it had been about seven hours, it proved that the lightning tribulation had already ended for a long time, so why hasn\u2019t the individual appear?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much time left?\u201d Xu Nuoyan looked towards the light of guidance, and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very most, the light of guidance will disappear in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan sank into silence for a moment, before turning to look at Zhu Yao at the side. \u201cYu Yao, what do you think of this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Zhu Yao blanked for a moment. What did this have to do with her?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, the ascending individual most likely don\u2019t wish to ascend at all.\u201d Xu Nuoyan found himself an excuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be possible!?\u201d The disciple at the side could not help but refute. \u201cSince that person has already brought upon the lightning tribulation, if he does not choose to ascend, he will not get another chance in the future. If he doesn\u2019t ascend, without a divine body, he can only wait for his death when his lifespan expires in the lower realm. How can there exist a person who is willing to die, instead of choosing to ascend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026 That person still has matters to attend to, or\u2026 someone he can\u2019t let go of?\u201d Xu Nuoyan looked towards Zhu Yao at the side, and his smile grew even deeper.</p><br/><p>That expression again. Zhu Yao was getting goosebumps all over body again. She could only shift her gaze and continue to stare at the light of guidance.</p><br/><p>The other disciple did not reply, and simply treated his words as a light joke. This light of guidance was a pathway which mortals must take to become deities. Only through the baptism from passing this light could one achieve an immortal body, attaining everlasting life. While the reason why practitioners in the lower realm seek the Dao, was exactly to obtain this goal. So could one easily give up on this opportunity?</p><br/><p>The light was already growing weaker, and it seemed to be close to dispersing as well. The disciples of Fluorescent Wind Sect who were present were all a little confused.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the earth shook. A bright red light flashed on the formation where the light of guidance was being emitted from, spreading towards all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d Zhu Yao simply felt her waist tightening, and then, she was carried away from her original spot, flying towards the sky.</p><br/><p>The ground was beginning to split apart inch by inch, and the earth collapsed into the cracks. The cracks began to grow, and several houses and trees had already collapsed as well. Zhu Yao widened her eyes, as she suddenly felt that this scene was a little familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Door is about to close.\u201d A disciple exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYet another one!\u201d Someone responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is already the fifth one in recent years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, more and more Heavenly Doors are closing for no apparent reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that the Heavenly Door so close to the sect would close as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao recalled it now. In her previous life, she seemed to have seen such a scene once before. Back then, the Heavenly Door of Lightning Spiritual World was closed, and now, another one here was closed. From the conversation of these disciples, the Heavenly Doors of various worlds were being closed. Was this normal?</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao, are you alright?\u201d Xu Nuoyan\u2019s voice, which carried a hint of worry, sounded next to her.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, and only then did she recall that she was still in his embrace. For a moment, she felt a little uncomfortable, as she immediately pushed him away, and floated on her own flying sword. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as though Xu Nuoyan did not see her scornful look at all, as he smiled without a mind. \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt a little uncomfortable again. His words sounded as though she was ungrateful.</p><br/><p>Mn\u2026 It seemed to feel that way alright.</p><br/><p>More and more people were being forced to fly on their flying swords, and the cracks formed from the collapse were already quickly being submerged by the ocean water. A beautiful island was instantly cracked and split apart, and even the former look of the ascension altar could no longer be distinguished. The light of guidance emitting from it was growing weaker as well.</p><br/><p>Just when the final strand of light disappeared, a yellow figure suddenly flew out, and a complacent laugh sounded throughout the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! The gods have not abandoned me!\u201d</p><br/><p>A person suddenly appeared in the sky. He was dressed entirely in yellow, and even his hair was yellow in color. A single word immediately surfaced in Zhu Yao\u2019s mind. A minion!</p><br/><p>He did not have a single flying tool beneath his feet, however, he had a large pair of wings growing on his back, yellow in color! With every single flap of his wings, a large gust would be brought about.</p><br/><p>\u201cA demonic immortal!\u201d An unknown person exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would a demonic immortal ascend from this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder he took such a long time to ascend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do? He seems to have come prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd seemed to be in a fluster. A demonic immortal\u2019s strength had always been tougher than deities in the first place. What\u2019s even more important was that demonic immortals were tightly-knitted, and they had always treated ascended demonic immortals with extreme importance. Since this one had appeared here, there would definitely be a group of them coming to welcome him in a moment. Earlier, he had been delaying his arrival to the higher realm, most likely to wait for his companions to receive him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sensible enough, then hurry and scram. Do not block this mighty one\u2019s way.\u201d The minion complacently glared at the crowd of deities. Just as he was thinking of flapping his wings and fly away, he unexpectedly turned around to give another glance, and his line of sight fell on Zhu Yao. His eyes fiercely widened, and brightly shone right after.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt her heart skip a beat, as she suddenly had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>As expected, that minion decided not to leave. In a flash, he appeared before her, and grabbed onto her arm. \u201cMiss, why don\u2019t we become friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. Sizing him up for a moment, she then pinched a layer of meat on his claw, and forcefully twisted it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t become friends with\u2026 demonic beasts with poor tastes!\u201d As expected, things like little animals were really hateful.</p><br/><p>The minion painfully released his hand, yet, he wasn\u2019t the least bit furious. The snowy shine in his eyes were like lit candles. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, if we can\u2019t become friends, you can marry me. Let me bring you back to the demonic continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he seriously moved to pull Zhu Yao towards him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an icicle was sent straight towards him. The figure of the minion flashed, and the icicle flew past Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cA mere beast dares to have such wishful thinking.\u201d Xu Nuoyan took a step forward, and blocked Zhu Yao. His voice was as cold as ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you pop out from?\u201d The minion was furious as well, as he ruthlessly glared at Xu Nuoyan. In an instant, the flaps of his wings became even more forceful. \u201cI like that girly, so hand her over to me. Once the people receiving me arrives, I will let all of you here go, how about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was speechless. Even though she was referring him as a minion, his intelligence shouldn\u2019t approach that of an actual one in the animated movie, right!?</p><br/><p>Xu Nuoyan did not reply, instead, his smile grew even colder.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirly, girly!\u201d The minion desperately waved his claws at her. \u201cReturn home with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just where did he get his confidence from? Although he was a demonic immortal, he had only just ascended. The people here were all Profound Immortals, alright? Instead of taking this opportunity to flee, he actually dared to threaten them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

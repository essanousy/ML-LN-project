Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone, and hurriedly opened it. \u2018Shuaaa.\u2019 What revealed itself was a vivid diagram of a human body, and her face instantly darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Chen Ning became even more gleeful as he touched the leather of those books. \u201cThese are all treasures among treasures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis book as well?\u201d Zhu Yao waved the \u300aWorld Singularity Record\u300b about.</p><br/><p>Momma\u2019s egg. Do you think this old lady here isn\u2019t able to see that it\u2019s a porno after changing into a different character?</p><br/><p>Chen Ning was startled. The gleeful expression he had before, instantly exploded into a ripe tomato.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 That book\u2026 I didn\u2019t place it there.\u201d Chen Ning swiped away the book in her hands, and tried to cover up for himself. \u201cWho\u2026 Who placed this here? That person simply lack of morals! Such shameful texts! This is too outrageous!\u2019</p><br/><p>How outrageous is it? If you dare, don\u2019t embrace it so tightly! Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at him. She then turned her head around and continued to look at the other books.</p><br/><p>Shen then spotted a pitch-black scroll. A part of the written words were completely blurred, and she could faintly see the word \u2018Chronology\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Zhu Yao curiously picked it up. The book and scrolls here were mostly white or blue colored, only this particular scroll was black.</p><br/><p>Chen Ning patted the \u300aWorld Singularity Record\u300b on his chest. After confirming that he had placed it well and nicely, he then looked at the scroll in her hands. \u201cThat scroll is a chronicle written by the Ancients. It doesn\u2019t really have any use, as it\u2019s simply a record of the events that happened long ago. Though, that scroll is made of Tinkling Jade Thread, so it\u2019s very precious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao opened the scroll, only to realize that what was recorded was not ancient words, but various pictures. From carefully inspecting it, a part of it was made up of celestial mountains and lands of blessings, though, there are various types as well. There were never-seen-before demonic beasts, and there were demonic beasts which were as large as mountains, while there were ones that were as small as worms as well. Most of them had strange and unique figures. The further one read, the uglier the demonic beasts became. Zhu Yao harbored the thought of \u2018just how ugly could the last one be\u2019, and continued reading, only to realize that the last one was stained black by a huge patch of ink.</p><br/><p>The hell, this feeling where the ending was in sight, only to realize that the author had ragequit, was simply too frustrating!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhu Yao was even in the mood to tear this scroll apart! Unfortunately, the scroll was too hard, and seemed to be reinforced by some formations as well, as it could not even be torn.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt a knot in the depth of her heart, when suddenly, the corner of her robe was tugged.</p><br/><p>When she lowered her head to look, Yue Yin who had been obediently following by her side, was slowly nodding up and down. It seemed like he was tired.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao squatted down, and spread open her arms in front of him.</p><br/><p>Yue Yin paused for a moment. His little face was still as emotionless as ever, yet, he reacted extremely quickly. Taking a big step to the front, he hugged onto her neck.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao then hugged him up, and stroked his little head. \u201cSleep then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the little figure relax, and calmly went into deep sleep.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh. This child, Yue Yin, was a little too obedient. He was not neither noisy nor talkative. Sometimes, when he became quiet, his existence could even be subconsciously forgotten.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, do you wish to look at these as well?\u201d Chen Ning suddenly popped in, hugging a large pile of ancient scrolls and books in his hands with a flattering expression. \u201cThese are all my precious collection.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao glanced at the big bulk that he was holding in front of his chest. In regards to his precious collection, she really did not have that much an interest in them.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I have to go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Ning\u2019s expression instantly sank, and he looked at her with a disappointed look. \u201cDo you really not wish to take even a single one?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, and had no choice but to pick up that black scroll out of goodwill.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I will take this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Ning\u2019s eyes instantly shone, and hurriedly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have matters to attend to, so I will be leaving.\u201d It wasn\u2019t good for a demonic beast to be too enthusiastic. Zhu Yao hugged Yue Yin tightly, and left Qiwu Pavilion. Flying on her sword, she flew towards Azureflight.</p><br/><p>A few minutes later.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d Zhu Yao looked at the figure behind her, and her head began to ache.</p><br/><p>Chen Ning resoundingly replied. \u201cThis subordinate pledges his life to serve Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>Serve your sister! This old lady doesn\u2019t want a follower at all. Honestly, you imprinted onto me, haven\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao really didn\u2019t know just how effective was the so-called dragon bloodline towards demonic beasts. Why was it that, as long as she released her dragon\u2019s aura, she would be chased by such demonic beasts that would pester her to no end? He wouldn\u2019t go away after a beating, nor would he move from being scolded.</p><br/><p>No matter how horrible her words were, he would still reply with a smile. \u201cAs long as lord wills it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, roll on the ground!</p><br/><p>And in the end, he really went to roll on the ground, before he continued to follow her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao no longer had any ideas, hence, she could only allow Chen Ning to follow her all the way back to Azureflight.</p><br/><p>In just a few short years, Azureflight had already adopted a whole new look. The ruined grounds that had been razed and destroyed by the heretic practitioners back then, had already changed into a different sight. Although the traces of repairs could still be seen everywhere, the place was filled with vitality.</p><br/><p>Unsure if it was because Sesame had sensed her presence, when Zhu Yao arrived on the mountain peak, all eighty three little radishes, including Yu Yao and Sesame, had already stood neatly on the plaza in front of the main hall, waiting for her arrival.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings to Sect Master.\u201d A resounding and collective voice rang, as all of them bowed towards her together.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood boys and girls.\u201d Zhu Yao waved her hand.</p><br/><p>She then began to size up the crowd of little radishes. No, they could no longer be called little radishes. Evidently, every single of them had grown by a single head, and the youngest among them was already ten years old.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Yu Yao was undoubtedly the happiest, as she hurriedly walked over.</p><br/><p>Only to be intersected along the way. A white figure flashed, and he pounced straight towards Zhu Yao. \u201cMistress, meow~~\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stepped to the side.</p><br/><p>Bam! Sesame\u2019s face made contact with the ground.</p><br/><p>However, without a mind, he crawled up, and hugged her leg. \u201cMistress, little beastie really missed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Zhu Yao wanted to pull out her leg with all her might, however, no matter what she did, she was unable to. The hell, Sesame. Do you have to be this shameless every single time you appear!?</p><br/><p>Just when Zhu Yao was about to adopt a more forceful approach, Yue Yin, who was in her arms, suddenly woke up, as he rubbed his eyes.</p><br/><p>His legs moved, as though he wanted to get down. Hence, Zhu Yao instinctively released her hand.</p><br/><p>And thus, with his little feet, he stepped straight on Sesame\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Sesame instantly released his hands, and began to cry at the corner, while holding onto his face which was printed with two footmarks.</p><br/><p>Good job! Zhu Yao gave little Yue Yin a thumbs up. However, he simply looked blankly at her, before he spontaneously pulled onto the corner of her robe.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, these two people are?\u201d Yu Yao looked at the two people behind her, and simply ignored Sesame\u2019s shameless action. That\u2019s right, she was already used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will speak of this matter later.\u201d Zhu Yao greeted the little radishes, and at the same time, began to examine their homework.</p><br/><p>Probably because she was present this time, the little radishes worked especially hard in their practice matches. In actual fact, Zhu Yao\u2019s trip to Celestial Indus Sect this time, did not even make up a total of ten days. Including Wu Song, among them, there were already five people who had built their Foundation. And, there were even ten who were at the tenth level of Essence. It seemed like, in less than two years, a half of the little radishes here would have built their Foundation.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the method of training in a group was really doable. Not only was it effective in actual battles, it was extremely good in raising one\u2019s cultivation level as well. Although everyone had differences in their cultivation speed, the difference among those in the same team was not significant.</p><br/><p>After Zhu Yao was done examining their homework, she casually pointed out a few amendments, and the sky had already begun to darken. Thus, she scattered everyone, and had Wu Song and Yu Luo enter the Main Hall.</p><br/><p>She gave Yue Yin and Chen Ning some simple introductions. She didn\u2019t expose Chen Ning\u2019s identity as a demonic beast, and simply brought up his matters as a merchant. However, naturally, this matter could not be hidden from Sesame. After all, Sesame himself was a demonic beast, and had long seen through his real identity with a single glance. Adding that he was a tenth-ranked demonic beast as well, all the more did he see him as an eyesore.</p><br/><p>Ever since they were at the plaza earlier, the two of them had been staring at each other for a long time. Zhu Yao could even faintly see the sparks that were flying between their eyes, though there basically wasn\u2019t any gay feelings going on.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao sighed. Compared to that pair, Wu Song and Yu Luo could be said to have feelings that had lasted for a long time. Especially the eye contacts they made every once in awhile, where one of them would gaze at the other lovingly while the other would look on shyly, could basically blind the eyes of a single loner.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, who was that single loner, silently lowered her head and looked at Yue Yin who had already fallen asleep in her embrace. Alright then, she could barely be considered as one of a pair.</p><br/><p>I really miss master!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two should be tired as well, go on then.\u201d Stop harming this single loner whose crush was in a different place. \u201cYu Luo, pack up, we will be returning to Ancient Hill Sect tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Luo was startled. The reddened face she had earlier instantly paled a little.</p><br/><p>Wu Song exchanged glances with her, before stepping out. \u201cSect Master, this disciple still has some uncertainties with his cultivation, and require senior-martial sister to provide more pointers. If possible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible?\u201d Zhu Yao chuckled. \u201cIf possible what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Song seemed to be a little afraid of looking at her expression, and only stutter out a moment later. \u201cIf possible\u2026 Have her\u2026 Have her stay here for a few more days, so as to guide\u2026 this disci-, no, the disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at him. Oh? Trying to take my disciple away from me? How can it be this easy? \u201cAzureflight had only been established recently, and there are many matters to attend to. I only have this one precious disciple of mine, how can I bear to have her stay here to suffer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019m not afraid of suffering.\u201d Yu Luo hurriedly expressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take good care of senior-martial sister.\u201d Wu Song immediately spoke up as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you going to take care of her? And for how long?\u201d Zhu Yao continued with her questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, the longer senior-martial sister is willing to stay, the longer I will take care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever to betray her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Zhu Yao patted heavily on his shoulders. \u201cI will then hand my disciple to you then. I\u2019m watching you, alright? Oh, right. You best prepare a bigger dowry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Wu Song was startled, only a moment later did he understand what she meant. Instantly, his face flushed. He slowly looked towards Yu Yao, and after seeing that her face was even redder than his, he revealed a silly smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Yu Yao acted as though as she was furious, and glared towards her.</p><br/><p>Yo, you actually became embarrassed at a time like this? If you have the ability, don\u2019t laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only speaking the truth. The person Wu Song wishes to marry is the daughter of the Ancient Hill Sect Master, you know? He must show some sincerity, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d The little radish erupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we can speak of this matter again in the future.\u201d Zhu Yao curled her lips. She must still give Wu Song some time to save up money, right? She wondered just how Zi Mo would react if he were to know of this piece of news. Thinking about this, she really looked forward to it!</p><br/><p>After that, she instructed them on the Sect\u2019s matters that would accumulate in these upcoming days, before having them head out to arrange a residence for Chen Ning.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame, stay behind!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zhu Yao was still unsure if Xiao Yi\u2019s \u2018BUG\u2018 characteristic had weakened, because he had gone for closed-door training, and he swore that before reaching the intermediate stages of Nascent Soul, he definitely would not come out of closed-door training. The Sect Master had simply wanted him to not leave Ancient Hill Sect for two hundred years, yet, he went for closed-door training on his own accord. He had just formed his Nascent Soul not too long ago, so to reach the intermediate stages of Nascent Soul, at least, he would only be able to leave his closed-door training after five hundred years. Both the master and disciple were keeping themselves in their own homes at the mountain peak.</p><br/><p>It seemed like flirting was not the only thing Xiao Yi knew. He still had a functioning brain, and knew that he had to lay low and keep to a low profile. At the very least, from the surface, he seemed to have broken off completely from Rui Yu. This would also give him a good reputation inside the Sect. However, not contacting Rui Yu, did not mean that he had no connections with the rest of the girls. Everyday, Zhu Yao could see waves after waves of girls casting their arts to send various spiritual grass and medicinal pellets to the mountain peak.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao shook her head. She really could not figure how what these girls, who kept coming one after another, were thinking in their hearts. Even idol fans would not be this crazy, alright? She really did not know what their motives were. Sighing deeply, she turned her head to glance at the mountain peak, and suddenly, an evil idea popped up.</p><br/><p>Heheheh, when the time comes, it will definitely be very lively.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao made a firm decision in her heart. However, she lacked of a helper, hence, leaving a trail of dust clouds behind her, she ran to look for Zi Dan. He was definitely the best helper she could find.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao told him her thoughts, and as expected, Zi Dan\u2019s eyes brightened up as well. \u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea. Why don\u2019t we find senior-martial brother Sect Master now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when the two was planning to leave, Sect Master Zi Mo had already came to look for them. Recently, the Sect Master\u2019s mood was pretty good, probably, he\u2019s in high spirits because of the happy event. It had been more than a few thousand years since he cultivated into a Nascent Soul, yet suddenly, he found out he had a successor, as his wife was pregnant. Naturally, Zi Mo was exhilarated by this piece of news, and when one\u2019s too happy, it would be easy to go crazy. Hence, he no longer involved himself in the sect\u2019s matters, and the things he was managing had reduced. Every day, when he had nothing to do, he would stroll around the various mountains, and when he saw people, he would ask these questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a practitioner-pair? Do you have a companion? Do you have a child? Hehe, I do!\u201d Zi Mo smiled like a daisy.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s face darkened. Are all people who are becoming fathers this crazy?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother!\u201d Zi Dan sighed. \u201cThis is already the third time you\u2019re asking me these questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Did I ask them before?\u201d Zi Mo stroked his own white beard. \u201cHaah, junior-martial brother, don\u2019t take offense to it. You know, I\u2019m about to become a father, and I have too many things on my plate. Thus, I will always forget one or two matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>If you have too many things on your plate, then why do you still have the time to take a stroll, hey? Zhu Yao silently retorted. Suddenly, she recalled the bunch of miscellaneous matters he pushed to her. He couldn\u2019t have pushed all of the matters to her, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations to you! Congratulations for becoming a father!\u201d Zhu Yao said a few words as a small retaliation.</p><br/><p>However, Zi Mo completely did not understand the meaning behind these words, and even chuckled and gave an apology. \u201cMuch thanks, junior-martial brother. Don\u2019t worry, you will have your chance as we- Uh, seems like you won\u2019t ever get your chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What do you mean by that, hey?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, look at your impatient faces, where are you guys heading off to?\u201d Zi Mo asked.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zi Dan recall the important matter, and thus, told Zi Mo their thoughts as well.</p><br/><p>Zi Dan nodded his head after hearing it. \u201cThis idea can indeed solve the issue once and for all. However, are you two sure that this is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother can be at ease about this.\u201d Zi Dan patted on his fats to guarantee it. \u201cIn these so many years, I have always paid attention to matters regarding the Beast-Taming Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Only then did Zi Mo give his nod of approval. \u201cThen this matter is decided. Tomorrow, I will bring this up to senior-martial aunt, but, I will have to trouble junior-martial brother to personally make the trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, Zi Dan did not reject his request. On the morning of the second day, he had already made his preparations to head up to the peak of Beast-Taming Mountain.</p><br/><p>Although Zi Mo was a little worthless these few days, he was still dependable with the things he did. When Zhu Yao arrived, the Mountain lords and elders had all been seated in the hall. As for old man Zi Mo, he was currently carrying his daisy-like face, persistently telling the people present about his parenting role.</p><br/><p>Just when everyone was getting tired of hearing it, Zi Dan returned while carrying a strange expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Zi Mo stepped forward and asked. Zhu Yao was a little anxious as well. He couldn\u2019t have been rejected, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial aunt Feng Yi agreed to it.\u201d Zi Dan said.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. Since she agreed to it, why did you frown for?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, this matter has been decided then.\u201d Zi Mo turned and looked towards Hongchou behind him. \u201cJunior-martial sister Hongchou, when do you think we should do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis can be considered to be a happy occasion. When I return, I shall inform Ling Long to make her preparations.\u201d Hongchou smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good, good.\u201d Zi Mo stroked his beard, his face was filled with creases from his smile. Lowering his head, he made some calculations. \u201cIncidentally, there\u2019s a very auspicious date five months later. Why don\u2019t we hold junior-martial Xiao\u2019s practitioner-pair ceremony then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hongchou nodded. \u201cI will heed to senior-martial brother Sect Master\u2019s plans.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the idea that Zhu Yao came up with, was to have Xiao Yi marry Ling Long. All he thought of everyday was flirt, although she knew he was a harem master, it\u2019s not good to not bear the responsibilities for his actions. Ling Long could be said to have followed him since young, the woman he knew the earliest. However, in the dream, Ling Long was infatuated with him, but other than sending Ling Long to the Medicine Mountain in the beginning, he did not bring her along during his ascension later on. Even her appearances with him were very little, as though he had forgotten her existence. Simply because she was a Tri-Spiritual Veins holder, and could not keep up with his pace which was guided by a golden finger.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had also only decided on her after a long consideration. Even with so many girls by his side, he still wished to leave after eating and wiping his buttocks clean? How could it be that simple? Once your debt hits a certain limit, eventually, you will have to return it.</p><br/><p>A practitioner-pair companion was not just an ordinary wedding. In the cultivation world, there could only be one practitioner-pair companion, unless one of them were to die or was unable to ascend. And practitioner-pair arts were able to bring benefits to cultivation, and it could be said that they could raise their cultivation at the same pace. If, a man were to have an affair with another woman after having a companion, then he will be shamed by everyone in the world, and if he was not careful, he might be mistaken as a heretic practitioner who practiced absorbing someone else\u2019s cultivation.</p><br/><p>What she was unable to predict however, was how the rest of the girls would react after knowing that Xiao Yi would be forming a practitioner-pair. She kind of felt that a war of an extremely large scale might happen, especially when there\u2019s that Demigod-stage Rui Yu. Just by thinking about it, she could not help but feel a little excited!</p><br/><p>And Xiao Yi was unable to reject it, because his master had agreed to this matter. Also, currently, he still harbored feelings for Ling Long, so he basically could not find an excuse to reject it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, do you have some sort of relationship with senior-martial aunt Feng Yi?\u201d Zi Dan suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled for a moment.</p><br/><p>Zi Dan continued. \u201cWhen I went to propose this marriage, senior-martial aunt was initially really happy. However, the moment I said it was for Xiao Yi, her expression sank. And she even asked why it wasn\u2019t you who\u2019s proposing this marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026 cough, cough\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao choked on her tea, and she coughed so much her face had reddened, and her throat had turned coarse.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, about that, most probably, the sovereign has some misunderstanding about me. Hoho.\u201d Holy. Feng Yi couldn\u2019t have been that happy because she thought Zhu Yao was asking for her hand in marriage, right? Not good, in the future, it\u2019s best to hide a little further away, and prevent Feng Yi from finding her. It would be terrible to have Feng Yi hate her for life due to love, before watching Xiao Yi\u2019s great show.</p><br/><p>The news of Xiao Yi marrying Ling Long, a disciple of Medicine Mountain, was quickly spread within Ancient Hill Sect. As Zhu Yao had expected, Xiao Yi did not express any objections, but, he did not really warm up to the idea either. There were still five months to the wedding, and with closed-door training as his reason, most of the matters were arranged by the Medicine Mountain.</p><br/><p>However, in the end, Zhu Yao was unable to attend their wedding, because Sect Master\u2019s wife was about to give birth.</p><br/><p>In the early morning, she was dragged to Sword Mountain by Wang Xuzhi, and as they walked, he was excitedly telling her this piece of news.</p><br/><p>Although Zhu Yao really resented Zi Mo for pushing a bunch of matters to her, however, she was still rather happy for him for having a child. Zi Mo was the Sect Master, and adding that his relationship with people was great, seemingly at the moment they heard of the news that his wife was about to give birth, all of the Nascent Soul practitioners in the sect had made a beeline for the Main Mountain.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yao arrived at the little house at the side hall, she was shocked by the huge crowd of people inside.</p><br/><p>They were either sitting or standing, and only old man Zi Mo, was walking back and forth in the house. He was especially eye-catching, and after a while, he once again casually pulled someone over to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy wife will be alright, right? Didn\u2019t you say she will be pregnant for ten months? Why was it brought forward by a month?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how long do we have to wait? Can I see her now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I hear anymore sounds? I could still hear them just earlier, though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it will be a boy, or a girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill there be danger? Can I help? Will something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>The face of the person whose hand was grabbed darkened. \u201cSenior-martial brother, sister-in-law, at the very least, is a Nascent Soul practitioner as well, nothing will happen to her. Also\u2026 If you were to grab onto me any tighter than this, something will definitely happen to my hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zi Mo release his hand, and continued to walk about in the house. After walking back and forth a couple of times, he once again asked the same few questions.</p><br/><p>So the old man had the potential to be a chatter-box as well. Zhu Yao was silently speechless, as she hurriedly found a place to sit, to prevent Zi Mo who was overly anxious from grabbing her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had always felt that women giving birth to children was something very sacred, yet, a little brutal as well. After all, those who were mothers had to experience that degree of pain. But, what\u2019s mysterious was that there was not even a single sound coming from the room.</p><br/><p>But after thinking for a moment, she understood. After all, she was a Nascent Soul practitioner as well, if she were to feel excruciating pain like a mortal, then that would be too embarrassing. Most probably, she had a special way to allow the child to be given birth safely, after all, she had never heard of any children dying due to a hard labor among those practitioners with children.</p><br/><p>After sitting in the house for less than an hour, the cry of a baby could finally be heard from the room, among the crowd that was quietly waiting with expectations, the sound was especially resounding. Smiles surfaced on everyone\u2019s faces, and everyone congratulated Zi Mo one after another.</p><br/><p>Old man Zi Mo was laughing so much, his mouth was unable to close.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the door was opened, and the person who came out was exactly the Sect Master\u2019s wife, and in her embrace was a little baby. Everyone gave her their congratulations as well, and Zhu Yao curiously looked at the baby.</p><br/><p>The baby is finally born. I wonder if it\u2019s a male bug, or a female bug.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao who had clearly seen the baby\u2019s face: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, why is she a BUG!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked at the three grey letters that were printed on the little face, and at that moment, she even felt like killing herself. The smile that she had brought up earlier had stiffened on her face.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was so furious she wanted to flip tables, and in her heart, she had already cursed and swore all the various vocabulary she had.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t there supposed to be a single bug, and that\u2019s Xiao Yi? Why is a child who has just been born a bug as well? Can someone explain it to me?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he was not the only one who could bring about an apocalypse, and this child could as well? Just how weak was this world, to the point where apocalypses could be brought about so easily and casually?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

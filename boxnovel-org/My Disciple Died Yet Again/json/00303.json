Was being able to see the colours of spiritual energy a specialized skill which Realmspirit had given her? This was why she could raise her cultivation so quickly every single time. However, with something like Realmspirit\u2019s personality, he couldn\u2019t have given her a cheat without informing her. Even something as heaven-defying as the World Favourable Impression was openly hanging above her head, let alone something like this. Not filling up her vision with screens would have already been pretty nice of him, there wasn\u2019t a reason for him not to inform her of such a setting!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the things Realmspirit gave her were always different for each avatar, and they would disappear along with the avatar. This was the same for World Favourable Impression as well. Though it seemed like its effect was still active, the button above her head to toggle it was indeed gone. Yet, this setting where she could see the colours of spiritual energy, had persisted till now since she officially began cultivating.</p><br/><p>Then there was only a single possibility\u2026</p><br/><p>The colours had always been there, while the difference was being able to see them. Back then, she had after all spent five years before being able to see them. Since she was able to see them, then others should be able to too. This was most likely related to a person\u2019s IQ.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt that such an important cultivation method should not be wasted, as she carefully recalled the feeling she had when she first saw spiritual energy. She gave little tyrant a rough explanation, before seeking out a place where the five types of spiritual energy were the most concentrated and letting go into closed-door training.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle tyrant, you can try sensing the five types of spiritual energy while taking them into your body. Use your heart to feel them. I can\u2019t guarantee that you will be able to see them like me, but I hope you won\u2019t give up easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn!\u201d He heavily nodded.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stroked his head satisfyingly. \u201cNo matter the outcome, I hope that you can establish your Foundation in five years, can you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression sank, yet his eyes slowly turned determined. \u201cGrandma, I will work hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, grandma shall await the day you\u2019re out of closed-door training!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao walk out of his cottage and place down formations in the surroundings. She blankly stared at the cottage that shrouded with spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a slightly chilly hand landed on her head, stroking her hair. \u201cWorried?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zhu Yao turned around and closed in, her head buried in his chest. \u201cMaster\u2026 Tell me. What should I do if he won\u2019t be able to see spiritual energy no matter what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan was silent for a short while, before he reached for her waist and said in a solemn voice. \u201cIf he can\u2019t see it, will you give up on him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Zhu Yao raised her head. \u201cAm I someone that irresponsible? Since I have already decided on little tyrant, naturally, I will take responsibility till the end. If he really can\u2019t do it, then there\u2019s really no way to solve the bug in this world. Of course, even if it\u2019s not for the bug, I will definitely cover for little tyrant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s there to worry?\u201d He stroked her hair and asked back.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled as she raised her head to look at her own master. The dispiritness in the depths of her heart was swept away in an instant. She tightly hugged him back, and nodded heavily. \u201cMn, I\u2019m not worried. With master here, I have nothing to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard this, his face which was as cold as ice, gradually loosened. He lightly raised the corners of his lips, and at that moment, it was as if spring had returned to the lands, revealing beauty that was beyond compare. \u201cStupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>A moment later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are you going to make me a monkey?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 I really want to get pregnant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsensical!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little tyrant was in closed-door training, the frog was chased towards the forest to watch over the place, and her master was pulled into the room. Zhu Yao who felt relaxed all over, believed that she should do some unique exercises in this dark, windy, and lonely night, in order to progress their master and disciple relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Wang, what are you?\u201d A certain master looked at his stupid disciple\u2019s hand which was grasping onto his waist belt, frowning disapprovingly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re already calling me \u2018Desire\u2019, so I should live up to the name. Otherwise, I would be disgracing the name, you know?\u201d Clothes, strip, strip!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master is now but a strand of divine sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. You said that you wanted to make a monkey with me.\u201d Ever since they returned from the modern era, they hadn\u2019t been doing anything embarrassing. This was her fighting for regular welfare.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Zhu Yao pulled apart his outer garments. \u201cEven if you cry your lungs out today\u2026 Ah pui, in any case, I won\u2019t let you go! No matter who comes, it won\u2019t happen! So why don\u2019t you obediently obey me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister! Seventh elder sister! Hurry and open the door!\u201d Suddenly, bangs resounded from the door.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoba, you\u2019re dead meat!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s fury instantly surged, her teeth grinding. Yet that stupid bird outside which could not read the situation was still knocking the door to no end. It felt as if he wouldn\u2019t relent till the door was open. She had to take a few deep breaths before she could stop her thoughts of eating his fat and juicy meat.</p><br/><p>She walked over with heavy steps, strongly pulled the door open, and freaked out. \u201cLittle! Eighth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister\u2026\u201d A red fur ball came charging towards her chest like a cannonball. Before Zhu Yao could even react, Little Eighth had already begun crying out loud. \u201cSeventh elder sister\u2026 Seventh elder sister, what should I do? Wuuaaahh\u2026 I don\u2019t want to live anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank, her fury instantly dissipated. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She had watched him grow for such a long time, yet she had never seen him cry like this. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry. Tell your seventh elder sister what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she asked, Little Eighth began to cry even sadder than earlier. \u201cI\u2019m going to be as ugly as seventh elder sister now, I might as well die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Stinky brat. He was already this saddened, yet he still did not forget to step her in the foot. This thing was definitely not related to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did the beasties in the forest bully you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWuu\u2026\u201d He shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fancied one of the beasties, but was rejected?\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued to shake his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t court a beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour auntie\u2019s husband came?\u201d</p><br/><p>He still shook his head?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>He nudged a little while, before finally stopping his wails. After a while, under her concerned gaze, he weakly stretched out one of his wings and pitifully said. \u201cLook\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao curiously closed in, only to see it was entirely covered in red feathers, and nothing else. \u201cLook at what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 This!\u201d He anxiously used his other wing to point at it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao carefully looked at it once more. \u201cNothing\u2019s there at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Eighth instantly grew anxious. \u201cLook carefully, at the top! Top!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Left without a choice, he strongly waved his wing and did a throwing action. What she saw next was a fluff, the size of a fingernail, fluttering down from the air. Before it even landed on the ground, Little Eighth immediately grabbed it as if it was treasure, and then carefully held it with his wings. \u201cSee that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeathers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d He nodded. In an instant, dispiritedness began to surface again. \u201cFeathers. I\u2019m shedding feathers. Seventh elder sister\u2026 I\u2019m actually beginning to shed feathers. Wuaah\u2026 What should I do? Becoming a ball is already pitiful enough. If I were to shed feathers as well, I will become as ugly as seventh elder sister. I don\u2019t want to become a phoenix with naked buttocks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She really wished to cut off ties with him!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao took a deep breath and managed to suppress her fist. She picked up a certain bird which was still crying, flung him out, and then closed the door with a bang.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Go get someone prettier as your elder sister.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the desperate knocking sounds resounded again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister, seventh elder sister! Come out, seventh elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m your only little brother, seventh elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just toss me aside, seventh elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die ugly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise that I won\u2019t despise you for being ugly anymore! Please help me think of something!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if people don\u2019t acknowledge me as a Phoenix after all of my feathers are gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister\u2026 Seventh elder sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing ugly is death itself!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips were twitching to the point where it could even break out of a certain net novel author\u2019s computer. Only after a long while did she finally manage to suppress the impulse to kill her biological younger brother. \u201cScram! You\u2019re just freaking molting, the hell you\u2019re crying for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMolting?\u201d That certain Phoenix who had long forgotten memories of his faraway youth, was startled for a moment. After a short while, even louder knocks resounded from the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister, what\u2019s molting? Is it really fine for me to shed feathers right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill they grow again? Seventh elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will they grow back? Seventh elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill the newly grown feathers look even more beautiful than now? Seventh elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I still the most beautiful Phoenix? Seventh elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo all Phoenixes go through the same thing? Seventh elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill I still be able to return to my past form? Seventh elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Are you treating me as Zhao Zongxiang\u00b9? Someone who\u2019s specialized in explaining the world of animals? And a Xianxia version at that!</p><br/><p>Only then did the knocking finally stop. Zhu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. When she thought that this worry-filled little brother had finally walked off, his faint voice sounded once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh elder sister, I can\u2019t sleep. Why don\u2019t you accompany me on a talk about feathers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you think my new feathers will look like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill they look the same as before? But I\u2019m not really satisfied at the sixty-fifth feather at the third row of my left wing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think they will look better after they are regrown?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I end up growing up to look like some other Phoenixes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn. If it happens, I want to become like second elder brother, or third elder brother, or even fourth elder brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not seventh elder sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, don\u2019t stop me. I\u2019m going to pull out all of his bird feathers!</p><br/><p>Ever since he found out that his feathers would regrow, and discovered that new and completely clean feathers would appear on his own wings every few days, Little Eighth had stopped worrying about shedding feathers. However, his feather shedding problem grew even worse, and the process seemed to be pretty long. In order to conceal this uglifying process, he no longer caused problems for the demonic beasts that filled Peaceful Spiritual Forest. Before this, every day, he would snatch away the spiritual herbs that demonic beasts were protecting, or burn away the treasures that belonged to them. Yet, those demonic beasts that were being harrassed all looked as though it was their honour for such acts to have occured on them. She had to be the one feeling embarrassed in her little brother\u2019s stead. </p><br/><p>And so, Little Eighth made a nest\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, he knew how to make a nest. Inside it was filled with various soft spiritual herbs. That\u2019s right, they were all snatched away from those demonic beasts as well. The nest wasn\u2019t huge, and it was placed in the courtyard of her home. He had even added in a lid, shutting himself inside like an egg shell. He had even swore that before his feathers were completely changed, he definitely would not disgrace himself by showing himself to others.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t even budge when Zhu Yao used melon seeds to lure him out, swearing that even if he were to die, he would die beautifully. </p><br/><p>1.

The woman\u2019s clothes were in a mess, she was panting heavily, and her eyes were filled with fear. This woman was an Earth Deity, but the divine energy on her body was not exactly condensed. Her footing was a little unstable, and one of her hands was holding onto her other shoulder. As her fingertips were faintly dyed in red, it seemed that she was injured as well.</p><br/><p>The three men in front of her were surrounding her, and the man at the center should be the one leading the group. He carried a fierce-looking face, and there was even a long scar cutting across it.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, run. Why don\u2019t you continue to run?\u201d The man smiled complacently, but he had already forced the woman into a position where she could no longer retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people\u2026 What are you planning to do?\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was already faintly carrying a tearful tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re planning to do?\u201d That person gave an even more obscene smile, as he sized up the woman from head to toe. \u201cHeheheheh, I have already told you in the city, that I will have you obediently become my practitioner-pair companion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to become your furnace!\u201d The woman loudly rebuked. She experienced so much hardship in order to finally ascend and become a Deity. Even when she was in the Lower Realm, she had never stooped down to such a level, so how could she endure such humiliation the moment she ascended?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not up to you to decide.\u201d That man cast an art, sealing the woman\u2019s movements, and instantly pulled her into his embrace. With a forceful tug of his hands, he ruthlessly tore a part of her mystic robe, revealing the snow-like skin within.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. As long as you\u2019re obedient, I will naturally treat you well.\u201d The man smiled especially complacently. Even the two people at the side were simply smiling as they watched this scene, as though they had long gotten used to this.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease me, release me\u2026\u201d The woman struggled with all her might, and even her throat was turning hoarse from all the screaming.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not stand to watch this any further, as she instantly flew down, and shouted out loud. \u201cRelease that girl, let me do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three ruffians: \u2026</p><br/><p>Girl: \u2026</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 Pui. That was out of habit.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh\u2026 I mean, hurry and release her.\u201d As expected, when seeing such irregular events along the road, there\u2019s a need to properly prepare her lines as well. \u201cBullying a maiden under broad daylight, you people are acting too outrageously, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you pop out from? Such a busybody.\u201d The leader did not feel even the slightest of fear, though, his anger had surged. \u201cIf you\u2019re sensible, then go away for this great Deity. Otherwise, I will give you a good beating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me!\u201d Before Zhu Yao could even reply, the woman anxiously called out for help, and her tears were even beginning to pour out. \u201cThey want me to become a furnace, and when I was unwilling to do so, they\u2026 Fellow Deity, please save me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrench.\u201d The man scolded out, raised his hand, and gave her a slap. \u201cThis great Deity have thought highly of you, yet, you don\u2019t know how to appreciate it. Come on, scream for help. Continue with your pleas. Even if you scream till your throat breaks, no one will come to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was already bursting with flames of fury. Casting a wood elemental art, a long vine was formed. The long vine wrapped itself around the woman\u2019s waist, and with a forceful pull, it pulled the woman away from the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. I\u2019m Till Your Throat Breaks.\u201d Zhu Yao took a step forward, and shielded the woman. I\u2019m going to handle this meddlesome affair alright.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to step in for her?\u201d The man instantly furiously exploded, as killing intent emitted out from his body. \u201cYou best think carefully. If you offend us three brothers, there\u2019s no need for you to think about peacefully going around these parts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao did not even feel like bothering with this little ruffian. Turning around, she glanced at the woman whose clothes were in a mess. \u201cLeave this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman blanked. She hesitantly looked at her for a moment, before nodding. Summoning her own divine sword, she flew away. Even if she stayed behind, she would simply be deadweight for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d The man\u2019s anger had reached its peak. Instantly, a gigantic ferocious aura exploded forth from his body. The aura was astonishingly dense, even the sky had instantly darkened. In a moment, a terrifyingly strong wind blew.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was shocked as well. Earlier, she was unable to see through this person\u2019s cultivation level, and thought that he must had concealed it. Seeing this amount of force now, his cultivation should be above hers, he was either a Gold Deity, or even a Heavy Deity!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao gritted her teeth, and tightly grasped the sword in her hands. Whatever, giving a trash like him a beating would just be light punishment for him. Taking a step back, that woman had already left anyway, if she couldn\u2019t beat him, she could run as well.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, master had said that she could face him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheheh, little girl, are you afraid now?\u201d The man seemed to look very complacent at the effect he had created. With belittling narrowed eyes, he looked at her. \u201cIf you admit your mistake now, and give me a hundred sounding kowtows, I can leave your life intact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all these nonsense in a fight?\u201d Raising her hand, she summoned a bolt of heavenly lighting, and struck it towards the position where he was standing on. At the same time, she flew up, and charged towards him with the intent to attack.</p><br/><p>The man blanked, and his expression instantly paled. However, he did not take the bolt of heavenly lightning head-on, nor did he cast a defensive art. Instead, he swiftly rolled on the ground, leaving the radius of the lightning attack.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao, however, did not mind about his battle methods, because she had already flown right about the man. Aiming at the man who was still rolling on the ground, she forcefully kicked him\u2026</p><br/><p>And\u2026 She hit him.</p><br/><p>It was just a casual attack, but she actually kicked her mark!</p><br/><p>The man groaned as he flew several meters away from the kick.</p><br/><p>For a moment, Zhu Yao did not know if she should sigh in praise at her good luck, or if it was because he did not open his eyes. With a kick like that, even if it was a regular Earth Deity, he should still be able to dodge it easily, right? But her attack had actually landed its mark.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned, and for a moment, a daring guess surfaced in the depths of her heart. Flying towards him, she continued with her attacks. And, the situation right after, had stemmed her guess. In every attack that she had thrown out, he did not have the intention to block any of them. No, to be exact, he was basically powerless to block them, let alone make a counter attack.</p><br/><p>In an instant, in the entire field, only the screams of a man could be heard, as though they were the cries of a pig which was about to be killed.</p><br/><p>This person, was simply\u2026 delightfully and refreshingly weak.</p><br/><p>The hell. His cultivation level was as low as this, yet he actually had the galls to become a ruffian?</p><br/><p>She did not even need to use her sword, you know? Zhu Yao simply stabbed her sword into the ground, rolled up her sleeves, and concentrated on greeting that ugly face of his. Left hook punch. Right hook punch. Uppercut. Overhand. Vertical kick. Horizontal kick. She struck him with a stream of various attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cOw, ow, ow\u2026 Stop hitting, stop\u2026\u201d The man covered his face with his two hands, yet, it wasn\u2019t the slightest bit effective at all. His face quickly swelled up like a pig\u2019s head. And even the hands which he used to try to block her attacks, had swelled up like a pig\u2019s trotters as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what you get for learning bad things. This is what you get for playing around with maidens. This is what you get for acting strong when you\u2019re not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Deity\u2026 I admit my mistake, please have mercy. I really admit my mistake\u2026 Ow, ow, ow\u2026 It\u2026 It hurts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao bashed him for exactly an hour. Only when she could no longer find anywhere she had not bashed on that pig-face of his, did she finally stop.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a long time since she bashed someone to her heart\u2019s content. So refreshing! It was no wonder her master said that she could face him head-on.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao slapped her hands, picked up the sword by her side, and turned to stare at the other two men at the side.</p><br/><p>The two trembled, and their faces instantly turned as pale as paper. Without any backbone, they knelt onto the ground, and, as a huge gift, prostrated in front of her. \u201cGreat Deity, spare our lives. We admit our mistakes as well, really!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao kicked the pig-face on the ground. \u201cSpeak. Just what level of cultivation do you have? What\u2019s with that aura earlier as well?\u201d Although this person was unbelievably weak, that surging aura did indeed come from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will speak, I will speak\u2026\u201d The man instantly pleaded for his life. With his swelled eyes that looked like light bulbs, he looked at sheepishly. As fear still lingered in his heart, he crawled back a little distance. \u201cThis little one, is an arrow spirit which has gained a human form after cultivating for seven thousand years in the mountains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn Ero spirit\u00b9?\u201d Zhu Yao sized him up for a moment. \u201cMn, you indeed lack of morals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that \u2018ero\u2019, it\u2019s the \u2018arrow\u2019 that is used for shooting with a bow.\u201d The man hurriedly explained, as he rubbed his purplish face. \u201cMy true body is an arrow which belonged to a High Deity of the Divine Realm. After the fall of the Deity, I fell deep into the mountains. Due to a great opportunity and coincidence, I awakened my spiritual consciousness, and I was then able to become a spirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s with that fierce aura of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because before the fall of my owner, he followed the Dao of Slaughter. All of his weapons possessed an immensely fierce aura.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that frighteningly fierce aura belonged to his former owner. Zhu Yao looked at him with narrowed eyes. \u201cI say, you. You\u2019re called ero, so why do you have to be so cheap as well? Can\u2019t you just cultivate properly? Why the hell do you have to bully a lady? What kind of hatred or enmity do you have, that made you want to kidnap that lady as a furnace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Deity\u2026\u201d That man no longer had the fierce and forceful look he had earlier. Raising his purplish face, he said aggrievedly. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely at fault either. On the streets, she loudly proclaimed that she wanted to look for a husband. This little one has been single till now, and she was even dressed that way either, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell.\u201d Zhu Yao once again kicked him. \u201cWhat does a person\u2019s fashion style have to do with you? This isn\u2019t a reason for you to be a greedy beast. Based on your logic, if a person carries money on the streets, then he should be robbed, so that person has to be blamed for being rich? If a person has a life, then he should be killed, since that person has to be blamed for reincarnating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d The man was at a loss of words. Just as he was about to explain, she once again interrupted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore!\u201d Zhu Yao glared at him coldly, as she cracked her fists. \u201cI disfigured your face, because you were born ugly. So you deserve a beating!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat deity, spare me! This little one admits his mistake, I will never dare to do it again.\u201d The pig-faced arrow instantly submitted to her, bent onto the ground, and became even more honest. \u201cThis little spirit will definitely mend his ways, cultivate properly, and be a good arrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to be ero, don\u2019t do it on others, just do it on yourself!\u201d Eh, something\u2019s a little strange here?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have learnt my lesson, great Deity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you great Deity for the kindness to spare my life.\u201d The pig-faced arrow then slowly crawled up. With a bun-like head, and a respectful look, he bent his waist. Suddenly, he twisted his wrist, pulled out something from his sleeves, and threw it towards her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao!\u201d Her master\u2019s voice instantly rang in her ears.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao reflexively summoned a bolt of Purple Extreme Heavenly Lightning.</p><br/><p>A bolt of purple-colored lightning struck directly onto the pig-face in front of her with a loud bang, even the talisman in his hand had disintegrated into dust. The pig-faced arrow\u2019s Dantian instantly shattered. Puah. He spat out a mouthful of bad blood, splattering all on her Zhu Yao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The hell, this pig-face actually dared to launch a sneak attack on her! With her fist raised, she thought about pummeling him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an immense red light emitted from her entire body. The light was so glaring, the two followers at the side even had to turn their heads away. Everywhere visible to the eyes was enveloped by the red light.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>Immediately after, she simply heard a \u2018ting\u2019 sound by her ears. The divine energy in her entire body was currently dispersing at an extremely quick rate, and in the next instant, she reverted back to a piece of jade.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao fell onto the ground, and within that flaming red light, she saw a row of large golden words.</p><br/><p>\u201cBinding of dimensional space: Success!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>\u00b9(Ji\u00e0n) \u2013 Arrow, has the same pronunciation as (Ji\u00e0n) \u2013 Cheap and despicable. In regards to why I chose \u2018Ero\u2019, which means pervert, as the translation, I did not want to translate the pun literally, otherwise, the impact for you English viewers wouldn\u2019t be there. Ero, though stems from Japanese, sounds the same as Arrow, and since it fits the context, I went along with it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

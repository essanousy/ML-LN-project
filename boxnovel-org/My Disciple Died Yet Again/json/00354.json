Logically speaking, since her master had explicitly said that he would only place her inside the storage mystic artifact for three seconds, one and two seconds were fine, but he definitely wouldn\u2019t go past three seconds. However, right now, let alone three seconds, three hundred, three thousand, and even more than thirty thousand seconds had passed. Yet, she was still staying in her body live and well.</p><br/><p>This could only prove that either her guess was incorrect and had played herself, or\u2026 she was too far and the signal had been cut off. In any case, she wouldn\u2019t be returning to that sword anytime soon. She did not know if this was good news or bad news, but being locked here definitely wasn\u2019t good news in any way. After the two Demonic Immortals brought her to the Demonic Immortal Palace, they simply threw her into jail. What happened to the promise of becoming friends!?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, after the investigation is over, we can see each other again~\u201d Leaving those words, the yellow and red Demonic Immortals waved their sleeves and left, leaving their beloved behind.</p><br/><p>cao\uff01</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao stayed in the jail that was filled with formations for two days, yet no one came to investigate her. It wouldn\u2019t do if things kept on like this. She had to get out. Though she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the Demonic Immortal Continent, she should still send her master a message and report about her wellbeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame, have you studied this formation before?\u201d She looked at the surrounding formations for a long while, yet she was still unable to determine their properties. Left with no choice, she sought Sesame, who was familiar with the terrain, for help. That\u2019s right. She wanted to break out of prison.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, Sesame doesn\u2019t know either. However, the formations of Demonic Immortal Palace are very unique. Even the strongest of Demonic Immortals won\u2019t be able to break out of them.\u201d Sesame replied, its voice faintly carried a small amount of pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I heard that the formations here were all constructed by the former Demonic Immortal Palace\u2019s Demon King, and they\u2019re run with bloodlines. No one\u2026 Ehhh!?\u201d Before he could even finish, Zhu Yao stood up, patted off the dust on her robes, and walked straight out. Easily, and without any pressure at all. Sesame looked like he had just seen something illogical. \u201cMistress, how did you get out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that all Demonic Immortals aren\u2019t able to get out?\u201d Zhu Yao clicked her tongue. \u201cI\u2019m not a Demonic Immortal.\u201d What does formations that are placed down with bloodline restrictions have to do with me!?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The Demon King is going to cry in the toilet.</p><br/><p>Though Zhu Yao had gotten out, she did not dare to leave the prison gates so casually. The formations inside were all duds, but the entrance was being tightly guarded by large number of troops. Before she even release her divine sense, she sensed the might of Gold Deities standing on the left and right of the entrance. Charging out with brute force was not an option. Furthermore, the Realm Tide would only end a year later, so even if she got out of here, she wouldn\u2019t be able to return to Lightning Divine Palace. For a moment, she did not know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, go south then.\u201d Sesame suddenly suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame paused for a moment, before he gently said. \u201cBecause\u2026 I have a friend over there. He\u2019s incredible. He might know of other methods to enter the Deity Continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Zhu Yao felt suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>She sized up Sesame who was in her divine sense. \u201cA beastie like you has a friend too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Mis\u2026 tress!\u201d Though this one doesn\u2019t have any morals, I still have the rights to make friends, alright!? \u201cHow can you be so unconfident of your beastie, I\u2019m after all still\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking nonsense!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately interrupted it. \u201cLet\u2019s first figure out how to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt a little troubled. When comparing martial strength, she definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat them, and her reinforcements were even a few thousand kilometers away. Not to mention, this place was the Demonic Immortal Palace, which had the most concentrated numbers of Demonic Immortals. Unless she activated hacks, she shouldn\u2019t even think of leaving.</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>A conversation window suddenly popped out.</p><br/><p>The hell, he\u2019s actually truly thinking of giving me hacks, hey!?</p><br/><p>The words on the conversation window this time were rather simple and written nicely: Friendship Hack Concealment System (Trial Pack). Activate, or Cancel?</p><br/><p>\u201cConcealment!\u201d Zhu Yao grew excited and she immediately tapped on the \u2018Activate\u2019 button on the screen.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, her body began to fade inch by inch. From her legs, to her waist, and then slowly, her entire body disappeared. After that\u2026 poof. Sesame was thrown out.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress\u2026 what\u2019s going on?\u201d Said the flustered Sesame, unaware of situation.</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 She didn\u2019t know either! She tried and realized that she wasn\u2019t able to put Sesame back into her divine sense at all. Could this be the limitation of the trial version? The features were too limited, weren\u2019t they?</p><br/><p>Before she could figure everything out, Sesame\u2019s cry lured in the guards at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d The two Demonic Immortals charged in. They saw Sesame on the ground, and looked as if they had just seen a ghost. \u201cYour highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell\u2019s with this \u2018your highness\u2019?</p><br/><p>While she was in doubt, Sesame had already been neatly tied up like a dumpling.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease me, hurry and let me go! I\u2019m a beastie with a master!\u201d Sesame struggled for a long while, yet to no avail. With the two Demonic Immortals holding onto each end of its body, Sesame was carried out.</p><br/><p>Since it was after all her family\u2019s beastie, Zhu Yao had no choice but to follow after them.</p><br/><p>Because of her concealment hack, she was not discovered along the way. The two Demonic Immortals happily carried Sesame into the highest temple of Demonic Immortal Palace. As they walked, they even shout out their lungs to announce to the entire world. \u201cHurry and inform the princess! Your highness Sesame has returned!\u201d It lured in a crowd of spectators.</p><br/><p>Sesame\u2019s entire face turned green and its struggle grew stronger. \u201cRelease me! What are you two greedy beasts going to do to me? I will never go along with it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Can you please not drop your morals at a time like this?</p><br/><p>However, no matter how it shouted, its cries had no effect. The two Demonic Immortals joyously carried it into a large hall, threw it on the ground, and then knelt to pay their respects. \u201cMy king, we discovered your highness Sesame in the heavenly prison earlier, and so we brought him here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d A mighty voice sounded from above. \u201cWell done. You two may leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the two Demonic Immortals stand and make their way back, leaving behind Sesame who was tied into a dumpling. Zhu Yao raised her head and saw an elderly with white hair and white beard sitting at the throne above the tall stage. He wore a dark robe, and blood-coloured patterns could be seen embroidered on it. His cultivation level was hard to discern, it was most likely above that of a Heavy Deity. He should be the Demon King that the people spoke of.</p><br/><p>He lightly swept his eyes towards the \u201cdumpling\u201d on the ground. Even though she was under concealment, Zhu Yao could still feel the pressure emitted from his body. She could not help but feel worried that he was going to do something to Sesame.</p><br/><p>\u201cStinky brat, you\u2019re finally back\u2026\u201d He lightly spoke up and then walked down the stage. An unseeming smile raised from the corners of his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s the second time now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, if you have the guts, then release this daddy!\u201d Sesame struggled like a fish that had been washed ashore. \u201cOld man, give up. I will never marry that precious daughter of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Demon King\u2019s expression darkened, frowning. He raised Sesame up and furiously said. \u201cYou\u2019ve already gone done to the Lower Realm twice, yet why can\u2019t you just learn how to be obedient? As long as you agree to marrying Gong Lan, this position of the Demon King would be yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sound as though I really want it.\u201d Sesame rolled its eyes. \u201cThis daddy doesn\u2019t like her, and so I don\u2019t want to marry her. I like to be unrestrained and free.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Demon King\u2019s expression sank, but he patiently continued to persuade Sesame. \u201cWhat\u2019s bad about Gong Lan? You two grew up together since young, and you two even ascended together. Just how is she unworthy of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything about her is unworthy of me?\u201d Sesame continued to be stubborn. \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry a two-legged beastie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The Demon King became furious. \u201cGong Lan is of the feathered race! Have you ever seen a feathered race with four legs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Sesame said with a shameless look. \u201cI don\u2019t like two-legged people. I only want to marry a little sister of the same race\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re basically being heartless, unreasonable, and nonsensical!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the heartless, unreasonable, and nonsensical one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how heartless I am\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Uhh\u2026 why are things developing in such a strange direction, hey?</p><br/><p>Wow! Looking at these two\u2019s informal manner of talking, their relationship isn\u2019t that bad as I thought? It seemed like she was worried for nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour race is hard to come by in the first place. Since you really want to find someone from the same race that much\u2026\u201d The corner of the Demon King\u2019s lips twitched, and it looked as though he wished he come bash him up at this moment. He panted heavily and said. \u201cThen find me one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI found one.\u201d Sesame\u2019s eyes instantly shone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame signaled him to release its bindings. The Demon King hesitated for a moment. Seeing that it wouldn\u2019t play any tricks in front of him, he released his bindings with a wave of his hand. With a flip of its hand, Sesame instantly brought out an enormous egg next to him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. It was that Spirit Guiding Beast\u2019s egg from the Lower Realm. The chap Sesame really brought it to the Higher Realm.</p><br/><p>Hugging onto it like it was treasure, Sesame said with shining eyes. \u201cLook, old man! This egg has the same aura as mine. I found it in the Lower Realm. It definitely is of the same race as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn egg like this!?\u201d The Demon King frowned. Just as he wanted to comment further, a Demonic Immortal entered and reported. \u201cMy king, Princess Lan wishes to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao clearly saw Sesame trembling for a moment. Its two hands that were initially tightly holding onto the egg even loosened a little, as though it subconsciously wanted to hide. Is the female lead about to make her appearance? Zhu Yao became excited. After realizing that the Demon King did not have ill intentions for Sesame, she unconsciously fell into drama-watching mode.</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow her in.\u201d The Demon King hesitated for a moment, before he said with a wave of his hand.</p><br/><p>In just a few moments, footsteps could be heard from the entrance. A handsome and heroic-looking woman entered. She was dressed in a battle armor, as though she had yet to have the time to remove them. There wasn\u2019t any other expressions on her face. With a calm look and an upright stance, her entire body was radiating with unspeakable might.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 So cool!</p><br/><p>Even Zhu Yao could not help but give her praise. She had never seen a woman who could be this handsome before. Seeing how Sesame was rejecting this princess so intensely earlier, she even thought that the princess had very terrible looks. In reality, not only wasn\u2019t the girl ugly, she was actually this handsome.</p><br/><p>Sesame, are you blind?</p><br/><p>Gong Lan slowly walked in, her eyes narrowed at Sesame on the side. However, it had only been for an instant, and she turned her eyes away right after. Clasping her hands, she greeted the Demon King. \u201cYour daughter pays respects to father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRaise your head, raise your head.\u201d Compared to Sesame, the Demon King was clearly being gentle, like the drizzling rain in spring, towards this princess. He personally went up to hold her up. \u201cHow\u2019s your mission to Cold Imperial Forest this time? Are you injured anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, father, for your concern.\u201d She replied with a serious look. \u201cFortunately, I have already restrained the Sharpice Beast, and it\u2019s now being sent to the heavenly prison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good, good.\u201d The Demon King grinned as he patted on Gong Lan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re back. Coincidentally, Sesame is here as well. Let\u2019s use this opportunity to set up your marriage ceremony then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Lan was stunned. Sesame however immediately exploded. \u201cAre you serious!? Old man, you have gone crazy! I already told you so many times that this daddy here doesn\u2019t like her one bit! I don\u2019t want to marry her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d The Demon King glared at him. \u201cThis matter will not be discussed. Even if you don\u2019t want to, you have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis daddy here isn\u2019t going to marry. If you have the guts, then kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t dare to!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching the two about to turn their verbal argument into a physical conflict, with a frown, Gong Lan arched her body and said to the Demon King. \u201cMay I request my king to cancel his marriage with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The Demon King was shocked. He looked at Gong Lan with eyes of disbelief. \u201cYou\u2026 Ever since you were young, didn\u2019t you wish\u2026 Lan\u2019er, you must think over this carefully, don\u2019t make such decisions in haste. Don\u2019t worry, if this brat dares to bully you in the future, this old man will be the first one to beat him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Lan turned to look at Sesame with a complicated expression. Heavy-hearted, she looked as though she was concealing many things that could not be put into words. Looking at Sesame\u2019s slight shiver, she awkwardly turned her head back.</p><br/><p>She shook her head with a light smile. \u201cNo need. It\u2019s all playful banter from our younger days, it can\u2019t be treated as real. Now\u2026 Let\u2019s treat it as though this engagement has never happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLan\u2019er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d Gong Lan still continued with a humble tone. \u201cHe\u2019ve gone down to the Lower Realm twice. He has already paid a suitable price. Even if we continue to push him regarding this matter, what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Demon King sank into silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 You said it yourself.\u201d Sesame weakly leapt up. \u201cYou musn\u2019t regret it! I will be leaving now. You\u2019re not allowed to chase after me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Lan turned to glance at him, the complicated feelings in her eyes had already disappeared, becoming clearer than before. \u201cYour highness, be well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame choked, as though it had just heard something that he it could hardly believe. It\u2019s face was filled with complications.</p><br/><p>\u201cStinky brat! You want to run now? Do you think it will be that easy?\u201d The Demon King was furious, looking as though he wanted to settle some debts. However, Gong Lan stopped him.</p><br/><p>Sesame sprinted out of the large hall and left the Demon King\u2019s palace without turning back. Because it was too sudden, Sesame had even forgotten that it could fly. Zhu Yao had almost lost track of it, and when she caught up, Sesame was already lying tired on the ground, panting like a dog. However, a gleeful smile was all over its face, looking as though it had struck a jackpot. \u201cHahahaha\u2026 I finally no longer have to marry that ugly thing! Awesome! Mistress\u2026 Mistress\u2026\u201d It danced about for a long while, and then began to look around for Zhu Yao. Though it couldn\u2019t see her, as a contracted beast, it could still sense that she was by its side. Mistress, hurry and come out. Accompany this beastie in its joy.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to cancel the concealment buff on the top right corner of her peripheral vision, a red figure suddenly flashed in front of her. Gong Lan who was still in the large hall earlier suddenly appeared. Sesame was shocked, and then it looked at her cautiously. \u201cYou\u2026 What do you want now!? I\u2019m telling you\u2026 you were the one who said that you wanted to cancel the engagement. Don\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t even think of regretting your decision! I don\u2019t like you one bit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gong Lan did not speak. She simply passed Sesame a pearl-like bead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Sesame was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cTasyoluk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao blanked. Tasyoluk? Isn\u2019t that the Secret Realm where I first met Sesame?</p><br/><p>Gong Lan gently said. \u201cThis is something your mother gave me back then. When you were punished and thrown down to the Lower Realm back then, I had it follow you to the Lower Realm. When you returned the first time, I had it return. Now\u2026 Since it\u2019s something that belonged to you in the first place, I\u2019m returning it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Sesame was dumbfounded for a moment. It hesitantly looked at the bead in her hand, as though it did not know if it should take it back.</p><br/><p>Gong Lan however simply stuffed it in its hands. \u201cFather is already at the level of a late-stage High Deity. In just a few more years, he will have to head to the Lightning Divine Palace and enter the tower. He doesn\u2019t have much time left here\u2026 You should come back to see him more often. After all, you are the one who truly harbours his blood.\u201d Immediately after, she turned around and materialized a pair of enormous red wings. With a flap of her wings, she did not hesitate, disappearing without a trace.</p><br/><p>Sesame held onto the bead and stayed motionless for a short while.</p><br/><p>A moment later, it then spoke with a blank expression. \u201cMistress, I\u2026 why do I feel so uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho\u2026 Trash!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

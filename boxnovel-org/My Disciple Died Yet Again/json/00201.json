When did a single Spirit Vein become a trash Spirit Vein, while having five Spirit Veins was the aptitude with the highest caliber? In the results of this Spirit Vein test, she and her master were both thrown aside, and theoretically speaking, they should have been assigned to the outer sect. As for Yue Ying, he was being auctio-, no, fought over by the three Sovereigns present in the hall, in order to take him in under their tutelage. Naturally, this included Yi Ling\u2019s master, Xuan Xu.</p><br/><p>As for the final outcome, seeing that Yue Ying was still \u201cyoung\u201d, it would be decided who would take him when he turns ten years old. And because of him, Zhu Yao was temporarily assigned to a cave residence in the inner sect.</p><br/><p>In regards to this, Zhu Yao expressed as such: All of you are blind as hell!</p><br/><p>The place they were staying in was extremely secluded, yet the spiritual energy was very rich. It could be seen that the Blue Parasol Sect was indeed paying very great attention to Yue Ying. Zhu Yao felt a little glad for this arrangement. Recalling the scenario, she had to set up camp for quite a long period of time here. The rich spiritual energy would aid them in quickly restoring their cultivation. Before gaining absolute strength, she had to do all she can to avoid that Mary Sue, Yi Ling.</p><br/><p>After scanning the surroundings, she felt that there\u2019s a need to set down some defense-related formations.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what kind of formation do you think should be placed here?\u201d She habitually turned to ask her master for aid, only to be frightened by the little dumpling at the side.</p><br/><p>His face was deathly pale, and he was holding his abdomen with one of his hands, his little face was covered in cold sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what happened to you?\u201d Zhu Yao hurriedly squatted down, and held onto his swaying body, her heart instantly tensed up. He couldn\u2019t possibly be facing some aftereffects from her resurrection, right?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu Yan frowned, his expression was a little dazed, and his breathing was a little ragged as he shook his head. \u201cYour master is unsure either\u2026 Though my abdomen is aching faintly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abdomen? Zhu Yao blanked, and in the next moment, she suddenly heard a growl.</p><br/><p>Her eyes reflexively stared at a certain someone\u2019s little belly. This sound couldn\u2019t be\u2026</p><br/><p>Gurururu\u2026</p><br/><p>Gurururururu\u2026</p><br/><p>It growled out a few times consecutively.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cMaster. You\u2026 Are you actually hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was clearly the miserable cry of a hungry stomach, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d Yu Yan who had abstained from food for several tens of thousands of years expressed as such: What\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Yue Ying immediately raised up his hand to make his existence known. \u201cI\u2019m hungry too.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, his stomach was emitting out the same growl.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall go find something to eat\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao sighed. Only then did she recall that it had already been three days since she left the forest, and it seemed like they really hadn\u2019t eaten anything since then? Since she had built her Foundation, she no longer needed to consume food. However, her master and Yue Ying were still at the Essence stage, so going hungry for three days must had long passed their limits.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, master\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao who just walked into the kitchen, once again turned around. \u201cI forgot to ask. Do you guys still need breast milk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan felt really depressed lately. Forget about turning into a fruit, after gaining his human form, he actually could only turn into a child. Yu Yan, who had already been an adult for several tens of thousands of years expressed that he was really uncomfortable with this body. Although his cultivation still existed, the spiritual energy within his body was pitifully little, and was merely comparable to the mid Essence stage. It had been a long time since he experienced this feeling of possibly depleting all of his spiritual energy in his body with a casual cast of a mystic art.</p><br/><p>And yet, he still could not restore his spiritual energy either. His current body was still too young, only about five to six years old, which was basically unable to endure too much spiritual energy. Even if he wanted to build his Foundation, he would still have to wait till he was ten years old. What he was even more worried about was that a Devil was tagging along beside him.</p><br/><p>He did not have much contact with Devils, so he couldn\u2019t figure out why this Devil wanted to follow his own disciple no matter where she goes. His disciple was so stupid, what could he do when she were to get trick by this Devil? Fortunately, until now, Yue Ying had yet to make any moves that would harm his disciple.</p><br/><p>And his disciple was so soft as well. For now, he could\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m tired. I want a hug.\u201d Yue Ying reached out his small hands towards Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, my leg hurts. I need a rub.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I want a kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That thin line in Yu Yan\u2019s mind snapped resoundingly. That chubby little face was instantly emitting out cold air.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying pouted, and did not continue forceful demands any longer. Tugging onto Zhu Yao\u2019s sleeves, he pitifully said. \u201cMom, I\u2019m hungry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could see that he was doing it on purpose as well. Pinching his small cheeks, he pointed at Yu Yan. \u201cFind your dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her own master had after all mastered all life skills. Even if he had turned into a child, his cooking skills were still on the professional level. Ever since Zhu Yao made that first meal for them, she then gave this honorable and arduous task to her own master.</p><br/><p>Mn. She was in-charge of miscellaneous tasks such as placing a small stool in front of the stove while he was cooking.</p><br/><p>Though, she wondered if it was because malnutrition, as even though they had never skipped any of the three meals every day, they would still feel hungry quite often. Until when she heard the conversation between the little trees outside her courtyard by chance, did she finally realize this problem.</p><br/><p>She was a tree demon, and her master and Yue Ying could barely pass as two fruit demons. As plant-type demons, though human food had a certain degree of effects, it was still not the main source of nutrition for them.</p><br/><p>What they required was\u2026 sunlight!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, although they had already turned into demons, they still needed to undergo photosynthesis.</p><br/><p>Thenafter, the first thing Zhu Yao did every morning, was to bring her master and Yue Ying out to the place in the courtyard which was exposed to the most sunlight, and bathe in the sun! And even with a method that covered every corner of their bodies.</p><br/><p>This had indeed proved very effective. At the very least, she no longer heard her master\u2019s belly growling hungrily again.</p><br/><p>However, a new problem surfaced. After bathing in the sun consecutively for a month, the two chubby dolls suddenly slimmed down. Even Yue Ying\u2019s double chin had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt that there was definitely a problem with her method of raising children, as she recalled about the various methods of growing plants. She then finally came with an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, why don\u2019t I dig a hole and bury the two of you? And see how it goes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although this method seemed really nonsensical, theoretically speaking, it was still possible. After all, ever since they gained their human forms, what they had been carrying out was soilless farming.</p><br/><p>Hence, Zhu Yao began digging\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu Yan and Yue Ying were standing at the side, watching with darkened expressions.</p><br/><p>Until when they jumped into the hole that was twice the size of their bodies, both of them were stunned. A warm energy flowed into their bodies, and it felt as though the fatigue that had piled up the last few days had been swept away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Zhu Yao squatted next to the hole, and asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan nodded. \u201cThis method is plausible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig SIs Yao, I feel more spirited now.\u201d Yue Ying answered as well.</p><br/><p>As expected!</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt at ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let me bury you two even deeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spilled a little bit of soil downwards, and just when she had covered their feet\u2026</p><br/><p>The two people who had slimmed down earlier, suddenly recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye, to the point when they were chubby in the past. And they had even grown two centimeters in height.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d They grew up after she spilled in some soil, if she were to spill more than this, would they directly sprout?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank. \u201cIt seemed like our current form is not our true state.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue state?\u201d Zhu Yao was a little confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat he means is.\u201d Yue Ying followed up. \u201cOur transformed state is not complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao inspected the two dolls. They did not lack any arms or legs. Pretty complete if you ask me.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like how mortals have to experience a few long years to grow.\u201d Yu Yan continued. \u201cWe most likely have to be buried deep into the soil to gain our complete form.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d In other words, they could only grow in the soil?</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao.\u201d Yu Yan sighed. \u201cOur cultivation is being restored.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, they basically did not need to take in any external spiritual energy. Just by staying in the soil, they could restore their cultivation while they grow up at the same time? That\u2019s too convenient.</p><br/><p>Even Zhu Yao did not think that the method she spouted out of without thinking would actually reap such unexpected results.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to add more soil.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was suddenly filled with vigor. Casting a wind-type art, she showered lumps of soil into the hole, instantly filling half of the entire hole. Just as she was about to continue\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!!!!\u201d A scream interrupted her.</p><br/><p>The wind whistled, as she felt something was charging towards her, carrying a sharp killing intent. Zhu Yao reflexively waved her hand, summoning a vine towards the direction where the whistling was coming from.</p><br/><p>\u201cTing.\u201d A clanging sound reverberated.</p><br/><p>An icicle fell onto the ground, stabbing shallowly into the soil.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you do this!? Hurry and release junior-martial brother Yue!\u201d Bug female lead Yi Ling was standing at the entrance, staring at her furiously. \u201cYou don\u2019t even let off your own son. You basically aren\u2019t fit to be a mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Why did she always leave her house without taking her meds?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually bury such young children in the soil. Are you still human?\u201d With a pained expression, Yi Ling looked at the children whose bodies were still half-buried in the soil, and said with a lecturing tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d After experiencing that framing incident in the great hall, Zhu Yao no longer had the slightest of good impression of Yi Ling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not here, how would I have known how vicious your heart is?\u201d Yi Ling ruthlessly glared at her. As though she was extremely furious, her face was flushed red.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I vicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth is laid before your eyes, and you still dare to deny it!?\u201d Yi Ling pointed at that huge hole which was half-filled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You actually want to bury them alive. You\u2026 You\u2019re simply a lunatic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBury them alive?\u201d The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched, and then let out a sigh. \u201cI say, girly\u2026 You have paranoid personality disorder, right? Who told you I\u2019m burying them alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Yi Ling interrupted her words. \u201cHurry and release junior-martial brother Yue, otherwise I won\u2019t be courteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haah, such bad temper!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not releasing him.\u201d Come bite me then.</p><br/><p>Yi Ling\u2019s expression sank. Pulling out a spiritual talisman, it seemed like she was going to throw it towards her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s hand flipped, and that vine earlier turned about and whipped forward, instantly whipping that spiritual talisman into two pieces. That spiritual talisman was half-activated, and since it was suddenly interrupted, it immediately blew itself up. A loud boom could be heard.</p><br/><p>Yi Ling, who was the closest from it, was within the disaster zone. With a miserable cry, her hair was instantly charred black.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao immediately used the vine to firmly entangle her. She had controlled the angle earlier, so that talisman did not really hurt her.</p><br/><p>She still wanted to struggle, so Zhu Yao directly cast an art and tapped on her forehead, sealing her spiritual energy. In the face of absolute martial strength, all cheating devices were merely paper tigers.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not help but retort. She was an Essence-stage practitioner, and her combat ability was terrible to that extent, just where did this girl find the confidence to make a direct move against her?</p><br/><p>Should she call her stupid, or stupid? Or maybe stupid?</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease me!\u201d Paper tiger saw that she was powerless to resist, and could only begin to bluff her way out. \u201cIf you dare to harm me, my master will not forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes, as she looked at the two little ones in the hole whose faces turned cold from hearing her words.</p><br/><p>Mn, my master will not forgive you either.</p><br/><p>But, what should she do about the present situation? Zhu Yao was a little conflicted. No matter if the incident today was a misunderstanding or not, the grudge had already been formed. She could be considered to have completely offended this bug. Currently, even if she tell her the truth, it would instead reveal her own trump card.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial brother Yue, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Yi Ling suddenly turned her head towards Yue Ying who was in the hole, and she instantly changed into a gentle expression. \u201cSenior-martial sister will definitely save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. Was this young lady blind? There were clearly two people in the hole, yet she\u2019s only looking at Yue Ying?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a moment, my master will make his way here. I will definitely save you out of this bitter sea.\u201d After saying that, she even meaningfully glanced at Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bitter sea\u2019 Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was indeed impossible to communicate with Mary Sue.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed as though there was something wrong with Yue Ying\u2019s antenna, as he did not even spare her a glance. Instead, he looked towards Zhu Yao, and sweetly said. \u201cMom, this hole burying game is so fun. Hurry and bury us even deeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGame!?\u201d Yi Ling blanked, her earlier flames of arrogance instantly sizzled down, her face was filled with disbelief. This was actually just a game?</p><br/><p>Good job. And there she thought she couldn\u2019t get out of this situation. She gave Yue Ying\u2019s wits a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-martial brother, you\u2026 you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Yue Ying still ignored her, as he reached his little hands out of the soil, waving at Zhu Yao. \u201cCome quickly, come quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d Zhu Yao released Yi Ling\u2019s restraints and walked over, stroking Yue Ying\u2019s head while she was at it. He really was too quick-witted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, bury me inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, dig me out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, hug.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Yue Ying suddenly pouted his lips. \u201cKiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She just knew that this little bastard was no good.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao flicked her finger on his forehead, and then dug the two of them out. They had been buried for quite a while now, she decided to continue tomorrow. For now, it\u2019s time to clean them up.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhu\u2026 Senior-martial sister Zhu.\u201d Yi Ling voiced out awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re still here!\u201d Zhu Yao turned to glance at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yi Ling seemed like she had something to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cBye!\u201d Zhu Yao instantly carried the two of them, and entered the building.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yi Ling then held back the words which she was about to say. With an embarrassed look, she tightened the grip of her hands, and instantly after, she felt incredibly wronged. The reason she was here today was because her master had the intention to take Yue Ying as his disciple, and thus she wanted build a good rapport with her future junior-martial brother. So, the moment she saw that junior-martial brother Yue was being buried into the hole, she believed that Zhu Yao wanted to harm him. She was merely worried for her own junior-martial brother.</p><br/><p>It was clearly that Zhu Yao\u2019s fault. Which mom would play with her son by burying him into the soil?</p><br/><p>Looking at the tightly shut door, Yi Ling snorted and stomped her feet. After a while, with a sunken expression, she turned and left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

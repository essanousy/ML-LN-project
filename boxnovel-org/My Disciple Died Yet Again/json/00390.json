He simply picked up a small soup dumpling with his chopsticks and carefully placed it in Guoguo\u2019s bowl. After seeing Guoguo eat it, the smile he carried was as if his entire being had bloomed.</p><br/><p>Hey, your character setting has collapsed!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is a Plane Manager?\u201d Though Guoguo grew curious and asked.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao hesitated for a moment, and then pulled Guoguo, who was still grasping onto a bun, into the room. With a click, she locked the door. \u201cGuoguo, I have something very serious to tell you. That person outside, he might not\u2026 be a regular person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Zhu Yao said with a calm look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was still a fish when he first came here. Today\u2026\u201d Guoguo thought of the breakfast on the table. After hesitating for a moment, she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a \u2018Mister Snail\u2019, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell is a Mister Snail? And the first time these two met, the man didn\u2019t appear in his human form either? Guoguo, just how thick are your nerves to actually stay this calm, hey!? This man definitely has some ulterior motives!</p><br/><p>\u201cGuoguo!\u201d She grabbed onto her shoulders and shook her. \u201cJust what is going on? How long have you known him? What has he done to you? Tell me everything!\u201d My only good friend is about to be taken away by an unknown and dangerous creature!</p><br/><p>\u201cStop\u2026 Stop shaking already. I will tell you\u2026 Actually, it\u2019s three months ago.\u201d Guoguo sighed and said. \u201cWhen I came back from my vacation, didn\u2019t I tell you about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree months ago\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao dug into her memories. It should be the time when she returned from her transmigration, as Guoguo did indeed just return from her vacation back then. Back then, she seemed to have suddenly asked her a very strange question. (Chapter 262) \u201cMermaid!?\u201d</p><br/><p>She remembered now. Guoguo seemed to have suddenly asked her if mermaids actually existed in this world. Back then, she wondered if Guoguo had crossed over to another world as well and had seen a sharkman? After that, she had to head out because of her master\u2019s incident, so she had forgotten about this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026 you really saw one back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. When I was on my vacation back then, I saw him dragging his huge fishtail, and was this close to dying dry next to the road.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 you saved him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Guoguo turned to look at her, and calmly said. \u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d Zhu Yao felt her jaw had dropped. \u201cYou\u2026 didn\u2019t save him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter seeing an unknown creature collapse by the road, if I don\u2019t run away, what else should I do? Stay behind and have lunch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 She makes a lot of sense. That\u2019s a human\u2019s normal reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 After that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that, I came home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why don\u2019t you act according to the usual script? \u201cThen why is he here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the night you moved out, he suddenly appeared in the bathtub. His fishtail disappeared as well.\u201d Guoguo raised the little soup dumpling that was still clasped between her chopsticks, and with an \u2018ahm\u2019, she swallowed it down.</p><br/><p>\u201cA man suddenly appeared inside your house\u2019s bathtub. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange?\u201d Where\u2019s your common sense? Where are your nerves?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s indeed rather strange.\u201d Guoguo nodded and said with a puzzled look. \u201cIf he\u2019s a fish and the place he was lying on did not have any water, why was he still able to run over to my house for water before being dried to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was that the main point here, hey?</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, don\u2019t worry. Compared to you, I have my own measures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why do I feel like I\u2019m being looked down upon?</p><br/><p>Guoguo immediately pulled her to the bed and settled her down. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about what\u2019s happening to you instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned to look at her. After hesitating for a moment, she still gritted her teeth and told her everything about how she was transmigrated to a cultivation world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the story. Realmspirit told me that this place is where the Plane Management Office is, but that guy was the first person I saw the moment I got here. So he definitely isn\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guoguo looked at with a strange expression for a moment. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that you found a part-time job in another plane, brought back a man while doing it, and even solved your problem of being a leftover woman. The reason why you came back today is to obtain a visa for your boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 You can put it that way.\u201d Her explanation was well-covered.</p><br/><p>Guoguo\u2019s expression turned even weirder. As though she was about to say something, there was a knock on the door at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuoguo, do you want to drink a cup of milk?\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s that man\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned for a moment. A mighty plane manager suddenly appeared here to wash clothes and make food for her best friend. She wondered just what was his motive? For a moment, she grew a little anxious. No, I must think of something\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGuoguo, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could even clear up everything in her mind, Guoguo had already pulled open the door. The diligent housekeeper was standing outside with a cup of warm milk in his hand. He was currently looking at Guoguo with sparkling eyes. \u201cMilk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Guoguo took it and proudly drank it all in one gulp. Then, she immediately went straight into the main point. \u201cYaoyao told me that you\u2019re a Plane Manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d If you\u2019re asking so directly, it would be strange if he replies truthfully, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d The man nodded.</p><br/><p>The hell! He really went and answered her, hey! Do you have to be that direct!?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you grant a plane visa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen grant Yaoyao a few. It\u2019s really difficult for her to find a man at her age. They can\u2019t break up just because they\u2019re in different places.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Uh, was a long-distance relationship the problem here? It\u2019s two Plane Movement Permits, you know? If it\u2019s solved so easily, I don\u2019t feel any sense of achievement!</p><br/><p>The man pulled out a pen and a book out of nowhere, and then wrote down a few things. As he wrote, he even raised his head. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao weakly stretched out two fingers. \u201cTwo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guoguo suddenly widened her eyes as she swept them across Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne for my husband, and the other for my little brother!\u201d Zhu Yao hurriedly explained. Withdraw that \u2018you\u2019re sitting on a fence\u2019 expression of yours, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cName?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yan, Yue Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGender?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMale.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOccupation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Temporarily unemployed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInch sized passport photographs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Why is there even a need for photographs as well? Flips table! Realmspirit didn\u2019t tell me that!</p><br/><p>\u201cGenetic information of soul fragments are fine as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t have them!\u201d Who the hell will carry someone else\u2019s genes and soul fragments, hey!?</p><br/><p>That man raised his head and coldly glared at her. With a smack, he closed the book in his hand. \u201cIncomplete information, review on hold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t! The hell you mean by \u2018review on hold\u2019, hey!? Just how hard do you think it takes me to cross over to another world, hey? Zhu Yao looked at her best friend next to her with a pitiful expression.</p><br/><p>Guoguo received her SOS signal, and immediately asked. \u201cAre photographs really necessary?\u201d</p><br/><p>That man\u2019s face instantly bloomed with the warmth of spring, as he looked at Guoguo shyly. \u201cNot\u2026 Not really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then why the hell did you put my review on hold, hey!?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Yaoyao doesn\u2019t have to hand them over for her two applicants then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man immediately nodded. \u201cAlright!\u201d He replied ever so readily.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d So, he was intentionally making things difficult for her?</p><br/><p>The man tore out the two pages that he had just finished writing on, but instead of passing them to her, he presented them to Guoguo. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guoguo then passed them to Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>Written on lined papers were one large word: Movement! On each of the papers\u2019 right corners, Yu Yan\u2019s and Yue Ying\u2019s names were written on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d It\u2019s done just like that? Isn\u2019t this too simple? What happened to the promised luxurious movement permit issued by authorities? At the very least, provide me with guidelines on how to use them?</p><br/><p>\u201cEffective immediately.\u201d As if he had guessed what she was thinking about, the man explained, though he was looking at her with a scornful look. \u201cA guide must be present during a plane transfer. The permit holders can only come over when you return.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, her master and Yue Ying could only cross over with her at the same time. That was fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe permits must be activated in two hours through verification. Otherwise, they will be invalid.\u201d The man said, still with the ice-cold tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cActivate? How to activate them?\u201dCould it be that her master still needed to send a verification SMS?</p><br/><p>The man frowned, and his expression grew even more scornful. \u201cThey will automatically activate once they make contact with their targets.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, she just had to hand the permits to her master and Yue Ying. Fortunately, she still had two hours.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuoguo\u2026\u201d Seeing how this person listened to Guoguo\u2019s requests, it seemed like he was treating her sincerely? Otherwise, flowers wouldn\u2019t bloom the moment he land his eyes on her. However, as her only good friend, she still had to instruct her on some matters. After all, this person had an incredible identity.</p><br/><p>Before she could even speak, the man suddenly interrupted. \u201cThey will be invalid if they\u2019re not activated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there still two hours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah?\u201d Zhu Yao was startled.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression turned colder, and continued to correct his own words. \u201cHalf an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell, you can\u2019t actually be chasing me out, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty minutes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey. Do you have to be that fickle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTen minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ruthless, alright!\u201d Zhu Yao turned and headed for the door. \u201cGuoguo, I will come back and look for you once the permits are activated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the man\u2019s expression look better as he followed Yaoyao to the door.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao opened the door directly, only to see the familiar staircase. She then turned to look at that dangerous manager. \u201cHow am I supposed to return?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man did not reply and instead walked hurriedly over. She did not know what he did, but when he closed and opened the door again, the view outside had already been replaced by a white portal.</p><br/><p>The hell, it turned into an Anywhere Door again!</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to enter, an idea suddenly flashed in her mind. As though she had just understood something, she turned back to look at the person whose face was filled with the words \u201churry and scram\u201d. She suddenly recalled Realmspirit\u2019s words, that the reason why he chose her was because someone recommended her. Then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly the person who recommended me to Realmspirit, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s reply was\u2026 kicking her directly into the portal.</p><br/><p>The hell! It really was him! She had always been a normal person without any incredible powers or identity. She had never stepped on any dog poop, nor was there any mysterious birthmark on her body that represented her identity or anything? Even if she were to participate in a lottery, she wouldn\u2019t win at all. So why was she chosen to transmigrate to another world?</p><br/><p>In the end, it was all to have her move away and use that opportunity to get close to Guoguo. It had to be known that Guoguo was a girl that was even more shut-in than her.</p><br/><p>As a Plane Manager, do you think you\u2019re a man by playing these kinds of tricks? Just you wait! This old lady will return and expose your true face of a lowly person in front of Guoguo!</p><br/><p>Szz\u2026 Aiyo, my buttocks!</p><br/><p>His kick was really ruthless!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung maiden, you\u2019re back so quickly?\u201d Realmspirit sprinted over with an excited look. He glanced at the two papers in her hand. \u201cYou really obtained them, you\u2019re so incredible. As expected of the woman I chose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao just wanted to say, \u201cHoho\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh!?\u201d He was stunned for a moment, and then she said ecstatically. \u201cYour Plane Manager actually gave you a Plane Imprint as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat imprint?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the authority to freely move between two planes. Initially, movement between two planes require a thousand years cooldown. With this imprint, then there\u2019s no such restriction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d She glanced at the permits in her hand. I don\u2019t see any imprints?</p><br/><p>\u201cOver here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realmspirit waved his hand excitedly, and Zhu Yao simply felt a golden light flash behind her. Slowly, what rose was a\u2026 shoe print with the number 42 on it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell!</p><br/><p>Mister Snail: There\u2019s this Chinese folklore called \u2018The Snail Girl\u2019. A man brought back home a snail one day when he saw it by the road. In order to repay the debt of saving her, she turned into a girl and began caring for his house. So \u2018Mister Snail\u2019 is like a genderbent version of the story.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

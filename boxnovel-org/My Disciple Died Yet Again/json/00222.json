Sesame flew out from her divine sense, and with a wave of its hand, passed her a white pearl.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Just as she received it, a white figure floated out. It was her master, of course.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d Why did her master become portable again? The biggest question was, why was he in Sesame\u2019s hands?</p><br/><p>Turns around and throws a glare!</p><br/><p>What did you do to my master?</p><br/><p>Sesame shrank its head, and said with a wronged look. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Lord told me not to tell you. This doesn\u2019t concern me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, I sensed there was something strange in your divine sense, so I left a strand of my own divine sense on Sesame.\u201d Yu Yan smoothly replied, and he completely did not have the self-awareness that he had been peeping on his disciple\u2019s divine sense.</p><br/><p>Where\u2019s your sense of shame!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, earlier, just what\u2026\u201d Whatever, I can\u2019t do anything about my master anyway.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned. \u201cWhat sort of feelings did you have back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnger.\u201d Zhu Yao honestly replied. \u201cA form of anger that cannot be contained.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao, at that time, within your divine sense was a sea of flames.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!?\u201d It was that serious? \u201cMy emotions can affect my divine sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly the opposite.\u201d Yu Yan\u2019s expression sank. \u201cIt was your divine sense which affected your emotions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What did he mean? The reason why she lost her sense of reasoning from anger was because of her divine sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Yao\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cBack then, what did you have in your divine sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>What did I have? Of course it\u2019s\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than you and Sesame, there was only\u2026\u201d She suddenly widened her eyes. \u201cThe Ruling Plume!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan nodded. \u201cThe Ruling Plume is the feather of a Phoenix, and all Phoenixes are innately born with the fire attribute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt affected my emotions?\u201d Zhu Yao retrieved the Ruling Plume and inspected it. \u201cIs the fire attribute always this explosive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s just the attribute, it shouldn\u2019t have brought about an effect of this extent.\u201d Yu Yan glanced at the Ruling Plume, and his expression sank a little more. \u201cIf your master did not make a mistake, the reason why you were affected by it, was because this feather carries violent emotions of its former owner when it was still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cViolent emotions?\u201d Wasn\u2019t Phoenixes of the God race? Why would one have violent emotions?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis feather must not have been pulled off by the Phoenix itself, but should have dropped off when the former owner passed away. That is why it was infected with the former owner\u2019s final emotions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled. Final emotions? In other words, the owner of this feather was already dead, and the only ones capable of killing Gods were\u2026 Devils!</p><br/><p>It was no wonder she felt so furious and had the impulse to destroy everything. The hatred of Gods towards Devils were deeply rooted in their bloodline. If that Phoenix was really killed by a Devil, then it was natural for it to carry violent emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seemed like I can\u2019t use this weapon anymore.\u201d She was finally able to find an incredible weapon, but it couldn\u2019t be used. She was feeling very depressed, you know?</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember that you can never place this object within your divine sense again.\u201d Yu Yan had to remind this stupid disciple of his again. \u201cThe divine sense is where the core of life resides. From now on, unless you have hundred percent certainty, do not place unnecessary objects within it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 He sounded as though she was using her divine sense as a storage pouch.</p><br/><p>Alright, maybe a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do I do about this weapon?\u201d As a God\u2019s artifact, destroying it was not possible for her. She couldn\u2019t use it, and she did not have the qualifications to use it as a decoration either. Why did she want to retrieve it back then anyway?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can keep it for now. Once I have found the method to destroy it, it won\u2019t be too late to talk about it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the only way now.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao placed the Ruling Plume into her storage bracelet she carried around wherever she went. For safety purposes, she even added a seal onto it.</p><br/><p>In the next few days, Zhu Yao was living a rather leisurely life. Other than guarding Yue Ying, watering the two trees and inserting spiritual energy into them, she did not have any other jobs.</p><br/><p>The two trees were already healed by a considerable amount. The charred black skin they had back then had already fell off, revealing brand new orange tree barks. The branches were also beginning to grow out some green buds. Although they were still not speaking yet, they should be completely restored in a short span of time.</p><br/><p>Yue Ying\u2019s condition was great as well, and he faintly seemed to be transforming soon. Sometimes, when she was guarding him by his side, he would suddenly call out a sweet \u2018Big Sis Yao\u2019. His voice was clear and crisp, sounding just like the child he was when he had just gained a human form back then. It seemed like, at the very least, he would be able to restore his former Essence figure.</p><br/><p>She was unsure if it was because she had elevated the courtyard too high up, but Blue Parasol Sect had yet to send people over to disturb her.</p><br/><p>Only three months later, did someone finally make his way to the doorstep.</p><br/><p>And this person was not just anyone, but Xuan Xu.</p><br/><p>Because of his relationship with Yi Ling, Zhu Yao\u2019s impression of him was not really good. Evidently, Xuan Xu was not treating her especially well either. From the time he appeared, he had this cold look, and was staring straight at her with a resentful expression.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao could not be bothered with him, as she leisurely watered the two trees in her courtyard.</p><br/><p>Riding on his sword, Xuan Xu waited for a few moments in the air. Seeing that she completely did not have the intention to remove the formation and let him in, his expression sank. Then, he called out. \u201cDisciple Xuan Xu, wishes to meet Ancestral Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao finally remove the formation and let the person in.</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu landed at a spot a few steps away from her, and the resentful expression on his face grew even heavier. Gritting his teeth, he bowed down unwillingly. \u201cThe incident back then is truly the fault of my disciple, resulting to a disaster which offended Ancestral Master. I beg Ancestral Master for your forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he was here to apologize in place for Yi Ling.</p><br/><p>Truthfully, when she forced Lin Yu to give an explanation for the courtyard being burned, it was a passing remark made purely out of anger. She did not really want them to do anything at all. In her heart, she knew that this matter did not concern the rest of the people. The culprit was Mu Liu, and he had already received a lesson.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have apologized with such sincerity, this matter can be put aside now. However\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao glanced at him. \u201cThe misfortunes brought about by your disciple, aren\u2019t just limited to one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu\u2019s expression paled.</p><br/><p>Evidently, he knew of those men behind Mary Sue Yi Ling. Thinking about it, this Xuan Xu was rather pitiful as well, as he truly loved Yi Ling. But, he was a little unfortunate, as the one he loved was a wild horse, which was destined to have a boundless grassland to run on.</p><br/><p>\u201cAncestral Master, is there a need to torment me with such words!?\u201d Xuan Xu suddenly flared up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Who\u2019s tormenting you? I\u2019m just giving you a kind reminder, alright?</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu clenched his fists, as though he was trying to suppress something with all his might. After a while, he said. \u201cI have long since found out about Yi Ling\u2019s intentions, but\u2026 what can I possibly do? She has her own thoughts and feelings, how can I force her to love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was he getting at? Didn\u2019t the two of them have something going on already? What\u2019s with this resentful husband tone of his?</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu however, as though he finally managed to find his target to vent his frustration on, poured out all the emotions he had been suppressing the entire time. \u201cThe only thing I can do, is to protect her with my role as her master, and I can only watch her silently at the side, forever. Even if that\u2019s the case, I still love her. But you\u2026 You clearly have so much more capabilities than me, why must you treat her in such a way!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Why did it feel as though his prideful and cold character was breaking down all of a sudden? Did he go crazy?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly because you\u2019re not doing anything, and managed to obtain the one and only thing we dream of, that makes us suffer so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d So, no matter if she had done it or not, it was her fault?</p><br/><p>\u3002\u201cI have already given up, I will no longer wish that she will turn back. I only hope that someone could treat her better. Not to the extent of loving her like she\u2019s a treasure or a beautiful pearl, but at the very least, do not make her feel sad and broken-hearted.\u201d After saying that, he glanced at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Please, can you speak human? Why did you suddenly go into hysterics, hey!?</p><br/><p>\u201cAncestral Master, I don\u2019t care what you think, but at the very least, do not be so harsh on her?\u201d Xuan Xu\u2019s face was filled with bitterness. \u201cAt least see her once in a while!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee who?\u201d Speak clearly, hey.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Liu\u2019s incident is unrelated to her, and she only knew about it after it happened as well. Please do not blame her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Wait a minute! I\u2019m getting more confused from what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ancestral Master!\u201d Xuan Xu\u2019s expression sharpened, and it felt as though his entire chest was burning with rage for a moment. With emphasis on every word, he said. \u201cYi Ling is infatuated with you, please do not let down her love for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao blanked, his last few words constantly reverberated in her mind. Her love for you\u2026 Her love for you\u2026 Her love for you\u2026 Love!</p><br/><p>Who? Yi Ling!</p><br/><p>Flips table. Who would want her love!?</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu\u2019s brain has gone to mush, right? I understand that you\u2019re here to act as a matchmaker for Yi Ling, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman, hey!\u201d Are you blind!?</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu was still unmoved, and his face was filled with determination. \u201cI\u2026 respect Yi Ling\u2019s decision!\u201d</p><br/><p>Respect my ass. Shouldn\u2019t you be rejecting an abnormal love relationship like this to the very end? What happened to your basic conduct as a straight man?</p><br/><p>Also, why her!?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you please wake up? I\u2019m not interested in Yi Ling in the least!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuan Xu frowned. \u201cHow can you be like this? Yi Ling treats you so well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell my ass!\u201d Zhu Yao was about to explode. \u201cWhen has she treated me well? She has been pulling hatred towards me the entire time, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe past incidents were Yi Ling\u2019s fault, but that\u2019s because she did not understand the feelings she had for you. That was why she went against you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven a ghost wouldn\u2019t believe a logic like that, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue love is not a crime!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Don\u2019t insult true love, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what! Whatever the case\u2026\u201d Xuan Xu looked frustrated. Gritting his teeth, he said with a bitter heart. \u201cYi Ling will be in your hands from now on. If you dare to bully her, even if I have to offend you given our positions, I won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d After saying that, he wildly dashed away while sobbing, looking like a lovelorn teenager.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what happened just now? Xuan Xu, come back here. What do you mean by handing her over to me? What does this have to do with me? Also, what\u2019s with your lovelorn expression? Aren\u2019t you going for the prideful and cold look? Why did your character change, hey!?</p><br/><p>This development was too sudden, and she needed to slowly digest everything.</p><br/><p>How did Yi Ling end up loving her to this extent? The key thing was, she seemed to have even convinced her harem members!</p><br/><p>It must be said that everything was caused by the effects of her World Favourable Impression ability back then, but she had already turned it off though? Sesame had seen her twice, and she did not see it going crazy over her either.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame!\u201d She instantly called out the person concerned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~~~\u201d A ray of light flashed in front of her eyes, and Sesame who was dressed in a white robe appeared before her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao inspected it for a while. Mn. Satisfactory performance, and his expression was completely normal.</p><br/><p>Thus, she asked with a stern look. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at me now, do you still have that feeling of infatuation which you felt when I activated my World Favourable Impression ability back then?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

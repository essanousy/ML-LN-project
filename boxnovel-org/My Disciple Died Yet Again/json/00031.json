Only when the other three had left far enough, did she pull Little Wang over with a gossiping look.</p><br/><p>While looking downstairs with an ambiguous expression, she said. \u201cHurry and spill it out. Does that Su Zi of yours have feelings for\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister Zhu Yao, don\u2019t misunderstand. We\u2019re just brothers and sisters of the same sect.\u201d Wang Xuzhi hurriedly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Zhu Yao was a little suspicious. Then why are you being so agitated for?</p><br/><p>\u201cReally! It\u2019s my first time seeing her today!\u201d Wang Xuzhi became even more anxious, and with a serious expression, he raised out his hand and swore. \u201cI will definitely not like any other girls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so anxious.\u201d Zhu Yao pulled his hand down. As a parent, she was really open-minded. \u201cI don\u2019t have any intention to stop you. If you like her, then go for it! Big sister will support you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand. Martial. Aunt!\u201d Wang Xuzhi pulled a long face, and he looked at her angrily. With his current expression, it was extremely similar to the expression he gave when he was young. </p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. I will stop.\u201d He actually got angry so easily, he\u2019s not fun at all. Zhu Yao hurriedly changed the topic. \u201cOh, right. Earlier, I heard Su Zi calling Xiao Yi senior-martial uncle. Did he build his Foundation?\u201d Although Xiao Yi had the exotic treasure to hide his cultivation level, looking on the surface, he was still at Essence-stage.</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi shook his head. \u201cAfter the Inter-Sect Tournament, Sovereign Feng Yi took him in as her personal succeeding disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the cultivation world, strength reigned supreme. In the same sect, as long as they were practitioners of the same stage, they would address each other as brothers and sisters, and if one was a stage higher, his position would be one level higher as well. But, Demigod Sovereigns were exceptions. As to give Demigod Sovereigns the respect they deserved, as long as one was a personal succeeding disciple of a Demigod, his seniority would only be one position lower than his master. Hence, although Zhu Yao\u2019s cultivation level was lower than the Sect Master and the various Mountain Lords, her seniority was higher than theirs. It was because she was Yu Yan\u2019s personal succeeding disciple, and naturally, the same went for Xiao Yi.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was a little stunned. He was actually taken in by a Demigod as her personal succeeding disciple so quickly, as expected of the protagonist\u2019s treatment. Promotion. Rise in salary. Becoming a CEO. Marrying a rich and beautiful girl. He was basically heading straight towards the summit of life.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! Master had told her that, even a Demigod, if one did not look carefully, would not be able to find out the exotic treasure Xiao Yi possessed. In other words, it\u2019s not entirely possible for him not to be found out. And back then, other than her master, there were three other Demigods!</p><br/><p>Then, Feng Yi\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Big sister Zhuo Yao, big sister Zhu Yao?\u201d Wang Xuzhi nudged the person who suddenly went into a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhu Yao\u2019s expression was dark, she had accidentally went into deep thoughts of the possible conspiracy theories occurring. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Oh right, Xuzhi. I\u2019m sorry for interrupting your match during the Inter-Sect Tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know big sister Zhu Yao did that because you were worried about me.\u201d Wang Xuzhi replied without a mind. Suddenly, he seemed to have recalled something, and went silent for a moment. His pretty brows creased, and he was a little hesitant when he asked. \u201cBig sister Zhu Yao, actually, on that day, I felt it was a little strange. The spiritual sword senior-martial uncle Xiao Yi summoned, I keep feeling that, there was something off about it\u2026\u201d A practitioner\u2019s sixth sense was very keen, and at that moment, he actually felt the aura of death approaching him. He really suspected, if Zhu Yao had not intervened, he might really be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it too deeply!\u201d Zhu Yao stroked his head. It was best if she did not tell him the truth. No matter was it luck or scheming ability, he was not Xiao Yi\u2019s match. And, whenever someone goes against the male protagonist, that person will never have a good ending. \u201cIf you do not like him, in the future, just stay further away from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi nodded his head obediently.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao then told him a few more things, before they finally separated and returned to their own rooms to rest.</p><br/><p>On the early morning of the second day, the five of them split up and went around inquiring information. However, even after three days, all the clues they found were exactly the same as the one they heard from the inn owner, and they did not make a single progress at all. And, another person disappeared in the city once again.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instructed them to not be anxious, and told them to take a good rest before investigating about it the next day. However, she never expected that, Wang Xuzhi who had evolved into a good boy, would actually assault her in the night!</p><br/><p>When she saw a black figure sneakily entering her room, and even had the intention to crawl onto the bed, Zhu Yao, who had coincidentally woke up, almost sent a Heavenly Lightning down at him. With fast reflexes, he immediately held onto her hand, and spoke up with a suppressed voice. \u201cBig sister Zhu Yao, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle wimp?\u201d With her other hand, she sent a fist to his head. \u201cWhat are you doing this late in the night? You got the wrong room, right?\u201d The Su Zi girly is on the second floor, you know.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister Zhu Yao, I have something I need to discuss with you about.\u201d Wang Xuzhi took out a veil and a paper crane from the storage pouch next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Zhu Yao picked up the veil from his hand. It was a red-colored veil. It\u2019s color was very common, and even the peony embroidered on it was rather common as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI found it in the room of one of the missing men.\u201d Wang Xuzhi explained with a stern expression. \u201cBack then, I sensed a hint of the remains of demonic aura. So, I cast a tracking incantation on the aura. However, the paper crane did not return for an entire day and night. I thought it was just my imagination, but, just then, the paper crane returned. It must have found the owner of the veil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying, you have found the culprit who caused the disappearances?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi shook his head hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019m still not entirely sure, but, by heading into the direction the paper crane guides for us, I believe we will definitely find some clues.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood work!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately leapt out of the bed, and casually wore over her clothes. She then signaled him to release the paper crane. \u201cLet\u2019s follow after it and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Wang Xuzhi took out another two paper talismans from his clothes. \u201cThese are Presence Hiding Talismans master gave me before we went down the mountain. As long as we place them on our bodies, we can hide our presence, and practitioners with strength lower than the Nascent Soul-stage will not be able to sense us.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s actually able to hide our presence? Zhu Yao curiously took it from him. Suddenly, she recalled her own master, and heaved a long sigh. Master, look what his master did for him!</p><br/><p>A few thousand kilometers away, a certain master, who was currently meditating, sneezed. He looked around strangely for a moment, before he closed his eyes again.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao and Wang Xuzhi followed after the paper crane. After leaving the inn, they stopped at a small forest not far away. There were no traces of any humans in the surroundings, though, several cottages were scattered around the forest. Some of them were still lighted up, and most probably, they were simply ordinary folks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like the owner of this veil, must have stopped here before.\u201d Wang Xuzhi said as he pushed away the bush in front of him. \u201cThe owner must be finding the next target.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao pointed to the scattered cottages in front of them. \u201cThe next target must be someone in one of the houses in front. Let\u2019s find somewhere to hide for now, and wait for the fish to take the bait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi nodded. The only thing they could do now was wait. The Presence Hiding Talismans could only last a single night, they could not be wasted.</p><br/><p>The two people found a good bush to hide in, and just when they were about to sit, a commotion was heard from within the forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister Zi, listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not listening, I\u2019m not listening, I\u2019m not listening!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 What\u2019s with this common and nauseating opening cutscene? Zhu Yao turned to look, and saw two figures, one in black, and the other in red, walking out of the forest. They were actually Su Zi and Xiao Yi. Why were they walking together? And they actually came to such a secluded place. And wasn\u2019t Su Zi a fan of Wang Xuzhi? She changed her allegiance this quickly?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

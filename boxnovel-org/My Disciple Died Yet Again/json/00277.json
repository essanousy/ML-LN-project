While it moved, it used its buttocks to squeeze the Profiteer away. Then, it slowly knelt down, hinting her to sit on its back. \u201cBeastie will bring you there, meow~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Looking at the colour of the sky, it would indeed be too late if they were to walk up now. Zhu Yao climbed onto its back, and just as she was about to pull Profiteer up as well\u2026</p><br/><p>The Winged Windbeast kicked him away, and let out a threatening growl.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao had no choice but to spend some time to change the beastie\u2019s mind. Only then did the Winged Windbeast unwillingly carried Profiteer with its claws, and with a flap of its wings, it flew towards the mountaintop.</p><br/><p>Most likely because they came a little too late, they were the only ones there when they reached the mountaintop. Fortunately, the teleportation formation had yet to close.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao bade goodbye to the Winged Windbeast before heading into the teleportation formation with Profiteer, teleporting to the main hall in the floating mountain above them.</p><br/><p>The Winged Windbeast stood at its original spot depressingly, as it looked at the floating mountain above it. It began to think about its life as a gatekeeping beast. Mn, it seemed like it could be understood even if it took an occasional absence.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was instantly teleported onto a platform. All of the successful participants had all gathered here, no matter if they were wandering practitioners or mortal children. With a glance, there were actually more than a hundred people. It seemed like Ness Cesary Sect\u2019s range of enrolment was pretty broad!</p><br/><p>When they arrived, the disciples coming to lead the participants had just arrived as well. Expectedly, they were the two Foundation disciples at the foot of the mountain earlier.</p><br/><p>Though, compared to the coldness they had earlier, they were presently filled with more zeal.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations. From this day forth, you are all disciples of our Ness Cesary Sect. As long as you cross the Trueheart Door, you will be considered to have officially joined our sect.\u201d He exchanged glances with the disciple next to him, and then waved his hand. In an instant, several hundreds of white jade tablets flew to the various participants. \u201cThese are Barrier Breaking Stones. Engraved inside are a few elementary grade heart techniques. When crossing the Trueheart Door later on, you will all enter an illusion. The illusion is birthed from your heart and cannot be controlled. If you can break through it, you will receive an enlightenment and henceforth use these heart techniques to raise your cultivation. If you do not have the strength to break through, do not forcefully break your way through, as you can use the Barrier Breaking Stone to leave the illusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd of people grasped onto the jade tablet tightly. The wandering practitioners seemed to have all heard about the Trueheart Door, as every single one of their faces carried a little excitement. The children who have yet to cultivate however, all had blank looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow junior-martial brothers and sisters, head on to take the final test then!\u201d That person cast an art, and right after, the heavy fog behind him began to scatter. An ancient and majestic arched stone door appeared before their eyes. The crowd headed towards the stone door, and everything in their surroundings began to turn a little blurry.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao raised her head, wanting to discern the few words that were written above the arched door. But no how she looked at it, she was unable to clearly see it.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to ask Profiteer next to her, with a \u2018poomf\u2019 sound, he fell straight onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfiteer!\u201d She was shocked. An even weirder scene appeared. The squeezy crowd earlier, like bowling pins that were struck down, began to fall onto the ground one after another. Finally, she was the only remaining person standing. What was this situation!?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao hurriedly checked Profiteer\u2019s pulse, only to realize that there was no abnormalities with his body. Rather\u2026 he seemed to be asleep?</p><br/><p>Could it be because of the door\u2019s influence?</p><br/><p>She looked at the door in front of her seriously, only to realize that the dense fog that rose earlier was beginning to scatter. A gigantic figure faintly appeared behind the door, and the figure began to grow clearer, clearer, and finally\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeastie!\u201d Wasn\u2019t this that Winged Windbeast earlier? When did it come up as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d A slightly furious voice resounded from the other side of the door. \u201cWhy is the Winged Windbeast which is supposed to protect the mountain here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master, this\u2026 this disciple has no idea either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRidiculous! Hurry and bring it back down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, five pillars of light appeared around the Winged Windbeast\u2019s body, trapping it within. The Winged Windbeast began to struggle furiously.</p><br/><p>Its furious roar pierced through the clouds. \u201cRoooar\u2026 This beastie doesn\u2019t want to go\u2026 This beastie wants its fur fur stroked\u2026 Roar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was of no use.</p><br/><p>The boundary of the pillars of light began to grow smaller, finally turning it into a ray of light which flew into a person\u2019s spiritual beast pouch.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao have a clear view. Behind the door sat a row of people. Looking at their demeanours, they seemed to be the higher-ups of Ness Cesary Sect, and Qu Qu was sitting at the top, looking at her with a dumbfounded look.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? There\u2019s actually someone who gave up so quickly and got out of the illusion.\u201d The middle-aged man sitting at the very center frowned, sighing. \u201cHaah, yout- elderly these days!\u201d He sized up Zhu Yao for a moment, and immediately changed his words.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind!\u201d He said with a wave of his hand. \u201cSince she\u2019s already up here, then she\u2019s considered a disciple of our sect. Stand at the side!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qu Qu winked at her, and then stood up. \u201cSenior-martial brother Sect Master, I wish to take her in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d That man turned around and glared at him with an exasperated look. \u201cAs the lord of a Peak, how can you take in\u2026 such an elderly person as a disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, I want to take her in no matter what.\u201d Qu Qu said shamelessly.</p><br/><p>The corner of Sect Master Qu Jiang\u2019s lips twitched, as he wished that he could open up his junior-martial brother\u2019s brain and check if water had actually entered it. \u201cJunior-martial brother, I can put aside your past nonsense, but taking in a disciple is a huge matter. Putting aside the fact that his person\u2019s lifespan is diminishing, just from her activating the Barrier Breaking Stone in less than fifteen minutes after crossing the Trueheart Door\u2026\u201d His words paused again, as he stared dumbfoundedly at the completely undamaged Barrier Breaking Stone in Zhu Yao\u2019s hand. He suddenly jolted to his feet. \u201cY-You\u2026 You didn\u2019t use the Barrier Breaking Stone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao lowered her head and glanced at the rock in her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about this?\u201d How do I use it?</p><br/><p>With a twist of his palm, Qu Jiang had the Barrier Breaking Stone fly into his hand. He repeatedly checked it, and the longer he looked at it, the more shocked he became. This was impossible! No one had ever passed through the illusion so quickly. Just how long had it been? It had barely been three minutes, right!?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 How did you get across the illusion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIllusion?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned for a moment. What\u2019s that? Was there such a setting?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis lord is asking you, how did you get here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI walked in, of course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qu Jiang was speechless. Could it be that his eyes were mistaken, and that this person actually had extraordinary aptitude? Because of her pure heart and soul, she was able to cross the Trueheart Door so quickly? Unfortunately, she had started her cultivation path a little late.</p><br/><p>She was too old!</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial brother\u2026\u201d Qu Qu hurriedly squeezed in again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine then.\u201d The Sect Master found a reasonable explanation, and was no longer as opposed as before. A miracle might actually happen as well? \u201cIf you want to take her in, do it then. However, she must not become your personal succeeding disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, senior-martial brother. You sure are a good person.\u201d Qu Qu gave his senior-martial brother the good person card. Facing Zhu Yao, he waved his hands at her and gave her a \u2018you should know what to do\u2019 expression. Little sister-in-law, come over here quickly.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. If she were to reject his invitation, she wouldn\u2019t be bashed to death, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d The awe-inspiring senior-martial brother added. \u201cSince she\u2019s the first to get across the illusionary realm of the Trueheart Door, then she naturally has the privilege to solve the riddle. You\u2026\u201d He was stuck for words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Zhu Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, Zhu Yao\u2026 On the right of the Trueheart Door, there\u2019s a riddle. You can try solving it.\u201d He continued. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you can\u2019t solve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao nodded. It should be the riddle Profiteer was talking about, right? Solving riddles or whatever really isn\u2019t my specialty, but I will just see it.</p><br/><p>Turning around, she looked at the door, and realized there were indeed words written on the door frame.</p><br/><p>The first line wrote: Cheng Qingdiao</p><br/><p>The second line wrote: Hell dragon\u2019s lake, filled with gold.</p><br/><p>The third line wrote: You who seek bitterness, in the middle of the sky.</p><br/><p>The fourth line wrote: Beach of jade, overflowing with sadness.</p><br/><p>The fifth line wrote: Good time to look back, but ever late.</p><br/><p>The sixth line wrote: By eyes, unseen.</p><br/><p>The last line wrote the name of the author: Daoist Wangshang, was here!</p><br/><p>Ah, so it was Classical Chinese. As a Science student who did not take learning language classes seriously, she hated Classical Chinese to the very core. She was already very used to the various mathematical quizzes, and were also used to logical thinking. Something as sophistical as this was truly\u2026</p><br/><p>Eh, wait a minute! Speaking about logic\u2026 Why did the first word of every line look so familiar? If she were to link them all up\u2026</p><br/><p>She could not help but recite them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheng Qingdiao, hell, you bitch, goodbye!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, aren\u2019t these just vulgarities?</p><br/><p>When her voice fell, the entire stone door suddenly emitted out a blinding white light, instantly brightening up the horizon that had long turned dark. The words on the doorframe gradually faded as well, and what remained eres the first and fourth line. Finally, all of them disappeared!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe riddle, was solved\u2026\u201d The Sect Master and his little companions were all dumbfounded, as they stood up one after another and looked at Zhu Yao with disbelieving eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 This is an accident!\u201d Please forgive this mathematical puppy\u2019s logical OCD.</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master, hurry and look at the lake at the front mountain\u2026\u201d Someone shouted.</p><br/><p>Everyone turned to look at the huge lake next to Ness Cesary Sect. The lake water looked as if it was boiling, as it began to surge wildly. An earthquake immediately followed after, and even the entire sect began to shake.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instinctively grabbed onto the door frame next to her to prevent herself from falling.</p><br/><p>The lake water surged even more incredibly than before, and it began to split towards the two sides. Something seemed to be rising from the center of the lake. Before its outline could be seen, an eye-piercing golden light shone, and its radiance grew even larger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Skybond Peak!\u201d Someone excitedly said. \u201cThe ascended ancestor\u2019s Skybond Peak has surfaced!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao squinted her eyes with all her might, before being able to see a golden palace rising from within the lake waters. In the beginning, it was just a corner. As it rose, she realized that it was a gigantic floating mountain. The size of its territory was seemingly close to the Main Peak she was present at. A palace that could not be described with just \u2018luxurious\u2019 took up the entirety of its mountaintop, revealing right before everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The owner of this mountain must have been really rich.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao secretly thought.</p><br/><p>The mountain rose even higher, and had even surpassed the highest Main Peak. It went several thousand meters above it, before stopping in mid-air. The entire palace was like a lighthouse fervently making its presence known in the dark night sky.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s missing now were the few words: This old man has all the money, come rob me if you can.</p><br/><p>Everyone presently on-site all had the same, dumbfounded look: ( \u2299 _ \u2299 )</p><br/>\n</div>"}

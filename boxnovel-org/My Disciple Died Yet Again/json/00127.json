At the very center of the Great Hall, a black arc appeared, which slowly expanded into a full circle. This was a space distorting Mystic Art which could only be used by Demigods, and everyone present was thrown into a shock.</p><br/><p>A moment later, a human figure stepped out from inside. \u201cWhoever\u2019s stronger will get the say in the matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words sounded especially arrogant, yet, the thoughts of rebutting this idea were unable to take root due to the Demigod\u2019s might carried within the speech. Even Zi Mo himself was unable to refute, and was simply tightening the grip of his fists.</p><br/><p>Three people walked out of the distorted space one after another, and the three of them were even familiar faces. The first to come out, was a woman dressed in fiery-red clothes, whose lips carried a cold smile, and the three letters \u2018BUG\u2019 on her face were so dark and bolded, it looked as though the word was printed on her face. Mu Meiyan!</p><br/><p>Even Zhu Yao was a little astonished. A hundred years ago, she was only a middle-stage Nascent Soul practitioner, but now, she was actually a Demigod. The aura she sensed from her body was comparable to hers, and it seemed to be faintly suppressing hers as well. Zhu Yao stared at that shadow behind her which had already fused with her body. Compared to before, it was even denser than before, and it was emitting a dark aura that sent chills to the spine. In the past, she didn\u2019t know what it was. However, because she had recently learnt the skill of weapon refining, she was now especially sensitive to auras. In an instant, she recognized that it was actually the Aura of Extreme Yin.</p><br/><p>Other than her, no one else could see that shadow, yet, she did not know why, but she could sense that the shadow had been staring straight at her, as though something ice-cold was crawling up from beneath her feet. Zhu Yao intentionally ignored that shadow like the rest of the people, however, that feeling of being watched became even deeper than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two Sovereigns have arrived.\u201d However, the Sect Master of Celestial Indus Sect looked very delighted, and greeted them. \u201cSovereign Qihan, Sovereign\u2026 Rulu, Junior-martial sister Hanxin.\u201d He greeted every one of them, however, when he saw Mu Meiyan, he paused for a moment, and a hint of awkwardness flashed past his face. After all, the Sovereign in front of him was previously his own daughter, and had even been personally expelled out of the Sect by him in the past. However, who would have thought that she would breakthrough into the Demigod-stage a hundred years later, and had even returned to Celestial Indus Sect without harboring past grudges.</p><br/><p>By looking at the Celestial Indus Sect Master\u2019s expression, Zhu Yao could guess parts of the situation. No Sect would reject a Demigod-stage practitioner, even if there was some sort of grudge between them in the past. The reason why Mu Meiyan had been hiding in the past few years, was probably because the shadow had yet to recover back then. Now that the shadow\u2019s abilities were flourishing much more than before, naturally, she would borrow the strength of her cheat to raise herself to the Demigod-stage. It was no wonder she had changed from her past gentle and weak personality, and become so arrogant. Most probably, this was her true nature.</p><br/><p>The matters had become even harder to manage now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan\u2019er?\u201d Wu Song stood up, and looked towards Mu Meiyan at the center with a face of disbelief. His expression changed, revealing a complicated look.</p><br/><p>However, Mu Meiyan simply turned her head and glanced at him with scornful eyes. After a cold snort, she seemed to have done something, as blood began to trickle down the corner of Wu Song\u2019s lips, his expression paled, and he began to cough as he sat right back down.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao frowned. As expected, she had always been simply using Wu Song. However, Wu Song deserved it as well.</p><br/><p>Turning her head, she looked towards Yue Hanxin who was following behind Qihan, and could not help but sigh. The female protagonist and female antagonist were as expected, natural enemies. Although she really wanted to see the fight between Mary Sue and Green Tea Bitch, looking at how the shadow was acting, it definitely wouldn\u2019t let her go.</p><br/><p>Like all Mary Sues\u2019 settings, Yue Hanxin had an astonishingly beautiful face. For a moment, Zhu Yao could not recognize her as that skinny and frail child back then. However, her delicate face seemed to look a little languished. It seemed that when Mu Meiyan rose to a Demigod, she had often sought trouble with her. Zhu Yao then could not help but turn to look at Yue Ying. He, however, had a calm face, and his eyes did not even move in the slightest. He had been looking at her while lowering his head the entire time.</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you heading over to meet your family? She\u2019s your elder or younger sister, you know?</p><br/><p>Mn. After thinking for a moment, Zhu Yao realized a problem. Between Yue Hanxin and Yue Ying, which one was older?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the cultivation world, the strong are always revered.\u201d Mu Meiyan swept her eyes past Zi Mo, and instantly locked onto Zhu Yao. The corner of her lips revealed a hint of a cold smile. \u201cIn the past, isn\u2019t the Ancient Hill Sect known as the number one Deity Sect by possessing three Demigod Sovereigns? Now that my Celestial Indus Sect possesses three Demigod Sovereigns as well, it\u2019s time for a different Sect to take the number one seat, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Mo\u2019s expression instantly darkened. What did she mean by \u2018known as\u2019? In regards to his Ancient Hill Sect\u2019s strength, was there a further need to boast about it?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Sovereign.\u201d Zi Mo forced a smile back. \u201cThis so-called number one Deity Sect, is merely a title. My Sect has been created many years ago, and this title, is merely a nickname that the various Daoists, who think highly of us, have given us. My Sect is named Ancient Hill, and we have never had the intentions to change it, so naturally, we will not take this mere title for ourselves.\u201d Although his words sounded modest, in actual fact, he was making hidden remarks at Celestial Indus Sect. When translated to human words: \u2018What number one Deity Sect? It\u2019s simply a title that has been pushed to us by others, why would we bother wanting it? Yet, you\u2019re treating it like a treasure, and you\u2019re even shamelessly coming to steal it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although Mu Meiyan had lived two lives, in terms of the use of speech, how could she compete against a Sect Master who had lived in the world for several thousand years, and was capable of turning matters of human affairs into scriptures? After being countered speechless in an instant, her widened pair of eyes stared straight at Zi Mo.</p><br/><p>Uncontrollably, the pressure from her might was pressed straight towards Zi Mo.</p><br/><p>Just as Zhu Yao was about to act, there was actually someone who was a step faster. Another much stronger pressure was sent right back at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestial Indus Sect sure has huge guts.\u201d The person who acted was unexpectedly Ancient Hill Sect\u2019s Sovereign Dan Wu, who did not have much sense of presence this entire time. In the past, in general meetings, even if he were to show up, he had never spoken. He was so low-profile, it caused people to unconsciously forget his presence. However, the moment he acted this time, he had clearly demonstrated his strength as a late-stage Demigod.</p><br/><p>Even Mu Meiyan\u2019s expression changed as well. Although Celestial Indus Sect claimed to have three Demigod-stage practitioners, Qihan and Mu Meiyan were both merely Demigods who had broken through not too long ago. While the other Sovereign that had yet to make his appearance, was merely a middle-stage Demigod as well.</p><br/><p>Only then did the Celestial Indus Sect feel a little afraid. The joy from suddenly gaining two Sovereigns in his Sect had gotten way over his head, as he had forgotten that Demigod Sovereigns of Ancient Hill Sect had all broken through into the Demigod-stage a very long time ago. Although Sovereign Zhu Yao, who had the weakest cultivation out of the three, was an early-stage Demigod, she came from Jade Forest Mountain!</p><br/><p>He could not help but put a bold face and step out to ease the tension. He explained to everyone that his Sect\u2019s Sovereign was just acting on a moment\u2019s impulse, and did not have intentions to start a war.</p><br/><p>However, Sovereign Dan Mu did not reply, and simply closed his eyes once again, as though he was completely uninterested in this entire issue.</p><br/><p>Mu Meiyan felt that she had indeed acted too impulsively as well. She was too aware of that feeling of being absolutely lowly and frail. So, when she had grown stronger, in her heart, she could no longer control the urge to act willfully, and she no longer wanted to be suppressed by anyone else. Hence, she dropped her guard a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, we\u2019re discussing about the matters of the Inter-Sect Tournament that will occur a year later.\u201d Qihan coldly reminded. Although he was a little frustrated about Rulu\u2019s impulsive actions, after taking her cultivation level in mind, he endured it. Though, he was becoming even more unhappy with this Sect Master\u2019s daughter. In the past, he still had some form of pity for her, after all, she was a Water Heavenly Spirit Vein holder in the past. However, ever since her Spirit Vein mutated, it felt as though her personality had changed. She became craftier, and had often acted against his own disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master Mo.\u201d Mu Meiyan restored her calm, and a hint of fine light flashed past her eyes. She then said with a smile. \u201cIn actuality, the Inter-Sect Tournament is a big matter for the various Sects, and is related to everyone present. Since the problem of the hosting location is difficult to solve, why not simply ask everyone here for their opinions, and have everyone decide where they wish the Inter-Sect Tournament be held at?\u201d</p><br/><p>This move of hers was ruthless enough. Since the other Sects earnestly wish for the two Sects to be in conflict with each other, they would naturally express their agreement one after another.</p><br/><p>And, several of them had already agreed beforehand that they would want to go to Celestial Indus Sect.</p><br/><p>However, there were some Sects who shouted that they wanted other Sects to host it as well. What\u2019s even more outrageous was that some even wanted a rotation system.</p><br/><p>Are you treating this as the Olympics? Zhu Yao silently retorted.</p><br/><p>The various Sects continuously argued. Initially, it was a competition between Celestial Indus Sect and Ancient Hill Sect. In the end, the other Sects wanted a piece of it as well, and hence, a huge pile of Sect candidates suddenly popped out. Every single one of them argued that they should host the event in their own Sects.</p><br/><p>After arguing for a long while, there still wasn\u2019t a resolution to the matter. Zhu Yao was barely about to control herself from suggesting that they should just fight it out outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s battle it out, in Best-Of-Three matches. Winner takes all.\u201d Someone suddenly roared out.</p><br/><p>Eh, they\u2019re really going to fight?</p><br/><p>The final conclusion had arrived. In the end, the one with the strongest fist would have the final say. Every Sect would send out three representatives, and whoever was to win, would have the say in the matter.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao fell on her knees due this extremely simple conclusion which took them an entire day of arguing to arrive at.</p><br/><p>If you wanted to fight in the first place, then why did you spend so much time flapping your gums, huh? You people might as well take this opportunity to finish the Inter-Sect Tournament too.</p><br/><p>In but a few moments, everyone had already prepared their representatives, and the people participating were actually all Nascent Soul practitioners.</p><br/><p>However, when it came to Celestial Indus Sect selecting their representatives, Mu Meiyan stood up. With a smile which actually did not look like one, she looked towards Zhu Yao in the upper seats. \u201cSince everyone is so excited, why don\u2019t I accompany everyone as well? Sovereign Zhu Yao, are you willing to face me in a battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled for a moment. Wasn\u2019t her main mission today simply to put her face out here?</p><br/><p>Seeing that she did not have any reaction, Mu Meiyan smiled even more complacently. Zhu Yao understood that although the person she hated the most was Yue Hanxin, ever since she was stopped from devouring Yu Yao, it had been a stifling thorn in Mu Meiyan\u2019s heart. However, Zhu Yao had never expected that she would actually dare to fight her openly.</p><br/><p>When this challenge was issued by Mu Meiyan, the entire place instantly quietened down, and a moment later, excitement could be faintly felt from the people present. This was after all, a battle between Demigod-stage practitioners. A sight that was rarely seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Sovereign, are you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Meiyan blanked, as though she never expected that Zhu Yao would answer this way. For a moment, she did not know how to follow up, as Zhu Yao actually shamelessly admitted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe Demigods have strength capable of moving mountains and overturning seas, and we\u2019re currently situated at my Ancient Hill Sect.\u201d Zhu Yao explained lightly, and even rolled her eyes while she was at it. What she meant was: \u2018Just by fighting a single battle, there would be such huge losses. Are you stupid?\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone present: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It actually sounded logical. Demigod-stage practitioners had never acted casually, and their overly impressive strength was the reason. If they were to fight, the mess created could never be cleared.</p><br/><p>Hence, the eyes that were looking at Mu Meiyan, had turned into ones that were looking at someone who would disregard others\u2019 lives just for her own selfish desires.</p><br/><p>Mu Meiyan trembled in anger, yet, she was unable to refute her explanation. Hence, she could only ruthlessly reply. \u201cWe can move away from Ancient Hill Sect, and fight above the ocean.\u201d This way, they wouldn\u2019t implicate others, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cNot going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there people next to the ocean too?\u201d She once again rolled her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d If they were to fight above the ocean, the ocean water would bring about huge waves. Tsunamis would definitely form, which would definitely bring upon disasters for the people by the shore.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao decided to add another bucket of oil into the fire. \u201cHaah, we\u2019re once mortals too.\u201d</p><br/><p>As humans, we must never forget out roots, yo.</p><br/><p>Hence, everyone\u2019s eyes on Mu Meiyan had become even more ill-looking, as though she was a great evil who was about to kill a large number of residents by the shore.</p><br/><p>Mu Meiyan took a few deep breaths, before she was able to endure the anger in her heart. She then said with a cold smile. \u201cIn the very end, aren\u2019t you just afraid of fighting against me? No worries. It\u2019s not like I definitely have to fight with you. As long as you\u2019re willing to admit defeat, then we can just put this battle aside.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

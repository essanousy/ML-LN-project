The herd of beasts suddenly split into two sides, spontaneously making a path at the center. A black robed man then confidently walked over. In his hands was an instrument that looked like a combination of a fan and flute, and rainbow flowing lights were faintly emitting out from it. The man first glanced at her with disdain, and then revealed a dark and dangerous smile. Waving his hand, he commanded. \u201cKill her!\u201d</p><br/><p>The demonic beast herd pounced at her at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame!\u201d Zhu Yao immediately released Sesame who was in her divine sense. In any case, the people within the barrier couldn\u2019t see the situation here, so she didn\u2019t have any worries.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuuu~~ \u2517|\uff40o\u2032|\u251b\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame appeared from thin air and squashed about five eighth ranked demonic beasts to death. Then, with a sweep of its tail, it toppled a bunch of them, and then pounced towards the man.</p><br/><p>The black robed man coldly laughed, and then flew into the skies, dodging Sesame\u2019s attack in a flash.</p><br/><p>Now! Zhu Yao grasped onto this opportunity, and pulled out that Purple Extreme Heavenly Lightning Talisman, pouring spiritual energy into it to activate it.</p><br/><p>Naturally, she wouldn\u2019t send herself out to die, she had long prepared a detailed plan. She would first immediately release Sesame. Though there might be a huge number of demonic beasts, they were all below ninth rank, while Sesame was an ascended demonic immortal, so naturally it wouldn\u2019t be afraid of these little beasties.</p><br/><p>The one she had to pay attention to the most was this man. He was a demonic beast as well, and he could already take up a human form, proving that he was a tenth ranked demonic beast.</p><br/><p>She really had to thank her master for giving her this talisman, as sealed inside it was an Ascension Tribulation Purple Extreme Lightning, and no matter how incredible a demonic beast was, it was impossible for the demonic beast to block against it.</p><br/><p>So, when Zhu Yao saw that he was approaching this way, she immediately pulled out the talisman, and circulated her spiritual energy. \u201cHeavenly Lightning\u2026\u201d Fall!</p><br/><p>The sound of a flute resounded, as that man suddenly lowered his head and blew into the instrument in his hands.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s talisman was in the midst of activation, when suddenly, the air and blood in her chest began to surge and tumble. A pressure so powerfully irresistible came assaulting her from all directions, and she instantly puked out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>Sesame, who was still arrogantly sweeping through the herd of demonic beasts earlier, loudly crashed onto the ground by that pressure as well, and after struggling for a few moments, it couldn\u2019t move any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was shocked to find out that her own spiritual energy had stopped circulating, as though the circulation had been deliberately stopped. Just what was that sound?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure do have some skills.\u201d That man stopped the music, and inspected Zhu Yao with a pair of narrowed eyes. In an instant, his expression turned cold. \u201cThen, I can\u2019t let you off.\u201d</p><br/><p>He slowly descended from the sky, and walked towards her a step at a time.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s heart sank. This time, she had miscalculated.</p><br/><p>The man stopped two steps away from her, the smile on his lips grew even more sinister and dangerous. He slowly raised the instrument in his hands.</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao clearly see what that object was. It was actually a gigantic feather. The rainbow colors on it looked as though they could move on their own, as they constantly flowed about. On the white stem of the feather, a row of words were clearly written on it. Bug (God\u2019s Artifact 2).</p><br/><p>As expected, this object was the target of the sidequest.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao clearly knew that he was going to harm her, and understood that she had to move away. However, her body didn\u2019t listen to her commands, she was simply unable to move an inch. She could only watch as that feather tapped on her forehead. In an instant, searing heat filled her entire body, and even her divine sense was faintly hurting.</p><br/><p>With emphasis on every word, he said. \u201cTell me your true name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled, a irresistible feeling suddenly rose from the depths of her heart, and subconsciously, she was about to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress! You can\u2019t say it!\u201d Sesame suddenly roared out. \u201cThis is a curse, he wishes to bind your soul! If you answer him, you will have to obey his every whim your entire life!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell!? It was this malicious?</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression sank. Evidently, he was dissatisfied with Sesame disclosing his intentions. With a twist of his palm, Zhu Yao felt the pressure turning heavier, and even her consciousness was becoming a little blurry.</p><br/><p>Who wants to be bound to you? You pervert! You\u2019re hurting this old lady to death! Can I say a fake one?</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, hold on. You must never answer him.\u201d Sesame grew even more anxious. As it stood against the pressure, it struggled to call out. \u201cAs long as you give a reply, no matter if it\u2019s your true name, the soul contract will take effect\u2026 puah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before it could even finish its words, the pressure on its body rose, pressing it even deeper into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak, what\u2019s your name?\u201d The man\u2019s expression instantly turned stern, as he ruthlessly stared into her eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao felt as though her soul was about to be incinerated by the searing heat, and she was already losing control of her mind, carrying a strong impulse to answer his question. Even if she desperately bit onto her own tongue, she was unable to stop the words that were about to leave her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress\u2026 You must not answer. If you say it, from today onwards, as long as he calls for your name, you will have to obey his orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>So one\u2019s name was the key to invoking the contract. But\u2026 wasn\u2019t something like this a setting of western fantasies? This is a completely different studio, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d The man coldly snorted, and looked at her in disdain as he confidently said. \u201cYou\u2019re just a mere Azoth practitioner. You think you\u2019re able to resist me?\u201d</p><br/><p>That impulse to say the truth in the depths of her heart was growing stronger, and Zhu Yao felt she was about to explode from bottling it up. Thus\u2026 She decided to yield.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s eyes brightened, showing an \u2018as expected\u2019 look, as he waited for the completion of the contract.</p><br/><p>As expected, Zhu Yao spoke her own name with emphasis on every word. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Einstein the Fourth\u2019s Sri Lanka\u2019s Artermis\u2019 Lin Zuoyue\u2019s extraordinary talent that came from ten thousand husbands and sons living in Yangtze Mountain who went to the clouds to battle whose name is too incredible and cannot be remembered clearly I dare you to remember this if you can hoho if you\u2019re able to recite this name I will address you as my ancestor or something you unprofessional black sheep China has five thousand years of rich history why the hell did you use a western fantasy setting whereby one\u2019s soul can be bound with the calling of one\u2019s name it\u2019s not like there\u2019s any use to bind the RMB next to you alright if I speak anymore than this the readers will think that I\u2019m just making up for the word count so I will just use the periods to replace the words below period period period period period period five thousand words have been omitted stomach is bloated from the drinks and food from supper motorcycle Levskey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you want a name? I will give you a name! As long as you\u2019re able to remember it.</p><br/><p>Man: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Beast herd: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need me to repeat it?\u201d Zhu Yao suggested especially sincerely.</p><br/><p>The man was stunned for two seconds, before he regained his senses from that ridiculously long name. His face instantly turned hideous. \u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Zhu Yao shamelessly nodded, and the talisman in her hand activated at the same time. Thunder rumbled and a gigantic dragon formed by purple lightning bolts descended from the skies, carrying a mighty pressure that was impossible to face head on. All of the demonic beasts looked towards the sky at the same moment.</p><br/><p>Utilizing an escape talisman, Zhu Yao teleported several dozen meters away. The pressure on her disappeared the moment she started reciting her name, so there was enough time for her to activate the lightning talisman.</p><br/><p>A lightning dragon came striking down on the man. Purple lightning lights instantly radiated across the entire skyline. Though Zhu Yao was already far away, the lingering might from the Ascension Tribulation Lightning still stirred her heart and soul. Even her Azoth Core was turning a little unstable.</p><br/><p>The demonic beasts present were even more so slammed onto the ground by the immense heavenly might.</p><br/><p>Ten seconds later, that light finally began to dim down.</p><br/><p>What was left of the place the man was standing on earlier, was a huge, charred black crater. At the center of the crater, rainbow flowing lights flashed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao flew back at this moment, and the thing that was emitting light was exactly the objective of this sidequest. Bending down her waist to pick it up, not only did she realize that there wasn\u2019t even a slight damage to the feather, it\u2019s radiance was as dazzling as ever. Even the Ascension Tribulation Lightning was unable to damage it, as expected of a god\u2019s artifact. But why did she feel that this feather was a little familiar?</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I never expected that I would lose to an Azoth practitioner.\u201d Suddenly, the man\u2019s voice once again sounded, and it faintly felt as though he was gritting his teeth.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled, as she cautiously looked at her surroundings. However, she wasn\u2019t able to see his figure.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a black fog slowly gathered in the air, forming a black illusory image. This energy was\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah~ It\u2019s another Devil.</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t she think it was even the least bit strange at all?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be conceited. In any case, I will definitely have my revenge for today.\u201d His sudden laughter was filled with an ominous air, emitting out an aura that was even colder than the black robed man\u2019s earlier. With an indiscernible look, he said. \u201cLittle brat. We\u2026 will meet again, soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s soon?\u201d She asked on reflex.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She could faintly hear the sound of him puking blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cArrogant brat, this daddy here shall kill you now!\u201d The Devil immediately unleashed his power, seething with rage, it pounced towards Zhu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d What did she say?</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to take him head on, in the instant he jumped on her, that bundle of darkness disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>In a cave residence at the demonic beasts\u2019 territory.</p><br/><p>A man dressed in a profound robe puked out a mouthful of blood, and the devillic aura scattered from his body. As he heavily panted, he pressed his hand onto his chest area, his entire body was trembling without end, as though it had seen some terrifying creature.</p><br/><p>Just who was it? To actually be capable of exterminating a strand of his god\u2019s will in an instant? His god\u2019s will couldn\u2019t even be resisted by that person back then, so why was it so easily\u2026?</p><br/><p>If he had not instantly cut the link with his god\u2019s will just now, even his main body would have\u2026</p><br/><p>He instantly grew fearful. Just when did such a terrifying individual appear in this world?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao placed down her hands which were in an art casting stance, released her divine sense to sense her surroundings for a moment, and only then did she ascertain that the Devil\u2019s aura was indeed not present around her. As expected, antagonists that speak too much were all just paper tigers. If you lost, then admit defeat, you just have to leave behind an image to say some words out of spite. You think you\u2019re Grey Wolf!?\u00b9</p><br/><p>However, that man earlier was probably not the Devil\u2019s main body, but a demonic beast possessed by a strand of his god\u2019s will. There might be a time when he would appear again to settle debts with her.</p><br/><p>Haah\u2026 Yet another troublesome matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~~\u201d A furry thing suddenly came rubbing against her leg.</p><br/><p>When she lowered her head to look, a fourth ranked young beast was hugging her leg with its two paws, lightly rubbing against it with a satisfied look.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was startled, and she immediately took a few steps back. She had forgotten that she was still within the herd of demonic beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeooow\u2026\u201d Seeing her suddenly retreat, that small young beast carried a disappointed look as it cried out. Tears seemed to be welling up in its eyes, as though it had suffered an immense grievance.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d What was this situation?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao looked around, and only then did she realize the area was abnormally quiet. Forget about the howls of demonic beasts, even the barrier thrashing sounds had stopped as well. Evidently, they were controlled by that god\u2019s artifact earlier, causing them to lose their minds. Now, they were wide awake.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Why were they all staring at her? Was there a need to look at her with such thirsty eyes? Hey, hey, hey\u2026 they\u2019re even drooling now, what\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s your pride? Where\u2019s your shame?</p><br/><p>\u201cI like her\u2026 I like her so much, like like like like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really, really want to lick her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like her too, I really want her to hold my paws.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to have her brush my fur.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to bear little beasties for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Have you guys really returned to normal? Don\u2019t learn from the Risefire Beast, hey!</p><br/><p>\u201cOuu~~ \u2517|\uff40o\u2032|\u251b\u201d Just when she was at a loss, Sesame leapt out, and with sweep of its tail, it blew away that young beast which was about to rub against her again. With a \u201cyou bunch of weaklings\u201d expression, it swept a glare at the beasts in the area. \u201cEvery single of you scram! I\u2019m Mistress\u2019 true contracted beastie. Ouu~~\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the tyrannical aura of a tenth ranked demonic beast blasted forth, slamming the beasties onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao rolled her eyes at it. You cannon-behind-the-horse\u00b2, when you were crawling on the ground earlier, why didn\u2019t I see you act so mighty?</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, Sesame.\u201d Zhu Yao stepped forward, a swept a glance at the demonic beasts. \u201cIs anyone aware of that black robed man who controlled you guys earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>The beasties looked at each other, and then shook their heads in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we came into realization, we already found ourselves here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. When I woke up, mistress was the first person I saw.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like mistress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOuu~~ \u2517|\uff40o\u2032|\u251b She\u2019s my mistress!\u201d Sesame instantly exploded.</p><br/><p>Haah, it seemed like I won\u2019t be able to get any clues. Zhu Yao sighed. \u201cAlright, everyone scatter then. If there\u2019s nothing else, don\u2019t blindly stroll around the human practitioners\u2019 territory. If possible, call back those beasties that are outside as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, mistress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, mistress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will listen to mistress\u2019 commands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow~~~\u201d</p><br/><p>Sesame: \u201c\u2026\u201d She\u2019s my mistress, hey! Why the hell are you all addressing her like that?</p><br/><p>The beasties which have regained their senses were rather obedient. After promising her, they raised their heads in unison and emitted out summoning howls one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back home, it\u2019s time to eat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back home, it\u2019s time to eat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back home, it\u2019s time to eat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The barrier shook for a moment, and thereafter, demonic beasts came flying back from outside one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt as though her three views had suffered a serious blow.</p><br/><p>As expected, it\u2019s best not to understand the demonic beasts\u2019 language.</p><br/><p>The demonic beasts continued to fly back from outside the barrier. However, unlike how difficult it was for them to break through it, as though there wasn\u2019t even a single obstruction, they easily crossed through the barrier. Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes shone. Could it be that this barrier worked single-way? One had to break through to get out, while returning could be done very easily. That meant she could\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was overjoyed, as she was still wondering how she would get back just moments ago. This would make things extremely easy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSesame!\u201d Zhu Yao kept the god\u2019s artifact, and kept Sesame while she was at it. Then, she immediately rode on her sword and flew to the opposite side. As expected, the barrier merely shook when she crossed it, and she passed it without any obstructions.</p><br/><p>Before she could even heave a sigh of relief, a fireball suddenly came flying towards her. Zhu Yao turned about, and immediately did a three hundred sixty turn with her transportation artifact, before she was finally able to dodge that fireball.</p><br/><p>So close.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-martial sister Zhu, it\u2019s you!?\u201d The culprit Yi Ling suddenly exclaimed, successfully attracting the attention of all the disciples. With a surprised expression, she looked at her. \u201cWhy did you appear from the demonic beasts\u2019 side? Could it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She took a deep breath, and had an expression that looked as though she had caught onto something incredible. After a short while, it then looked as though she wanted to hide something, as she explained to herself. \u201cIm\u2026 Impossible, I must have made a mistake. Why would senior-martial sister Zhu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell, Zhu Yao suddenly had the impulse to stomp this Mary Sue death. She would die if she didn\u2019t push aggro onto her for even a single day, was that it?</p><br/><p>\u00b9Grey Wolf: The main antagonist of \u201cPleasant Goat and Grey Big Wolf\u201d in a Chinese cartoon with over 500 episodes. He always set up traps in an attempt to catch goats, only to always fail in the end. His favourite phrase is \u201cDarn goat, I will be back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00b2Cannon-behind-the-horse () refers to someone who appears to help after an entire ordeal is already over. The phrase originates from Chinese Chess, where the Cannon chess piece right behind a Horse chess piece, while the Horse is in front of the opponent\u2019s general, it\u2019s a definite checkmate, and since the opponent\u2019s loss is undeniable, complaining or calling it out has no meaning at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

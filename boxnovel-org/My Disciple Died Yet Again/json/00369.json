Then, he immediately said with a stern look once more. \u201cDo not be anxious.\u201d Saying that, he turned towards another small road.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, we came from that road earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d His figure paused for a moment, and then, he decisively turned towards another road. Mn, he simply wanted to have a closer look. He definitely wasn\u2019t lost.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao caught up to him with a darkened expression. So her master was not just face-blind, but had a poor sense of direction as well. Without the GPS known as divine sense, he was completely unable to find his way. It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s a shut-in?</p><br/><p>In the next few days, a certain master completely demonstrated his basic conduct as someone with no sense of direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, we walked through that road before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, at the end of this road is the riverside which we rested at earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, we crawled up from that boulder over there earlier. Did you forget?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, stop marking on this tree. You have already marked it four times, this makes it the fifth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Master, why are you turning back? We just came from there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao!\u201d Yu Yan frowned as he finally stopped. He pulled in his disciple and said with a stern expression. \u201cYour master feels that it\u2019s best that we search from the sky, and use our divine senses to probe the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhu Yao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cMaster, weren\u2019t you the one who said that we can\u2019t use our divine senses to search for demonic beasts?\u201d You\u2019re just trying to escape the fact that you have no sense of direction, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master feels that for something such as Nascent Divided Pearls, they might not all be inside demonic beasts.\u201d He analyzed with a serious look.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Master, are you certain you\u2019re not lost?\u201d Enough, enough! I know you have no sense of direction already. Please pass me the authority to lead the way, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d A certain master still kept up his stern expression. \u201cPreviously on the first floor, among the five Nascent Divided Pearls in the five secret realms, not all of them were found within demonic beasts. It must be the same for this place as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen master thinks that\u2026\u201d Enough! Though having no sense of direction isn\u2019t an illness, please do not give up treatment!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Nascent Divided Pearls. They might be somewhere else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho\u2026\u201d Master, the way you\u2019re quibbling is so refreshing. She took a deep breath, and casually picked an unknown fruit from the tree next to her. \u201cIf it\u2019s not inside demonic beasts, are you saying they can even be grown from trees?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ting!</p><br/><p>You received 1 Nascent Divided Pearl. Gate Key 2 \u2013 Completion Rate: 1 / 10</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Ying: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked at the fruit in her hand that suddenly turned into a green pearl, staring at it silently for three seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>They\u2019re really growing from trees, hey!</p><br/><p>Where\u2019s your most basic conduct as a quest item? Do you have to be this random?</p><br/><p>\u201cMn, it seems the path that your master has chosen isn\u2019t wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Master, do you have to be this shameless?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao carefully inspected the tree, and it looked extremely normal. If not for it being filled with fruits hanging on its branches, it wouldn\u2019t even have any decorative value either. Furthermore, the fruits on the trees were extremely green. Just by looking at it, she knew that they were the type where their sourness would seep into her tastebud with just a single bite. However, a tree like this was actually filled with Nascent Divided Pearls. At that moment, Zhu Yao felt that she had truly stepped on dog shit.</p><br/><p>It seemed like them circling around this forest for more than a month was not a fruitless effort.</p><br/><p>All of them grabbed ten each. After hearing a series of notification bells, the ten Nascent Divided Pearls merged into a colourful marble-like pearl. Written on it was \u2018Gate Key (2)\u2019.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao never expected that they would pass this stage so easily this time. It was so easy, she couldn\u2019t believe her own eyes. After adjusting themselves, they decided to hurry back to the previous divine city and head up to the third floor.</p><br/><p>This time, they did not need to look for demonic beasts, and so they could wantonly use their divine senses to look for the path back. In the end, after scanning through, she found out that they were actually at somewhere extremely north of the second floor. Zhu Yao recalled that when they left the city back then, they had clearly gone south. Yet, they actually managed to find their way to the northern side. She had to admit that her master\u2019s standard of direction sense was already beyond godlike.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Yu Yan held his disciple with his usual look, and flew up into the air. They, he headed straight in the direction of the divine city. In the depths of his heart, he was already experiencing waves of joy. With the powerful GPS known as the divine sense, a certain master had instantly turned into an expert guide as he picked the nearest road. He could finally fly confidently, fly freely, and fly willfully! His disciple no longer had to worry about him not having a sense of direction either!</p><br/><p>Because they made an incredibly huge detour in the beginning, they naturally did not pick the same road as before. Zhu Yao thought that their speed would increase dramatically, but her master suddenly stopped after flying for an hour and stayed in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned as he looked towards the distance. \u201cThere\u2019s people in front of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao swept her divine sense through, and indeed, there were auras of Deities in the surroundings. However, they were quite a distance away, so she couldn\u2019t get a clear sight of them. Furthermore, a faint scent of blood was lingering in the air. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not reply, instead, his expression simply turned heavier.</p><br/><p>Though, Yue Ying at the side spoke up. \u201cIt\u2019s the people we formed a squad with before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur former squad?\u201d Zhu Yao was stunned. \u201cSquad Captain Nangong Huang!? Let\u2019s go over!\u201d</p><br/><p>She increased her speed and immediately flew in the direction where the scent of blood was coming from. As she had expected, fifty kilometers away, Former Squad Captain Nangong was lying on the ground covered in blood. He was missing an arm, and the wound there was uneven, as though it was tore out by something. A large pool of fresh blood stained the ground as he panted, half-kneeling on the ground. His aura was unstable, and even the number above his head was constantly flashing between \u20182\u2019 and \u20183\u2019. Was he about to drop a level?</p><br/><p>\u201cNangong Huang!\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but call out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Nangong Cheng.\u201d The person on the ground roared back out of habit, and then he was stunned when he saw Zhu Yao. \u201cWhy is it you? Why\u2026 are you all here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who should be asking you that. Why are you injured so heavily? Where\u2019s the others?\u201d Zhu Yao cast a few arts to stop his bleeding. Wasn\u2019t he in a squad with that Mary Sue? Why was he here alone?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe others\u2026\u201d Just as he was about to explain, he suddenly recalled something and pushed her away. \u201cHurry and leave this place. Otherwise, it will be too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Before Zhu Yao could even figure out the situation, she hearing a sharp and terrifying roar. The surrounding atmosphere felt as if it had dropped by several dozen degrees as a bone-piercing chilling wind blew.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late!\u201d Squad Captain Nagong\u2019s face instantly turned miserably pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2026 Yao!\u201d Yu Yan pulled up his disciple and shielded her behind him. Forming hand seals with his two hands, various inscriptions instantly flew out of his hands. At that moment, spanning a territory of several dozen meters in radius, a transparent barrier was instantly erected. Dozens of enormous spiritual swords descended from the sky, circling around the surroundings and firmly protecting the people within.</p><br/><p>This was\u2026 the Five Ways Sword Spirit Formation! A defensive formation that merely second to the Nine Tribulations Five Ways Lightning Formation of Lightning Divine Palace!</p><br/><p>The moment the formation was completed, the surroundings rumbled. Several hundreds of demonic beasts of various types and sizes appeared. They then began to wildly crash against and bite the barrier.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao was stunned. Earlier, there wasn\u2019t even a single movement. Just where the hell did all these demonic beasts come from?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use.\u201d Nangong Cheng\u2019s face turned ash-grey in defeat as he looked at the three people in front of him with eyes filled with guilt. \u201cThis demonic beast is lured over by an Annihilation Formation. More and more of them will appear. Forget about the three of you, even if there\u2019s thirty of us, we definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Annihilation Formation\u2026</p><br/><p>The Annihilation Formation that would annihilate all living beings! Who would place down such a formation?</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned even deeper. He directly called out his own Life Artifact, the lightning sword, and took a few steps forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 for pulling you all down.\u201d Nangong Cheng looked at Zhu Yao with a face filled with guilt.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not speak for now.\u201d Zhu Yao cast an art to temporarily stop his bleeding, and then entered his body to inspect it with a strand of divine sense. She realized that his internals were damaged especially heavily, and even his meridians were about to turn into mush. His Dantian even had the dangerous traces of cracking. She immediately sat down in a lotus position behind him. \u201cFocus and calm yourself, I will help restore your Dantian and heart meridians.</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind!\u201d Nangong however shook his head. \u201cWe are not even able to escape now. You will just be wasting your divine energy. Dongfang girly, don\u2019t care about me any longer. I can\u2019t live for long anymore. If you all of you charge out with all of your strength, there might be a sliver of hope\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all these nonsense that you\u2019re spouting!\u201d Zhu Yao ignored his words and immediately slammed her palm onto his chest and inserted a strand of divine energy into his body. This strand stabilized his collapsing Dantian with all its might.</p><br/><p>Nangong Cheng still insisted on explaining. \u201cThere are so many demonic beasts, and not to mention, they are demonic beasts with an extremely dark attribute. If you bring me along, you guys basically can\u2019t escape at all. Take this opportunity where the demonic beasts are not stacking up yet and flee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d She did not realize it before, but he was even a chatter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious, Dongfang girly!\u201d Nangong Cheng was anxious. He persuaded her while spitting out blood. \u201cThis gratitude for helping me, this old man shall pay back in my next life.</p><br/><p>However, this crowd of demonic beasts are all extremely dark beasts that stay in the north. Only lightning can deal with them effectively. You guys beat them.\u201d The more he spoke, the more he felt despair. \u201cIf we don\u2019t leave now, we won\u2019t make it in time. Unless you guys are capable of inviting the people of Lightning Divine Palace\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Rumble!</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, lightning sparks lighted up the entire sky. Lightning bolts with the width of a bucket and descended from the sky. The lightning bolts that surrounded the encircling demonic beasts struck fiercely. In the sky, a snow-white figure was currently holding onto a lightning sword. Even with a light swing, lightning sparks continued to fill the sky.</p><br/><p>Eh!?</p><br/><p>\u201cLight\u2026 Lightning\u2026 Lightning Divine Palace!\u201d There must be something wrong with how I got injured. Why the hell does Daoist Beichen know how to wield lightning-type arts!? \u201cDong\u2026 Dongfang girly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhu Yao used this opportunity to guide out her divine energy and sealed four out of five of his damaged meridians. Then she stabilized his near-collapse Dantian, before standing right up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 Is he really your master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirect disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d If he\u2019s not my direct master, are you telling me that you\u2019re my master?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Didn\u2019t they say that only a single person from Lightning Divine Palace had entered? When did it become a total of three?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That way, it will be more convenient for the great deities to undergo your registration.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhu Yao blanked. \u201cNo\u2026 No need.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to turn back into a jade.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was unwilling, the peapod did not continue to persuade her, and queued up behind her in a serious manner.</p><br/><p>Goudan then explained at the side. A very large number of spiritual monsters wished to enter the Advent Cloud Hall, so, for the sake of convenient registration, everyone would return to their original forms to accelerate the registration process. In order to prevent confusion, the ones queuing here were basically all vegetables. There was even a zoo at the other side.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao turned her head around, through the half-open door, she looked at the other side. As he had said, it was a room filled with animals. Everything from chickens, ducks, cranes to rabbits could be found there. It seemed like, the Advent Cloud Hall was rather popular, seeing that so many people wished to enter it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about human practitioners?\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would human practitioners need to register? As long as they are willing, they can enter the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s the case.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao and Goudan queued for exactly four hours, before their turns came. The one in-charge of registration was an Earth Deity, and evidently, he wasn\u2019t really paying attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, great deity. I\u2019m called Li Goudan.\u201d Dog-Egg proudly answered.</p><br/><p>The Earth Deity\u2019s hand paused, and he even woke up from his drowsiness. He raised his head and swept a strange glance at Goudan. This name was really too\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao silently looked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your original form?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m an arrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>That man once again gave him a strange look, and Dog-Egg once again raised his head proudly.</p><br/><p>The corner of the Earth Deity\u2019s lips twitched, as he recorded it on the deities\u2019 list. Then, he looked towards Zhu Yao at the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext. Name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao hesitated for a moment. Since she\u2019s concealing her identity, naturally, she shouldn\u2019t reveal her Daoist name.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she wasn\u2019t speaking up, Goudan answered on his behalf. \u201cI\u2019m together with her. She\u2019s Till Yo-\u201c</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao slammed him onto the table. Till your sister! You\u2019re Till Your Throat Breaks!</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho. I have the surname Zhu. Zhu\u2026 Po!\u201d She simply did not want to use the word \u201cJade\u201d in her name, and her original surname \u201cZhu\u201d did not actually matter.</p><br/><p>The Earth Deity looked at the two of them strangely. \u201cOriginal form?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 a jade.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did he sloppily record it down on the deities\u2019 list.</p><br/><p>Though, Goudan gave her several strange looks. Although he could sense that Zhu Yao wasn\u2019t a human practitioner, he had never thought that she was actually a piece of jade. It was no wonder she dealt such painful hits.</p><br/><p>After the two of them had successfully registered, they were brought into a room. In that room, there were only four spiritual monsters, and all of them were vegetables.</p><br/><p>After a closer look, there was that peapod from before. Other than him, there was a carrot, a garlic, and a cabbage. The moment the two of them arrived, they were brought out by someone. After countless turns, they actually arrived at a water-filled domain. In front of them was a boundless silver-colored ocean.</p><br/><p>A few people were scattered by the ocean shore. After a closer look, they were a rabbit and a weasel. The Earth Deity who brought them over pulled out a paper boat. The paper boat quickly grew larger, and not a moment later, it turned into a huge boat which dozen people could sit on.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet on the boat.\u201d The Earth Deity said to the animals and vegetables present. \u201cThe Advent Cloud Hall is past this water domain. As long as you reach the other end, your first entrance trial will be considered passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Getting on the boat together? Zhu Yao blanked. Including those two animals? Wouldn\u2019t something occur like this? Those several vegetables evidently became flustered, as they looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Hey! That rabbit over there, can you restrain yourself? Can you stop drooling while looking at that carrot?</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat deity, are we really going to\u2026 get on the boat together with them? Are there any other\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Earth Deity who guided us, coldly glared at the vegetables. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the nonsense? If you don\u2019t want to go on the boat, you can opt out now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vegetables instantly turned silent, and obediently went on the boat. Though, that rabbit\u2019s eyes turned even redder. The only one which was calm was that weasel. He simply narrowed his eyes at the rabbit, before instantly retracting his gaze and raising its sharp mouth up high.</p><br/><p>After getting on board the boat, everyone consciously returned to your human forms. Only then did Zhu Yao was able to clearly see the genders of these animals and vegetables. The peapod, garlic, and weasel were three youthful men, while the carrot and cabbage were two little ladies. Unexpectedly, the rabbit was actually a fatty, his stomach was so huge, it could even fit a swimming pool. His eyes were still staring at the carrot little lady, unblinkingly.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was especially tense.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to know each other.\u201d The peapod youth stood up, and said with a friendly expression. \u201cI wonder how I should address everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>With someone breaking the ice, the rest of the people heaved sighs of relief as well. The rabbit gulped down his saliva. \u201cI\u2019m Whitey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYellowy.\u201d The weasel replied after.</p><br/><p>The carrot said. \u201cI\u2019m Carroty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression darkened. Whitey, Yellowy, and Carroty. These names were given a little too sloppily, right? It\u2019s as though the next one would be called Cabby.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Cabby.\u201d The cabbage little lady stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao instantly felt stuffy in her heart. You guys gave yourselves such sloppy names, do your parents know about them?</p><br/><p>In an instant, she felt that not only did these spiritual monsters not have high cultivation levels, their intelligence weren\u2019t actually great either. She silently glanced at Dog-Egg at the side. Alright, this person\u2019s name wasn\u2019t really high-end either.</p><br/><p>An instant later, the animals and vegetables had all said their names, and it was time for Zhu Yao\u2019s and Goudan\u2019s turns.</p><br/><p>Goudan proudly slapped his chest, and said out loud. \u201cI\u2019m Li Goudan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment his voice fell, Zhu Yao instantly sensed that the gazes of all the spiritual monsters had concentrated on Goudan. This idiot, no matter how poor your name is, you shouldn\u2019t just give up on yourself. Look, as expected, you\u2019re being scorned now.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a good name!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>In an instant, all of the vegetables and animals came gathering towards him, and looked at Goudan with worshiping gazes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour name is actually made of three Chinese characters![1]\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, just like those great deities. Brother Li, how did you come up with this name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou even have a surname. Your cultivation level must be really high, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d There\u2019s something wrong with this scene, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh, it\u2019s just so-so!\u201d Goudan scratched his head a little embarrassingly. \u201cI received my name from boss.\u201d He stretched out his finger, and pointed at Zhu Yao who had long been squeezed out of the crowd.</p><br/><p>In an instant, all of their lines of sight turned towards Zhu Yao one after another.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao revealed the name she just came up with. \u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m called Zhu Po.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a mere instant, the crowd\u2019s sparkling eyes which were filled with expectations, were extinguished after a single sizzle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, isn\u2019t it just two Chinese characters as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd here I thought that her name would be much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It should have four Chinese characters, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could the quality of names be determined by how many characters they had? Where did all of you learn your aesthetic standards from?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. I really wish to have such a beautiful name like Li Goudan!\u201d The rabbit spirit said with an intoxicated look.</p><br/><p>The crowd of vegetables and animals chimed in unison, as they continued to look at student Dog-Egg with worshiping gazes.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just how was this name beautiful?</p><br/><p>Letting out a sigh, she decided to not care about these spiritual monsters which had irregular aesthetic sense. Zhu Yao turned around, and asked the Earth Deity who guided them and was standing at the shore. \u201cGreat deity, may I ask when can we depart?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guiding Earth Deity turned and glanced at her. As though he had seen through her Profound Deity cultivation, he did not belittle her like the rest of the spiritual monsters. \u201cFellow deity, there\u2019s no need to rush. Your group is still missing one person. After everyone has arrived, we can depart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Missing one person? Just as she was clarify, she suddenly heard resounding boing sounds not far away from them. Even the earth itself was trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d The Earth Deity said.</p><br/><p>Not far away, a circular pillar-shaped object was currently running over one leap at a time. With every leap, large amount of dirt would be lifted into the air. After a closer look, that was actually a pure-white mushroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cMushmush!\u201d Zhu Yao could not help but shout out.</p><br/><p>The mushroom blanked. Raising his mushroom cap, he looked towards the boat. After sizing her up for a moment, the mushroom cap tilted, and he called out. \u201cGuo\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with this feeling of having a reunion after sixteen years?[2]</p><br/><p>As though he had confirmed her identity, the mushroom took a forceful breath, and leapt onto the boat.</p><br/><p>Boom\u2026</p><br/><p>The floor of the boat was penetrated with a smash.</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGuo\u2019er? Guo\u2019er, is it you? I had such a hard time finding you!\u201d The mushroom nudged himself, and then, came pouncing towards her, as though he was so excited, he could only express it with a hug.</p><br/><p>With speedy hand-eye coordination, Zhu Yao instantly stepped away. A hole was already made in the boat, if she was crushed under him, wouldn\u2019t she become a piece of meatloaf? \u201cMushmush, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to find you!\u201d The mushroom looked at her with teary eyes. \u201cYou materialized your human form?\u201d He sized Zhu Yao up in surprise, before satisfyingly nodding his mushroom cap. \u201cNot bad. As expected of the jade spirit which had stayed with me. You have only materialized your human form a little later than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can materialize your human form as well?\u201d It had only been a few months since they last saw each other. Not bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The mushroom carried a prideful look. \u201cMy cultivation has improved by a huge amount. That\u2019s right, where did you go? I searched the entire forest, yet, I was still unable to find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 It\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the two of you?\u201d Just as Zhu Yao was about to explain, she was interrupted by the Earth Deity by the shore, whose expression had darkened. \u201cBy destroying the boat, do you guys not want to go to Advent Cloud Hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Zhu Yao realize that this wasn\u2019t the time to reminisce. After giving the mushroom a \u2018we will talk about it later\u2019 look, she turned around and apologized to that Earth Deity. \u201cGreat deity, please forgive us. Me and my friend were simply too excited over our grand reunion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019re excited, you can\u2019t just destroy the boat!\u201d The Earth Deity still carried a fuming expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will fix the boat now.\u201d Zhu Yao cast a restoration art, speedily restoring the smashed hole which Mushmush made. Not even a single scar could be seen from the damaged spot after the restoration.</p><br/><p>Only then did the person\u2019s expression look a little better, though he still moved his lips a little. Or was he not speaking up in consideration of Zhu Yao\u2019s Profound Deity cultivation?</p><br/><p>He loudly shouted. \u201cYou people can depart now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boat then automatically slid into the waters, travelling towards the boundless ocean.</p><br/><p>The mushroom then came leaping towards her. Because of his huge figure, every single one of his bounce would cause the boat to tremble thrice. After bouncing for two to three times, he had successfully pulled in all of the hatred from the entire boat full of animals and vegetables.</p><br/><p>\u201cJade spirit, let me tell you\u2026\u201d Yet, he was still unconscious of his surroundings, as his entire mushroom figure was filled with the excitement of being able to see her again.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why don\u2019t you first return to your human form.\u201d You have improved your cultivation, but don\u2019t give up on your intelligence, hey. Can\u2019t you see that rabbit is no longer looking at the carrot, but is now looking at you with drool on his lips?</p><br/><p>The mushroom blanked, revealing a look of extreme unwillingness. After hesitating for a moment, he said. \u201cAlright then, I shall allow you to witness the heroism and might of my human form.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The mushroom closed his eyes, and circulated the divine energy in his body. A white glow emitted from his body, enveloping the entire mushroom within it. His gigantic figure began to shrink as well, and gradually, he materialized a human-like figure. After a moment, the white glow slowly receded.</p><br/><p>And the face that was revealed\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao simply felt a tremble in her heart, as she fiercely widened her eyes.</p><br/><p>This is impossible!</p><br/><p>[1]The Chinese names of the vegetables and animals only have two characters at most. Ex: Yellowy (-Huanghuang), etc.</p><br/><p>[2]In Legend of the Condor Heroes, Guo\u2019er and his aunt were separated for sixteen years at one point.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

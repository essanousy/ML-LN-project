Zhu Yao felt like crying. Don\u2019t be like that. What happened to \u2018friendship first, competition second\u2019? She really did not intervene in the match on purpose.</p><br/><p>Just when she was about to swallowed whole by the surrounding glares, a figure flashed right in front of her. A white figure had appeared before her. A terrifying pressure was spread in all four directions, and like a silent threat, everyone instantly kept their unsatisfied glares.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d It was her master, the master who saves her from all bitterness and difficulties.</p><br/><p>Yu Yan\u2019s face was cold as always, and he lightly glanced at her. \u201cIt\u2019s getting dark.\u201d</p><br/><p>His sleeves fluttered as he waved his hand, and without even explaining, he carried his disciple and flew back to the Jade Forest Mountain, leaving an audience who did not even have time to react.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo silently looked towards the direction the two people disappeared to, cold sweat dripping down his head. Ancestral-martial uncle, you openly protected your disciple for personal reasons, and then, you left me to handle this mess. Are you really a man?</p><br/><p>Heaving a deep sigh, Zi Mo regained his senses. He\u2019s a Sect Master who specialized in cleaning the backsides of others, after all!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem! Xiao Yi is the victor of this match. In this Inter-Sect Tournament, he\u2019s number one in the Essence group.\u201d Only when these words fell, did the sounds of discussions among the audience finally stop.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi endured the rumbling blood in his chest, and forced himself to stand and bow. \u201cThank you, Sect Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xuzhi stood up and left the ring. This was an outcome that was within his expectations, he had indeed lost this match. As he thought, he was still not strong enough. Raising his head, he looked towards the direction Zhu Yao had flown to, a feeling of melancholy suddenly rose in his heart. When he recalled the scene when the humongous sword was falling towards him earlier, he could not help but deeply frown again.</p><br/><p>When Zi Mo was about to announce his reward, he was stopped by the sonorous cry of a bird nearby.</p><br/><p>Sovereign Feng Yi, the only woman out of the three Demigod practitioners, who was sitting on her mythical bird, gently stood up. It was just a simple movement, yet, her movement was like that of a fairy\u2019s. With a light raise of her left hand, Xiao Yi, who was still kneeling on the ground earlier, suddenly rose into the sky, and flew towards the tall stage, stopping at the empty floor of the tall stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2019re called Xiao Yi?\u201d An ethereal voice echoed gently.</p><br/><p>Xiao simply felt as though, from the skies, a soothing voice floated towards him, and each word rang in his mind. He could not help but kneel. \u201cYes\u2026 Xiao Yi is this disciple\u2019s name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi\u2019s beautiful eyes closed slightly, and she only continued to speak after a short while. \u201cAre you willing to admit under my tutelage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi was stunned. Not just him, even if it was everyone on-site, they were all unable to believe their ears. A Demigod Sovereign was taking in a disciple. And the person was the only woman out of all the Demigod Sovereigns in the cultivation world, who was said to have not taken in a single disciple.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he did not reply for a long time, Feng Yi\u2019s brows creased lightly. \u201cYou\u2019re not willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this disciple is willing.\u201d Xiao Yi was filled with surprise and was completely moved, he had to bite his lips tightly to prevent his tears from falling. He had thought that, even if he were to obtain first place, he would only return to the Inner Sect. He did not expect that he would have such an opportunity. It seemed there were still people that would treat him well in this world. He gently lowered his body, giving her the most sincere bow. \u201cThis disciple, greets master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi nodded. Forming a hand seal one-handedly, a bright ray of light shot towards Xiao Yi\u2019s forehead, leaving a mythical bird-like marking.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s actually a personal succeeding disciple! Waves of heavy breathing could once again be heard from the surroundings.</p><br/><p>And regarding all these, Zhu Yao, who was currently being carried back home like a little puppy, was completely unaware.</p><br/><p>The moment they reached the mountain peak, she immediately made an innocent-looking face, and looked at her own master pitifully. \u201cMaster\u2026 It really was unintentional. I didn\u2019t mean to intervene, I don\u2019t even know what happened to me earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, I swear!\u201d Zhu Yao raised one of her hands. No matter how stupid she was, she knew that it was an one-on-one duel.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely because of that huge spiritual sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I saw that spiritual sword, my entire body felt strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong!\u201d Yu Yan finally replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Eh? Master, what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master glanced at her chillingly, his face was filled with contempt. \u201cWhat that person summoned was not a spiritual sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d If it\u2019s not a spiritual sword, what else could it be? A katana? Master, don\u2019t fool me.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Sword Intent.\u201d Yu Yan said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cSword Intent!\u201d Zhu Yao was shocked. \u201cIsn\u2019t Sword Intent something that can only be trained by sword practitioners who are at least at the Azoth-stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn theory, yes.\u201d Yu Yan frowned. That Sword Intent was hidden extremely deeply, even a Demigod practitioner might not be able to see through it at first glance. \u201cSince he was able to bring out his Sword Intent, he must definitely have an exotic treasure on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a definite answer, and not a suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder he was able to cultivate to an Essence Paragon in such a short amount of time, even after being crippled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was not merely at the Essence-stage!\u201d Yu Yan once again gave her a stupid look. \u201cThat exotic treasure of his, not only is it able to conceal his Sword Intent, it\u2019s able to hide his cultivation level as well. His current cultivation level should be around the intermediate stages of Foundation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s eyes widened. Foundation intermediate-stage! Oh my god, this isn\u2019t as simple as a poor person making his counter-attack, the way this scenario is progressing, he\u2019s basically heading towards the summit in life.</p><br/><p>A light bulb flashed in her mind. She finally understood why he looked a little strange to her. His experiences, were evidently the treatments male protagonists receive in novels!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, do you know what exotic treasure he has?\u201d A male protagonist who has been bullied since young, obtains a godly treasure by chance, and then, he raises his level as he fight monsters, as he walks down the path heading towards the peak in life. The longer Zhu Yao thought about it, the more she felt Xiao Yi was similar to male protagonists like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know what exotic treasure it is, it\u2019s definitely extremely beneficial to his Spirit Veins. Hence, he was able to raise his cultivation level this rapidly, and was even able to comprehend Sword Intent, which exceeded his current level of strength.\u201d Yu Yan slightly frowned, and turned to look at his stupid disciple. \u201cSword Intent is incomparable to a spiritual sword, regular Mystic Arts are basically unable to resist against it. However, the Heavenly Lightning you guided down earlier, although it could not be compared to Disaster Lightning, it\u2019s still power of the purest form in the world, hence, it was able to disperse his Sword Intent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d Zhu Yao stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout that ray of Heavenly Lightning, his opponent would have turned into a corpse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s expression instantly paled, fear began to rise from the bottom of her heart, and terror instantly struck her entire body. The mistake that she made by coincidence, actually saved little wimp\u2019s life. Although she understood that a bunch of cannon fodders would lay behind every rising male protagonist, she had never thought that, one of her closest people would become one of those cannon fodders.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his disciple had been silent for a while, Yu Yan raised his hand and stroked her head. \u201cDo not worry, even though he possesses heavenly luck for obtaining this unusual treasure of his, your luck is not smaller than his.\u201d Her affinity to lightning spiritual energy was high to the point of defying the heavens, an exotic treasure might not even be able to compare to that.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao\u2019s thoughts were still deeply filled with little wimp\u2019s safety, as she nodded her head randomly. The more she thought about it, the more worried she was. It was just a simple competition, and a life was almost lost. Wouldn\u2019t the future be worse? \u201cMaster, about little wimp, I mean Wang Xuzhi, he should be fine, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Yan frowned deeply. Does she have to be this worried about the safety of an outsider?</p><br/><p>Recalling the scene where his disciple and that kid was chatting happily earlier, how they looked rather intimate, and how she did not even bother looking at her master on the tall stage, he suddenly felt a little irritated, as though he had the feeling of a boar was suddenly eating the vegetables he had personally grown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Zi Mo\u2019s disciple, if something happens to him, he has his own master to worry for him.\u201d He looked at coldly, his expression was telling her not to care about the kid.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yao curled her lips. He\u2019s not your child, so obviously, you wouldn\u2019t be worried. It was just a competition, yet, his opponent actually dropped his killing move on him. Who would be sure that he would not create more trouble in the future? In any case, even if he did not dare to do some things in broad daylight, it did not mean he would not do them in the dark. She clearly remembered Xiao Yi\u2019s warped three views, after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, do you have any defensive mystical treasures that you can lend to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The coldness of Yu Yan\u2019s expression instantly fell to ice point. She wants to use his mystical treasures on that kid? He began to feel even more irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone!\u201d Even if he did have some, he would not hand them over. He did not have any interest in bringing up a disciple who belonged to someone else, as it was already hard enough to bring up his own disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Master, didn\u2019t you say that, the higher one\u2019s cultivation level, the more mystical treasures one possesses?\u201d Master, you\u2019re trying to fool me, aren\u2019t you.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are foreign objects. One\u2019s cultivation must depend on oneself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave an early rest, in a few days, I will teach you another new Mystic Art.\u201d After saying that, his figure flashed, and he could no longer be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cStingy! Petty! Compassionless!\u201d Zhu Yao stood there and silently complained. He isn\u2019t even willing to give me a hundred dolla- pui! He isn\u2019t willing to give me a single mystical treasure. He\u2019s so stingy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

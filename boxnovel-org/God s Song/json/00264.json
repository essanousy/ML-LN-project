He never made a public appearance after the premiere of opera \u2018Godfather\u2019 so it was hot news that he was in New York.</p><br/><p>He only had one response for the reporters pouring questions on him at the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpera \u2018Godfather\u2019 is my last performance and the album I\u2019m working on with Maestro Jun will be my last album. I will not be coming out with anything from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>He is the only person who could know if the reason why he declared that his last voice is the opera \u2018Godfather\u2019 is a marketing tactic to raise album sales.</p><br/><p>When Argento arrived at the studio, his jaw dropped at its size.</p><br/><p>\u201cA full orchestra? No, it\u2019s bigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s big enough to accommodate a chorus as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell well. Are you intending to become secluded in here? Like a dragon locked up in a dungeon. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI intend to be that dragon for the 2 years until JS Center opens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about that incredible orchestra? Is it good enough as your instrument?\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento knew about his recruitment of orchestra members, since it made noise all over the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re tuning it first. There\u2019s a lot to fix up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to tell when we\u2019re recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>These are songs that he is singing for the first time in over a year, but Argento did so well that he got the OK sign from Jun Hyuk in one go. It was clear that he had practiced a lot with the recording ahead of him.</p><br/><p>The short time period of a year brought a lot of change to the old man. His voice got rougher and it made a metallic sound. This kind of voice is more like that of an old mafia\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Opera viewers, who had been unable to hear Argento\u2019s singing, will listen to the album and think it a pity that there will never be a casting so perfect for the role.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the entire recording process took over 6 months. All of the singers had different schedules, so it was difficult to gather people for their duets and trios.</p><br/><p>Even 6 months was only possible by recording singers and working on the mixing separately. If they had done it properly, it would have easily taken over 1 year.</p><br/><p>For 6 months, Jun Hyuk not only worked on the opera album, but he produced a total of 4 albums. The 3 musicians who made his ears perk up while he was vacationing in Switzerland, the musicians who arranged Jun Hyuk\u2019s album to release albums.</p><br/><p>The female singers from England and America, and the rock band from Northern Europe\u2019s Finland put lyrics to the music that Jun Hyuk made for them and flew to New York.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lyrics are in English.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Maestro. It\u2019d be stupid to put Finnish lyrics to such an amazing song.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Finnish rock band did not want to miss this perfect opportunity to get out of their country and become known worldwide, so they put English lyrics in for all of the songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 I liked the special characteristics of Finnish. And I did compose the music with that in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>They all became uncomfortable. If they receive this maestro\u2019s touch, they are bound to become stars.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t the media compare them to Cinderella as well? They were given media attention for the first time with just the fact that they received Maestro Jun\u2019s music.</p><br/><p>But they cannot keep playing around in Finland\u2019s small market.</p><br/><p>\u201cSing in your mother tongue so you can deliver your message exactly. Even if people in other countries can\u2019t understand the lyrics, they\u2019ll get your sincerity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, our English is perfect too. There isn\u2019t a language barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>They cried out quickly. They want to become like the global band from Finland, Nightwish.</p><br/><p>They were dreaming of becoming the 2nd Nightwish, placing on Finnish charts for half a year whenever they release albums and selling out world tours.</p><br/><p>And it felt like they had their hands on the door to achieving this dream now. But they can\u2019t use English?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still foreigners. I\u2019m sure you can write, speak, and hear in a different country\u2019s language perfectly. But in order to express your personal deep area, the mother tongue is better. You didn\u2019t write the lyrics without thinking, did you? And I\u2019ll say it again, but I fell for the Finnish language.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Maestro, in order to get your great music out to the whole world, isn\u2019t it better to use English?\u201d</p><br/><p>The band members made great effort to persuade Jun Hyuk, but Jun Hyuk grew even colder.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve misunderstood\u2026 but I don\u2019t care whether your band reaches worldwide stardom or the best band in Finland. I gave you the music and proposed creating an album because I wanted to bring out your musicality, potential power, and the zest of your language.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the band members could not respond to Jun Hyuk\u2019s determinedness. They realized what they had mistaken. The young maestro is not a star making producer like Quincy Jones. He is someone who does not care about anything beyond creating perfect work like popularity or money.</p><br/><p>\u201cEither come back with Finnish lyrics or let\u2019s just say this didn\u2019t happen. Since I\u2019ve prepared the airline ticket and hotel, take a tour of New York and go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. We\u2019ll rewrite the lyrics in Finnish.\u201d</p><br/><p>They quickly shouted out while waving their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll extend the time that you stay in the hotel. Take your time and create great lyrics. Then.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the band members left with their shoulders slumped down, Jun clucked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cKids don\u2019t know what late bloomers are.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The last record was Colin band\u2019s 2nd album. Once the world tour was over, Alvin Lee went back to his hometown. He is a musician who plays the blues with just an acoustic guitar and his voice in a small theater for 2 hours every night.</p><br/><p>Countless agencies gave him calls to sign on with them during the tour, but he refused all of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a drug addict. I\u2019m just restraining myself. The life of a big star will inevitably test my resolve, and I don\u2019t have the confidence. I don\u2019t want to start snorting cocaine again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He chose the path of seclusion.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked over the score and demo CD that Colin gave him, and did not hide his admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. You\u2019ve even become tasteful and restrained now. There really is a difference after swimming in big waters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTodd\u2019s influence was big. It\u2019s not the Colin band anymore. It\u2019s just Violon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you be the producer? Just like this without arranging it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin showed his confidence. It could become better with Jun Hyuk\u2019s arrangement, but it is also his will to show their own music.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m really expensive, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you have a good alumni discount.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laughed and Colin put his hands together to ask politely.</p><br/><p>All of the albums including Colin\u2019s will be released through JS Music, an affiliate record label that will be established under JS Foundation.</p><br/><p>Until JS Foundation\u2019s official launch next February, Jun Hyuk was busy with producing music and training his orchestra, while Isaac Stern was busy focusing on establishing the foundation.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The sound engineers were unable to spend their time idly at the studio even on days when there were no official album recordings. Jun Hyuk recorded the orchestra\u2019s practice sessions everyday, compared the sound heard through speakers and the sound heard in real life, and tuned the equipment.</p><br/><p>When orchestra practice ended in the giant recording booth, Jun Hyuk was always recording something while playing the drums, guitar, and synthesizer by himself.</p><br/><p>They even had to spend all night working whenever the hard disk was completely full with music files and they needed to mix the tracks according to the order Jun Hyuk gave them.</p><br/><p>Songs ranging from guitar riffs that are easy on the ears, drums with concise tempo, to symphony rock songs that are over 10 minutes long, kept stacking up without indication of where they would be used.</p><br/><p>Today without fail, Jun Hyuk played alone in the recording booth. When he came out, 2 people were waiting for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlex! Eli! Goodness.\u201d</p><br/><p>LA Sound\u2019s top producers Alex Jenkin and Eli Gotez bowed to Jun Hyuk in exaggerated noble gestures.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Maestro. It\u2019s an honor to get to meet you like this again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? Stop playing around and get up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 men straightened their backs and hugged Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe thought you\u2019d become the leader of a top band like U2 or Metallica, but you went beyond our imaginations. Who knew you\u2019d become Beethoven?\u201d</p><br/><p>He realized that a lot of time had passed by looking at them. Alex Jenkin\u2019s sharp eyes had become gentle and Eli\u2019s hair was starting to grey.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. I was a Clayton-Hoffman student at the time. I was more in classical music than a band.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, everyone shook their heads saying that it was their first time seeing the score. There were a few who showed interest in the music, but he did not have any intention to discuss it with them. The important thing is to find the composer.</p><br/><p>He looked for a week, but he could not find the source. Eventually, everyone except the professors he had not asked had shaken their heads saying they were seeing it for the first time.</p><br/><p>Um Ki Jun decided to check the remaining possibility. He assumed that the song had already been released and someone had downloaded it off of the internet. It could be a song that is not yet known in Korea, a wasteland for contemporary music.</p><br/><p>Um Ki Jun scanned the score again and sent it to Park Ji Kuk, a college classmate studying abroad in San Francisco. His classmate said that he was seeing it for the first time and was sure it is an unpublished song since he had gone to America to study contemporary music.</p><br/><p>After sending the mail to his classmate, he did not get a response for a day. He thought that it was an emotion that only he had felt. It is like when not all people who see Picasso\u2019s works of cubism are in awe.</p><br/><p>Due to the time difference, a call at dawn told him that he had not felt it alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Um Ki Jun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me honestly. Where did this song come from? You didn\u2019t write it, did you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Jin Kuk\u2019s voice of anger hit him hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cLower your voice! I can hear well. So, you saw the e-mail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and just answer. Did you really write it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have sent the sheet program file if I had written it. That was printed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen whose is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI sent it to you because I don\u2019t know that. Look into it. You know it\u2019s hard to find new works here. This is the first time you\u2019re hearing it? It\u2019s really unpublished?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. If a work like this had been published, it would\u2019ve already been a big deal. You really don\u2019t know? Then where did it come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Um Ki Jun went through how the score had come into his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean there\u2019s a genius hidden in our school? No way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s possible? The score I scanned was printed. Or it was downloaded and printed.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way a student who could write a song like this would not have stood out. He would have been revealed through the countless assignment pieces and reports.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of those old farts at the school would have written it\u2026 Where did this guy come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems great even to you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to say it. This is a really novel take. I don\u2019t know how to express it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. There\u2019s a big chance the person who wrote this doesn\u2019t go to our school. Doesn\u2019t it seem most likely that someone found this on the internet somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo write such an innovative song and just put on the internet? Then that means this person is nameless\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Marco Giavelli still at your school? The principal conductor of the San Francisco Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. That man. He doesn\u2019t come out to the school. He completely retired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you get in contact with him? Try showing it to him. Let\u2019s see what he thinks of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do we need to check that. You can tell it\u2019s a work of art just by looking at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop playing around. You don\u2019t know this industry? Don\u2019t you know it doesn\u2019t matter if nameless people like us like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>A society where the people with authority make evaluations and where that is the only opinion that counts. If this music were to be assessed as a work of art by Maestro Marco Giavelli, who was once one of the best conductors, there would be no need to question it any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that would be better. And who knows? He might know who the composer is. Or it might be easy to find out who it is through his connections.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep looking too, so call me right away if you find anything out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Um Ki Jun was still so excited after hanging up with Park Jin Kuk that he was no longer sleepy.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Park Jin Kuk used what little money he had to buy a box of high quality Cuban cigars, and went to Marco Giavelli\u2019s mansion. When he was serving as professor, Park Jin Kuk had come face-to-face with him nearly everyday, but it had become rare since he retired.</p><br/><p>He prepared the cigars that Marco Giavelli likes because he felt sorry to go looking for him with a favor instead of just visiting.</p><br/><p>Marco Giavelli greeted his former student with a friendliness that made it feel as though they had seen each other the day before, and laughed when Park Jin Hyuk gave him the cigars.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still remember what I like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should have come to visit more often.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. When you get old, there are more times when it becomes bothersome for visitors to come. All you have to do is occasionally check on me to make sure I\u2019m still alive. Ho ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>After chatting for a bit, Park Jin Kuk slowly handed the score over to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, can you take a look at this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? Did you compose this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I would like to hear what you think about it once you take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marco Giavelli lit a cigar and after taking a deep puff, he relished the fragrance and started to read the score.</p><br/><p>Before he had even turned the first page, the cigar was getting to its end in the ashtray. He had forgotten he lit a cigar because he could not take his eyes off of the score.</p><br/><p>Even the old man called a maestro was no different from Um Ki Jun or Park Jin Kuk. He sighed deeply and put the score down multiple times, and put the score down after almost an hour.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Maestro, is this a song you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Jin Kuk saw that he had put the score down and spoke carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 Who wrote this kind of song\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Maestro Giavelli\u2019s stammering indicated that it was indeed his first time seeing the song.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either. It came into my hands by chance. We are looking for the composer now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marco Giavelli suddenly stood up from his chair and poured two glasses of wine from his refrigerator.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a drink. I must have one because my hands are shaking so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Jin Kuk took the glass and felt delighted inside. He had not seen it wrong. This work is a masterpiece.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, I would like to hear your honest assessment of this piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why do you only have the 1st score? Is it incomplete?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are checking that as well. I just have the score by chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I would get to see such a masterpiece before I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first assessment is \u2018masterpiece\u2019. This is praise beyond expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song is\u2026 hm\u2026 How should I say it? Right. Should I say it opened a new door in music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA new door?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. In the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic eras, music was a tool to deliver a beautiful emotion to the listener. As we came to the present time, it gained a role in delivering that emotion. Loneliness, sadness. Anger. Happiness, et cetera. It also throws philosophical messages as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marco took a sip of his wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this song is showing that now, music can relay senses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say senses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. This song is relaying physical pain. Not the emotion of pain, but the pain itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>When we watch a movie with a scene where someone is getting beat up or being tortured, our bodies flinch. We are imagining that pain. Contemporary music exists to transmit that imagination.</p><br/><p>To follow the assessment, this music has the power to allow for an indirect experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have a hard time looking at this score?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was hard. It\u2019s just a 10-minute song, but it took an hour to read through all of it. It was painful to keep turning the pages.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it right there. With just the music, you have the thought that someone is hitting you \u2013 no. No it\u2019s not a thought. No, it\u2019s at the level where your brain sends the signal that you are being beaten. That\u2019s what I mean when I say it relays senses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marco Giavelli lit the cigar again and closed his eyes to enjoy it without speaking.</p><br/><p>Park Jin Kuk quietly waited to see what else he would say, and heard something unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 What a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? What are you saying is a waste\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering if it would be possible to hear this song in real life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, maestro. We\u2019re going to find the composer and we\u2019ll get the rest of the scores.\u201d</p><br/><p>The maestro waved his hand at Park Jin Kuk\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I was saying that it might be impossible to perform this song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>That is when Park Jin Kuk understood what he meant when he said that he might not be able to hear the song.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would perform this? What orchestra can perform this? Will the members and conductor be able to handle the pain they have to experience while they perform? It\u2019s already this difficult to imagine it while reading the score. And that\u2019s just the 1st score. But until the 4th? I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marco Giavelli shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay that someone could perform it. How many audiences do you think there will be for this kind of music?\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Jin Kuk drank his wine in one gulp, but his frustration did not go away. He had not considered the audience.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the people who are able to understand the music, it\u2019ll be too hard for them to listen to it. For the people who can\u2019t understand, it\u2019ll just be noise. There are only a few people who can listen to this. Is there a planner who would put this on stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a masterpiece, but a performance may be impossible. Who is the person who created this kind of dilemma?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, I want to meet this composer no matter what. Is it okay for me to show this score to my friends? There could be someone who knows whose work this is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. That\u2019s actually what I wanted to ask of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Park Jin Kuk was satisfied with hearing Maestro Giavelli\u2019s evaluation, but was kept repeating his gratefulness that he would be willing to help in the search for the composer.</p><br/><p>As soon as Park Jin Kuk came out of Marco Giavelli\u2019s home, he called Um Ki Jun to tell him what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cKi Jun, we were right. The Maestro didn\u2019t hold back on compliments. He liked it more than we did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s a work of art in anyone\u2019s eyes. Except to the old farts at our school.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men relaxed after confirming the work\u2019s value. It was up to here. Now they just have the difficult job of finding the person who made the song.</p><br/><p>\u201cKi Jun, try checking with the professors too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? You\u2019re saying that because you don\u2019t know? I\u2019m dead the day I bring up the word \u2018modernism\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust ask them slightly. Don\u2019t show them the score.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What do you think about this song? I think it could be great if you arrange this into a piano song. You can put in some orchestration too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The song Jo Hyung Joong had selected was the OST \u2018From the Sun to the Boy\u2019 from Shin Hae Chul\u2019s animation \u2018Soul Cavalry Lazenca\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you heard this song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve heard Shin Hae Chul\u2019s other albums but this is a first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then listen to the original first.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the elaborate introduction came out of the CD player, Jun Hyuk moved naturally with the rhythm. It was a good choice. It was a song full of the trademark heaviness and pomp of Shin Hae Chul\u2019s experimental band N.EX.T. It was like rock opera.</p><br/><p>When the song ended, Jun Hyuk opened his mouth slowly,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I would like to do a different song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? A different song? Why? You don\u2019t like this one? It would sound really good as a piano instrumental. The audience could enjoy it even if it\u2019s an instrumental with the original\u2019s orchestration in the background.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong looked at Jun Hyuk with disbelief and brought up the rule that they had to abide again,</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? There are issues with copyrights. If we change the song now, the staff has to go get the rights to that. There\u2019s also a problem of royalties. It\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re saying it\u2019s okay as long as there are no copyright issues?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Oh, are you thinking of doing an original song? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to hear me out first? During a live performance, if an audience full of young people hear an instrumental they don\u2019t know, they\u2019re just going to sit there. You won\u2019t get any response. There\u2019s no producer who will air that on TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard for anyone to respond to music heard for the first time. Even if the audience reaction were to be edited, it could not be done in a natural way to hide the awkwardness. The live stage had to be fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an original song\u2026 It\u2019s a song from about 300 years ago, but would the copyright still be an issue? It\u2019s a song that young kids all know, too. It\u2019s famous and has been played in many different versions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you thinking of a classic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I was thinking of doing Pachelbel\u2019s Canon. Since there isn\u2019t a copyright, the producer and staff don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong fixed his glasses as if trying to hide his frustration. As Jun Hyuk said, anyone would know the song just by listening to the introduction. It was overplayed though.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, that song is already famous for people like George Wilson and Lee Galloway. And if you want to perform classical, you can go on a concurs. You\u2019re going out on a competition for popular music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot the piano. I\u2019ve tried making two versions. The original is three violins but\u2026 the first version is three guitars instead of violins. The second is a rock version like the ones you see on YouTube. I wanted to do it like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChange the violins to guitars\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>Three guitars. There was nothing to expect if he was just switching the violins to guitars. The rock version of Guitar Kids on YouTube was good, but there was too much of that as well. If you search Canon on YouTube, there were more videos of the song done in electric guitar than there were of the classical version.</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong did not like how Jun Hyuk was thinking and he did not bother to hide it,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, the song is good. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad. As much as it\u2019s a famous oldie, there\u2019s nothing new. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll make the new version, but you won\u2019t be able to show your own creativity.\u201d</p><br/><p>The VJ who had been silently filming the two spoke carefully,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what if we try hearing Jun Hyuk play it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The VJ wanted to film Jun Hyuk play his two versions of Canon and Shin Hae Chul\u2019s \u2018From the Sun to the Boy\u2019 to make more material for the broadcast.</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong had forgotten that the camera was filming everything and that this was all content to go on air. It seemed like a good idea to try listening to everything since they still had a lot of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Should we? It wouldn\u2019t be bad to listen to everything and choose then, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll objectively assess which of the three will have the most impact on the audience for the first stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk went into the recording booth and sat in front of the electronic piano instead of the guitar. The VJ focused the camera on him and looked confused,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, I thought you said it was a guitar version?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll play From the Sun to the Boy first. I only need to play the piano once, so let\u2019s finish this first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong was at a loss for words. He had said that it was his first time listening to the song. He was changing a song he had heard for the first time into a piano instrumental. If he was able to do this, he was in fact the genius that Yoon Jung Su had said he was.</p><br/><p>While Jun Hyuk played the piano, the VJ and sound engineer were puzzled and Jo Hyung Joong who had been frozen began to smile widely when the song was ending. Yoon Jung Su had an eye for people. His eye for seeing talent was unmistakable.</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s smile did not disappear until Jun Hyuk finished his song and came out of the recording booth,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, the music stops too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound engineer had been wondering the same thing. The running time of the song was over five minutes, but there were too many parts where Jun Hyuk stopped and the piano did not even play for four full minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you said you wanted to put the orchestration in this song. Since it\u2019s not a piano solo\u2026 I matched it to the orchestra.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su was wrong. It was not that \u2018He could be a genius\u2019; he was a genius.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

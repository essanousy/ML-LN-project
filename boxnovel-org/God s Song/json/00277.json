They could tell how starved and tired she had been.</p><br/><p>After 1 month, her skinny cheeks and hands became fleshed out.</p><br/><p>She was taken back and forth to the hospital to check on her health, and they heard something to despair of.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. Jina will never be able to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing like a cornea or eye implant will work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely damaged. It\u2019s the same as if arms and legs were cut off. Just as arms and legs cannot be attached even with donors, it is difficult even if she has an eye donor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor was also regretful and his voice was weak as he explained Jina\u2019s state.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd about Jina\u2019s age. What age do you think she is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard she is 10.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. By the state of her teeth, she seems to be at least 13 years old. Fortunately, it\u2019s not too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean too late?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she eats and rests plenty at least now, she will be able to recover a normal physique. She can\u2019t just stay inside the house too much just because she cannot see. She needs to run around like other children and build up her stamina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s decision to make sure that she would never experience unhappiness even if she will never be able to see again.</p><br/><p>And after Jina had been living with Jun Hyuk for 1 month, the feared day came to them.</p><br/><p>Amelia finished her tour and came home with a stony expression. She already knew through the media that Jun Hyuk had brought a girl home from India.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdopt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia sighed lightly and Jun Hyuk was just watching for her reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I say no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 then I guess I\u2019ll have to be her custodian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019re her custodian, doesn\u2019t that mean she\u2019ll live here with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe\u2026 yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s just a difference in the term. How is that different from adopting her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs\u2026 is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk wasn\u2019t even able to lift his head and was only resenting Yoon Kwang Hun. He had not come even though he knows that Amelia was returning today.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then that child, what was her name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Jina will call you dad and what about me? She\u2019ll call me mom anyway. No?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia\u2019s voice grew increasingly sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodness. I\u2019m still a Miss who hasn\u2019t gotten married. But mom!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 then you can marry me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk spoke, sparks flew from Amelia\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you asshole! Get out of this room, no, this house you jerk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia\u2019s eyes were already full of tears than anger.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, you idiot. How does it make sense to propose so you can adopt a kid? You think of that as a proposal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. I think of Amelia as the only girl in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara came to comfort Amelia who had been crying all night, and Jun Hyuk who had gotten kicked out just drank with Yoon Kwang Hun.</p><br/><p>When Yoon Kwang Hun found out about Jun Hyuk\u2019s mistake, he wanted to give him a smack. How women take children men bring home from outside is common knowledge found in soap operas.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what of it? You already told her you guys should get married to make a mom for the kid. Did you think she\u2019d like it if you proposed like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go crazy. Really\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was not because of Jina. Marriage is a scary thing to him but if he does do it, he thinks that the only person he would marry is Amelia. He could not imagine another woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a really serious situation. You guys could break up now because of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is this jerk yelling? You did it to yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun only said things that would annoy him as though enjoying the situation. He did not worry because he knows what kind of person Amelia is.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, think about it. With those looks and the fame of a world-renowned pianist. How many guys do you think follow her around because they like her? But she only looks at you. She endured it even if you didn\u2019t propose to her. But you bring a little girl from India and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk yelled at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s unnecessary words.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh! Stop and lay out a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I know? I lived alone all my life. And I\u2019m taken aback too. I have a granddaughter all of a sudden. I\u2019m becoming a grandfather all of a sudden\u2026 How will Amelia feel when I\u2019m like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t it. He thought that he would be able to persuade her but spitting out a proposal at this appropriate timing because of his dumb mouth was the biggest mistake.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk drank his beer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia probably would have fully accepted adopting the kid. She\u2019s open-minded. But she exploded when you asked to marry because of the child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun emptied his beer bottle and told Jun Hyuk the only way he knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be best to show her your sincerity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSincerity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Amelia is the only woman in Jang Jun Hyuk\u2019s life. There\u2019s only you in the past, now, and in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk imagined buying a diamond ring and getting down on one knee to propose. It is a method with a 100% success rate in the movies.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about a diamond ring the size of a baseball. You\u2019ll get beaten with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sincerity.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk just drank while thinking of a way to express his sincere feelings.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Jun Hyuk pushed a piece of paper under Amelia\u2019s door and spoke as he knocked,</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia. Make sure you look at that. I\u2019ll wait in front of the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he had been waiting at the door for about 20 minutes, the door opened.</p><br/><p>Tears were running down Amelia\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>Her hand trembled as she held the paper Jun Hyuk had given her. She looked at Jun Hyuk and suddenly wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk whispered into Amelia\u2019s ear, she hugged him even harder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk proudly talked about his successful proposal, Yoon Kwang Hun let out a low whistle in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better than I thought. How did you figure it out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou told me to show her my sincerity. So I showed her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s eyes grew wide. He had just said that because he had nothing else to say, but it worked?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just told her? Your sincerity? She believes that? Amelia\u2019s dumber than I thought. She believe\u2019s a man\u2019s words.\u201d</p><br/><p>How great would it be if people could show their sincerity with just words? Words can hold truth and lies, so it is difficult to tell what the truth is.</p><br/><p>This is especially true when people are angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven I know that words aren\u2019t enough. Fortunately, I had a document that would let me show my sincerity. In Korea. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKorea? Document?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I showed her my will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Will? You already made something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t even dreamed of something like that even though he is now 60, but Jun Hyuk already wrote one? Yoon Kwang Hun looked at Jun Hyuk in disbelief and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost 10 years ago? You don\u2019t remember when strange people appeared saying that they\u2019re my biological parents?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, when you had your concert in Seoul.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Lawyer Baek Seung Ho created a will then to put out any fires. He said that no one would try to go after money that already has an owner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun could guess why they had written the will without saying a word to him about it. His name will be in that will.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia was the heiress in that will?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Just two people, you and Amelia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun hit his knee.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect. You were the only woman from 10 years ago. There\u2019s nothing more sincere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not know that he would use his will like this. Yoon Kwang Hun couldn\u2019t not say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why is my name there? You thought you\u2019d die before I did?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust in case. I was young then\u2026 he he. I thought geniuses die quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk flushed in embarrassment. Yoon Kwang Hun saw this and started laughing again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smoke, you only drink sometimes, and you go jogging every morning, but die quickly? You\u2019re going to live longer than Jina.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not all geniuses die premature deaths. Einstein lived 76 years. Living like Jun Hyuk, he will live for more than 80 years.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This means that they are treated like beasts or livestock, no, even less than that since people are not believed to be unclean just because they touched animals. These people are banished as though they have a contagious disease.</p><br/><p>These dalits are usually a group of workers who take on the work despised by Indian society like corpse treatment, leather repair, street cleaning, and toilet waste disposal. They face contempt, prejudice, and religious, cultural, and social discrimination in their lives of poverty.</p><br/><p>In the past, they regularly had their eyes taken out just for looking at sacred scriptures, their tongues cut off for talking about the scriptures, and any body parts that touched the scriptures cut off.</p><br/><p>Though a lot of these inhuman discrimination and acts have disappeared in modern times, there are still remnants of unimaginable discrimination.</p><br/><p>There is a child who lost his vision when his teacher beat him just for drinking water at school, and they are not even able to receive the lunch rationed out by the state.</p><br/><p>These children have lunch by eating the other children\u2019s leftovers even though they are students of the same school.</p><br/><p>Dalits need to take on manure treatment, but they cannot use machine but must use their bare hands. They also need to clean out manholes, but a lot of people die due to toxic gas.</p><br/><p>These are not old stories, but stories of today in the 21st century.</p><br/><p>The interpreter did not allow Jun Hyuk to touch the little girl because of her social rank. And before the interpreter could finish speaking, dozens of rough men were already coming toward Jun Hyuk\u2019s group. There were so many of them that the bodyguards looked tense.</p><br/><p>The scumbags looked at the interpreter and spoke roughly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say that we should leave if we\u2019re not going to give the children money.\u201d</p><br/><p>The terrified interpreter was barely to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell them we\u2019ll meet with this child\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk spoke with his teeth clenched. If he could, he wanted to kill all of these people on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Parents? Didn\u2019t you hear what I just said? The parents already sold them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense and hurry up and tell them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the interpreter could relay Jun Hyuk\u2019s entire message, the men burst out in laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say they\u2019ll sell this girl if you like her. They\u2019re asking for $10,000.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? $10,000? These fucking assholes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The interpreter was able to understand up to the word \u2018dollar,\u2019 but unable to understand the rest. The interpreter does not know Korean.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk breathed roughly, thought of people who would be able to kill these guys for him, and yelled to Tara.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. Call the White House. I need to talk to the President.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t make this bigger\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Tara could finish speaking, Jun Hyuk shouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up and do as I say! Who else can help me right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara took out her phone with an anxious expression. She became even more nervous when she thought of the time difference. It must be the middle of the night in Washington.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Maestro. Why are you calling me all of a sudden? I was actually trying to decide whether I should call you or not. I mastered the songs up to the 5th one. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The President spoke over the phone in a pleased voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. President. I am calling about an urgent matter. I ask you to forgive the rudeness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk pushed down his anger and spoke in a well-mannered tone first.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. A call from you would always be welcome, even if we were in the middle of war. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a personal favor to ask of you, would it be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>The President stopped laughed and became silent before speaking calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, tell me what it is. I\u2019ll decide if it\u2019s alright or not after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk gave a brief account of his current situation. That bastards who cut off young children\u2019s hands and feet are bustling here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then what is the favor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care whether it is the Indian Prime Minister or the head of the police, just anyone who can catch these bastards in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 Is that all? I was nervous thinking you were going to ask me to launch a nuclear missile or something. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as Jun Hyuk heard the President laughing, he felt nervous. But he heard the President\u2019s refreshing response right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it. I\u2019ll do that personal favor for you. It seems like this is urgent, so I\u2019ll take action right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. President.\u201d</p><br/><p>He heard another voice before Jun Hyuk could even finish his greeting. It seems the President was connected over speakerphone. And the voice he hears now is not the President\u2019s. It must be a staff member.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, will you tell me your current location?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk told him what the compass on his phone said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move and stay in that spot, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the call ended, the interpreter had become pale and was looking at Jun Hyuk. Goodness, to mobilize the American President.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at the interpreter and spoke coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go too. I don\u2019t even want to look at you. What? I\u2019ll suffer if I touch the child? Your face is dirtier and uglier!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk spoke, a bodyguard dragged the interpreter away. That bodyguard\u2019s face was distorted in anger as well.</p><br/><p>After Jun Hyuk\u2019s bodyguards and the rough men held off in confrontation for about 10 minutes, a loud helicopter and siren sounds rang with the arrival of dozens of motorcycles.</p><br/><p>They used the fastest method of transportation because of the terrible traffic jam. A special task force in the helicopter landed on the ground and the police on the motorcycles ran over.</p><br/><p>They aimed their rifles and blockaded the surrounding area, with a middle-aged man in a suit running over. He saw Jun Hyuk standing in the middle of his suited bodyguards, and took his hat off.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Jun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you hurt anywhere? I\u2019m from the Mumbai office. I\u2019m Commander Farhan Akhtar. I received an urgent call that you are in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Commander Akhtar introduced himself in fluent English as he looked over Jun Hyuk\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, please take care of those guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk gestured to the swarm of rough men. Their faces were severely distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to us. But beyond that, it\u2019d be best for you to leave this place. We\u2019ll escort you to your hotel. But this child?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl was frightened by the sound of the helicopter and sirens, and held tightly to Jun Hyuk\u2019s pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to protect her for a while. I\u2019ll tell you in detail later. And Commander, are you also averse to this child because of her social standing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk tested the Commander who was trying to help him. He became strangely sensitive while looking at the poor child.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm. You\u2019re saying she\u2019s a dalit? I\u2019m embarrassed that you saw the bad habits left over in our culture.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s face flushed red with the Commander\u2019s courteous words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. I was harsh, forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. Let\u2019s talk about stuff like that slowly, and let\u2019s start moving first. With this little girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Commander took the little girl\u2019s hand and showed effort to calm her down.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s group arrived at their hotel with a police escort.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, relax here. I\u2019ll take care of what happened today and call you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you. I\u2019ll be waiting for your call.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Commander saluted Jun Hyuk and quickly went back.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Tara took fast measures to find a hotelier who could speak in English perfectly, and she and a maid took the little girl shivering in fear into the bathroom.</p><br/><p>The girl sat in the bathtub full of warm water and when she heard the language she was familiar with and the hotel maid\u2019s touch, her fear began to subside little by little. Before they knew it, there was even the sound of giggling and playing with the water.</p><br/><p>There was no way to know whether it is because she is a child or because it is her nature, but she quickly started adjusting to the sudden change in environment. She seemed to be rather enjoying it.</p><br/><p>The girl bathed, changed into new clothes, and started to eat the food that the maid brought her, completely leaving her fear behind her and filling her empty stomach. Her face lit up with joy.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk watched her bright face with satisfaction, and picked up the receiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. President. Thank you for listening to my strange favor. It was figured out well thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, can you tell me exactly what\u2019s going on? I asked the Indian office to help you because you were in danger\u2026 but it seems that wasn\u2019t the actual situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled brightly and told the President what he just did.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou basically rescued me. I discovered a little girl who is like me, or maybe even rarer to find than I am. We\u2019re together right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Someone similar to you, Maestro? You don\u2019t mean\u2026 How could that be?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

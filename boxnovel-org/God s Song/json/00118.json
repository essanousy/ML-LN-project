Who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Alex Zakin from LA Sound\u2026 Do you know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline threw his fist in the air and silently yelled YES! multiple times. Finally!</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Zakin.\u201d</p><br/><p>LA Sound. It is a label that emerged in the 80s, when a pop metal called LA metal swept the world. When other labels disappeared in the 90s with the introduction of alternative rock, LA Sound caught on to the trend and brought out bands from the American West to make them stars. That LA Sound grew into a leading label covering the entire U.S.</p><br/><p>Gaining the attention of Alexander Zakin with the Midas touch as LA Sound meant that they had unlocked the first gate to stardom.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard your band\u2019s music. It\u2019s very appealing.\u201d</p><br/><p>To hear the word \u2018appealing\u2019 from the maker of stars. Coline wanted to fly to LA immediately if he could.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Zakin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have songs other than the one on the online store?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019d like to hear the rest of the songs\u2026 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to send over a demo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I can. I\u2019ll get it ready right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not make a single mistake with this golden opportunity. Coline ran straight to Jun Hyuk, but Jun Hyuk kept the door bolted and told him to go away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Didn\u2019t I say one song? I can\u2019t do anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, it\u2019s Alex Zakin. The Zakin of LA Sound!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s LA or Washington, I don\u2019t know. If you don\u2019t stop, you won\u2019t see me ever again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not even Jun Hyuk\u2019s yelling could curtail Coline\u2019s excitement. He told his band members immediately and they gathered in the practice room to make song selections. They chose the 5 best songs and ran to the recording studio.</p><br/><p>Coline and the band members painstakingly recorded the songs for 2 days and did not sleep trying to finish the second half, but did not even know that they were tired.</p><br/><p>After completing the music, they made the files in the highest sound quality and sent them as an e-mail to Alex Zakin.</p><br/><p>Coline quit checking his views in the Apple store and was instead, checking his e-mail every hour. However, Alex Zakin did not even open the e-mail he had sent even as a few days passed.</p><br/><p>When he was so frustrated that he could not even sleep, he could not wait and called. Zakin himself called to ask for the music, but was not even paying attention now!</p><br/><p>However, a secretary answered instead of Zakin. Not even the 1st secretary, but what seemed to be a training junior secretary at that.</p><br/><p>It must be because he is an extremely busy person. He would deliver the message to check his e-mail. Coline just ended the call because he could not keep listening to the employee repeat these kinds of responses.</p><br/><p>There must have been an effect of calling because he received a message that the e-mail had been read and all he had to do now was wait.</p><br/><p>Your music is great. Let\u2019s prepare for a tour right away. He waited for a response with this content, but there was still no news.</p><br/><p>Finally after 2 weeks, Coline took the call he had been waiting for form Zakin.</p><br/><p>\u201cColine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Zakin.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a more anxious moment than when he had been waiting for his acceptance notification from CH School of Music. What decision had he made?</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize for the late response\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, there was no longer any reason to contact you but I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he mean there was no reason to contact? What does this mean? His hand holding the phone began to tremble. He had an ominous feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cI needed to know the reason why the music that came up on the store is so different from the music in the demo. It\u2019s to the point where I thought it was a different band.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of cases where one song just stands out so I was thinking that\u2019s what had happened, but it\u2019s too different. Since you\u2019re the person who made the music, can you explain it to me? Why is there such a deviation when the band is the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you as the person who made the song doesn\u2019t know, there\u2019s no longer a reason for us to stay on the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline could not figure out what Zakin\u2019s first question meant. Then there was a truth he remembered right away. The arrangement and tips Jun Hyuk had given them in just one day had made such a difference that they thought the music was from another band.</p><br/><p>While Coline hesitated, thinking of how to explain it, Zakin\u2019s voice became cold,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it seems there\u2019s something you\u2019re hiding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Send me an e-mail when you want to come clean. That\u2019ll be the last opportunity you can grab. Then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline stared blankly at the phone. He could not believe this situation that had come and gone like a rain shower.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cAlex, aren\u2019t you scaring him too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Even this is too little for kids these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think our speculation might be wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid Coline is going to send an e-mail. And he\u2019s going to come clean with who the arranger and producer are. You want to make a bet? I\u2019ll bet $100 he e-mails me within an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin spoke with confidence.</p><br/><p>First, a staff member gave him a song saying that there is something he should listen to. One of countless $1.99 singles in the Apple store. It was one amongst thousands of songs uploaded for free every day, but this had been uploaded boldly with a price.</p><br/><p>When he first heard it, he thought that it was not by a rookie. All rookies have a rough taste. It is difficult to find a band out of thousands with music that can move someone through its roughness. It had not been touched, but it moved a person\u2019s heart. The band that LA Sound was sifting through thousands for. Though Coline\u2019s band lacked the rough taste, it showed a refined taste.</p><br/><p>That refined taste had moved Zakin and made him want to contract them.</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin saw so much potential that as soon as he heard Coline\u2019s single, he held a staff meeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me your thoughts. Starting with the cons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Criticism came pouring out as soon as Zakin spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hook is weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t enough of a rough taste for a band performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLyrics are mushy too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive these kids grew up spoiled. Maybe college students in New York?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he had heard enough cons, it was time to hear the pros. He would weigh them and decide on the heavier side.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the pros?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe melody is good. They can have a wide spectrum for their target audience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bassist is excellent. And it\u2019s refined.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin snapped his fingers and stood up from his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it right there. Refined. This band\u2019s greatest forte. They did pretty well for recording in a cheap studio, no? I don\u2019t know who did the directing, but that\u2019s the leader of this band.\u201d</p><br/><p>It meant that someone great had done the directing and had amazing producing. Alex Zakin thought someone in the band had played this role and was determined to contract whoever it was even if they had to throw the band away.</p><br/><p>He asked for the rest of the songs to be sure, but none of the 5 demo songs showed the abilities of the producer. The demo songs just had a much better band similar to the countless bands with the rough taste. It was at a level where they could perform at local clubs and would need a lot of revision to make a nationwide debut. They had left the producing of these types of songs to someone.</p><br/><p>It was certain that the songs themselves belonged to the same group, but the song on the online store was like music where a great chef showed skill with bland music whereas the demo songs felt as though the ingredients had just been thrown together.</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin\u2019s expectations were not wrong. An e-mail came before 30 minutes had passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this brat kidding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin wanted to curse as soon as he read the message. Coline\u2019s e-mail was full of excuses that they had not been able to record the demo properly because they had been in a rush.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, send a text message to this brat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? A text?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Not to lie to me. And Ili, you\u2019re taking over this kid now.\u201d</p><br/><p>LA Sound\u2019s producer Ili Gotez had attended the meeting for no reason and felt like he had been hit. He was sure this kid Coline lives in New York, but to go to New York from LA?</p><br/><p>He might have to leave warm LA. He had heard that New York winters are brutal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

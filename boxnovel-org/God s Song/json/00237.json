My wife\u2019s skin is not tight and black, but crisp and white.</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>My wife held back her vomit as she washed me, washing away not only the vapors of my body but also her love through her fingers.</p><br/><p>She started to enjoy washing the smooth body of a friend who loved her more than she liked washing my dirty body.</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee sang slow and calm to Jun Hyuk\u2019s acoustic guitar fingering. When the song ended after 3 minutes, Alvin Lee\u2019s manager was clenching both fists.</p><br/><p>Of Alvin Lee\u2019s songs up to now, none were so alluring. The lyrics did get to him a little, but he is sure that Alvin Lee\u2019s voice and the melody dominating the music will be able to cover that drawback.</p><br/><p>The following 11 songs were over, but no one could speak for a while. President Stern was the one to break the aftertaste of the music.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. You didn\u2019t make all of the songs with just an acoustic guitar accompaniment, did you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. This is the acoustic version. Of course there\u2019s a band version.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee could guess why he created 2 versions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac, don\u2019t be too surprised. I think Jun created the acoustic version for me. Is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I heard you like small shows, so I wrote it to fit that so you can perform it in the future. What do you think? Did you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee hugged Jun Hyuk instead of responding. He has not heard the band version yet, but his story has been captured with just one guitar.</p><br/><p>A feast of verses; where a hook should have followed the intro. There were times when the songs ended at the climax (bridge) and those that went into the outro. They are songs that are difficult to get used to, but not music that will flash popularity and then fade away.</p><br/><p>When the aftertaste of Alvin Lee\u2019s voice disappeared, the people who quickly came back to reality were those at the record label.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlvin. Do you have any intentions to edit the lyrics a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had been lost in the music and remembered something they had all been forgetting. The references to drugs, swearing, and sex pose great disadvantages when receiving TV ratings for the music video.</p><br/><p>Getting a rating of TV-MA (programs that are inappropriate for children under 17) poses a big minus to marketing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. Jun wrote the music without touching a single word, so we can\u2019t change it for a music video.\u201d</p><br/><p>The record label officials seemed not to have much expectation when they asked. They shrugged and smiled bitterly without asking any further.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. With a song like this, the music video can\u2019t act as an excuse for low sales. Jun, when can you be done with recording?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern spoke fervently. He has certainty from experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can be done by November.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s release it in December for the Christmas season.\u201d</p><br/><p>People are reluctant to release albums in December in America. The Grammy awards, which open every February, announce the candidate list in November. Albums released after the nominations are announced can be considered for the next year\u2019s awards, but they are normally buried because attention has withered over time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t sometime around March be better? It\u2019s hard for anything other than carol albums to get popular in December\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrust me. I\u2019ll make it so we\u2019ll be preparing for a world tour starting in March.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one spoke further because of President Stern\u2019s confident voice.</p><br/><p>When Colin and Kyung Min Ho were exhausted from Jun Hyuk\u2019s constant criticism and directing, a whopping 3 albums came out to the world.</p><br/><p>The jazz album with Lee Carlton and Stanley Clarke \u2018The Second,\u2019 , came out as a double album, and the Seoul concert was released as \u201cJUN &amp; Alvin in Seoul\u201d with a live video.</p><br/><p>The English version of Jun Hyuk\u2019s 1st album came out with just his name \u2018JUN\u2019 on the album jacket.</p><br/><p>One part of why President Stern planned to release in December was because of the effect that having Jun Hyuk\u2019s albums come out in succession could have, but also because it is a big event.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro! It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. I heard you\u2019ve been busy these days working on your album. Are you home now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The welcome voice heard on the phone is New York Philharmonic\u2019s standing conductor, Dimitri Carras.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be going to the studio soon. Do you have anything in particular that you need? Should I go to Lincoln Center?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I would have gone to your apartment if something was up. I called to let you know of something in advance. Don\u2019t be surprised when you leave your house today. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you go out. Then let\u2019s both wrap up our busy schedules and meet up soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk left the house with Dimitri Carras\u2019 laughter and talk about their busy schedules running through his mind. He greeted the few fans waiting outside the apartment and got in the car waiting for him.</p><br/><p>As the car went through New York City, he could see placards stuck all over the city. The placards and posters are what Carras had been talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026 Hang on! Stop the car for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Carras\u2019 warning not to be too surprised was of no use. Jun Hyuk stopped the car and examined a placard hanging on a street lamp.</p><br/><p>The date of the concert is December 23rd, and it clearly says that it will be performed in the work\u2019s entirety. There was even a fine print at the bottom of the placard that said \u2018Orchestra members will not be utilizing expedients such as headphones or earphones.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk got back into the car and laughed, and the driver spoke as he looked at Jun Hyuk through the back mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey started popping up on the streets starting last night. The New York Philharmonic\u2019s concert will be a performance of your song, right Maestro?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a performance that I failed as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really as the rumors say? There\u2019s nonsense that the music causes pain\u2026 Oh. Sorry, Maestro.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver cleared his throat and hastily took a look at Jun Hyuk, but Jun Hyuk shook his head and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m starting to hear nonsense as well. It could just be noise for all we know. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk thought of a good holiday gift to give the driver in his 40s.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I give you tickets, will you go with your wife to see if it\u2019s true or nonsense?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that for real? Thank you, Maestro. Actually, I also bought the CD and listened to it out of curiosity\u2026 but it was just full of weird sounds. I was wondering what the difference would be in the actual performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk saw him smiling brightly from the surprise gift, and took out his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. Did you know about the New York Philharmonic\u2019s Inferno performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. What do you think? Isn\u2019t it impressive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Over the phone, Isaac\u2019s voice was delighted as though there was nothing better. Following the the New York Philharmonic\u2019s official announcement this morning, the press\u2019 calls went to Stern Corporation instead of the New York Philharmonic.</p><br/><p>Even though it had been announced that the conductor will be Dimitri Carras, they asked about whether Jun Hyuk would be conducting and for comments. There were even reporters who asked about the backstory of Jun Hyuk\u2019s role as the original composer.</p><br/><p>Each time, they were able to promote Jun Hyuk\u2019s album, saying that he would be focusing solely on that album for release on the 23rd. It seemed that the New York Philharmonic\u2019s concert and Jun Hyuk\u2019s new album would fill the news.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac, did you see rehearsals? Did they really complete the whole song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to enter either. No one is watching rehearsals. But there\u2019s no way the New York Philharmonic would be releasing false advertising.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Carras is really impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m skeptical. I heard that the interpretation is unconventional. It\u2019ll likely be very different from your Inferno album.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk liked it more that the New York Philharmonic\u2019s music may not come out the way he intended for it to be. The attention of a great maestro is an honor in itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it, however they perform it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, the New York Philharmonic\u2019s concert is providing amazing promotion for our album. Watch the news tonight. I\u2019m pretty sure there will be more talk on the new album. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He wrote out notes while reading a book in the library. The only change was that he spent more time in front of a piano.</p><br/><p>After about a week since he got back from Japan, he got a call from the front desk saying that he has a guest. He thought about who would come looking for him and rushed to the cafeteria on the 1st floor.</p><br/><p>There was an Asian woman in her 30s sitting alone in a cafeteria empty because of the break.</p><br/><p>\u201cJang Jun Hyuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Natural Korean. Jun Hyuk could guess who it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Are you by chance a lawyer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s right. My name is Lim So Mi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk shook the hand she held out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re the person Teacher Jo Hyung Joong spoke about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her business card said Katherine Lim.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have my cellphone number? You could have just called me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted to come. I would get to see the famous Clayton as well. I also heard that you were always studying at school. I wanted to check.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Are you watching me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot watching, but checking.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had expected her to be warm from what he heard in Japan, but she has a dry tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I smoke here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a non-smoking area. There\u2019s a separate room for smoking, but do you want to go there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s just go out. I saw a nice cafe out front. Smoking rooms are uncomfortable for no reason. It\u2019s not a crime to smoke or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as they sat down in the cafe, the lawyer lit a cigarette. She took a delicious puff and her cold expression seemed to relax a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll formally introduce myself. I\u2019m a second generation immigrant and I\u2019m 36 years old. I\u2019m divorced with one daughter. It\u2019s not Harvard law, but I graduated from Columbia law which is also pretty well known. I\u2019m living in the suburbs of New Jersey and I make enough money to live comfortably.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me\u2026 I didn\u2019t ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was confused as to why she was suddenly revealing her personal information.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill. I know a lot about you, but you don\u2019t know anything about me. I\u2019m telling you in advance that\u2019s unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>She talks about fairness of minor things like this. Jun Hyuk started to like this cold lawyer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a good impression of Korean study abroad students. I\u2019ve seen a lot of immature kids who are just rich and don\u2019t study, getting into all kinds of trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I looked into you. You\u2019re impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lim So Mi put out her cigarette and quenched her thirst with coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just have to keep two things in mind if you want to work with me. Don\u2019t get into unnecessary trouble and call me. Drunk driving, drugs, girls. I don\u2019t take care of those kinds of things. And if you left something to me, trust me. Whatever the result is.\u201d</p><br/><p>She seemed to resemble Baek Seung Ho. Is it her confidence?</p><br/><p>\u201cI was told that I can talk to Lawyer Baek Seung Ho in Korea about anything related to money. Is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I can talk to him about contract results?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.There\u2019s no reason to tell me as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not want to have to report everything to a young kid.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I have something to tell you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything other than write songs for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess that means you want me to look over the contract articles carefully?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lim So Mi smiled slightly and took out a document from her bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well. This is a contract saying that you\u2019re electing me as your agent. You can sign here. Also, you can be assured with this since Lawyer Baek already looked over this contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk signed the contract, she put it back in her bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the first thing I have to do is to go to LA?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Leave it to me. Then shall we get up now?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk stood up, Lim So Mi gave him a paper bag that was sitting next to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd take this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you like tonkatsu. I made some. There\u2019s sauce inside as well, so get some instant rice from the Korean supermarket and eat it together. Just microwave it. Do you have one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We have one in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Then I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m back from LA.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Jun Hyuk watched Lim So Mi while she stood the collar of her coat and left, he thought that she was similar in some ways to Yoon Kwang Hun. Her cool tone, and even in her pretending to be indifferent. She seemed to be someone with a warm heart.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Two days after he signed the contract with Lim So Mi, Jun Hyuk received a call from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Jun Hyuk? I\u2019m Lawyer Lim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe contract with LA Sound is complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you turned out to be a much more impressive person than I had thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou made a large label like LA Sound hang on and ask for favors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lim So Mi\u2019s voice sounded a little pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the record contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. They made a fuss asking to make just three more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what did you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else would I do? I made it clear that there wouldn\u2019t be anymore. I got to act a bit pompous thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes .Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you in New York.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hung up the phone and ate the last piece of tonkatsu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whew \u2013 I barely ate all of that. This woman\u2019s cooking is the worst.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>As the weather warmed, the students who went to their hometowns started coming back one by one. Jun Hyuk\u2019s roommate, Danny, opened the door to the dorm and came in and showed how happy he was to see Jun Hyuk with an exaggerated voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun! My maestro! I\u2019m back. Did you miss me? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny pulled out his violin before he even put his luggage away.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to this. This is the fruit of my efforts during the break.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Danny played the violin, Jun Hyuk thought about how he would tell him the news.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t it pretty good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny. Sit down for a second. I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Why are you so serious? Was it bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It was really great. It\u2019ll be perfect if you\u2019re just careful with three parts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? There are three?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny thought back to his performance to figure out what three parts Jun Hyuk was referring to, but Jun Hyuk\u2019s words made his mind go blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny, we have to dissolve our quintet now. You need to make a different team. I think it\u2019ll be better for you to play in a string quartet from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny kept thinking about the word dissolve, and could not hear anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, Coline can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cColine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s better to hear the details from Coline himself. And\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fall out too. I\u2019m going to focus on the piano from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maintaining a quintet when two people out of five dropped out is impossible. Jun Hyuk saying that he was going to focus on the piano rang like thunder in Danny\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. Are you preparing for the competition? Since there are 4 years left until the Chopin Competition, the Long Thibaud next year? No. The Chaikovsky Competition this June?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not interested in competitions. I just want to think about piano a little more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk needed to tell Danny who was lost in shock, one more thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly\u2026 I\u2019m leaving the dorms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving the dorms? You\u2026 Are you living with Amelia?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shock on Danny\u2019s face was incomparable to what he had shown until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Amelia and I decided to do that. We already have a condo leased.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last thing shocked Danny the most. He could not speak for a long time.</p><br/><p>The first thing Danny said to break the silence was so unexpected that even Jun Hyuk was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I go visit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a quintet that cannot be maintained because of Coline, not just Jun Hyuk. And Danny had wanted Jun Hyuk to choose to focus on the piano.</p><br/><p>Moving out of the dorms is a choice that anyone would make if their relationship with a girlfriend gets deeper. It is not something to be opposed to just because he is upset about it. Danny knew well that if he had a girlfriend, he would look into houses to live in together right away.</p><br/><p>A friend should congratulate and be happy for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Come over whenever you want. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny came back to his cheerful state and started talking to Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you need to take some lessons from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLessons? What lessons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things you can\u2019t ever do and what you have to be careful with while living with your girlfriend. Things that naive guys like you would never know. Listen carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny\u2019s long lecture began.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst is the toilet lid\u2026..\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

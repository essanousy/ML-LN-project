I\u2019ll be in vegas this weekend so I am preuploading weekend chapters. Enjoy binging!]</p><br/><p>He now needs to decide what he will do with this opportunity, but no one could speak easily because everyone had their own thoughts on the matter. Jun Hyuk examined the three men\u2019s expressions and broke the heavy silence,</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure since it\u2019s your issue. Say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took the contract from the table and ripped it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis way, there\u2019s nothing to think about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked shocked at Jun Hyuk\u2019s unexpected behavior. The contract ripped to pieces looked to them like a check for $1 million and it looked like the mark of a world star. It had become a piece of paper that clearly showed Jun Hyuk\u2019s position on the issue.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun came out of shock first and spoke as he laughed,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I guess that makes it simple. Alright\u2026 Our food is getting cold. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun knew that he did not have to worry about Jun Hyuk anymore. He is still a bit immature, but he has plenty of volition in deciding his own future.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. There\u2019s still something we need to take care of. The music you played with that old black man. And the 10 songs that Jun Hyuk said he made. What are you going to do about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho brought up the issues that had not yet been resolved yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means that you need an agent or representative\u2026 And you never know. In my opinion, I think things like this are going to keep happening. Whether Jun Hyuk wants it or not. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was again not something that Jun Hyuk had planned. He had just started by trying to help a friend, but it had become a bigger issue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if you look at Jun Hyuk, he pretends to be cool but he\u2019s actually really weak when it comes to friends. He can\u2019t reject when someone he\u2019s a little close to comes with a favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk felt guilty while eating and started coughing, and Yoon Kwang Hun took Jun Hyuk\u2019s side,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Everyone\u2019s like that. We\u2019re all just taking care of each other and helping each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said it\u2019s a bad thing? I\u2019m saying you need to take action in advance so Jun Hyuk doesn\u2019t have to worry about stuff like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTruthfully, there are a lot of great agencies on this side of the industry as well. Companies like Boras Corporation of American major league Scott Boras.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong quietly jumped in while Yoon Kwang Hun and Baek Seung Ho were arguing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a famous producer like LA Sound\u2019s Alex Zakin says one word about Jun Hyuk to the industry people, everyone\u2019s going to come to Jun Hyuk with a contract. But\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong took a slight look at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s face. He wanted to see if they were thinking the same thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kind of company won\u2019t be satisfied with letting Jun Hyuk do what he wants like a hobby. They\u2019ll somehow get him to dedicate all of his time to releasing albums or touring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that they\u2019ll put forth unreasonable conditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Since those people are smart professionals, they\u2019ll know that callous tactics like that won\u2019t work. They\u2019ll probably bait Jun Hyuk with something he likes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBait?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong thew what he thought was bait at Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. What would you do if I said that you could release an album with musicians like John Mayer, Adele, Metallica, U2, and Stevie Wonder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? That\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Jo Hyung Joong was surprised by how easily Jun Hyuk took the bait.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee? They\u2019ll throw this kind of bait. Like Stanley Clarke. Then he\u2019ll have to quit CH School of Music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that we need someone like Jerry Maguire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, exactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Movie Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise. Protagonist Jerry Maguire becomes angry that stars at a large agency are only seen to be worth money. He is fired from the company and it is a story about how he forms bonds with the only client who will stay with him, a soccer player, and becomes successful.</p><br/><p>The agent Jun Hyuk needs is this kind of person.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s a person like Jerry Maguire out there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot an agent, but there is a lawyer. You know Baek Jung Hun, the actor, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen he appeared in a Hollywood film, he had a Korean lawyer who took care of him like he was his manager. He apparently took care of Baek Jung Hun like family during the filming. He brought homemade kimchi for him and even had black goat airlifted for him to take care of his health. I heard that he\u2019s good very good at his job as well of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun realized the attraction of the lawyer Jo Hyung Joong spoke of,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying he did it case by case instead of having an exclusive contract with an agent\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Baek Seung Hun only selected him as his representative for that movie. He does live in New York as well\u2026 Should I try contacting him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d go to those lengths for us, we\u2019d be grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Jun Hyuk is special to me as well. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk and Yoon Kwang Hun returned to their room, they sat together leaning against the twin beds.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir. How is the cafe doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can breathe a bit these days. It was like death until the fall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun shook his head, not even wanting to think about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I guess business is doing well now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. The opposite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil the fall, there were a lot of people who came because they\u2019re your fans, but they don\u2019t come anymore. It\u2019s much more comfortable now that I only have to deal with the regulars who come to really enjoy music at a music cafe. You\u2019ve already been forgotten in Korea. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s joke. He only needs for the people who are important to him to remember him. Yono Kwang Hun saw Jun Hyuk smile and said what he had not been able to at dinner,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that but why did you tear the contract? It could be a good opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of what Teacher Jo Hyung Joong said. If I really did get the opportunity to collaborate with stars like that, I had a feeling that I would quit school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk spoke with indifference as though he did not regret it in the least.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you like school? No. It\u2019s because of Amelia, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s still a lot I need to do at school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a lot to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes. I came to realize a lot of things while writing a piano concerto for Amelia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what my piano is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun put down the can of beer that he was about to drink. Jun Hyuk was talking about his piano, something he had never revealed or been the first to bring up. Yoon Kwang Hun knew what this meant.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

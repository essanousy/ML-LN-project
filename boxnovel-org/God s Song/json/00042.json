Amateurs tended to think that music was sacred. Usually, the answers to a question like this was that it was their dream, life, or challenge. That was after much contemplation as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThought? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople have all kinds of thoughts all day without a second to spare. It\u2019s because I have music instead of those thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s constantly music in your head?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s music and sometimes they\u2019re sounds since sounds are also music. No\u2026 is music sounds? It\u2019s confusing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su thought that fireworks had gone off in his head. Could he have been born with the God-given talent that is said to be lucky to appear once a century?</p><br/><p>There is a saying in art and sports: There\u2019s only one way a person who tries hard can beat a person born with talent. He can win if the person born with talent quits.</p><br/><p>The first people who recognize a gift are parents. Even today, there are countless children who are led to the doors of famous musicians or artists by their parents. They all say the same words,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have no doubt that our child is a genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the reply is also always the same,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, he has some talent but he is not a genius. He\u2019s simply a little more advanced than the average child. That difference is very insignificant as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The parents leaving all say,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t even recognize a genius!\u201d</p><br/><p>The former world record for the 100m race for 23 years was 0.16 seconds. But the monster Usain Bolt shortened it to 0.14 seconds in a year while beating his own record.</p><br/><p>Usain Bolt\u2019s spine is curved due to a congenital disease scoliosis.</p><br/><p>As such, there are also people who are born with a talent that others cannot attain with hard work. There is an innate ranking in gifts one is born with.</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su was curious about the ranking of Jun Hyuk\u2019s talent when he said that he constantly heard music,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you want to become a star through your music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey said that I don\u2019t need to make an effort to be a star. They said that I would become a star no matter what because I was born a genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour boss? Oh, the owner of the cafe you work at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Could it be that a cafe owner who does not know anything is mistaken in believing that Jun Hyuk\u2019s insignificant talent was something incredible? Was this case like with other parents who were under the illusion that their children were geniuses? Is this why Jun Hyuk had such an arrogant personality?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does your boss think that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never forget a song I hear once and he said that every sound in the world becomes music in my head. All I have to do is get out the music that\u2019s in my head. What did he say that was\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolute pitch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Absolute pitch. He said that only a few people are born with this talent and of them, I\u2019m top quality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemembering music after hearing it once could just mean that you have a really good memory. And getting the music in your head out doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re a genius. That music has to be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Writing the entire music scores of all instruments in an hour long symphony was impossible with a good memory. This is what the cafe owner said, but music expert Yoon Jung Su was saying something different. Jun Hyuk tilted his head slightly.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk tried to speak, but was cut off when Yoon Jung Su continued to talk,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve only shown us your arrangements until now. You\u2019ve never made your own music. Of course the arranging skills you\u2019ve shown us are outstanding. However, in music you need to have a fundamental creative base. I want to see if you\u2019ve got creative potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes sparkled,</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to do my music as well, but they keep saying stuff about mission songs and won\u2019t let me do my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Ha ha ha. There is that. Hey, Producer Kim! This is your fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su yelled to Producer Kim Ki Sik who was filming the interview from a distance. The fast-thinking VJ filmed this scene including Producer Kim Ki Sik who was laughing in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you have an original song prepared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a lot. I can make a few in a day if I put my mind to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A few songs in one day? Hah.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who created the most songs in the shortest time were children. They made music while constantly humming, but none of the songs were fit to be used.</p><br/><p>Teenagers wrote songs by scratching out the guitar chords they are used to hearing. They may not know it themselves, but it was plagiarism. With songs like this, it was possible to make dozens in a day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we hear it? What do you think? How about the song you like most out of all the songs you\u2019ve made so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk thought for a bit and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe song I like most is difficult to play right now. It\u2019s a symphony so I need an orchestra.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat symphony?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Oh\u2026 right. There\u2019s something I made not too long ago. During the 2nd mission with Nam Seung Hee, I made a song that would be perfect for her tone. I\u2019ll play that for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su was taken aback by the two words, symphony and orchestra, that Jun Hyuk had just said. What did he mean, symphony?</p><br/><p>The only famous Korean composer was Yoon Yi Sang. From Kyeongnam, Tongyong, he performed in Germany and was proudly chosen to be in New York Metropolitan Museum\u2019s 20 contemporary musicians.</p><br/><p>No other composer came to mind. Of course there was a decrease in the number of people composing symphonies these days, but this was an issue of basic skills.</p><br/><p>How could a teenager he had thought of as immature talk about symphonies?</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su wanted to hang on to Jun Hyuk and ask him, but he was already sitting at a piano,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll start now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled brightly as he started playing the piano. That smile did not disappear until the music ended.</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su pictured a Pocari Sweat commercial from Jun Hyuk\u2019s song. Warm sunlight, a beautiful blue sea. Greece\u2019s Santorini with walls as white as a swan.</p><br/><p>The piano melody was smooth, beautiful, and clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Teacher? Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, it\u2019s good. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was nothing else to say. It was good. Really good. It could be played for at least 20 years.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you made this two days ago? During the 2nd mission?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Nam Seung Hee sang the Finkl song as a jazz song then. But it seemed like ballads are perfect for that girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you just made a ballad song on the spot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about the lyrics? What is it about? Did you write them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t write lyrics.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t written them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying I can\u2019t write lyrics. It hasn\u2019t been long since I learned hangul\u2026 and I\u2019m not very good at expressing emotions with words.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not believe that it had not been long since Jun Hyuk learned hangul, but he remembered Jun Hyuk\u2019s past and shut his mouth. Expressing emotions. Expression itself is spoken or in writing. Expressing with speech and writing is literature.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had learned too little to express himself in words. When Yoon Jung Su did not speak, Jun Hyuk said something unexpected,</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you perhaps write the lyrics?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you write songs well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You made the song. You have to write the lyrics according to your emotions. Isn\u2019t it weird if I write them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 I took my emotions and made the song, so couldn\u2019t you write the lyrics according to the emotions you felt by listening to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s potential had already been confirmed after hearing the song he made for Nam Seung Hee. There was also a reason why he did not sing and was persistent on playing instrumentals. His intention was to give everyone listening to his music the freedom to feel and interpret it.</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su realized that Jun Hyuk had the capacity to become an impressive musician instead of being just another singer.</p><br/><p>Kim Ki Sik who had been filming this entire interview smiled widely as he thought that he had killed two birds with one stone. A song created for one girl. Yoon Jung Su confirmed Jun Hyuk\u2019s musicality with this song and the camera had filmed his feelings for Nam Seung Hee.</p><br/><p>All that was left was what viewers called the devil\u2019s edit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

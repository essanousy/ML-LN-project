His first album. He said it was released in Korea. I guess he made it right before he came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComposition, guitar, piano\u2026.. That\u2019s fucking great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline was impressed by Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar and started motioning his fingers in the air as if playing one.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun\u2019s guitar is really\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKiller, right? And what about the configuration of the tracks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny suddenly remembered something and turned on his laptop.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look at this too. I\u2019m pretty sure you haven\u2019t seen it yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny showed him Jun Hyuk\u2019s versions of Canon that were up on YouTube. Coline\u2019s jaw dropped at the image of Jun Hyuk playing the drums as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really a monster. Not just the piano and composition, but the guitar and drums too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore than that, take a close look at that guitar. You know what that is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHang on. That\u2026 Isn\u2019t that a custom PRS (Paul Reed Smith) and a James Tyler Buring Water?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. It\u2019s under Jun Hyuk\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Danny spoke, Coline ducked under Jun Hyuk\u2019s bed and pulled out the guitar case. However, it was locked with a passcode and he was unable to see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny, was Jun Hyuk rich in Korea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I think he went out on some pop music program in Korea. He said he made a lot of money when the songs he arranged became really popular. And I think I heard something about him modeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew \u2013 So he was a star in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why he even released an album.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline\u2019s eyes sparked as he spoke to Danny,</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny, do you know what time Jun Hyuk\u2019s classes end today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c9 o\u2019clock? Or around 9:30? He\u2019ll be coming back soon. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. I just need to ask him something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline wanted to confess a secret he had been keeping to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>After a never ending 4 hour class on the history of African American human rights, Jun Hyuk came back to the dorms exhausted. It was a frustrating lecture that he had not been able to understand half of because the professor spoke more than he normally did.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had been expecting to lay down in his bed comfortably, but Coline who had been waiting for him took him by the hand and dragged him out to a bar in front of the school.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to talk about, but hurry up. I\u2019m really tired today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll get straight to the point. Do you want to join our band? Let\u2019s do it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Band?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I made a band with 2 friends. It\u2019s been almost a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFriends? At our school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. They only know the names Beethoven and Mozart in terms of classical. But they\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>There are a lot of people who are difficult to understand in the world. Is it not the CH School of Music where everyone wants to go but cannot?</p><br/><p>Not only was he dreaming of doing other music after getting over such a difficult obstacle, but he had even created a band to do something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about classical? Wasn\u2019t it your dream to become a cellist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClassical? What\u2019s so great about music that\u2019s hashed up and replayed over and over again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline took a swig of his beer and spoke mockingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHashed? Replayed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think so? Beethoven\u2019s symphony \u2018Fate\u2019 alone has been recorded in 700 albums. No matter how much of an oldie it is, it\u2019s just one song. It\u2019s one song with different conductors. No, I\u2019m pretty sure Karajan of the Berlin Philharmonic did it around 20 times. It has to be more because he released the box set of Beethoven\u2019s complete works 5 times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Herbert von Karajan who especially loved Beethoven. He sold 200 million records while he served on the Berlin Philharmonic. Though there was a lot of talk about how he just performed songs that the public was used to and about it all being showmanship, it was true that he led the popularization of classical music.</p><br/><p>\u201cPast baroque, classical, and romantic, do you think classical would have developed? The so-called contemporary music is saying that it is following behind classical, but even that is barely staying alive with Stravinsky, Bartok Schoenberg, and Rigeti.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline\u2019s honest thoughts on classical music exploded and flowed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you release something as contemporary music now, the premiere is the last performance. It\u2019s only performed once. And for a rookie, that\u2019s only if it\u2019s good enough to get 1st place at the Belgium\u2019s Queen Elisabeth Competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Classical is already falling in its own league because it is worshipping its existing works while keep new trials at a distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you understand this screwed up situation? Either rehash relics or make music that no one will listen to even if the critics praise it. These are the only 2 paths in classical.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether it was due to his drunkenness or discontent and dissatisfaction concerning classical, Coline\u2019s voice grew louder and louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cComposers were revered a long time ago, but not anymore. No one will listen even if you make contemporary music. If you want fame and wealth\u2026. Composition? You have to give it up and become a performer. Conductor? That\u2019s also okay since a conductor of an orchestra is a performer.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was advice with the fact that Jun Hyuk\u2019s majors are composition and command in mind. In Coline\u2019s thoughts however, Jun Hyuk still has a naive view.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen instead of making abstruse contemporary music, you can make songs that are like the old classical.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha ha. You\u2019re really impressive. You\u2019re saying we should go back to the past? Do you have the confidence to do that? Fine. Then let\u2019s say you wrote a song. You know who your competition is? You have to compete with people like Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, and Wagner. No. You\u2019ll only be recognized if you write songs that are better than theirs. Or they\u2019ll say you\u2019re just a monkey copying them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not think that everything Coline was saying was gibberish. However, he thought that Coline would also know that good music comes to light and is loved by the public. It is just that right now, they are taking down the negative aspects of classical music.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you made a rock and roll band?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with that? It\u2019s popular music. Classical was popular music of its time. Mozart\u2019s Don Giovanni had a lot of success in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. It was the song that the citizens enjoyed in the theater. To compare it with something now, it would be like a box-office success musical or a U2 concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems Coline wants the masses to cheer for his music. But as a cellist, he would not be able to get past the restrictions of classical fanciers. This kind of thought could be the reason why they created the band. It is the greatest difference between them and Jun Hyuk, who only thinks about music.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, just think about it. If Mozart came to the present on a time machine, do you think he would do rock or jazz? Or do you think he would do classical?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m 100% sure. There are a lot of people who like Mozart, like to have fun, enjoy grand things, crave success, and desire people\u2019s cheering. I\u2019m sure Mozart would have put a rock band together and toured the world. Money, fame, women, popularity, alcohol, drugs. These are all trademarks of rockers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk even thought that Coline\u2019s plausible speculations were fun. Mozart as the leader of a rock band\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cMozart died at 36, but he would have died at 26 in the present. Of overdosing on drugs. Ha ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline broke out in laughter and asked Jun Hyuk again,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Jun, I heard the music you made in Korea. You like rock and roll too, and you like jazz and the blues. Let\u2019s do the band together. I won\u2019t ask you to miss classes or quintet practices, so let\u2019s do it together when you have time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s blood also boiled. He wanted to do it. He wanted to play a deafening guitar capable of exploding an amp and he wanted to play the drums so hard the ceiling came down.</p><br/><p>However, classical is what really made his blood boil. The exhilarating bliss. He does not have to choose between the two, but now is the time to focus. He does not want to make the 4 years he had decided on with such difficulty to go to waste by doing something useless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. You know too that I get special classes for 2 hours every day. I don\u2019t have time.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

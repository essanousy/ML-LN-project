And the kid who was hit is huffing about calling the police.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you get Jun Hyuk to stay? That kid doesn\u2019t listen to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe young writer who marked Jun Hyuk did it. They\u2019ve gotten pretty friendly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBring the kid who got hit here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The participant who had gotten hit by Jun Hyuk started his interview with Producer Kim Ki Sik while massaging his face with ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo what you want,\u201d</p><br/><p>He understood what Producer Kim\u2019s frosty tone meant. He was giving him pressure. It meant that he needed to pack his bags and leave the condo if he did not keep his mouth shut.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not a kid or anything\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then the company\u2019s legal team is going to go to you with a piece of paper. Sign it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What paper\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what paper? It\u2019s a document saying you won\u2019t make a problem out of today\u2019s events. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go. Also, I\u2019ll change your team instead. Just know that we\u2019ll be doing that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The participants of \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019 were all expendable to the absolute target of raising viewer ratings. Once expendable, they needed to listen to the producer in order to stay in the program at all costs.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The expendable person who had been switched into Jun Hyuk\u2019s team was someone whose skill was to the degree that he had heard he sang well at his neighborhood karaoke.</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik who was in charge of the show started his plan to get Jun Hyuk in the top 10.</p><br/><p>Two VJs tight with tension stood in front of Producer Kim Ki Sik and were listening to his orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well. You just keep concentrating on Jun Hyuk and film him. And you\u2026 you\u2019ve been here longer than he has, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay then. Jun Hyuk doesn\u2019t sing, right? Instead, you have to make him the conductor for the 5-person team mission. He has to be the maestro who does everything from arranging to directing parts for the members. You understand what I\u2019m saying, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I get what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s Jun Hyuk\u2019s theme for this week\u2019s 5-person team mission. I\u2019m putting it in your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. The two of us will bring back lots of good shots.\u201d</p><br/><p>They finished preparing the materials to make Jun Hyuk a maestro. Now they needed to convince the viewers that Jun Hyuk was qualified to be in the top 10 even without singing.</p><br/><p>The people to persuade the viewers were the judges themselves.</p><br/><p>Before Jun Hyuk\u2019s team performed as the fourth to be on stage, Producer Kim and the main judges started their conference on the issue.</p><br/><p>The main judges of Season 5 were slightly experimental with the addition of two new members.</p><br/><p>Along with Lee Sung Chul and the legendary singer and songwriter Yoon Jung Su, singer of 25 years Lee Eun Jin who had been given the nickname \u2018Diva of the Night Sky\u2019 because she did not make appearances in public or on broadcast joined the panel.</p><br/><p>Last was Son Jin Young from JYS, one of Korea\u2019s top 3 agencies which produced countless girl groups.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim, why are you like this for this season? You\u2019re openly pushing for this kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Excuse me just once. Aren\u2019t I a person who goes back and forth between heaven and hell based on the viewer ratings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? You\u2019re saying that kid will guarantee viewer ratings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSung Chul. Who are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su who had not seen Jun Hyuk during the area preliminaries was asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a kid. A kid who gives me headaches. Oh right, he\u2019s the type you would like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su\u2019s eyes widened as he was flipping through the files containing each person\u2019s history and special characteristics.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? He got all the way here just by playing the guitar and not singing? And\u2026 what? He\u2019s an orphan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Other than not singing, he\u2019s the best. His story\u2019s good, he\u2019s better looking than Kang Dong Won, the guitar performance is great, he\u2019s probably a genius in arranging, and his song analysis is outstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like he\u2019ll get all of the women\u2019s texting votes. He could even get to the top 5 on votes alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they discussed Jun Hyuk, Producer Kim Ki Sik said the final defining words,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid is just a star. He has the talent and looks to cover a song. On top of that, he has an unstoppable nature. You know well since you\u2019re all stars. One of those people who is bound to become news whatever he does.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Eun Jin who had been listening silently had an opposing expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want us to push for him openly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m asking you to find something in him that will cover his inability to sing. If you can\u2019t find anything, I won\u2019t hang on to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>They could protect Lee Eun Jin\u2019s pride as this was her first time on the judges\u2019 panel. What went out on air was the producer\u2019s magic, or editing. She was not such an amateur that she would make a fuss if an edit was made entirely different from her intentions.</p><br/><p>Kim Ki Sik was confident. He was certain that the viewer ratings would go up if he made Jun Hyuk a star.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

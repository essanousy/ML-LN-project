His invitation to Boston was the top story in the culture column, and his articles were all over the internet. Even the BSO homepage had pictures of him, proving that the articles are true. It is best to get out before the reporters come swarming in.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk went to the park that people of Boston love most. Boston Common is America\u2019s first park. It is 60,000 acres, so there is no one who would recognize him in his sweatpants and hoodie.</p><br/><p>He had come to the park to get some exercise because he remembered that Philadelphia\u2019s conductor Bruno Kazel said that conducting is a matter of stamina.</p><br/><p>He repeated running and resting during the morning, ate a sandwich for lunch, and walked around Boston. Other than picking up Tara\u2019s calls every hour to tell her not to worry, he was able to tour the city without interruptions.</p><br/><p>When the sun started setting, he went back to the hotel, carefully looked around the lobby, and found that Tara was still in interviews. She had gone through the busiest day on Jun Hyuk\u2019s behalf.</p><br/><p>While Tara acted instead of Jun Hyuk in the lobby, Jun Hyuk had been able to spend plenty of time thinking about how he would hold the first rehearsal.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk arrived at the concert hall early on the morning of the first rehearsal of Inferno, and had a cup of coffee with Patrick Quinn.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, I don\u2019t know if you know but I\u2019m saying just in case\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe members are creating performer unions for the Boston Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I had no idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patrick Quinn saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s surprised face and remembered the first time he stood on the podium. He wanted to make it so that Jun Hyuk would not have to experience the incredulity that he had felt.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they are employees of the BSO (Boston Symphony Orchestra). They are paid a salary to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon leaving school, everything revolves around \u2018work\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe performers meet with the BSO to go over salaries and conditions every year, but there\u2019s just one thing that you need to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreak times and times you work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Break times?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This isn\u2019t just the case for Boston, but the same anywhere around the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I can understand working ties but what are breaks in rehearsals?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter about 1 hour of practicing, you must give them 10 minutes to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not school. What is this 10 minutes for every hour?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t it like that in Korea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know the circumstances in Korea\u2026 Then does that mean I have to cut off rehearsals in the middle of a song and give them a break? Is that even possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the orchestra members know that much. Normally, you can say that it\u2019s time for a break once whatever you\u2019re practicing is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk heard the word \u2018normally\u2019 loudly. Then that means that there are circumstances that are not normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s quite delicate. When the members are having fun or lost in the passion of the song, they don\u2019t ask to take a break. They don\u2019t realize that time is passing either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see how that would happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut when the conductor says nonsense, the conducting is boring, and the performance isn\u2019t fun, they\u2019ll keep the break times without any other thought. Since they can\u2019t focus on the music and performance, they\u2019ll keep looking at the time. As you said, they\u2019ll cut it off in the middle of a song. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patrick Quinn chuckled as if it were something funny. When Jun Hyuk heard his laughter, he realized why the members take breaks.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. So the reactions of the conductor and members\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. You\u2019ll be able to check by looking at the breaks.\u201d</p><br/><p>With more breaks and more punctual breaks, it means that the members cannot trust the conductor or that there are differences in musical views that cannot be resolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Quinn. Then\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Jun, I told you to call me Patrick. If not, I\u2019m going to make sure to call you Maestro Jun too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patrick Quinn glared at Jun Hyuk and shook his finger at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, haha. Alright. Patrick. Then what were the breaks for members like in Vienna? Did they take their breaks on time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re asking such a straight question? That\u2019s scary. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>There is bitterness in his laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were more breaks as time went by. They never missed a break since we started Inferno. They even made sure to leave work exactly on time. They had sent a signal that they cannot do it while I kept pushing it on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the one hand, it is understandable. The Vienna Philharmonic\u2019s roots are as an orchestra of Vienna\u2019s court opera theater. Its unique color is that it focuses on tradition and is against modern music.</p><br/><p>Their focus on things of the past is not stubbornness. Their thinking is that the Vienna Philharmonic is not the one that needs to be performing contemporary music. Their sense of duty to enrich the classics is more important to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go to the theater. I\u2019m going to see how many times they rest during your rehearsal. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the orchestra members were waiting for Jun Hyuk in comfortable clothing. Their looks did not show any tension and were just full of curiosity.</p><br/><p>Patrick Quinn had repeatedly said that he is a genius, but the only exposed fact is that he is the composer of Inferno. Other than that, his claims to fame are not in classical but in jazz and rock. There are a lot of geniuses who leave 1 good song and disappear.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took in all of this attention and went up to the podium. He left the baton on the music stand and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I cannot understand why this song causes pain. It is not music that I created in order to bring pain to anyone. My intentions for writing it\u2026 Well. I think I just made it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk could not get himself to say that he had written the specific melody about his painful childhood.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing, though I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be helpful in performing. You do not get used to pain. Even if you feel the same pain repeatedly, the power of that pain remains the same. It hurts. But there is something good in its repetition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone listened to Jun Hyuk\u2019s words about his story rather than the music.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat you know when it ends. That becomes the strength to withstand the pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. We have never thought that we\u2019d be able to play this song just by enduring the pain. Isn\u2019t there no point in playing it when we can\u2019t express it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Matthew Price is a performer before he is the concertmaster. The success of the performance and the record are important, but he is more focused on the desire to express music.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. But don\u2019t you think we need to do at least that much? I ran a bit in the Commons yesterday. I didn\u2019t run to run well. It was in accordance with Maestro Kazel\u2019s warning that I need to have the stamina to back up my conducting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hit his thighs with both of his hands and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnduring is also a basic fitness to playing Inferno perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the members did not stop looking at him in distrust.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it had been possible to play the song automatically by building the basic fitness, we would not have suffered so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the members yelled and with that sound, everyone started buzzing.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put his hand up, calmed the members down, and continued his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. There\u2019s no way that it\u2019ll be enough. As I told you, the basic fitness is just the first step.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the second step?\u201d</p><br/><p>Concertmaster Matthew Price did not pay attention to the members\u2019 buzzing, and looked only at Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second step is pretty easy. But as you said concertmaster, there is still the problem of expression.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to tell us in detail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ll play mechanically. Playing the notes exactly as they\u2019re on the score like a machine \u2013 that\u2019s the second step.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell well. We always play exactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matthew Price seemed a bit disappointed upon hearing that the second step he had been anticipating was something that went without saying. They are the Boston Philharmonic, a famous orchestra in the U.S. They are confident that they play all songs with more exactness than machines do.</p><br/><p>But Jun Hyuk shook his head and spoke clearly,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. What do you mean the Boston Symphony plays like machines? That\u2019s nonsense. You are playing like people. With abundant emotions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means we follow the movement of the baton exactly in order to bring out that emotion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matthew Price who had seemed patient, frowned. They had not gathered here to hear about meaningless basics. Isn\u2019t exact conducting the basic of basics?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew \u2013 How do I explain this\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had an uncomfortable expression on his face. He needs to show them the precise difference between an \u2018exact performance\u2019 and a \u2018mechanical performance\u2019 with his body.</p><br/><p>From the seats below the stage, Patrick Quinn and Chairman Mark Boff watched their conversation with interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. Do you understand what that young conductor is saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He said that the second step is easy, but it is actually the more difficult method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more difficult?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s not easy for people to play a song while taking out emotions completely. And isn\u2019t it music? Music makes emotions fluctuate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patrick burst out in laughter while looking at Mark Boff who was still lost in puzzlement.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

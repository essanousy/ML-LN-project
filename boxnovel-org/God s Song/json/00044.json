The XOR officials were edgy while Yoon Kwang Hun read through the contract meticulously.</p><br/><p>The broadcast had warned them that the cafe owner was very precise. They still had not thought that he would read through all six pages of the contract.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun began to speak once he was done reading the contract,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe main point is this? If he has a scandal during the year after \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019 starts, we need to compensate the damages. Is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 yes. That is content that is typically included.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, sir. I guess you haven\u2019t heard the rumors yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun put the contract down and coughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk punched another kid during Star Week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, we know about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a kid plenty capable of cursing at the judges. Live broadcast? He doesn\u2019t know what that means because he doesn\u2019t care about the cameras once he goes into his music. But live like the ideal child for one year? This is asking us not to sign on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, sir. You\u2019re being too much. Surely he won\u2019t cause any accidents on live broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. What I\u2019m most worried about is that he\u2019ll say \u2018You don\u2019t know shit and you\u2019re being annoying!\u2019 if the judges say something he doesn\u2019t agree with.\u201d</p><br/><p>The XOR Manager\u2019s face brightened,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re grateful if he causes scandals like that. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe concept of this season\u2019s jean is the rebel. We chose Jun Hyuk based on that concept. He doesn\u2019t fear the judges and says what he wants? This overlaps with a teenager rebelling against a teacher or adult. Kids like it. The terms you pointed out are in reference to issues like drinking and assaulting someone, drugs, girls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 a 17 year old and alcohol, drugs, girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun had not even thought of such absurd situations. Did people in the entertainment industry act like adults no matter what age they were on they gained fame?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Jun Hyuk becomes famous once the program ends, he\u2019ll be called to different places, go to parties for his album release\u2026 there will be accidents. Especially with Jun Hyuk, girls will be all over him. He\u2019s at an age where he won\u2019t be able to say no. That\u2019s why kids have management companies. The companies resolve all of these types of accidents. The reason why people like the larger companies is that they stop the articles no matter how big a scandal is. The reporters are scared of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>They just had to stay quiet until \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019 was over. Jun Hyuk was staying in a boarding house until the end of the program anyway. Whatever the XOR official was worried about would not be a problem.</p><br/><p>Once the program was over, Jun Hyuk needed to focus on studying abroad and not on become a celebrity as everyone else was assuming.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk could not bear being ordered around. The life of a celebrity was hard. He had to do what he was told until he became a recognized star.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s write out what the \u2018unsavory acts\u2019 are specifically. The drugs, assault, girls, et cetera you spoke of. Doesn\u2019t a contract need to be specific?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds good. We\u2019ll change that part. Do you have any other suggestions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFour poster shoots and two promotional video shoots. This video is for the TV?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s internet advertising. Of course if Jun Hyuk has enough star power, they could go on TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s agree to that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you satisfied with the guarantee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI realize that $20,000 for a total rookie is a very generous condition. Isn\u2019t it normally $5,000?\u201d</p><br/><p>The XOR Manager\u2019s face brightened. When they were first drafting the contract, they were grappling with $5,000 and were allowed to go a little higher, but the marketing director cut everyone off bluntly. She said that he was a model worth the expense. She also said that he might turn against XOR indefinitely if they went too hard from the beginning. The XOR marketing director had a conviction about Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>The XOR Manager did not lose his chance when Yoon Kwang Hun showed satisfaction at the guarantee,</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for recognizing this. It really is a generous condition. Our Director really has an eye for people. Jun Hyuk will become a star. Our Director is sure of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The XOR Manager left the cafe saying that he would bring back a revised contract.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That night, Yoon Kwang Hun and Jun Hyuk watched the first episode of \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019 together at the cafe. Yoon Kwang Hun watched while drinking a beer, waiting for Jun Hyuk to come out, but all that aired of him was 10 seconds after 1 hour and 20 minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Did you know you weren\u2019t coming out this week?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. They didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk must have been fascinated that he was on TV because he was a little excited. TV has a strange charm. One begins to think that he is special.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun worried about what he had to do if Jun Hyuk became more concerned about becoming a star than he did about his music, but it was already too late. He brought up another topic to ease his ominous thoughts,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the girl whose preview came on in the middle Nam Seung Hee? She\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? Truthfully, she does look prettier on the TV screen. I\u2019m going to try to get her to go out with me while we\u2019re living in the boarding house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? She said she\u2019s interested in you too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to blow her away. I\u2019m going to make her a song. There\u2019s no problem. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo well with her, but you can\u2019t cause any trouble. Oh right, when you go into the boarding house tomorrow, they\u2019ll make you do all sorts of things. They\u2019re going to make you exercise and dance. You saw last season, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. If they bother me too much, I can just quit everything and get out of there. Those people can\u2019t cut me. I overheard them talking about how I\u2019ll be the factor guaranteeing their viewer ratings this season. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was understandable since he was a kid who had survived on watching for other people\u2019s reactions alone. He would be able to figure out that he is necessary just by looking at the faces of the staff members.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t act too much on your impatience and go along with what they say for the most part. Do what you can and if there\u2019s something you really can\u2019t do, don\u2019t throw a tantrum and go tell the producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going out in society now. You were on the boundaries of society when you were living alone, but it\u2019s not like that anymore. Now, you have to fit in to a certain extent. You also have to learn to be patient until you become a person that no one can touch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Am I a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being cocky. Hey, you\u2019re still a kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun felt that his nagging was unusually long and shut his mouth to start cleaning the cafe. Jun Hyuk was like his son, but he did not want to become like other fathers and sons. He wanted to be like an uncle and at times, a close friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to sleep early. You have to go all the way to Sangam-dong tomorrow morning. Are you done packing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey told me that I don\u2019t need to bring anything. They\u2019ll give me all the clothes I need to wear once I get there\u2026 even the underwear and socks. I\u2019ll just take my guitar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll come early in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I can just take the bus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun who came early in the morning to drop Jun Hyuk off in Sangam-dong thought he might know how parents feel when they are sending their children far away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

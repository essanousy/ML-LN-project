This is late, but congratulations. Jun Hyuk is finally being recognized all over the world. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s because of everything you\u2019ve done for us. Oh right, I was going to give you a call anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of Inferno, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it said that the source was unknown. Is there anyone else you showed it to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m still taking care of the original. Jun Hyuk said that he showed it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Jun Hyuk re-wrote it and brought it to me. I scanned it and sent it to a music professor I know. Honestly, it\u2019s just noise when I look at it\u2026 Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is just noise even to Jo Hyung Joong whose job is music. 99% of the people who buy the score will just think of it as noise as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? It was uncomfortable and hard for me to look at as well, but to think that it is recognized by maestros\u2026 I guess there\u2019s something special to it that average people like us can\u2019t see. Then the score that Jun Hyuk re-wrote for you\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have it. Since it\u2019s handwritten by Jun Hyuk, I\u2019m going to keep it as a family heirloom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I guess there\u2019s a high possibility that the leak came from that professor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the music professor I sent it to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did that professor say when he saw Inferno?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat professor must not have been a maestro. He was someone whose standards are not very different from our own. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong thought of when Professor Ju Yong Tae had criticized it as garbage. As older professors have trouble with their e-mails, assistants and graduate students often help them check their accounts. He thought that it may have been a student who saw the score.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to look into it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no, it\u2019s okay. What use is there is finding that out now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I need to say something to that professor as well. I\u2019m dying to hear what he has to say. I also want to take this opportunity to see what he\u2019s really like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong was having fun imagining the reaction of an elder in classical music who brags impressive prestige.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor. How are you? This is Jo Hyung Joong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Teacher Jo. Are you doing well?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could hear Professor Ju Yong Tae\u2019s calm voice over the phone. He smiled slightly when he thought of how surprised the professor would soon be.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I just have something to ask you, professor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see the articles that are making news these days? A song called \u2018Inferno\u2019. The one that a Korean genius wrote?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I know. Isn\u2019t it a song that European maestros are praising highly? I\u2019m also just in waiting for the score to be revealed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs much as it is being praised, there is also negative feedback.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Ju who is supposed to be opposed to innovative contemporary music is anticipating it because European maestros have praised it? He had given his negative opinion in the strongest terms even when he occasionally heard contemporary music on broadcast. Had he always been someone with such little conviction?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the opinion is divided, I\u2019ll have to see the score to know. But it\u2019s definitely a work of art if one side is praising it highly and one side is saying that it\u2019s not. If it\u2019s half and half, it\u2019s only a matter of differences in taste or opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Oh, Professor. I have one more thing to ask\u2026 Do you remember a score I sent you for a symphony written by a rookie about 2 years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I remember. That was the first time I\u2019d seen such an unpleasant song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you still have the email that I sent you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I deleted it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you look at the score on your monitor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I printed it, but what is it? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Ju Yong Tae started to become annoyed. It sounds as if Jo Hyung Joong is accusing him of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing really. Then that printed score\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI threw it out of course. I even deleted the email. Why would I hang on to the printout? But why do you keep asking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Ju Yong Tae finally asked the question. But Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s voice on the phone had become cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would need to wait to see the score for Inferno.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that? What does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor, you were the first person to see the masterpiece called Inferno. The score that you said is garbage and threw out is Inferno.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no sound over the phone. Jo Hyung Joong imagined Professor Ju dropping the phone out of surprise, and hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk bought a used camping car for $10,000 and planned his first journey to go in the Bayern area from Wurzburg to Fuissen, and on Romantische Str.</p><br/><p>This road created from nature, culture, and history originates from \u2018The road to Rome\u2019 connecting Germany and Rome, Italy. The 360km journey was laden with architecture worth thousands of years of history and the rustic atmosphere of rural farmhouses.</p><br/><p>He met Korean tourists in every city who recognized him, forcing him to change his direction into the countryside. They would take pictures of him and post them on social media immediately, bringing more people to the area.</p><br/><p>It turned out to be a better choice to change direction into rural areas that are not well-known. There were barely any tourists and he could only see the people of that area living simply within their own fences.</p><br/><p>There were even places that looked at him as if seeing an Asian person for the first time. When Jun Hyuk stumbled with his German however, they let down their guards and treated him with a friendly manner.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk visited each village that the European maestros told him about in order to learn the folk songs of each area. A camping car is good because he can stay somewhere even if the area does not have accommodation for outsiders.</p><br/><p>Of the people that Jun Hyuk met, he spent the most time with gypsies. These nomadic Aryan Indian people are called the Romany people.</p><br/><p>Most of them have settled, but there are the rare people who still live in place to place. Their freedom and optimism held Jun Hyuk back.</p><br/><p>Bizet\u2019s Carmen is a thing of the past. Gypsies do not make their living off of music, dance, and prostitution, but live off of the subsidies net by the government for minority protection.</p><br/><p>They played a quaint melody for Jun Hyuk that they did not know the origins of, and Jun Hyuk committed that melody to his memory. He then created a new song with that melody as a background and played it for them.</p><br/><p>He felt like living with music in this optimism is another good way of living.</p><br/><p>When he left Germany and found the Route 4 Lucerne line in Swiss Zurich, it was his treasure. The green fields and lake that kept disappearing and reappearing were a superb view that exceeded any tourist attraction.</p><br/><p>He did not even have a place to hurry up and get to. Jun Hyuk stopped the car whenever he wanted to. He spent the nights enjoying the dark, calm nights lit up by the stars reflected on the lake.</p><br/><p>It was people who interfered with this calm from nature. They must have thought that no one was around because Jun Hyuk turned off all the lights in the camping car, so an SUV turned up near him with speakers turned up to the maximum volume.</p><br/><p>As even the sounds of nature grew quiet because of the loud noise, the only sound in the area was that of the music from the car.</p><br/><p>He was angry and annoyed, but he could not get himself to approach them. He was scared that they could be a danger to him.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was lying down in the camping car for about 5 minutes after the SUV arrived when he got up all of a sudden. He put his clothes on and walked toward the car with the music.</p><br/><p>It seemed that there were 4 men in the SUV, preparing to camp out. They already had sleeping bags laid out on the ground and they had brought dry wood to create a fire.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk appeared suddenly, the 4 men picked up the wood that they were going to use for the fire. They were equally scared, but they put the sticks down when they saw that Jun Hyuk was alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, but that music\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sorry. We didn\u2019t realize that we had neighbors. It was too noisy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard Jun Hyuk speaking German with difficulty, one of the men rushed to turn the volume down.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026 That music, is it the radio? A CD?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCD.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I see the CD jacket?\u201d</p><br/><p>The men were taken aback because Jun Hyuk had appeared like a ghost to ask to see the CD.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. Is your German not good? Can you speak English?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone spoke in English, though it was British English which sounded like German to him anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a relief. English is okay. Can we speak in English?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who spoke with an English accent retrieved the CD case from the car and handed it to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It is the day to rehearse choral concerto with Maestro Carras. Jun Hyuk joined as the pianist.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. You haven\u2019t heard us play your song, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yoon sitting all the way over there has heard it several times. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maestro Carras gestured to Yoon Kwang Hun, sitting in the audience. Jun Hyuk saw that Yoon Kwang Hun was waving at him.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk shook his head. Yoon Kwang Hun is basically the audience who gives him the most burden and caution.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, am I alone? Where is Danny?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019ve become easily scared since I\u2019ve gotten older. It takes too much strength to handle 2 young performers at the same time. I\u2019m planning on dealing with each of you separately first. That should be okay, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that a characteristic of maestros? Everyone fakes out their difficulties so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no. I\u2019m not faking. I feel like you alone will be hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Carras waved his hand and Jun Hyuk sat in front of the piano.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. I didn\u2019t call a page turner because I figured you wouldn\u2019t need one. I thought that would just get in your way anyway. That\u2019s okay, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>A \u2018page turner\u2019 is someone who turns the pages of the score, just as it sounds. Pianists do not have a hand to turn the score while performing, and this is where the \u2018page turner\u2019 comes in.</p><br/><p>Horowitz said, \u2018The person turning the pages of a score could ruin an entire performance\u2019. Page turners must be present in complex and difficult performances.</p><br/><p>While the performer is concentrating, if the page turner turns the page too quickly or slowly, the flow could be cut off, ruining the performance. This is why the page turner and pianist\u2019s teamwork is considered so important.</p><br/><p>Pianists often lose count of the beat during live performances because the page turner did not match the timing, so it is inevitable that pianists look for page turners who they work well with.</p><br/><p>When the page turner is turning the page, they cannot block the pianist\u2019s view, must dress modestly so as not to upstage the pianist, and they cannot even wear accessories. Sensitive pianists are even affected by the page turner\u2019s anxious breathing, so page turners need to self-obliterate themselves.</p><br/><p>They always need to go on stage after the performer and stay seated while the performers are applauded after.</p><br/><p>Some call page turners \u2018the cold hand that dominates the performance\u2019 or \u2018the hidden presence on stage, the 2nd performer\u2019.</p><br/><p>Page turners are another important presence on stage that the audience does not understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. You can just enjoy it since it\u2019s your first time and then join in for the 2nd part.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll give a performance that I can\u2019t stay away from to just enjoy it. How could I stay still?\u201d</p><br/><p>The orchestra members tensed up when they heard Jun Hyuk say that he would perform with them.</p><br/><p>The string instruments started with Dimitri Carras\u2019 baton, and Jun Hyuk looked up to look at the conductor.</p><br/><p>He had not guessed that it would be such an aggressive performance!</p><br/><p>Belgium National Orchestra\u2019s Pierre Boulez gave a performance that emphasized elegance. They had received praise for showing a comparison of past and future Beethoven through an old maestro and young Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>Thinking of Dimitri Carras\u2019 experience, Jun Hyuk thought that he would give a similar performance, but it was clearly distinct.</p><br/><p>It was the same as forcing him to choose whether he will challenge such a tight and solid performance, or if he will put his head down and join.</p><br/><p>When the 1st part was over, darkness enwrapped the theater for over 10 seconds. Dimitri Carras took a glance at Jun Hyuk, smiled, and held up the baton again. Jun Hyuk already had his fingers on the piano.</p><br/><p>The members all saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s hands. The piano they had only heard of by rumor. When they heard that Jun Hyuk would be joining as the pianist, most of them were so full of anticipation that they bought Jun Hyuk\u2019s jazz album to listen to.</p><br/><p>The members admired the connected configuration that flows like water and the grand technique that makes dissonance sound like a beautiful melody. This is the moment they get to hear that piano for themselves.</p><br/><p>Maestro Carras\u2019 baton was firm, as though warning them that they need to be fully prepared.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano was not aggressive or fierce, like a warm sunlight that had seeped in from nowhere.</p><br/><p>He did not mind the New York Philharmonic\u2019s rough performance and continued playing with a gentle touch on his own. He made the concerto into a solo song, treating the orchestra\u2019s playing as an accompaniment. He is showing his ability as a pianist, showing strength only when necessary, precise fingering, flexibility in wrists and agility in fingers.</p><br/><p>The most surprised person was not Maestro Carras or anyone in the orchestra. It was Yoon Kwang Hun, sitting nervous in the audience.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano right now is not a copy or reappearance of someone else. It is Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano. But, there was no feeling of anger, resentment, or pain. It is a completely different piano with a gentle peace and mellow touch.</p><br/><p>He could tell as soon as he heard Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano that what he is playing now is not for the choral concerto performance. It is a performance for Yoon Kwang Hun, the only person sitting in the 2,800 seat Avery Fisher Hall.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had made the New York Philharmonic into an accompaniment so that he could show Yoon Kwang Hun that he has matured and escaped from the despair of the past. The New York Philharmonic\u2019s private theater is being used for a one-person audience.</p><br/><p>\u2018That kid always surprises people so dramatically.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun calm his beating heart and got lost in Jun Hyuk\u2019s flowing song.</p><br/><p>But, the conductor Carras and orchestra members could not hide their embarrassment. Dimitri Carras in particular had to make larger movements with his arms in order to steady the shaking orchestra.</p><br/><p>Dimitri Carras conducted until the 3rd part and put the baton down. It would be impossible for him to steady the orchestra and take them through the 4th part.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. Is this the choral concerto you\u2019re thinking of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of them? In detail!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitri Carras raise his voice, but he is not angry or excited. It is strong curiosity of a new image of a composer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe piano I just played was something I thought of while listening to the 1st part. In a bookcase with 1000 books that are organized well, the one book that is in disorder. In a company where all employees are men wearing black suits, one woman who appears wearing a red dress. I thought about what this kind of feeling would be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that you\u2019re playing the role of pianist instead of composer right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have done the same even thinking as the composer. I want to play something new every time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that art is always a new interpretation? Like you said in the interview in Belgium?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty much. I actually wanted to do an arrangement or play a completely different song as soon as I heard the 1st part, but I\u2019ll do that next time at a later opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitri Carras and the orchestra members did not hide their perplexed expressions. It was an interpretation and performance that was so unique it could make the ensemble collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is troubling\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it too unfamiliar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just unfamiliar. Isn\u2019t it? Is my feeling wrong? I felt it in the piano touch that had the faint feeling of an elegant woman\u2019s charm. It would have been much more fitting if it had been like an enchanting woman who is enough to thaw a frozen heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not a flower blooming amidst suits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Maestro Carras just nodded. It is a moment when he should not be pushing it.</p><br/><p>A soloist is another universe in a concerto. The moment that a soloist\u2019s individual performance creates fireworks with the orchestra is one of a concerto\u2019s highlights.</p><br/><p>But, if it is to the point where the ensemble collapses, there begins a dissension between the conductor and soloist. However, concertos are ultimately for the orchestra. In the end, the conductor and soloist are bound to compromise.</p><br/><p>The soloist right now is also the composer. If the composer himself says that his interpretation is right, there is no solution for even the conductor. The members held their breaths as they watched Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll bring out more of the feeling he had while writing the song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Conductor Carras let out a long sigh of relief. It is probably his unstubborn free style that shows confidence, but it is also marvelous that he could change his style as he wants in one place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, shall we start with the 2nd part again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The feeling Jun Hyuk had when he was first writing the song. When Beethoven could not even hear and was obsessed with one melody and clinging to the thematic melody of the 4th part, nearing on madness.</p><br/><p>He put that feeling into the piano and played for the conductor and orchestra.</p><br/><p>They heard Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano melody and the maestro smiled from ear to ear.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The only signs that something had happened were his bloated face and stiff, bandaged back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake now? How do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, mister. Yes\u2026 I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be hungry. Sit there and I\u2019ll make you something to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk sat uncomfortably in a corner of the cafe. He had only seen the boss on the first day when he ate the tonkatsu, but there were two young people cleaning and preparing the hall now. He could also see the boss making something next to the chef in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>The two young employees cleaning the hall kept glancing over at Jun Hyuk as well. Yoon Kwang Hun came out with a plate once that attention started to become uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this first and ease your stomach. We\u2019ll eat more heartily for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk only noticed that something was wrong with Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s face after he had scarfed down the porridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut mister. Your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this? Those high schoolers hit me a little yesterday. At any rate, I thought you would be able to fight a bit but you couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we fought properly, I would have won for sure. What can I do when they\u2019re all ganging up on me? I could have run away if it weren\u2019t for you but you came\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey kid! Your tone is different after being saved. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk wanted to thank Yoon Kwang Hun who was laughing with a bruised face, but he lost his chance to show his gratefulness because of his next words because they were entirely unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to work here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a place to go anyway. You can sleep in that small room and since this is a cafe, your meals won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun had considered taking Jun Hyuk home as well, but the cafe was better suited if he wanted to be surrounded by music at any time of the day. Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s CD collection and the audio system he had spent thousands on were at the cafe. If Jun Hyuk even wanted to make ramen at the house, he would have to be careful of Yoon Kwang Hun, but if he were alone at the cafe, he could go into the refrigerator at any time and eat whatever he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what type of work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead of dealing with the customers, preparing to open for business and cleaning the hall and kitchen after closing. That\u2019s it. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me to just prepare and clean, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Isn\u2019t it completely ideal?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought Jun Hyuk would be jumping for joy at the offer of simply cleaning in exchange for food and shelter, but he had a strange expression that was neither positive nor negative. What\u2019s more, the expression did not look favorable either.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, mister. Tell me honestly. What do you want from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no adult who gives out food and shelter for free. There\u2019s no such thing as free food.\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes were full of distrust. His lips were forming a slight smile.</p><br/><p>Adults made a young child like this. Could it be that he had never experienced kindness and goodwill?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026 Whew~.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun stopped talking to depress this horrible feeling. How had the world treated this 15 year old boy and what awful tribulations had he endured on his way here?</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun had so many questions, but did not want to revisit old wounds like they had done the last time. Instead, he told Jun Hyuk what he needed to do going forward slowly and clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen carefully, Jun Hyuk. There are also adults who give hungry children free lunch without expecting anything in return. And it\u2019s not free, is it? I\u2019m making you clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s expression was that of disbelief. No matter how hard he searched his memory, there had never been a person who treated him like this without expecting something in return. He felt Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s sincerity in the way he was speaking clearly as if he were upset.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are you being nice to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 let me think. How should I say it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun thought for a moment about how he could say it in a way that would help Jun Hyuk understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a tremendous talent that you don\u2019t know about. I don\u2019t know how extensive it is either. I want to see that talent and I don\u2019t want it to disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy chance, can I hear\u2026 I mean, do I have a talent in music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo far it seems so. It could be an incredible talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hung his head. Yoon Kwang Hun could guess why his head was hanging and went on speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t have a talent, let\u2019s live here together until you\u2019re an adult. I\u2019m alone and you\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk finally lifted his head and thanked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, mister. I\u2019ll make sure to be successful with my music and repay your kindness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me\u2026 Forget about that. And you\u2019re not just playing around. You really have to start studying hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Study?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, study. You\u2019ve never been to school, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t know hangul?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not something to be ashamed of. It\u2019s natural that you don\u2019t know it if you\u2019ve never learned it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun hit the back of Jun Hyuk\u2019s once again hanging head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the cafe opens in the morning, go to your room and sleep. Sleep well and you can listen to music when you get up. We can study together after the cafe is closed. We\u2019ll learn hangul and sheet music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSheet music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea. Sheet music makes it possible to read sounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSounds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It means you\u2019re recording the pitch and length of sounds. And since you don\u2019t know tones yet, you\u2019ll need to learn an instrument. You need to know the different sounds instruments make.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 if I learn sheet music, I\u2019ll be able to write down the sounds I think of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Exactly. This is it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun felt a shiver run through his body. There\u2019s definitely music unique to this child in his head. Yoon Kwang Hun wanted to see that music. He needed to know if this child was Mozart reincarnated or if he just had absolute pitch, a sense for tempo, and amazing memorization.</p><br/><p>If Jun Hyuk was not talented in composition, he would need to receive professional training. Yoon Kwang Hun thought this far ahead and started to worry. How much money would this cost?</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, you can think about making music slowly. You need to listen to a lot of it before that. As you listen to a lot of music, it\u2019ll become clear how you can make the sounds that you are thinking of.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Jun Hyuk started to live at the cafe.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

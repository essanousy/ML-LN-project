You\u2019re good at handling yourself now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe committee called to say you knocked 10 years off their life. You gave them a great show?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern is happy that Jun Hyuk is able to get himself out of trouble on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI barely got past it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t barely. You did really well. Anyone can make a mistake, but resolving it isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>While President Stern was praising Jun Hyuk, employees of Stern Corporation were moving busily inside the house. They were already preparing to go back to New York.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. Are you going back tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Maestro Carras is making a fuss for me to hurry back. I think he wants to do the performance as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, what about Danny? Can you match his performance schedule?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we need to match it. There\u2019s no soloist who will reject the New York Philharmonic. We\u2019re going to make adjustments with the committee. The committee won\u2019t force a tour when a finalist has a great opportunity either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara already has Jun Hyuk\u2019s luggage packed up as well. They will be leaving early in the morning.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at Yoon Kwang Hun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to go to Korea. I\u2019ll go see you when you perform with New York. Beethoven is glaring at you. Do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make him so surprised he\u2019ll go back into his grave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid is getting worse by the day. You don\u2019t know modesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>A phone rang when Yoon Kwang Hun was about to hit Jun Hyuk\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Kwang Hun?</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Lawyer Baek. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lawyer Baek Seung Ho\u2019s voice over the phone became urgent.</p><br/><p>\u2013 You\u2019re in Belgium now, right? You haven\u2019t left yet?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Why? Is something going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Phew. That\u2019s a relief.</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho let out a long sigh and went back to his normal voice.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Don\u2019t come here for a while because it\u2019s crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 What do you mean what is it? Of course it\u2019s because of Jun Hyuk. His winning, his conducting, the critics calling him the 21st century Beethoven \u2013 all of it. I\u2019ve been suffering since the morning instead of you and I just ran away. It\u2019s so bad I can\u2019t even do my work.</p><br/><p>The public shows more interest in the winners of the performance portions than they do in the composition portion. But as the competition was ending, the international media reported more on Jun Hyuk\u2019s statement, conducting, and song than they did on the performing winners.</p><br/><p>The Korean media finally realized this Queen Elisabeth Competition\u2019s core and headlines were covered in the \u2018Korean Born\u2019 that the nation is celebrating.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what? Why can\u2019t I go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 If you come back, they won\u2019t leave you alone. They\u2019ll already be waiting for you at the airport and cafe.</p><br/><p>Cable networks are already requesting to film documentaries on Jun Hyuk. Considering not just the win but also the next schedule, or performing with the New York Philharmonic, it is an awesome ordeal. The honor of having the first Korean to conduct his own song was enough to bring out the nation\u2019s enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Jun Hyuk is going to perform Beethoven\u2019s choral symphony. The standing conductor of the New York Philharmonic will be performing Jun Hyuk\u2019s song. They can\u2019t even tell the difference between a symphony and concerto?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Is that important? Anyway, there\u2019s only news on Jun Hyuk on TV today.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? What do you want me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Go to New York with Jun Hyuk for now. You\u2019ll have to hold a combined interview with the Korean reporters there. Or it\u2019ll just stay noisy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do about the cafe? I can\u2019t leave it empty for so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Nothing happens with the cafe regardless of whether or not you\u2019re there.</p><br/><p>When Yoon Kwang Hun had nothing to say, Baek Seung Ho\u2019s yelled,</p><br/><p>\u2013 Ugh! Kwang Hun! I\u2019m telling you to give a refreshing interview in New York and then come back! Let me live. I\u2019m an employee who needs to go to work. If you don\u2019t want to, you can come in right away. Then you\u2019ll be swept over by the reporters instead of me, so that\u2019s fine with me. You don\u2019t understand even when I\u2019m saying this thinking of you.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll talk to President Stern about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Do well this time. People can\u2019t buy Jun Hyuk\u2019s 1st album because there aren\u2019t enough of them because of the articles. He appeared on music charts again within a day. Rake it all in for once. Hang up.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun got off the phone and told Jun Hyuk and President Stern about the current situation in Korea. Jun Hyuk was so happy he could leap around.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! You can stay in New York with me for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun is hesitating because Jun Hyuk is staying in the apartment that President Stern lent him. On the other hand, it would be strange to leave a house that has more than enough space for 2 people and stay in a hotel.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should do that, Mr. Yoon. I\u2019ll take care of the interview with the Korean press you mentioned.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern made an offer that Yoon Kwang Hun could not refuse when he kept hesitating.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you go to New York, you should get dinner with Maestro Carras and talk about music\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stern. I\u2019ll make sure there are no inconveniences because of me. Then I\u2019ll stay with Jun Hyuk for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun quickly took President Stern\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took out a bundle of scores on the private plane back to New York.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look at this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you write this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhenever I had time in Brussels. I made it into a short song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun, President Stern, and Tara quickly began reading through the score.</p><br/><p>The 3 people sat with the score on the table between them but were no longer surprised. They are already aware that he can easily write songs like this. President Stern was the only one who had any type of reaction because it is not an abstruse contemporary piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are 5 songs of 5 minutes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Feels like stringed instruments from the way there is a lot of portamento (sliding from one note to the next).\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern thought that Jun Hyuk had prepared a solo violin piece for Danny who would be in New York.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not the strings, but soprano vocals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Soprano? Are you thinking of Laura?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I was hoping you would bring Laura Goldberg in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk automatically smiled while thinking of Laura Goldberg\u2019s beautiful tone.</p><br/><p>President Stern spoke as he looked at the score,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you need to work on the lyrics. Hm\u2026 I\u2019ll have to look into a lyricist. Is there anything you\u2019re thinking of? Like a poem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t need lyrics.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t need lyrics?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I wrote each song to respond to one sound. The songs are titled I, A, E, O, U. I\u2019m going to have her sing with just 5 collections.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 3 people had been calm until now, when their expressions changed. They knew it had been too banal. With lyrics, it is just another song. Yoon Kwang Hun in particular thought that considering the melody alone, Jun Hyuk has a lot of other songs that are more beautiful. Jun Hyuk is not one to make a song that is lesser to hand over to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want to take on another new challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun looked at Jun Hyuk, urging him to confess his secret.</p><br/><p>President Stern put the score down and spoke to Yoon Kwang Hun,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Yoon. We can\u2019t say that it\u2019s completely new. There are already works that have been created with the human voice without any meaning to them. The difference is that the melody of Jun Hyuk\u2019s song is beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s expression did not change even after President Stern\u2019s explanation. He fully knows that Jun Hyuk is not one to transform or rehash something that someone else has already done.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. It is a new challenge. She needs to sing these songs without an accompaniment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re saying it\u2019s an unaccompanied solo?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ability to deliver a message will fall because there are no lyrics, and the aria cannot stop because there is no accompaniment. She needs to express the emotions with the melody, tempo, and tone alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there a lot of recitals for instruments without accompaniments?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ultimately, Jun Hyuk is trying to implement an instrument that makes one sound. With just the voice of a soprano.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern bit his lip as he realized the meaning behind Jun Hyuk\u2019s song. He is not concerned about the song. He thought of countless primadonnas. Does it have to be Laura Goldberg?</p><br/><p>\u201cInstruments don\u2019t say words. Can\u2019t they convey various emotions with just their sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm. You\u2019re thinking of the human voice as just an instrument?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why Laura? There are a lot of great soprano singers out there. I can get anyone for you. No. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll get in line once they hear that it\u2019s your song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled and scratched his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFamous prima donnas wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithstand what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara had been holding back her words but could not hold her curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are 5 perfect sounds in my head. They\u2019ll have to sing countless times until that sound comes out. People who are already stars wouldn\u2019t be able to take it and I\u2019m pretty sure they would get angry. Oh and that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m underestimating Laura\u2019s abilities. She\u2019ll be able to handle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura has not sung very much yet. Her unique sound will become more firm as she spends more time as a singer. It will be hard to bring out the sounds that Jun Hyuk wants if her sound becomes set in completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sound can\u2019t change even slightly. E with the same pronunciation has a fortis, an ordinary sound, and heavy sound. There are also sounds pronounced in between E and O, and E and I.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t stray even a bit\u2026 Hm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely experimental.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun smiled at Jun Hyuk\u2019s idea. It is the kind of music he correlates with Jun Hyuk. He has the ability to go beyond a simple song with a beautiful melody, to be pioneering and create innovatory music.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why I made the melody beautiful. I was actually going to make the melody irregular too\u2026 but then people won\u2019t listen to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac was more surprised by what Jun Hyuk just said than he was by the music. A lot of contemporary music is not created with the public\u2019s tastes taken into consideration. It was always more important to show the composer\u2019s intent, philosophy, and thinking. As a result, a lot of music that is not much more than noise was produced.</p><br/><p>It could be that they intentionally rejected beautiful melodies. Beautiful melodies pose the danger of bringing out emotions that the composer had not intended to evoke.</p><br/><p>But what Jun Hyuk was saying meant that he would create music that would sell to the public no matter how experimental it is. It is unbelievable that this is the Jun Hyuk who wrote the extreme Inferno.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Isaac, try contacting Laura. You have to put in the contract that she\u2019ll have to pay a tremendous amount of penalties if she quits in the middle\u2026 Stuff like that so she can\u2019t get out of it. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you thinking of releasing an album too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Laura won\u2019t be motivated either if we\u2019re just experimenting. We\u2019ll release an album and perform\u2026 It won\u2019t be a bad deal for Laura either because the performance will just be one soprano since there isn\u2019t an accompaniment.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk was done speaking, President Stern looked for his satellite phone. He needs to take Laura Goldberg out before the tour for the Queen Elisabeth Competition finalists begins. While he was calling various people, the private plane flew through the Atlantic clouds of success to New York.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

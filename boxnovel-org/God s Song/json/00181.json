What does the staff member have to say?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Age? Do you listen to classical music with age?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Should I say there are cultural differences by generation? Anyway, it is the difference between whether or not it is familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anyone here who isn\u2019t familiar with classical music? It\u2019s your jobs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to talk about isn\u2019t classical. I\u2019m talking about the characteristic of this song. Isaac, think about movies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMovies?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young staff member used movies as a way to express what he is thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Movies are the icons that represent their generations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake out the introduction and get to the point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern lit a cigar and cut him off.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s think about the movie Batman. Compare Director Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 Batman and Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2008 Dark Knight.</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern could not compare them because he had seen Tim Burton\u2019s Batman, but not the Dark Knight. He did not say anything because he thought the staff member would go on about age again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about a larger scale or incredible special effects. Think about the number of shorts or cuts. Today\u2019s movie changes screen every 4 minutes on average. They edit the action parts by second units.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the office could understand what he is trying to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people of this generation get bored if there aren\u2019t changes that are this fast. If Beethoven was a modern man, his song would have been more flashy than Jun\u2019s. People who are used to the whirlwind of angles used in Spiderman don\u2019t see it as excessive. They are able to enjoy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The world has changed over the past 200 years. There is more rapid change in 10 years in the 21st century than there is in 100 years of the 18th century. The Porsche that James Dean died in in 1955 boasted speeds of 180km/h, but Porsches now can go up to 300km/h.</p><br/><p>Speed of change is not something that is learned, but something that becomes acclimatized throughout life.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Beethoven wrote a revolutionary song and it was of a diabolical difficulty. It would have been no different from Jun Hyuk\u2019s song at the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The premiere with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1824 made quite a lot of money but it was not as much as Beethoven thought it would. The 2nd performance saw a deficit and it was criticized.</p><br/><p>The format of Jun Hyuk\u2019s song is faithful to the classics, but the style is a classical matched to the contemporary. It is just that it is a classical suitable to the modern person. It is too extreme to grab people who are used to the classical of the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure even the youth who don\u2019t go near classical music will say that they like this song. There\u2019s not a boring moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. Am I now too old to find the essence of music?\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern grumbled, but his face was bright without any doubts.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Jun wants to submit this to the Queen Elisabeth Competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What absurdity is this? Why a competition so randomly?\u201d</p><br/><p>The word competition is as shocking as this song is. He wants to fight Beethoven in an arena of young rookies? The right place for it is the New York Philharmonic\u2019s Lincoln Center Avery Fisher Hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but will anything become bigger news than this?\u201d</p><br/><p>If the New York Philharmonic performs it in Lincoln Center, it fits the song\u2019s character and scale. But they cannot help but agree with the news that Isaac Stern is talking about. How many people in New York know about the philharmonic\u2019s performances?</p><br/><p>With a worldwide competition however, Europe and the countries of the finalists receive reports on its progression. A competition is much more advantageous in becoming news.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but we need to think about the problems after.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member looked at President Stern and hesitated, looking for a way to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you thinking that the results might not be good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a problem that can be predicted?\u201d</p><br/><p>He has no question about Jun Hyuk\u2019s work, but he worries about the judges. Not their ethics, but their actual ages. Even the staff of Stern Corporation is out of breath with a music that they are not familiar with, but judges of the old competition could be worse.</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern smiled while listening to the staff\u2019s concerns. He felt good that none of them had read his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I think is \u2013 and I\u2019m 100% sure \u2013 he won\u2019t be able to win. The reason is that like you all said, the judges are too old to enjoy the music. Like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When one of the staff members was about to speak up, Isaac Stern put up his hand to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the case where he doesn\u2019t win where we can shine our light best?\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff members\u2019 eyes changed. They realized President Stern\u2019s intention.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. If we\u2019re thinking only of becoming a hot topic, not winning would be better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA misfortunate 2nd place tends to receive more spotlight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff started calculating the advantages of not winning.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? On top of that, we can mobilize powerful reinforcements.\u201d</p><br/><p>If President Stern shows Jun Hyuk\u2019s score to maestros all around the world and gets their thoughts on it, the spotlight will be even stronger.</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern is able to have such confidence because he is so sure of Jun Hyuk\u2019s song.</p><br/><p>However, Isaac Stern needed to change his thoughts. He realized what Jun Hyuk wants while talking to him over the phone. He wants to conduct in Brussels, Belgium. And Isaac Stern had agreed to do whatever Jun Hyuk wants to do.</p><br/><p>To keep that promise, he prepared to spread the image of Jun Hyuk conducting and his work as widely as possible.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cSir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going now. I rested enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. This was a good enough vacation, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk talked about going back to America over dinner. Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s face showed disappointment for a very short moment, but it quickly calmed down. Jun Hyuk\u2019s visit had been like a surprise present. It would be harder to see him from now on.</p><br/><p>There was something that he did regret, so he spoke up,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that. You don\u2019t have any thoughts on performing with Fine Philharmonic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I do want to hear Han Ye Ji\u2019s piano again, but I don\u2019t know about doing an official concert. I\u2019d rather see her at her own recital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. There\u2019s nothing to do if you don\u2019t feel like it. Now, I\u2019ll have to go see you when you perform. When do you think your first performance will be? Belgium?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Do you think I\u2019ll be able to win?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought President Stern said he would make you the winner? I\u2019m going to go ahead and reserve my flight and hotel to fit the finals period. Oh right. Send me 5 admission tickets to the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? 5 of them? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I go alone? I need to take everyone. It\u2019ll be boring if I go alone. There\u2019s nothing to do in Europe once the sun sets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he. Alright. I\u2019ll prepare them right away if I win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk finished up his last meal at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s cafe.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about the apartment in New York? Are you going to move to the apartment that President Stern prepared for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I was told that they already moved all of my stuff and took care of the apartment I was renting. It really is comfortable that I don\u2019t have to mind anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since signing on with a management agency, moving was the first realistic convenience that he experienced. As Yoon Kwang Hun brought up the New York apartment, he thought of someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut hasn\u2019t it been a long time since you\u2019ve seen Amelia? Are you two okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to come in the summer. She\u2019s performing and recording with the BBC orchestra right now. Why? You think we might break up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the saying, out of sight out of mind? It\u2019s an immutable truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe FaceTime every day. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean seeing physically when I mean out of sight. It\u2019s because you lose the opportunity to make an effort itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not know what Yoon Kwang Hun meant by effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cAffection is bound to die down as time passes. If you don\u2019t make the effort to fire the affection up again, it\u2019ll eventually die. I mean that if you stay apart this long, it\u2019s impossible even if you make the effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk stared at Yoon Kwang Hun and spoke cautiously,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that someone who has lived alone forever should be saying. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

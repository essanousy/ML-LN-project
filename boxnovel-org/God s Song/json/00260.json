He thought that it might be a tremendous mansion because it is in an area where only the super rich live, but there wasn\u2019t even a swimming pool. Instead, there was a large forest reminiscent of a park.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Amelia, what\u2019s that other building on the side?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was pointing at a building far from the main house.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, your studio. I put all of the audio, recording, and instruments in there. Oh right. The audio system is a gift from me to you. I spent all the money I made playing piano all year until my fingernails fell out, so treat it how you treat me. And I made the basement into a recording studio. I won\u2019t even go near it, so it\u2019s completely a place of your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled from ear to ear and walked toward the annex building when Amelia yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to die? You\u2019re going to go to your studio without seeing our bedroom first? I\u2019m going to bulldoze it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia was not able to spend even 10 days in the bedroom she loved so much. She went back to her routine and had to start living like a nomad with her manager again. What had changed was that she was getting around more comfortably without having to take longer routes with Jun Hyuk\u2019s private plane.</p><br/><p>After Amelia left, Jun Hyuk\u2019s life was just him going back and forth between his studio at home and the studio at the JS Center.</p><br/><p>Unlike Jun Hyuk\u2019s simple life, the outside was noisy with his news everyday.</p><br/><p>When it was revealed that they would be establishing an orchestra for JS Center and the details came out, professional musicians and conservatory students in classical music were stirred up.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s jaws dropped at the salary that was three times the amount of other orchestra and Jun Hyuk was said to be the conductor for life, but it was also because of the recruitment ad that obviously showed who the owner of the orchestra is.</p><br/><p>It hinted that the main repertoire would be Jun Hyuk\u2019s works and the best treatment and working environment would be provided, but they need to agree to the condition that they can be fired at any time if they do not show improvement and development if they want to apply.</p><br/><p>It was unconventional that there will not be any separation in aspects like 1st or 2nd performer, and positions will change frequently with the pieces they perform.</p><br/><p>It was also unusual that the audition will not look at names or experience, and progress with registration numbers. The intent to look only at current ability showed clearly.</p><br/><p>Applying was just leaving an e-mail and instrument part on JS Center\u2019s temporary homepage. The purpose of the e-mails was only to notify applicants of the audition date and time.</p><br/><p>Tens of thousands of people applied, including the truly strong musicians, those who call themselves exceptional, performers who are not that great, and those who applied because of the money.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is troublesome. It\u2019ll take 1 year to audition all of these people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. We would need to see 100 people every single day to make it in a year. It was reckless not to look at experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c100 people in a day? That\u2019s not realistic either. We\u2019ll need to hold auditions for at least 2 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Even though it\u2019s Maestro Jun\u2019s orchestra, we should have persuaded him.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern and the staff racked their brains for a method, but nothing clear came out. There was something that they were forgetting however. That is Jun Hyuk himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about so hard? We should be done in a week at most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? One week? How?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c200 people can fit in the basement studio. We can have rounds of 200 people perform for 10 minutes by instrument parts, and pick from there. I\u2019m just worried there won\u2019t be able performers in the entire number of applicants.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, no one knew what Jun Hyuk was talking about. However, they all hit their knees and started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. We were forgetting the maestro\u2019s incredible listening skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first day of auditions was the violin. The thousands of people who gathered at JS Center with their violin cases were surprised by the number of people auditioning. There was even bustling when they discovered a known violinist among them.</p><br/><p>The first 200 people were called in numerical order and took the elevator down to the basement studio. Their jaws dropped at the tremendous scale of the huge studio.</p><br/><p>Staff members escorted 200 violinists into the recording booth, and they looked at each other bustling. At first, they thought that they were going to be told how the auditions would proceed. However, the way they were evenly spaced out in the room felt like they were in position as an orchestra, so they felt even more nervous.</p><br/><p>Shortly after, the recording booth door opened and the famous young maestro came in. Jun Hyuk stood on the podium and spoke in a businesslike manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cA score will come up on the screen momentarily. When I send the signal, play according to that score. If you miss my signal and start late or early, you will be eliminated automatically. Missing the conductor\u2019s signal is a mistake that not even amateurs make.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk raised both of his arms, the applicants put their violins to their chins and prepared to move their bows at any time.</p><br/><p>As Jun Hyuk said, a score came up on the screen. But it is music that they are seeing for the first time. While they tried to read over the score quickly, Jun Hyuk\u2019s baton moved.</p><br/><p>The applicants did their very best not to lose the score and Jun Hyuk\u2019s baton. However, they quickly realized that the baton would simply help them keep the beat.</p><br/><p>When the 10 minute performance ended, Jun Hyuk used his baton to sort out the applicants.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber 4, 36, 168\u2026.. These people stay behind and the rest can go back. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 200 people were in a state of confusion after Jun Hyuk\u2019s dry announcement of the results because they could not figure out what was going on. The 3 people whose numbers were called were also bewildered.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm Maestro. I\u2019m sorry, but is this the audition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the eliminated violinists were packing their violins and leaving the recording booth, someone burst out in discontent.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it is right that the decision is made based according to the maestro\u2019s standards\u2026 but isn\u2019t this too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk frowned and looked at the applicant who was objecting to his method.</p><br/><p>\u201c200 people played a song that they saw for the first time and you choose from among them? Honestly, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen an audition like this. It\u2019s hard to accept its fairness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFairness\u2026 What\u2019s your number?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour number.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c143.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you performed from that spot, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou missed 2 notes, 3 fingering mistakes, you lost the tempo once. Even if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019re seeing this score, you made all of these mistakes in a short 10 minutes\u2026 If I were you, I\u2019d disappear quietly out of embarrassment. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being shameless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Number 143 gulped under Jun Hyuk\u2019s sharp reproach. While he could not say anything, the other applicants had looks of disbelief.</p><br/><p>It may be difficult if all of the instruments are different, there are conductors who are able to pick out where mistakes were made. But they are all violins with the same timbre. He not only pointed out that something was strange, but how many mistakes were made and how many times. The impossible was happening in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Number 143, you\u2019re left handed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Yes. That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeft handed people need to hold the elbow of the hand with the bow 3 to 5 centimeters higher than right handed people do. That\u2019s how a clear sound comes out. Unless you fix that, you won\u2019t pass any auditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The candidates froze as they were leaving the recording booth. He picked up on not only mistakes, but that the performer is left-handed?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe audition is fair. And I hope the people who passed understand that this is just the 1st round. Not even I know how many rounds there will be. If there is anyone else who has a problem with the way our auditions are being held, speak up. Just keep in mind that you might hear something more harsh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone except the 3 people whose numbers were called, left the studio as though running away. The 3 who passed were so tense that they wanted to follow after them as well. Performing under a conductor like that?</p><br/><p>Their burden reached its peak.</p><br/><p>When the 2nd group of candidates came down, there were far less people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why are there so few people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Less than 100 people were holding their violins and waiting for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey all left. The people who were just eliminated told them how the auditions are held\u2026 and one candidate revealed that he used to be with the Munich Philharmonic. It seems they made a fuss and ran away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen these are all of the violin candidates left over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Maestro.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was not just the case with violinists. When talk of the 1st day of auditions spread on the internet and social media, only a little over 100 people out of tens of thousands of applicants showed up for each instrument.</p><br/><p>Due to this, they were able to hold higher quality auditions with great performers. 82 people passed the auditions until the 3rd round, and they became the founding members of Jun Hyuk\u2019s orchestra.</p><br/><p>They moved to New York a month later and stepped back into the large studio in JS Center again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

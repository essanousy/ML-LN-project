Alvin, who became a star after just 2 albums before meeting his downfall with drugs and becoming a hermit blues musician. A classical cello major holding a bass guitar. A nameless session drummer who is like Cinderella, getting the chance to perform with a world renowned star.</p><br/><p>There seemed to be no end to the interview because Korean and foreign reporters gathered to flood Alvin Lee with questions.</p><br/><p>Tara did not end the interview. The content was still good and she needed to buy more time for Jun Hyuk to overcome the shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Jun still the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I checked in on him for a second, but he is sitting in the same place without moving.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard for Tara to forgive herself for not knowing about this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. It\u2019s something that would have happened at some point or another. It\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t have time to prepare\u2026 Actually, it\u2019s a question as to whether or not we would be able to prepare for something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun saw that Tara was being hard on herself and comforted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the interview wrapping up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Now, we need to end it. The reporters will think something is strange if we keep it going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s cancel the solo interview. We can\u2019t push him into a press conference in this state.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun made the final decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara tried to go to the press conference hall, but she could not take a step.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you taking care of? Tara, I\u2019m a little late, right? Let\u2019s hurry. I\u2019m sure everyone else is having a rough time because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk burst through the door, took a surprised Tara by the arm, and was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. There\u2019s no reason for you to overdo it, and we can push the interview back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun felt bad that Jun Hyuk was forcing himself to smile, and his own expression continued to be hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not overdoing it. And I heard what you both said. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ll experience sooner or later, and it just happens to be today. Of course that \u2018something\u2019 won\u2019t disappear on its own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk spoke in English so Tara could understand. His waved his left hand and pointed to his watch.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I need to show this watch a lot during the press conference? I know that much too, Tara.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun saw the smile on Jun Hyuk\u2019s face and knew that his worries were unfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. Go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun nodded to Tara. It means there is no reason to worry. It is Jun Hyuk\u2019s personal problem. Eventually, Jun Hyuk will make the decision.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When Alvin Lee and the others left the conference hall, the reporters just murmured in waiting for Jun Hyuk to enter. If Jun Hyuk does not show up, they will need to write articles guessing about why that is.</p><br/><p>The entrance was a little noisy, and Jun Hyuk entered the conference hall without losing his smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you wait. I was resting because I was not in a great condition, but I made this run late.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Jun Hyuk\u2019s greetings, the reporters began asking questions. They even showed the courtesy to start with easier ones.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou chose Edvard Grieg as your repertoire with Seoul Symphony. Is there a particular reason for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeoul Symphony chose that song, and I also wanted to perform it because it is a wonderful song. There won\u2019t be a different reason for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo of the people in your band are not famous. Is there a special reason as to why you chose them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the concert is over, they will be recognized for their abilities and they will become famous. Colin, the bassist, is already performing actively in America in the west coast, and Kyung</p><br/><p>Min Ho, the drummer, is famous in the music industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Alvin Lee got back into music, this is his first concert of such a large scale. How did you convince him to join?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone else was the one to convince him, but\u2026 I\u2019m sure that means that\u2019s how great my song is? That it would even make a hermit come out? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters\u2019 response to Jun Hyuk\u2019s joke was not good. They were all thinking of the last question they would ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe new solo song that you released is creating a lot of news. There are a lot of versions coming out with arrangements in different instruments. If they want to create an aria with lyrics or arrange it into pop music, would you allow it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already revealed the score. If someone wants to make a song, whether it is pop or even a song for children, it does not matter to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The interview questions continued to be about music. It seemed to be a normal atmosphere with intermittent joking and occasional questions with depth from music magazines, but an unknown tension was staining the air.</p><br/><p>After a fairly long amount of time and it felt that they had reached the end of interview questions, reporters began to clear their throats awkwardly. As though it was a signal, one reporter bravely asked the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know, but people have begun to appear, claiming to be your biological parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had been waiting for a longer response, but Jun Hyuk just nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018I see\u2019 mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask a question just now, so there\u2019s nothing for me to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter thought that Jun Hyuk had been avoiding the question, and took the microphone. The arrow is already flying, so it needs to hit the target and that target is what Jun Hyuk is really thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll modify the question. Of course, there have been people who are just trying to gain attention outrageously, but there are those who could quite possibly be your biological parents. Do you have thoughts of confirming if they are your biological parents with blood tests? And if you do find your biological parents, please tell us what you will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cameras began flashing again because Jun Hyuk had been smiling until now, but his face had hardened.</p><br/><p>He sat for a while and took in the flashing cameras before slowly opening his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will check one thing first. You said that there are \u2018people\u2019 claiming to be my biological parents, but I can\u2019t have multiple parents so there\u2019s a high possibility that they are all fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can\u2019t rule out that possibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy biological parents left me my name and birth date, so that alone would be able to eliminate a lot of people impersonating my biological parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean you will look for your biological parents?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, will you let me speak to the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk spoke with a hard face, the other reporters shut their mouths.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith ill intentions\u2026 well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s money? Anyway, if anyone tries to falsely claim rights from now on, I don\u2019t know if this is possible, but I will take legal action. They approached me with intentional fraud? Well\u2026 something like that.\u201d Jun Hyuk took a sip of his water.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy legal representative, Mr. Baek Seung Ho, is at one of the top law firms in the country and I believe that they are capable of finding grounds for punishment. I won\u2019t be concerned with</p><br/><p>how much it costs. I think that they will understand from what I said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s anger was relayed to the reporters through his determined voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there is still the possibility that someone is your biological parent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only attended music school, but I learned a lot beyond music. There are important things among them, and it is that greed is bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you mean to say that those claiming to be your biological parents are showing greed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I mean that I will not be greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk still had the microphone in his hand, so the reporters just waited for him to go on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already have a parent. And a parent who loves me excessively at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you referring to Mr. Yoon Kwang Hun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I still call him \u2018Sir,\u2019 but since the moment I first met him, I have never forgotten that he is my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Up to here was what the reporters had been expecting. It also means that he is drawing a line with the people claiming to be his biological parents.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I have a lot of mothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters had thought that he was done but when he kept speaking, they all put their hands down.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Go Sae Won, who led me so that I would not gain bad habits while playing the piano. Professor Jeon Hye Jin, who desperately wants me to truly express myself and grow as a proper pianist. Lawyer Baek Seung Ho, who went out of his way to interfere with the press\u2019 malicious articles. Teachers Yoon Jung Su, Jo Hyung Joong, and Kim Jong Suk, who showed me the various possibilities of music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk started to talk about each person who worries for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLawyer Lim So Mi, who never forgets to make me tonkatsu in America. President Isaac Stern, who treats me like a prince and creates an environment in which I can create music that\u2019s better than money. And Tara Butters, who never leaves my side and takes care of me like a real older sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk felt better after recalling the good people around him, and started to smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly, there\u2019s even my girlfriend, Amelia, who understands and loves me regardless of the problems I have due to my personality. All of these people are my mothers. But to look for more parents? That would be greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the names flowed out in order. The reporters know Jun Hyuk\u2019s precise thoughts, however,they did not want a metaphor, just his exact wording.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we interpret that as you\u2019re saying that you will not be looking for your biological parents or going through DNA testing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. And if you meet anyone claiming to be my biological parents, please be sure to tell them not to make a fit and continue living as they have been.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no reporter who did not feel Jun Hyuk\u2019s deeply hidden resentment and anger when he said \u2018make a fit\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Jang Jun Hyuk. Of the people claiming to be your biological parents, they might actually just want to apologize and ask for forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForgiveness? If they really want to be forgiven for abandoning me as a newborn baby, it\u2019s not too late. They can go to the orphanage immediately and adopt a child, helping him or her grow into a great adult. Isn\u2019t that the most suitable way to be forgiven for their past wrongs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun watched the press conference and translated everything for Tara. But he could not keep translating when the word \u2018father\u2019 came out.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was not able to hide how worked up he is, but looking at the way he relays this thoughts calmly and exactly, Yoon Kwang Hun just had one thought. He is all grown up. And he grew up well.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk was done speaking, Yoon Kwang Hun said to Tara,</p><br/><p>\u201cTara, it\u2019s all over. End the interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara had been completely silent and did not know what had been said during the press conference. Yoon Kwang Hun saw that she was nervous and smiled as he spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cTara, you don\u2019t need to worry. I\u2019ve never seen a better interview. Jun handled it really well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara saw him smiling brightly and calmed down as she went out into the conference hall.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk saw her come in and stood up to say his goodbyes to the reporters before leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard the whole interview, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk found Yoon Kwang Hun waiting outside the conference hall, his face flushed red.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were a little cool today. Kid, you\u2019re all grown up. Makes me proud.\u201d He hit Jun Hyuk\u2019s back and stopped walking for a second.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. The \u2018make a fit\u2019 at the end was a little much, but\u2026 ugh, damn whatever. Anyway, you did well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara saw that both of their expressions were bright and felt as if a burden had been</p><br/><p>lifted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Let\u2019s go eat something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara locked arms with both of them and headed to the restaurant.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

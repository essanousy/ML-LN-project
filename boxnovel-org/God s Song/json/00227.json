And now, he is in front of the most important person in that performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was incredible, Isaac. The 1st album that a 17 year old Jun made. I got goosebumps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s no catch, right? All genres are in one album.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee-who looks much too old to say that he is 39 years old-was admiring Jun Hyuk\u2019s album without exaggeration.</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee is the bassist and vocalist of a rock band that appeared like a comet in the</p><br/><p>2000s, but released 2 albums and disappeared. He had to spend 5 years in a rehabilitation center because his drug addiction had gotten to the point where it was difficult for him to continue doing music.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of rumors that he would reform the rock band after coming out of rehab, but his first album was surprisingly the blues. And that was solo instead of with a band, with a simple song and serene lyrics.</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee overcame that 5 year period and was awarded a Grammy for his comeback album, showing that his genius musicality remained. But focused on making studio albums instead of concerts, and was a hermit singer who only appeared occasionally in small-scale concerts.</p><br/><p>So it is surprising to propose a concert to him, and a large-scale Korean one at that. President Stern thinks highly of his vocals, which express his arched life, and firmly believes that he will present a great concert with Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is iffy to say that is an advantage. From the position of the fans buying the album, they would rather have an album full of the genre that they like. This album just feels like it\u2019s been filled with the best of charts songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason for that. It might not be easy to understand because the lyrics are in Korean, but it contains the 2 years where Jun started living a stable life for the first time and learned music. You know about his childhood too, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I saw the lyrics. There were a lot of waves in his life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee put a cigarette in his mouth. He could not shake the thought that he was incredibly immature and foolish compared to Jun Hyuk because he spent his 20s wasting away on drugs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the lyrics have meaning. I had the Korean lyrics translated, so look over those first and then write the English lyrics\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern handed over the papers with the translated lyrics, but Alvin Lee did not even look at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to write my lyrics based on how I feel regarding Jun\u2019s music that on the original song\u2019s Korean lyrics. I don\u2019t want to force meaning on the emotions of the original song. We can just forget it if you don\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a little surprised by what Alvin Lee said, but he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that means you\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It means a singer would be stupid to miss out on a song like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew. What a relief. I was worrying that you might reject because you only release your own work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. It\u2019s not like that. I just made my own songs because there wasn\u2019t a song I liked.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not important who made it if I like it. I\u2019m just a singer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when can you be done working on the lyrics?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already writing them. It won\u2019t take long. There was something I thought of when I heard the music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee put the cigarette out and did not hide something that was bothering him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what are you going to do if Jun doesn\u2019t like the lyrics that I wrote?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern spoke nonchalantly, telling him that there is nothing to worry about.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you trusting me too much? I\u2019m not a poet like Yates. I can\u2019t create incredible lyrics. I just write my thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I mean. Jun doesn\u2019t pay much attention to lyrics. He thinks of a singer as an instrument. He places more importance on the singer\u2019s voice than he does in the lyrics. He thinks more highly of the ability to handle a song well with the voice.\u201d Alvin Lee snapped his fingers and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAha! So that\u2019s why Laura Goldberg\u2019s incredible voice was on that album. It\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t care about lyrics?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s the music that Jun wants, and the reason why I chose you. You\u2019re the only vocalist who came to mind when I was listening to Jun\u2019s album.\u201d Isaac Stern set Alvin Lee up, but he just laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. There are so many great vocalists. Aren\u2019t you Isaac Stern, master of the box office? If I sing, the box office element just gets a little stronger. Reappearance of the hermit?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re going after?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I can\u2019t say that\u2019s not a part of it. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head as he watched President Stern laughing slyly, but he did not stop smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll create a demo as soon as I\u2019m done writing the lyrics and send it over. I hope</p><br/><p>Jun likes it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern smiled widely in satisfaction of the results of today\u2019s meeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting in anticipation. Then we\u2019ll meet with Jun soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going back to New York?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I need to go to LA to get a bassist on board.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee showed interest at the mention of a bassist because he himself is an outstanding bassist.</p><br/><p>\u201cLA? Who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cColin Sabotos.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern winked and laughed as he left.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern. Did you come to LA because of me? You could have just told me over the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould I really have come all the way to LA because of you? I came to see my 4th girlfriend who lives here. You\u2019re just a side note.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin was speechless because he could not tell from Stern\u2019s serious expression whether or not he was joking. It seems like the girlfriend is true, but it is hard to believe that she is the 4th one.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can change your show schedule around, right? Jun\u2019s concert in Korea is next month, and I was hoping you would join as bassist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Me?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Colin heard President Stern\u2019s sudden proposal, he had thousands of thoughts. \u201cWhy? Do you not have the confidence? Or does it not fit into your schedule?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. It was just so sudden\u2026 Did Jun\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Are you thinking of turning this down if Jun had asked for it? Out of a matter of pride?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You have to fill the concert with the best musicians. It needs to be perfect so that no one is falling behind Jun\u2019s standards. And not too long ago in New York, I told Jun about the difficulty I\u2019ve been having. It might be because of that\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I heard you\u2019re Jun\u2019s friend. Then I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t think that Jun is the type of person to take care of such small details like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, well that is true. No, no. Jun isn\u2019t good at expressing it, but he does take good care of the people around him.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern squinted at Colin and washed him of his concerns.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to know about you after Jun signed on with our agency. There was an item for arrangement among Jun\u2019s income, so I looked into it and it was your album. I came to meet you because the way you played on that remained in my memory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin\u2019s face became brighter when he realized that he had been judged on ability. \u201cThen can you by chance tell me who the vocalist is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlvin Lee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Goodness. Alvin Lee on the vocals?\u201d</p><br/><p>A genius hermit with diehard fans. He was excited by the possibility of being able to perform with such a musician, but he is also surprised by President Stern\u2019s ability to get him on board.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen have you decided on a drummer as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin\u2019s expression showed that he was expecting another tremendous musician\u2019s name. \u201cOh. The drummer is the original drummer. You\u2019ve heard Jun\u2019s Korean album, right?\u201d \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t he great? I got a file of his playing sent from Korea, and he\u2019s gotten even better.</p><br/><p>So we\u2019ve decided to use him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin lightly bowed his head to President Stern.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, thank you for giving me this opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheck the details on the contract. Your manager\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you can just give it to me. I don\u2019t have a manager, so\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t have a manager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin looked embarrassed and gave a rough explanation of how his music career has been collapsing ever since the drummer quit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 Then just clear your schedule. You\u2019ll need to keep at least 2 weeks before the concert free. 1 week of rehearsals with a temporary band. Then 1 week of rehearsals with the orchestra in Korea. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be preparing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Let me know as soon as your schedule is fixed.\u201d President Stern shook Colin\u2019s hand and returned to New York.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

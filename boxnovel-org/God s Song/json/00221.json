What is this? When did you get here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny ran over right away and hugged Colin. This is also Jun Hyuk\u2019s first time seeing him after they separated in LA, and took the hand Colin held out to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, the show was good. Your talent really isn\u2019t rusty at all. No, I think it shines even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. Why are you here all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean why? I came to see the show. Neither of you pick up your phones, so I was wandering for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I left mine with my manager\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny finally remembered that he doesn\u2019t have his phone on him. He was completely forgetting about where his agent was because he was surrounded by maestros. \u201cLet\u2019s not hang around here. We should go back home first.\u201d Jun Hyuk took Colin\u2019s arm and got in the waiting limousine.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cColin! Goodness. What is a rock star doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t miss Jun\u2019s U.S. debut stage. I needed to come yesterday, but I can\u2019t stop time.\u201d Amelia saw Colin come through the door and also expressed her delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cClayton\u2019s top beauty is still the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk saw Yoon Kwang Hun go to Colin, who he was meeting for the first time, and introduced him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you before that there\u2019s a cellist who\u2019s incredible on the bass, right? This is him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh. So this is the friend who rejected becoming Yo-Yo Ma and chose Curt Kobain\u2019s path. It\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Colin Sabotos. Yo-Yo Ma and Curt Kobain are both remote.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin laughed bitterly and his old friends were busy asking how he has been doing recently.</p><br/><p>Colin released his first album and started from the bottom, sweeping through California\u2019s clubs with an arrangement by LA Sound. It was the start of a rigorous schedule.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe released the album thanks to Jun and started performing in clubs. I would perform at 3 or 4 clubs a night, be reduced to rags, and go back to the apartment to pass out.\u201d Colin shook his head. He was recalling memories of suffering.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe drunk jerks disturb the shows\u2026 Ugh, don\u2019t even mention it. I don\u2019t even want to think about it twice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ve gotten out of the clubs since you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want to think about it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yoon Kwang Hun spoke, Colin\u2019s face brightened with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019re fairly well known in the west now. Since we\u2019ve made our band known to a certain point, we hold joint and solo concerts at times now. Of course we can\u2019t do tours across the country yet\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, it doesn\u2019t look good from your expression.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia looked over Colin\u2019s face and spoke cautiously. It could be that he is exhausted because of a long flight or a concert, but this is not the face of a musician who was working to gain popularity.</p><br/><p>His dark shaded face shows that he is without a doubt worried about something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe went east through LA, San Diego, and San Francisco while preparing our 2nd album. We presented new songs occasionally and reactions weren\u2019t bad. But\u2026\u201d Colin faltered suddenly and his face quickly turned red.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. The drummer left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He left? How could that happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy after suffering through everything? I thought you guys were doing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny and Amelia shouted at the same time. A drummer who suddenly quits a band that is growing well. It is something that they cannot understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said my music sucks. It\u2019s just really flashy and there\u2019s too much that\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like that\u2019s true. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had been listening quietly when he spoke up for the first time. Colin\u2019s face grew even redder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I tried to be cool and it was really flashy. That\u2019s my music. But I can\u2019t agree that the flashiness and splendor are useless. Anyway, the drummer left saying that he wants to do alternative music.\u201d</p><br/><p>70s rock music pioneered various genres like hard rock heavy metal, blues rock, southern rock, and progressive rock, and emphasized performances with depth. 80s rock was the golden age for the guitar as a phallic symbol and a macho image of wearing leather jackets.</p><br/><p>But since the 90s, rock music has been focusing on delivering messages. Concise guitar riffs, drums that are not flashy, and meaningful lyrics are the characteristics. Like the shabby jeans and t-shirts that band members wore on stage, alternative music expressed their rejection of existing musicians\u2019 ideas of money, love, and pleasure.</p><br/><p>Colin wants music with harmonious melodies of the guitar, bass, and drums with each part giving an admirable performance, rather than the delivery of messages in alternative rock. They just have not been able to show that admirable performance yet because they have not found a keyboardist to join them.</p><br/><p>He had tried to get Jun Hyuk to go into pop music with them in the first place because he needed Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to show the kind of music I want to pursue to the public. I\u2019ll turn down the role of playing messenger regarding the circumstances that today\u2019s youth have been placed in and their worries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin calmed down again and quietly explained his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you wanted to do music that people like and not music that I want to do, you didn\u2019t need to give up the cello. You can play the Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms that people like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you think you should listen to your members\u2019 opinions and work together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Band members are equal relations regarding music. If there are colliding opinions, they need to reach a compromise. Though the leader\u2019s views are most important, the leader needs to persuade the others at the least. However, Colin\u2019s response was like that of a dictator\u2019s. \u201cNo. I\u2019m doing my music. All I need is a guitarist and drummer who play the music I make. If the guitarist and drummer want to do their own music, I\u2019ll have to find other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>In some way, Colin is like an orchestra conductor and not a band leader. He seems to be thinking of band members as instruments that implement his music.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo did you find a drummer who\u2019s to your liking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny pushed a beer towards Colin with a nervous look. Colin took a big gulp.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy. And I can tell that the guitarist is conflicted because the drummer position is vacant. It\u2019s a real headache.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the atmosphere became heavy in the living room, Colin hastily waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. I really didn\u2019t come here to talk about stuff like this. I came because I didn\u2019t want to miss out on that shining moment when Jun conducts the New York Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk completed a great performance tonight. It is fitting to drink and celebrate.</p><br/><p>\u201cColin. Can we listen to your flashy and cool music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Oh, no. It\u2019s too much to do now. How could I when there are so many people with sharp ears here? I\u2019m scared when it\u2019s obvious that all kinds of criticism will come raining down on me. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin jumped in surprise at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s sudden suggestion, but everyone else clapped and welcomed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat of it? Honestly, I\u2019ve never heard your music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia stared at Colin, and Jun Hyuk added in,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t tell you to fix it, so let\u2019s hear it. Don\u2019t we need to see if you\u2019ve been playing around until now or if you\u2019ve gotten better?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Colin sighed and took out his phone, Jun Hyuk turned on the audio system and connected it through bluetooth.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s eyes were brightest as Colin\u2019s new song filled the living room. This alone shows what kind of music Colin is pursuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really my style. It\u2019s progressive rock. And the length of the song is no joke. Jun, how long is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c7 minutes 46 seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk said the time as soon as Yoon Kwang Hun looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s barely any lyrics\u2026 It could even be seen as an instrumental.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. This is my favorite song. I was going to make it a complete instrumental, but I put in a little for vocals. Like seasoning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mixed in Brahms. Can\u2019t hide that you come from classical music. The configuration is charming too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny gave him a thumbs up. Colin only looked at Jun Hyuk, who was not saying anything. He was waiting for the most precise evaluation of whether he has grown, stayed the same, or worst case scenario, gone backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that the drummer left. Isn\u2019t he just a hindrance to your music? I don\u2019t think he left because of a difference in music styles, but because he\u2019s lacking the skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was surprised by Jun Hyuk\u2019s comments and their eyes grew wide, but Colin was the only person to laugh bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s a part of it. I did push a bit. We did over 100 takes for just the drums while recording this song. We picked the best of those for this recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA drummer who can handle a song like this will hear that he\u2019s talented everywhere he goes\u2026 I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t easy to find such a talent. But to tell a drummer like that to shut up and only play the kind of music that you want? It\u2019s one issue after the other.\u201d Yoon Kwang Hun nodded at Jun Hyuk\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet. People in their twenties these days prefer consistency to outstanding performances. It\u2019s hard to find a talented drummer who can perform a colorful drum solo for more than 10 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at Colin and tilted his head. Colin\u2019s music is similar to 70s progressive rock. The difference is that he shows more refinement in terms of technicality, but that derives more from the system than from music.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut can you release an album with a progressive song like this? I don\u2019t think a record label would delve into such an adventure, unless it\u2019s an independent label.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I clash a lot with LA Sound. Eli and Alexander okayed the 1st album right away because you got rid of the progressive color with your arrangement. But now\u2026 whew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin said that it is a clash, but he is telling them that it is not so with his long sigh. They will be completely rejecting the idea of releasing his album.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was foolish when we were releasing the 1st album. I asked you for help because I wanted to succeed quickly and had a lot of expectations\u2026 And thanks to that, we got all the way here. I\u2019ve never forgotten how grateful I am to you. But I really want to fill the album this time around with my own music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun thought it admirable when he saw Colin\u2019s determination and thought about the fact that he is still in his early twenties.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Colin, you want to win and succeed with your music more than you want to continue your success now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Yoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good attitude to have. You need to do your own music if you\u2019re a musician.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun spoke and quickly shut his mouth. Right now, the living room is full of professional musicians. He is overreaching if he keeps talking as an amateur, and it will become an unnecessary sermon.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s sheepishness did not show because of Danny. Danny spoke sadly,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try a public audition? Didn\u2019t you say that your band is pretty popular in the west? You\u2019ll get a lot of applicants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did. LA Sound did a public recruitment, but I didn\u2019t want a single person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are you going to search through New York clubs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I need to go back tomorrow to keep going with my shows. I need to go to San</p><br/><p>Diego.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes widened at mention of a show.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you perform without a drummer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re scraping by with a session man. It\u2019s okay because we mainly perform songs from the 1st album.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin barely smiled and bolted up from the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s stop talking about me and do what we really need to do tonight. Jun, you remember back when we were in a quintet and drank at a strip bar until we passed out, right? We need to get drunk like that tonight, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had not been drinking, but almost passed out. Yoon Kwang Hun and Amelia\u2019s scary glares came at him like arrows.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

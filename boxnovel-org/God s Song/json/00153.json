A classical pianist who oversteps the abilities of a jazz pianist. They had also heard that he led students in a successful performance of Magic Flute.</p><br/><p>They will have to hold back on premature judgments but since he even has the abilities of a conductor, he is a complete and perfect maestro.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this too much showing off? We meant to listen to a few more songs but starting now, I think we\u2019ll need to buy tickets. It\u2019s too much to ask to listen to this for free.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia\u2019s interview wasn\u2019t an effort to push for her boyfriend. I see she\u2019s a lucky girl. To think that she receives lessons from a pianist like this everyday!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see why you aren\u2019t revealing the rest of Inferno. You have so much more to release. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>They started to ask about Jun Hyuk\u2019s short life until now. When he started with music, who taught him, and what his plans for the future are.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all are my teachers.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this sentence as a start, Jun Hyuk thought them briefly about his rough childhood, his encounter with Yoon Kwang Hun, how Yoon Kwang Hun recognized his talent and allowed Jun Hyuk to fall into the world of music. He also told them how he listened to CDs and soaked in the essence of that music.</p><br/><p>Everyone became lost in this story that could be out of a movie and when he was giving his evaluation of an album with a song as one unit, a few maestros were so shocked they could have fainted.</p><br/><p>Jun Huk\u2019s evaluation takes into account every single note and melody from each instrument, which is difficult even for them to remember. There is no way to describe Jun Hyuk\u2019s talent but to say that it is a gift from God.</p><br/><p>All of the maestros were just thankful that Jun Hyuk who had such a talent was standing in front of them today. There are a lot of youths who disappear without being able to show their talent. After today however, everyone would be expecting the music that Jun Hyuk has created until now and will be creating in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt says that Inferno is Symphony No. 1. So how many have you written after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they had witnessed Jun Hyuk\u2019s abilities, they could not help but be curious about his past works.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most recent symphony I wrote is No. 14.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c14 songs? What about others? Pieces other than symphonies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do have sonatas, concertos, and etudes for a few solo instruments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell us how many songs there are total?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should be a little over 60 songs for classical music. I used to just scratch them out, but I have been controlling myself since I started attending school.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who caught on to Jun Hyuk pointing out classical, spoke out,</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, you said classical? Then you work with other genres as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s pop music. Like rock, the blues, and jazz.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have 60 of those too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there are more. It has been easy to create those because the instrumentation is easy and they are shorter. I think there are about 100.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy\u2026 Didn\u2019t you say that it hasn\u2019t been 4 years since you started music? Are you writing a new song every week?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess so. If it\u2019s possible, I try to write music every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Three or four songs in a year. They had expected him to write at most 10 songs in a year. 10 is a tremendous number, but to think that he has 14 songs that are just symphonies.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you released any of your songs? Looking at your 1st sonata, it doesn\u2019t seem like the rest will be rubbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have performed a few of them at school concerts. But there isn\u2019t anything that I like enough to reveal to the public yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha ha. Look here, Jun. If you\u2019re thinking of releasing songs that you\u2019re completely content with, you\u2019ll never release a single song.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is a mistake that young geniuses make before they go out to the world. They focus on creation until a song that they are satisfied with comes out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you complete a song, you have developed that much. Then how could that song be satisfying? Unless you stop growing\u2026 you\u2019ll never create music that you\u2019re completely satisfied with. We\u2019re the same way. I\u2019ve never had a performance that I was completely satisfied with. Something always falls short.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk felt like the shortcomings that the maestros were discussing as if they are nothing, was exactly what he experienced. It had felt perfect when he wrote the note on the sheet, but something seemed to be lacking when he looked at the song as a whole. There had been many instances when he felt frustrated because he could not find a breakthrough in this shortcoming.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease the songs that you feel are beyond okay. And make sure you show all of the music you make to the world from now on. You can\u2019t always receive praises. You need to hear poignant criticism as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a life of creation that is full of the feeling of lacking. Finding out like this, he felt much lighter.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk forgot how tired he was because they were talking deeply about funny episodes and music. He did not forget to take pictures with everyone either. That night, the party went until dawn.</p><br/><p>Two days after the unforgettable party, Jun Hyuk followed Sir Simon Lettle and Sarill Petrenko to Berlin. He watched the Berlin Philharmonic practice and talked to each of the members, spending his time admiring the world\u2019s top class.</p><br/><p>Each of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic are good enough to be active as soloists. They are such recognized performers that in the off-season, they configure trios or string quartets to take on full tour schedules.</p><br/><p>Since each person is outstanding, the conducting is also different. It is possible to conduct in a way that shows that an orchestra can one perfect instrument.</p><br/><p>As long as he does not alter the tempo, they do not need to rehearse repeatedly when given the conductor\u2019s interpretation of the song and a few points to pay attention to. The Berlin Philharmonic is always in its best condition.</p><br/><p>Conductors also visited other cities in order to see Jun Hyuk. Jun Hyuk was having a great time talking to these people and thinking about how their respectable greats like Bach, Handel, Beethoven, Wagner, and Mendelssohn had an effect on traditional songs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the car, Jun Hyuk laughed loudly with a light heart. He could not remember the last time he had been part of such a fun performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s performance is going to go up on YouTube right away. A lot of the students recorded it on their phones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cViolation rights \u2013 What, is it a problem that like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that sensitive. It\u2019s just\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara recalled the concert and had a subtle look on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just? Ah, me singing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure that will become tremendous news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first measure I sang was off pitch, but it was plenty that I could handle. There\u2019s nothing special about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had a nonchalant expression as if it was insignificant. Tara had found out about Jun Hyuk\u2019s appearance on the audition program in Korea while looking up information on him. She also knew that he had become a hot topic because he was the only participant who had not been singing.</p><br/><p>She had been taken aback when she saw that Jun Hyuk singing on the stage as though it is nothing. She had thought that he did not like singing itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you going to do if the students in the audience hadn\u2019t been singing along?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course everyone will sing along when it\u2019s Chuck Berry\u2019s famous song. Don\u2019t you think I thought that far?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whatever happened, Jun Hyuk was extremely satisfied with today\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. Forget the other stuff. Today\u2019s schedule was a success, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019ll have 100 times the effect of an interview. \u2018Maestro Sings Rock n Roll\u2019. There isn\u2019t any outlet that won\u2019t use this great headline.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk saw Tara smiling brightly, he felt good because it was as though he had helped her out a little when she is working so hard for him.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was praying for the time to go by quickly in this place with such a different atmosphere from yesterday\u2019s performance. 20 minutes had not even passed in this lunch that had started at 1 in the afternoon. But Jun Hyuk had already cleared his plate.</p><br/><p>More than 10 elderly women were in a small banquet hall in the Boston Symphony concert hall and eating little bits of the catered food.</p><br/><p>They ate slowly and only wet their lips with their coffees. What frustrated Jun Hyuk more was that he could barely hear them with the way they speak.</p><br/><p>He would need to use a hearing aid to hear them exchange their thoughts on Inferno and classical music.</p><br/><p>However, the lunch took on an entirely different mood with one person\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, is today\u2019s news true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? What news are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe performance with the New England Conservatory last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes. It just happened like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you come up with the idea to perform Chuck Berry\u2019s song?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not criticism about how Boston\u2019s maestro could perform rock n roll. It was a question with wide eyes full of curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt fit the mood yesterday. The students drunk in jazz were looking at me, and I couldn\u2019t splash cold water on them. And I had fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Jun is taking on a variety of genres like rock n roll, blues, and jazz. I don\u2019t know if you know, but his performing skills are on par as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara, who was joining them for lunch, did not lose the chance to grab the sponsors\u2019 attention and praised Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cI used to like Bill Haley\u2019s music more than I liked Chuck Berry\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Buddy Holly was the best at the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo ho. The conclusion is going to be Elvis Presley anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElvis is great too, but the Beatles\u2019 musicality is on top.\u201d</p><br/><p>The women left the elaborate lunch on their plates and talked about old stars and their music. Jun Hyuk was no longer the object of their attention. The topic was their memories.</p><br/><p>When they were young, America was a completely conservative society. It was a time when rock n roll was considered music of vulgar hoodlums or the devil\u2019s music. They hid LPs from their parents and listened to them behind their backs.</p><br/><p>The British Invasion, an expression for when British music took over America, started in February 7, 1964. The Beatles zone F. The girls who had been screaming their names when they first stepped foot in Kennedy airport, are now here to sponsor classical music.</p><br/><p>Now they may seem to be people with luck as a lawyer\u2019s wife, banker\u2019s wife, CEO\u2019s wife, but they loved their idols more than the teenagers today and had passionate youths with rock n roll.</p><br/><p>The memories of their fiery childhoods are better topics of conversation than classical music or the young Asian genius composer.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk, now forgotten, did not have much to do but listen to their conversation.</p><br/><p>While drinking coffee and listening to them speak, he realized that they had experienced the music that he had only heard in albums with their bodies. They are now old women whose blonde hair has turned white, but they are the pioneers who opened the door to popular music.</p><br/><p>When their time to reminisce ended, the lunch also ended. After reminiscing about their pasts for a while, it was evident that they had a lot of fun. Their refined and elegant expressions have disappeared and they were only left with the passion blushed red in their cheeks.</p><br/><p>When a restaurant employee cleared the table, the sponsors pulled their checkbooks out of their bags. Then they wrote the amount for their donations on the spot and handed them over.</p><br/><p>There were no envelopes with bills that hid how much they were donating, and there was no immature battle over who would write a larger number on their check. They each wrote an amount that was fitting for their circumstances, and handed the checks over proudly.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk got a glance of the values of the checks and was surprised that they were not that high. The largest amount was just $10,000 and the rest were just a few thousand.</p><br/><p>Tara put the checks in her bag and jabbed Jun Hyuk\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for giving us your precious time today. The donations you made today will be put toward the new challenge that the Boston Symphony will take on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk recited the words that Tara had written for him politely and precisely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHo ho. Maestro, will you put the music that we enjoyed as youths in that new music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. If it\u2019s possible, I\u2019ll try to create a stage to perform with those people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meeting ended after Jun Hyuk kissed each of the women on the cheek. The sponsors now head to the concert hall to watch rehearsals. It is a benefit of being a donator.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara, drop me off at the park on your way back. I don\u2019t feel so good after sitting still and shoving meat down my throat. I\u2019ll run a bit before going back to the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that you have another appointment in the evening, right? Please make sure you\u2019re not late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara started to see Jun Hyuk in a new light because he was handling these situations better than she thought he would. He had handled today pretty well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. I know they are difficult appointments, but you are doing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk saw Tara smiling brightly, he remembered something he had been wondering about.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you think about the donations today? Is that much a success?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was thinking that the donations might have been reduced because of himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s someone who donated a whole $10,000. That\u2019s more than 30% of what Maestro Quinn and the former conductor brought in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Donations are smaller than I thought they would be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre thousands of dollars a small amount? Ah, well Maestro\u2019s income is so high\u2026.. With royalties, album sales, and everything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tara listed Jun Hyuk\u2019s income on her fingers, he blushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s not what I meant\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara saw Jun Hyuk quickly waving his hands and burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHo ho. I\u2019m joking, it\u2019s a joke. There aren\u2019t many sponsors in reality who donate tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk thought of sponsors, he thought that the basic was tens of thousands of dollars. But just from today, he realized that it is just the middle, no more no less.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost donations amount to tens or hundreds in a year. If they go into the thousands, they are entered into celebrated contributions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen is it rare to see donators who give that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there are a fair amount of them. But most of them are private sponsors, not people who come to these lunches and rehearsal previews. Only the people we saw today want this kind of gathering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then is the dinner going to be like those old women as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. They will be women in their thirties. They are not housewives but rather successful women, so it won\u2019t be boring. And just have a hard time today. For 2 weeks after this, you don\u2019t have anything in your schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s welcome news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had to run in the park again in order to go to dinner later.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

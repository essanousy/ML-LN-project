Inferno album and Amelia]</p><br/><p>When the Inferno album was released in mid-June, another craze came and went. When it sold 400,000 in just 1 month, it was estimated that it would easily sell 2 million and could even go up to 4 million.</p><br/><p>It is the result of hearing that it is an innovative song that opens the door to a new musical genre, even bringing in a customer base devoted to classical music.</p><br/><p>Once there were only complaints in the Amazon reviews online however, it changed to an entirely different angle. The general view and anger that they had spent money to listen to noise started spreading through social media. Due to the severe criticism of the public, the sales graph plummeted starting with the 2nd month.</p><br/><p>The classical single album with the highest recorded sales is Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras, and Zubin Mehta\u2019s live concert album, \u2018The Three Tenors in Concert: Live in Rome, 1990\u2019.</p><br/><p>It reached 12 million in sales and people do not have to be classical fanciers to have heard the music at least once. These kinds of stars are necessary in making a classical album into a hit.</p><br/><p>Even a person who has never listened to music conducted by Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s Karajan can recognize a picture of him with a face full of anguish. With this level of awareness, he was able to record an incredible sale of 200,000 albums.</p><br/><p>No matter how much critics give Inferno rave reviews, it could not win the one word \u2018noise\u2019 written on the internet and not even the jazz fans who had accepted Jun Hyuk were in favor of it.</p><br/><p>The Inferno album was not able to surpass 1 million in the end, and was pushed to the corners of shopping malls.</p><br/><p>Curiosity does not become a driving force for increasing sales. Inferno was forgotten by the public and was only discussed among maestros of their own league. The premiere is still left.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Amelia returned in the middle of July and was so shocked when she saw Isaac Stern\u2019s apartment that she yelled. The apartment she had heard about from Jun Hyuk was not so luxurious.</p><br/><p>She had attended many banquets held for people in the music world, and could guess what this apartment was used for. This is not the kind of apartment that they lend to maestros who come from different areas.</p><br/><p>It must be one of President Stern\u2019s several houses in New York, and a place used to hold parties.</p><br/><p>She could tell how much special treatment President Stern gives Jun Hyuk from the way he gave the whole apartment to him.</p><br/><p>She was also surprised by the piece he would be submitting to the Queen Elisabeth Competition. She had the same reaction that everyone else had</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, anyone who sees this is going to say that it\u2019s crazy. You\u2019re saying you want to compare with Beethoven?\u201d</p><br/><p>She saw the whole score and could not stop admiring with \u2018Oh my God!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? It\u2019s that bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s crazy because it\u2019s comparable. It would be normal for someone not to match up to Beethoven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia placed kisses all over Jun Hyuk\u2019s face and took the piano part of the score. She played the 2nd and 3rd movements, and got up from the piano.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to change the finals calendar around a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey always give 1 week to practice the finals song. But how can someone learn this in 1 week? There\u2019s no way.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is not a known song. The 5 piano and violin finalists are going to receive a tremendous and large song, and are going to have to show their ability. Amelia counted on her fingers as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI recorded Brahms\u2019 Piano Concerto No. 1 with the BBC Orchestra this time. I had already memorized all of Brahm\u2019s concerto, practiced it hundreds of times, and it\u2019s been included in my performance repertoires dozens of times. On top of that, we still went into rehearsal 3 times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia shook her head and asserted,</p><br/><p>\u201c1 week? Impossible. I\u2019m positive they\u2019ll completely change the competition schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey might not. It might look hard in the beginning, but they\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s easier once they get a little used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I couldn\u2019t tell yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you memorize the score, it suddenly gets easy. I kept the performers in mind and didn\u2019t leave any margin for error.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mozart\u2019s songs are not hard to approach in the beginning. Special techniques are not needed, and there are not severe changes. Just as there are a lot of famous songs in pop that use 3 simple chords, Mozart also created great music from simple melodies.</p><br/><p>As one knows the piano more and more however, it becomes harder to express Mozart\u2019s songs. There is a lot of margin for the performers. As difficult as Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano part seems, there is no margin.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I need to win in order for the schedule to be changed or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you joking? That doesn\u2019t even need to be said. Of course you\u2019re the winner.\u201d</p><br/><p>The starting point of thought is different. While other competitors go up against each other, he is going up against Beethoven. This difference is bound to chase the other participants out.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Amelia was fascinated by Jun Hyuk\u2019s special classes, which took place at home. She had never felt interest in anything outside of piano and music. Jun Hyuk on the other hand, kept asking questions and concentrated in his philosophy class to make it run over 2 hours.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, do you like studying that much? Doesn\u2019t your head hurt enough from looking at scores?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the total opposite. I can forget music when I focus on other things. It\u2019s better the more complicated it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how much the melodies don\u2019t stop in your head?\u201d</p><br/><p>She is realizing it for the first time since she started living with Jun Hyuk. There is a new melody and rhythm in his head every waking moment.</p><br/><p>When she first knew this, she could not hide her envy. But the second she figured that it might not be a blessing, she tried to help Jun Hyuk put his attention elsewhere as much as she could.</p><br/><p>This was also a factor in her saying that they could not leave such a large house alone and started inviting acquaintances over for simple parties every week. Because she knows Jun Hyuk\u2019s personality well, she did not invite people who are loud or boastful. Since she only invited conscientious people who know the paths that they are on, there were no loud parties that Isaac Stern suggested.</p><br/><p>Danny was also in the off season and came to New York when he received Amelia\u2019s call. He who had always gone around telling people that he is Jun Hyuk\u2019s roommate and best friend, had changed a lot over 1 year.</p><br/><p>After the Tchaikovsky Competition last summer, Danny had finished up the tour with the runner ups and had jumped into the world of professionals. He seemed like an entirely different person.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. I thought everything would work out if I made it into the top ranking of the Tchaikovsky Competition, but that was just the start. There are so many people running in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Amelia\u2019s been doing a lot of performances from even before the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. Before Tchaikovsky, she was mostly active in her home country Argentina. I\u2019m famous in Canada too. I came out on TV a bunch of times.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Danny kept sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia is of a different class from me. How many albums does she have out? And in Europe at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>There is no difference between Danny\u2019s circumstance and in Colin who is going around clubs and small concerts in the western region to make a prospective rock band known. He had only performed with a famous orchestra in a big city twice in 1 year. Even that did not receive the evaluation that it was successful.</p><br/><p>Instead, he is taking in a tight schedule of going around in small European towns.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to go out for the Long-Thibaud, Menuhin, and Queen Elisabeth next year and win all of them. I have a lot of experience now, so I\u2019ll be able to perform without being nervous.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was about to say something when he said Queen Elisabeth, but he shut his mouth. Amelia had blinked at him.</p><br/><p>For the sake of fairness, a win is canceled if the composer\u2019s score and win are leaked. Even if they are friends, he cannot commit a misconduct. All of the participants are putting their lives on the line just as Danny is doing.</p><br/><p>Amelia spent about a month with Jun Hyuk. Once the season starts in September, she needs to take in another packed schedule.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

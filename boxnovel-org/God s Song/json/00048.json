The purpose of vocal training is to find the right sound, not to teach you how to sing well. All I\u2019m doing is helping you to make the proper sound from your body as an instrument. The first step to that proper sound is pronunciation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vocal trainer Ryu Sun Hee\u2019s confident attitude and clear voice made the 12 contestants even more nervous. The best vocal trainer who had taught several famous singers.</p><br/><p>As they were already tired from spending all morning with the rigorous schedule they had been given by the fitness trainers, it was unnecessary to yell \u201cDon\u2019t use strength in your body!\u201d at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out and sing the song you\u2019re most confident in one by one. Sing the song you\u2019re best at. Don\u2019t do something hard or something you want to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was necessary to fix the voices they normally spoke with first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou try singing first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung was resentful of his body. He stood out wherever he went. After starving all day and running hard, a gentle song flew out of him gently,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother da~y gets further.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ryu Sun Hee grimaced at the first line of Kim Kwang Suk\u2019s \u2018Around 30\u2019,</p><br/><p>\u201cStop. It\u2019s not further, it\u2019s far.ther. You need to write the lyrics on a piece of paper and read it. Don\u2019t sing until you can read it accurately. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone sang in turn, but were torn apart in the introductions and had to start practicing reading the lyrics like Kwak Hye Sung. There were two people who did not hear Ryu Sun Hee\u2019s criticism. It was 1st place nominee Jessica who was receiving harsh training at Mango Entertainment and Lee Hae Jun who was only 18 years old but had started as a trainee when he was 13 years old.</p><br/><p>Since Lee Hae Jun found out he had to share a room with Jun Hyuk, he had been down. He was displeased that the only other contestant in his teens was already receiving celebrity treatment.</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun had been watching the rules of this industry for five years already. It was a place where he had to stay afloat amidst constant comparison with others. It did not leave his head that Jun Hyuk who was also in his teens was his rival. This opponent was too strong.</p><br/><p>It seemed the production crew had given Ryu Sun Hee advanced notice about Jun Hyuk who was up next,</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you don\u2019t sing. It looked like they are planning on highlighting the fact that you\u2019re going through a survival program without singing. You don\u2019t need to receive lessons, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. You can watch from the side. It\u2019ll help to watch too since these are the kids you\u2019ll be competing against.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had already been watching the other contestants\u2019 vocal training with interest. Singing with accurate pronunciation was the same as making the correct sound with an instrument.</p><br/><p>First, there was only correcting pronunciation. As soon as they were given lyrics, the practice room quickly became full of noise with the instructions to practice reading. They seemed like elementary school students clearly reading the text in new textbooks. It was surprising how in a room full of the noise of 11 people, Ryu Sun Hee could pinpoint any one person making even the slightest mistake in pronunciation.</p><br/><p>However, watching this interesting scene was only for a moment and the staff quietly took Jun Hyuk out of the room after taking a sudden phone call.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe schedule got messed up a little. You\u2019ll have to go with me right now to record.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRecord?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, do you remember the 1st mission from Star Week? Park Ki Young\u2019s song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe got a call that there\u2019s no time to record it except for today. All the other kids finished recording. You need to record your guitar instrumental.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really nothing. Anyone can just play it. Honestly, I don\u2019t really remember how I played it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just an accompaniment without anything special. It was the type of music that even a decent guitar session man could record easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. It\u2019s not that simple. Would we do it so easily when we\u2019ll be releasing it for digital sales? We\u2019re going to trim it and make it much more elaborate. I bet you\u2019ll find it interesting once you go and try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he got to the recording studio, the song he played for the mission was already playing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too weak. Try making it livelier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mix with the accompaniment. And lower that. That\u2019s right. Okay, stop it there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else must have finished recording their parts, but none of the people who completed the mission with him were present and five soundtracks were dancing on the recording studio monitor.</p><br/><p>The producer who saw Jun Hyuk and staff put out his cigarette,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh sorry. Can you wait a bit? Let\u2019s start once I finish this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk sat on the recording room sofa and watched the producer playing with all of the sounds through the equipment with interest. For an hour after Jun Hyuk arrived at the studio, they had not even finished the 1st draft of a 3 minute 40 second song.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 You see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk began to speak when he could not take it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh sorry. Will you wait just a little longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk jumped up from the sofa and put his hand on the monitor track,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, lower it by 1/7 at 77 seconds. At 96 seconds, I think you can just make this and this higher by about 3/10.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer\u2019s eyes widened at Jun Hyuk\u2019s input,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you learn sound engineering?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I saw you do it for two hours. This thing lets you see each voice, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s fix it like that and try listening. The part that stands out too much should have disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyone who heard a WAV file at home will know what a wave is. However, how could he pick out one point and modify it by lowering and heightening it? Even he who had been producing for 10 years could adjust the awkward parts but what Jun Hyuk was talking about was impossible. Fixing it by making by small modifications was all he could do. But how could he find exact modification figures like 1/7 and 3/10?</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The engineer adjusted the track as soon as the producer allowed for it. The producer\u2019s scowling face lit up when he heard the modifications again,</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething wasn\u2019t right, but this was it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer realized that the broadcast station music director\u2019s assessment of Jun Hyuk was not wrong,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey kept calling you a genius; you really are good. How did you figure it out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just knows by hearing it. It was something he had heard often. It was what people with talent always said.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Back to the states]</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk followed an employee who came to meet him at New York\u2019s JFK airport to President Stern\u2019s apartment.</p><br/><p>He was astounded when he opened the door and entered. It is grand but also incredibly wide. It is a 2-floor duplex apartment with a staircase to one side of the living room.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Hang on\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk quickly looked for the employee who had brought him to this apartment, but he had already closed the door and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>There is no problem staying in this big house alone, but he could not imagine how to clean it when the living room alone is the size of a basketball court. There are 4 doors that he can see on just the 1st floor. How many rooms would there be on the 2nd floor?</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took his phone out. It would be better to tell Isaac Stern that he should move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Do you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He heard the door open with a familiar voice. Jun Hyuk put his phone back. Isaac Stern walked over to Jun Hyuk and put his arm on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me if you don\u2019t like it. I can look into another place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. I do like it\u2026 but it\u2019s too big. Cleaning it is going to be no joke. I think it\u2019d be better to move to a smaller place\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern looked at Jun Hyuk\u2019s serious expression and burst out in laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell well. Ha ha. Would I really leave you to clean the place? Don\u2019t worry about it and stay here comfortably. A maid is going to come every day to take care of your meals and clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was more surprised when he heard about the maid than he had been when he saw the large house.</p><br/><p>\u201cA maid? I\u2019ll just do it myself. It\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Uncomfortable? Weren\u2019t you going to demand a personal chef? Why now?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern brought up what they had discussed in the private plane.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then I\u2019ll have someone come just once a week to do the laundry and clean. Is that fine? And come this way. You haven\u2019t seen it yet, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern pushed Jun Hyuk and opened one of two doors standing next to each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cI made this into your studio. There was a piano here for a maestro in our company who used to live here, but we moved the 2 pianos and instruments from your house here. And I prepared some other things I thought you might need. There wasn\u2019t enough space, so we broke into the next room.\u201d</p><br/><p>In that room were Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar, amp, 2 grand pianos, and drum set.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. Isn\u2019t that recording equipment?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could see wires everywhere with a console box covered in white fabric.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you\u2019re good at sound engineering too. It\u2019s not studio standard, but I left it so you could use it when you need to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sound-proofing is certain\u2026 It\u2019s great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see you like this room more than the apartment.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk saw the recording equipment, he suddenly remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. What happened with the Inferno album? It hasn\u2019t been released yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going out in stores around mid-June.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very late. I made it so that there wouldn\u2019t be any problem working on the album.\u201d</p><br/><p>They finished recording early February. Even with package production in mind, 6 months is taking too long.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe record has already been completed. It\u2019s coming out the next month because of marketing. We\u2019re going after the holiday season.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Boston Philharmonic needs to gain some attention from this too. They\u2019ve been receiving public attention since they revealed that you recorded in February, so that\u2019ll continue. It\u2019s all business after recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they came out into the living room, Isaac Stern went into the kitchen and skillfully made coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, did you rest well in Korea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I just kept sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t just sleep. You said you were going to rest. How did you think of coming up with such a masterpiece? You should really rest when you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern set a coffee down in front of Jun Hyuk, who just laughed, and settled into the large sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we talk a bit about the piece?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe piece? Oh, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe title is Concerto for Violin and Piano in D Minor, \u2018Choral,\u2019 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just ask one thing. Did you really write it with Beethoven in mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did it thinking about how the Queen Elisabeth Competition has the piano and violin, but I thought of the foundation as a choral symphony. The subtitle is \u2018Choral\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy Beethoven? Isn\u2019t it too much of a challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought of it as a challenge. I just started it because I thought it\u2019d be fun to work on\u2026 I guess that\u2019s how it turned out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFun\u2026 That\u2019s good too. Let\u2019s see if the world sees it as fun or as a challenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern could not stop smiling even as he drank coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe competition judges are going to be startled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe score itself is huge. Most entries are about 10 minutes. I\u2019m pretty sure this will be the first ever masterpiece of such a length. And\u2026 he he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern was about to speak when he started laughing. Jun Hyuk watched him with an expression wondering if senility had set in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry. I keep laughing when I think about the National Orkest van Belgie. I can\u2019t stop picturing them perplexed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Could it be because there are not enough members in the Belgian orchestra?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this piece wins in December, you\u2019ll have to go to Belgium right away. You need to go into rehearsals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the competition finals in April?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe difficulty is too high. They\u2019ll need to practice for a while in order to perform at the finals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSurely not. They are the national orchestra.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not \u2018surely not\u2019. I showed this to the maestro of the New York Philharmonic to ask for his opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he said the New York Philharmonic, Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes widened. His heart beat at the thought of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that he guesses 2 to 3 months. He can\u2019t say that the National Orchestra of Belgium is better than the New York Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the New York Philharmonic, isn\u2019t it Maestro Dimitris Carras? The Greek genius conductor who started at age 25.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s famous for perfect song interpretations. If he says two or three months, that\u2019s exact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he give you an assessment of my song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. How could he see a piece like this and not say anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s sparkling eyes and thought of Dimitris Carras\u2019 sparkling eyes when he first saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s score.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only showed him the score at first. I didn\u2019t say your name. He didn\u2019t say anything for a while and then after praising it a ton, do you know what he said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was anxious to hear what the undeniable top maestro of the century said about his own work.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that 2 geniuses will lead the world of music in the 21st century. Composer of \u2018Inferno\u2019 Jun and the person who created this new \u2018Choral Concerto\u2019. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s flushed cheeks and realized that this young genius still does not have certainty regarding his own work. There must be various reasons, but he thought that the biggest reason might be that his standards for pieces are too high.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that assessment and didn\u2019t tell him your name until the end. He was tremendously curious. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>This occasional child-like appearance from this man over 70 does not seem like that of an industry mogul.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait until August, since he has performances abroad right now. When he come back, I\u2019ll introduce you two. Get a chance to talk over dinner or something. Dimitris is also going to be shocked once he finds out that you wrote \u2018Choral Symphony\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern stopped laughing jokingly and his voice became low.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019m curious about. Can I ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with the pieces you\u2019ve written so far? Are you going to keep leaving them in Mr. Yoon\u2019s safe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a song that I really want to show to the world. I like making new songs more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity, but there\u2019s nothing I can do. Do as you please.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said that it is a pity, but his expression is not so. Artists do not want to reveal their past works the more they excel. Geniuses are those whose future works are more anticipated than their past works are.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you going to do until December? Do you have any plans? And I don\u2019t mean your intention to put everything into composing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have nothing to say if you put it like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been thinking that it would be good to make music since he has a good studio in his apartment, but there was nothing to include in his plans if he excludes that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll propose 2 things. Pick one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern sat next next to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first is traveling. I recommend South America. I want to suggest enjoying the freedom and nature of South America.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not really want to travel again after traveling Europe for 2 months, so his expression did not change. Isaac Stern watched Jun Hyuk\u2019s expression and spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other is studying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStudying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Didn\u2019t you receive special classes at Clayton? That\u2019s what the school said. They said that you were very active in that class. What do you think about starting it again? I\u2019ll invite a teacher to come once or twice a week. Not music but subjects like literature, art, and philosophy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk showed much more interest in studying than he did in traveling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t broadening the width of thought an extremely important element for people who create?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to make the decision now. Take your time to think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll study. The thing I actually regretted most about leaving Clayton was not being able to take the special classes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Then I\u2019ll get it ready. Just keep it in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern did not forget his last piece of advice as he was leaving Jun Hyuk\u2019s apartment,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. Don\u2019t be alone too much, and invite some friends to have some fun. Throw some parties. The best thing about having a large apartment is that it\u2019s great to have parties in.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

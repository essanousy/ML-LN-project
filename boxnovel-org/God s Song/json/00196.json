Why did you talk like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he picked up the phone, he could hear Yoon Kwang Hun yell. But the tone did not feel like a scolding. It felt like he was holding back laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about the interview? You saw it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I saw it broadcast live on the internet. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 The reporters asked relentlessly. It was annoying. So I just said what I was thinking\u2026 I don\u2019t know why everyone is making such a fuss.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk answered cautiously, there was yelling again. It was something he had not been expecting.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You should have just done it. You can\u2019t catch up with his piano sonata? Why so timid? You really don\u2019t think you could?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s a total uncrossable wall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. You have quite a few piano sonatas that could easily be put up against Beethoven\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t follow Beethoven\u2019s way of using one theme to create a song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk forgot that he was on the phone and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still have a long way to go before you\u2019re 50 years old. Work hard at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun and the maestros who know Jun Hyuk well were applauding the situation with laughter and looking on with interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. I guess you are afraid of Beethoven? You have one foot in and one quietly pulled out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was exhausted from taking over 10 calls full of jokes.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>While the internet was becoming more and more heated over Jun Hyuk\u2019s statement, Jun Hyuk was starting the first rehearsal with the vocal finalists.</p><br/><p>The vocal soloists gathered around a single piano in order to practice just the solo parts. When Jun Hyuk entered the room, Laura was the first to welcome him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. Congratulations on the win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLaura! Congratulations. It was the best performance. It\u2019ll be your time now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019ll be the time of the new Beethoven. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not surprisingly, it came up again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew \u2013 You saw the interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think there\u2019s anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it? Where did that confidence come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. That article was exaggerated.\u201d</p><br/><p>They could feel the 5 other soloists\u2019 eyes on them and quickly stopped chatting, blushing.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk quickly changed his expression, and bowed to the vocal finalists.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, congratulations on reaching the finals. And I apologize for having a personal conversation for so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hastily sat in front of the piano and spoke again to the 6 vocalists.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou practiced yesterday with Maestro Boulez? Then forget everything that you felt during practice yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>The finalists seemed to be a bit taken aback. The rumor was true. The rumor that the 2 conductors are performing with completely different interpretations of the song had leaked little by little through the orchestra.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, also forget Beethoven\u2019s choral symphony. I\u2019ll say it again, but it\u2019s an entirely different song.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk spoke, a thick voice spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might be possible for the orchestra, piano, or violin, but it\u2019s hard for singers like us to erase Beethoven. Isn\u2019t the song we\u2019re singing Ode to Joy?\u201d</p><br/><p>A male vocalist who entered the finals as a baritone looked a bit discontented.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lyrics are Ode to Joy but honestly, there isn\u2019t much meaning to it. There wasn\u2019t really anything else to put in, and I don\u2019t write well enough to put in my own lyrics\u2026 But I kept the meaning of the first verse of the lyrics. I\u2019ll tell you about this again later.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first verse of Beethoven\u2019s choral symphony is not Schiller\u2019s \u2018Ode to Joy\u2019. They are lyrics that Beethoven himself wrote.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe important thing is the feeling you have while singing. You\u2019ll know when you join the orchestra for rehearsal soon, but it is really aggressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>During practice yesterday, Maestro Boulez kept stressing \u2018elegance\u2019. It is \u2018aggressiveness\u2019 today?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I have to express it in one phrase, it would be like a war song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWar song?\u201d</p><br/><p>The baritone\u2019s face became an expression of doubt. It is hard to find war in the first verse that Jun Hyuk had said was important.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s not a song that is showing the joy of victory. The entire 4th part is in the midst of a battle. You are all warriors. You\u2019re warriors who become excited at the sight of blood. That\u2019s the kind of thought you have to have while singing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it in symmetry with the 2nd part?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura watched the other soloists and spoke cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes flashed as he looked at Laura.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suddenly thought of it when you said that it\u2019s a battle. The 2nd part is the unrest of fugitives, or retreating soldiers? The fear of people being chased? I got that kind of feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Did you get that feeling like practicing with Maestro Boulez yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Maestro Boulez said that the 2nd part doesn\u2019t forget humor. It was a completely different feeling and what you\u2019re saying is the feeling I got when I first saw the score.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk felt like he had discovered another side of Laura. Regardless of the fact that she has enjoyed singing from a young age, it is a talent to be able to look at a score and figure out the composer\u2019s intentions at once, and not practice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying the 2nd part is retreat and the 4th is a battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t? Did I get it wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura looked over Jun Hyuk\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHang on. Before that, can you tell me what you thought of the overall flow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you have to tell us as the composer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to know how you took it. Everyone, tell me what you thought of the parts before, not just the 4th. There\u2019s no such thing as a correct answer, so please speak frankly.\u201d</p><br/><p>As though they had been waiting to, everyone poured out their opinions but Jun Hyuk was only looking to Laura.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you said that it\u2019s a battle\u2026 With the analogy to a battle, the 1st part is a fierce battle, the 2nd is retreat, the 3rd reorganizing the battle line, and the 4th is the final showdown. Something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReorganization? The 3rd part?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. But it doesn\u2019t seem smooth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you think it\u2019s going smoothly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the trombone in Andante Maestoso in G Major, there\u2019s a viola with a dark and dismal atmosphere. Of course there will be individual differences, I felt an uncanny fear. They\u2019re bracing up for battle, but there\u2019s a dense fear of defeat. I think that the 3rd part is dominated by this kind of feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>She is impressive. There is no doubt that Laura had a fierce battle with the score in order to come up with an interpretation like this. This ability to interpret must come from her sense of expression, that is easily comparable to that of star vocalists without falling behind.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk however, hid these thoughts and urged the vocalists without mentioning it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to keep the emphasis on the change in the vocal and chorus part. I\u2019m sure you all saw the score and already know, but there is prestissimo and then the speed is suddenly reduced to poco adagio. And then it\u2019s vivace again. You need to handle this change in tempo well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at Laura again and continued with his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe overall flow is as Laura just said. I only used the word \u2018battle\u2019 to express the vehemence. Lastly, it is about the first verse of the song I talked about first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk quietly read the lyrics that Beethoven himself wrote,</p><br/><p>Oh friends, not these sounds!</p><br/><p>Let us strike up something more pleasant, full of gladness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink of the sagging shoulders of the soldiers who are participating in the final showdown. Hoping they\u2019ll have courage as they\u2019re taking heavy steps toward death, but the foreboding that they can\u2019t escape death. You need to express this complex state of mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The baritone, who needs to sing the first verse, swallowed hard. Starting with a grim resolution instead of joy! It is the first time he is experiencing such a thing.</p><br/><p>They finished their long discussion on the interpretation of the song, and Jun Hyuk played the piano. Everyone looked at their scores and created a beautiful timbre along with the piano accompaniment.</p><br/><p>Having lyrics could be the easiest way to express emotions. Happiness and sadness are relayed directly through words rather than a melody and rhythm.</p><br/><p>But when they are told to deliver an entirely different emotion from the lyrics, it is only an interference. Furthermore, Ode to Joy is a straightforward narrative and not a metaphor. The vocalists try to express the resolution as per Jun Hyuk\u2019s demands, but they keep getting lost in the lyrics.</p><br/><p>Before Jun Hyuk can saying something, the soloist realizes that he has not been able to bring out the emotion that Jun Hyuk wants, and often stopped the song.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be easier to experience it for yourself, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>After stopping a few times, Jun Hyuk looked mischievous.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try it out one at a time. First, Laura.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. What are you telling us to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Laura came next to the piano, it was evident from her expression that she was nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe same thing. Forget that it\u2019s a chorus and just think that you\u2019re singing an aria. The piano accompaniment is going to change, but don\u2019t worry because it\u2019ll match the song perfectly. Shall we start?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura started singing on Jun Hyuk\u2019s signal, while the piano only picked up the simple chord. But when it slowly started becoming more complex, the other vocalists began to get nervous.</p><br/><p>If it had been a battle where the piano and voice went back and forth, they would have been able to look on with interest. However, it was more like a scene from a horror movie where the beautiful protagonist is being chased. The surprised expression on Laura\u2019s face heightened this feeling as well.</p><br/><p>When the song was over, Laura was in a cold sweat and the watching vocalists let go of their breaths.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took his hands off of the keys and spoke to the vocalists who had been watching instead of Laura.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. You all sang along silently while Laura was singing, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had moved their lips and sang along silently. Is that not instinct for a singer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep in mind what you felt while listening to my piano and Laura\u2019s singing. That is exactly what I am asking for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura did not know the reason for Jun Hyuk\u2019s words and looked over the expressions of the other vocalists. As soon as they realized that the performance just now was for them, they looked more surprised than Laura did.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo shall we try it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk recalled New York Philharmonic\u2019s Maestro Dimitri Carras. He had surprised Jun Hyuk by using the method of being objective to prepare the Inferno performance.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk does not have time to tune the singers individually. He had thought of Dimitri Carras when he was thinking of how to tune these expressive people in one go.</p><br/><p>When Laura sang the song herself, the tension she had felt was excessive. It had been to the point where her voice was crawling. However, Jun Hyuk watched the vocalists\u2019 expressions and controlled the tempo and strength of the piano accompaniment to maintain the emotion he desired.</p><br/><p>After a few practices, the singers were slowly tuned into the way Jun Hyuk wanted.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

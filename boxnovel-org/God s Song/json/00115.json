Today\u2019s performance is completely controlling the pianist. Think of it as a rodeo. If you can\u2019t get it under control by the 22nd minute of the 3rd part, you\u2019re falling off the horse. Our crushing defeat. Obviously a crushing defeat for the pianist, and a failure for the performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The orchestra members could not believe that Jun Hyuk was comparing their performance to a rodeo before they had even started practicing. Was it any different than saying that they are improvising the performance?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can, look at me instead of the sheet music. It\u2019ll be a fun performance where unexpected situations might occur.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. This isn\u2019t jazz. What do you mean unexpected situations?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the orchestra members bolted up and shouted out. The limit for improv performances is normally 7 people. The performers need to sign to each other to start and end their ad libs and pass on the baton. Having members beyond this number makes it harder to send signals to each other, and it is virtually impossible in large numbers like an orchestra.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you don\u2019t need to worry about that. I can handle those unexpected situations plenty.\u201d</p><br/><p>After appeasing the concertmaster, he looked at the orchestra members again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere could be small changes from time to time during the performance. Don\u2019t be surprised and just follow my directing. We\u2019ll be following the score like a classical.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lastly, Jun Hyuk said what he was expecting for the end results.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 there\u2019s a big chance the performance will be a failure. Even if it isn\u2019t successful, that\u2019s totally my fault and I would like to tell you once again that it has nothing to do with you all. Then shall we start? You can\u2019t take your eyes off of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked each member in the eye and held the baton high.</p><br/><p>There was not an empty seat in the theater to see the freshman that the maestro had pinpointed himself as the conductor.</p><br/><p>The professors were of course there, but even the dean was sitting there with interest. They were not wearing dresses or suits, but casual clothing like jeans.</p><br/><p>When the lights turned off in the audience, Jun Hyuk and Amelia walked out onto the stage together.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk saw Amelia nervous and whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cPlay however you feel. However you want to. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the orchestra\u2019s melody, the performance started.</p><br/><p>When the 1st part ended, the 2nd part started within moments. The observing professors\u2019 expressions subtly changed.</p><br/><p>It was fast.</p><br/><p>It was incomparably fast to Bruno Kazel\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>The orchestra members and Amelia could not hide their embarrassment. However, Jun Hyuk\u2019s baton led them without hesitation.</p><br/><p>As the ringing of the piano strings grew louder with small differences in the nuances, jun Hyuk looked at the cellist and thrust the baton. The cellist relayed the strength he felt in Jun Hyuk\u2019s baton with his hand holding the bow. A thick and strong cello sound came out and the piano became calm again. The strings and winds were taking turns catching the piano that kept trying to fling out and by the time they reached the 3rd part, the piano was very stable.</p><br/><p>The 4th part started with a deafening piano where the orchestra and piano released all of their power.</p><br/><p>The professors whispered to each other as they spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 It\u2019s completely different than yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the piano a little unstable? She\u2019s showing an entirely different touch than she did yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But the 4th part today\u2026 I\u2019m sorry to the maestro to say this but there\u2019s a much more abundant sound.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little unstable, but it\u2019s hard to see a performance with such dynamics. It seems Jun exerts that appreciation on a live stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>If this had been a concert where tickets were necessary instead of a student recital, it was a performance that would have ended with formal applause. The feelings of the unstable pianist and orchestra were properly delivered as they had watched. But this is a school. It is a place where they could be satisfied with even a moment of music that made their hearts beat.</p><br/><p>When the performance ended, there was cheering and clapping like that of the day before. The difference from last night was that this enthusiastic response was directed at the pianist.</p><br/><p>It is because the vehemence of the 4th part had shaken up the students as they forgot the instability of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd parts.</p><br/><p>There was no after party as there was the day before. The people involved in the performance including the orchestra members were talking about the performance in the hall outside of the theater.</p><br/><p>All of the orchestra members had flushed faces because they rarely had such tight performances. It was as Jun Hyuk had said. It was not perfect, but it had been a fun performance where they were in a gallop without knowing when they might fall off the horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a very different performance from what is indicated on the score?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy thoughts are different. That much can be explained by the contrast in the conductors. The difference just feels greater because Maestro Kazel performed it last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the professors were exchanging evaluations, Bruno Kazel butt in,</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there something that\u2019s undeniable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kazel was smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a performance that undoubtedly revealed Jun\u2019s genius. Isn\u2019t it so?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the professors could only look at Kazel\u2019s mouth. The talent he had shown on a live stage was outstanding, but it was an exaggeration to say that he showed his genius. The stability of yesterday\u2019s performance. He had not been able to maintain the peaceful melody of the piano or orchestra through the 3rd part. What had Kazel seen in Jun Hyuk as a fellow conductor?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see the conductor\u2019s fingertips? Didn\u2019t it look like he was commanding the performance with a clear understanding of how the 30 minute song would unfold? When any of the members seemed to be on the verge of panic, he already had the baton directed toward them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to the maestro\u2019s evaluation, they remembered something they had forgotten. The show completed with an unstable performance until the end. It was visible that the orchestra and pianist were surprised, but the conductor\u2019s back had not shaken once.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Only the conductor was stable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018In my opinion, Jun is already a complete musician.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel could not get himself to say this aloud.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk and Amelia appeared, Bruno Kazel exaggerated on compliments again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh, future maestro. Jun who has reserved a lifetime conductor position on the New York Philharmonic. You were really great today. It was amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was not drinking alcohol, but his voice was loud enough for everyone to hear. All of the students there learned of the maestro\u2019s thoughts. Today\u2019s performance was a time to see how great Jun Hyuk is.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it was a failure anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A failure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel was still reeling from the awe he felt from the 4th part so he thought that Jun Hyuk was being overly modest, but the failure Jun Hyuk spoke of was Amelia.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk shrugged and indicated Amelia.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. A failure. A powerful feeling came out once or twice, but that was it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The failure was not regarding the quality of the performance. It was his thought on the goal of the piano concerto. He meant that he had not been able to raise the pianist up a level.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia, take it slowly. Pianists are always at war with themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel wanted to talk more about Jun Hyuk\u2019s conducting than Amelia\u2019s piano.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, will you get a coffee with me? Just the two of us. Professors, I would like your permission to monopolize on today\u2019s maestro.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kazel did not wait for the professors\u2019 response and took Jun Hyuk by the hand to the cafeteria to avoid other people.</p><br/><p>He drank a whole cup of coffee without speaking to calm his excitement, and started saying what he had on his mind,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, do you know what a real genius is?\u201d</p><br/><p>An unforeseen question. Jun Hyuk just blinked, but it was a rhetorical question that did not need his answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot forgetting something you learned once? Learning at an incredibly fast pace? Applying what you learned differently from how others use it? No.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel spoke faster. He was excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to learn. It just happens. You just know, you don\u2019t forget, and you apply it naturally\u2026 It just works. It\u2019s like a newborn calf being able to stand on four feet without its mother teaching it to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk could not tell if Bruno Kazel\u2019s words were to praise him or if he had other intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing here? Is this school crazy to be hanging on to you to teach someone like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was not praising him, but honestly revealing his frustrations.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you wasting your time here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kazel was the same even after hearing Jun Hyuk\u2019s response. He was sure that Jun Hyuk, like the professors, did not know his full worth. From what he had seen over the past two days, he was sure that Jun Hyuk did not need anything else if he just learned how to stand in front of an audience.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a waste! What can you learn from the professors at this school? Be honest. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve learned. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not learning, but in a state of getting to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What do you mean you\u2019re getting to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 Maestro, it\u2019s impossible for me to explain with my limited English.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk thought for a moment and opened his mouth,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that I know naturally, automatically? Yes, that\u2019s right. As you said, I don\u2019t need to learn. I can watch someone driving a racecar and know everything about racing.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is easier for Jun Hyuk to make analogies than to express something exactly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a racer who can determine a car\u2019s performance just by listening to the sound of its engine, figure out the state of the tires just from what I feel at my fingertips, and understand the car by the vibration I feel with my body. It\u2019s just\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what? What are you saying is the issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only drive on a race track. I can navigate the track faster than anyone else can. But I can\u2019t drive on a normal road because I don\u2019t know the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was then that Kazel could guess what Jun Hyuk meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to know that road at this school. A shortcut from New Jersey to Brooklyn, the highway I need to take to get from New York to Philadelphia\u2026 Those are the kinds of things this school is showing me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even for a pro racer, the best way to navigate an unfamiliar road is to ask someone. Jun Hyuk is asking about unfamiliar roads and learning the geography at this school.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that I\u2019m learning the way. I\u2019m just getting to know the way. And there are a lot of things that I\u2019ve come to know over a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel burst out in laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Not even a top F1 racer can navigate the city? Because he doesn\u2019t know the road? That\u2019s a great comparison. Your English is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kazel nodded as he looked at Jun Hyuk who thought of Clayton-Hoffman as a navigation system.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relief that you\u2019re not wasting your time here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mistake that talented youth commonly make in showing themselves in an unripened condition. They show this unripe state and forget it. How many of these kinds of youths had he seen?</p><br/><p>However, this clever young kid is not in a rush. He has a clear understanding of his shortcomings and is going forward one step at a time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was the only one in a rush. This is\u2026 a bit embarrassing. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>He laughed again and spoke to Jun Hyuk with an affectionate voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, if you come to know the way to Philadelphia, make sure you come find me. Then I\u2019ll let you know how to go out to the world.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

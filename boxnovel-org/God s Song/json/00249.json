Do you really want to show my damaged image to my</p><br/><p>fans?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Damaged? I think of it as the opposite. The</p><br/><p>cracking is the sound that I and the opera needs. If you still had the sweet</p><br/><p>voice from the past, I wouldn\u2019t have come all the way here. You\u2019ll be able to</p><br/><p>express the exact sound that I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat sound are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making an opera where beautiful arias flow out. There are</p><br/><p>countless works like that. I\u2019m going to make an opera where the characters,</p><br/><p>singing, and voice match up perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento felt passion in Jun Hyuk\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cA sweet voice for an aged big boss? Isn\u2019t that funny? This</p><br/><p>protagonist isn\u2019t a handsome prince or a king ruling a single country. He is an</p><br/><p>old man who has been shot before and always has death beside him. A person like</p><br/><p>that with a beautiful voice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento could not drink his wine and got lost in Jun Hyuk\u2019s</p><br/><p>passionate words.</p><br/><p>\u201cA young Corleone who sings in a cool manner will fill the 1st</p><br/><p>act. The sound that is necessary in the 2nd act where we can feel the flow of</p><br/><p>time is you, Mr. Argento.\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento started as the tenor in the Alfredo role of Verdi\u2019s \u2018La</p><br/><p>Traviata\u2019. The powerful, beautiful, and grand voice that had touched the</p><br/><p>audience at the time is changing into the cracking voice of an old man in his</p><br/><p>last work.</p><br/><p>It is as though he is revealing to everyone that his life is in</p><br/><p>decline.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou would be facing death in your last work. Is there a better</p><br/><p>exit than this? Are you going to disappear after performing lightly at charity</p><br/><p>concerts like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento had gladly accepted meeting with Jun Hyuk because he</p><br/><p>wanted to see the genius that the world was abuzz about, but also to give a</p><br/><p>mild refusal.</p><br/><p>However, could it have been a desire hidden deep within him to</p><br/><p>find a reason to stand on the stage with this opera?</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not pay mind to Argento\u2019s complicated thoughts and</p><br/><p>bolted up from the sofa, holding a stack of scores out to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the aria that Vito Corleone needs to sing. If you look at</p><br/><p>it, you\u2019ll want to stand on the stage. I\u2019ll be waiting at the hotel. Just give</p><br/><p>me a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put the score on top of the table and left the living</p><br/><p>room, leaving his last words,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Mr. Argento. I can keep a secret. I won\u2019t tell anyone</p><br/><p>that you got a procedure done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento kept looking at the score even after Jun Hyuk left. After</p><br/><p>staring blankly for a while, he picked up the score instead of the wine glass.</p><br/><p>\u2018Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018An offer you can\u2019t refuse\u2019</p><br/><p>The song titles are Vito Corleone\u2019s most famous lines. Argento</p><br/><p>started to read through the sheets slowly.</p><br/><p>President Stern was waiting anxiously for Jun Hyuk</p><br/><p>at the hotel. He felt better when he saw Jun Hyuk come in smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did it go? Did he accept?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not yet. But he will. I left the aria score with him. If he</p><br/><p>sees that and rejects it, he\u2019s done as a singer. We\u2019ll have to look for someone</p><br/><p>else.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gains more confidence over time. He means that he gave Argento</p><br/><p>music that he cannot reject, not an offer that he cannot reject.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long are you going to wait?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust until check out tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next if he turns us down?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk said a few names and President Stern made the order to</p><br/><p>check on their schedules.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then shall we enjoy this sweltering heat until tomorrow?</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s look out at the Mediterranean and watch beautiful women on the beach.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern dragged Jun Hyuk to the beach where he laid under</p><br/><p>a parasol and drank a refreshing drink.</p><br/><p>But unlike Stern who was happy, Jun Hyuk could not get rid of his</p><br/><p>weighted expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Because Argento might turn you down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Because of the other roles\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not seem to think that Argento might refuse.</p><br/><p>President Stern saw this and spoke nonchalantly. He knows what Jun Hyuk\u2019s heavy</p><br/><p>expression means.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. Don\u2019t think more about it and ask for help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else? Laura.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Laura Goldberg?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a supporting role, but it leaves an impact, doesn\u2019t</p><br/><p>it? It\u2019ll become the top aria of this opera? With something like that, Laura</p><br/><p>will do you this favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hesitated several times, but he could not get himself to contact</p><br/><p>her. She is already rising rapidly as a star. Her name has gotten too big for</p><br/><p>her to take on a supporting role.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t even apply for the audition. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how busy</p><br/><p>she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. She could have not participated because there isn\u2019t an appropriate</p><br/><p>role and she could have thought that you would contact her first if you needed</p><br/><p>her. She could even be disappointed that you didn\u2019t call her.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern took his cellphone out and gave his employee</p><br/><p>another order.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask her to contact you, so wait. If she calls today, it</p><br/><p>means she\u2019s been waiting for your call.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern was positive that Laura would call, and started</p><br/><p>looking at women in bikinis again.</p><br/><p>The phone in the hotel room started ringing as it</p><br/><p>neared midnight.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun? Wow. I was really surprised that you called me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She called that day. Had she really been waiting for him to</p><br/><p>contact her?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m in the middle of an opera in London. Once the London show</p><br/><p>is over, I have a solo concert in Frankfurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since releasing an album with Jun Hyuk, Laura is considered the</p><br/><p>most powerful rookie soprano and is ranked at the top of casting.</p><br/><p>When he heard how busy she is, he could not get himself to bring</p><br/><p>up his opera. How could he ask her to take on a supporting role when she is</p><br/><p>someone who needs to be doing solo concerts?</p><br/><p>While Jun Hyuk hesitated, Laura became frustrated and spoke up</p><br/><p>first.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Didn\u2019t you leave a message to call you because you</p><br/><p>have something to say to me? I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t call to ask how I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura knows that Jun Hyuk does not have the personality to call</p><br/><p>just to ask how she is. She thanked him many times because he basically brought</p><br/><p>her success, but he had only ever responded gruffly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just hard to say because it\u2019s a bit of an unreasonable</p><br/><p>request. Your schedule is so full\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Tell me. Didn\u2019t you call because of the opera?\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt much lighter because of what Laura said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to audition at all? No\u2026 There\u2019s no reason to</p><br/><p>audition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to, but how could I reach out first? All sopranos around</p><br/><p>the world are going out. I assumed there wasn\u2019t a right role for me</p><br/><p>because you weren\u2019t calling me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s almost all filled up. There\u2019s one role, but it\u2019s a</p><br/><p>supporting role.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSupporting role? Is it the chorus\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. Would I have called you to join the chorus?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk rushed to explain the role to her. He told her how</p><br/><p>important it is although it is a supporting role.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me know once the show schedule comes out. And send me the</p><br/><p>score right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>She blurted out her response without even the slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re accepting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Did you think I would turn it down because it\u2019s a</p><br/><p>small role? Who was it who helped me get here? I always repay my debts. And I\u2019m</p><br/><p>telling you in advance that it\u2019ll be the same going forward. Tell me any time,</p><br/><p>no matter how small the supporting role is. If you call, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk ended the call and felt he had let go one of his big</p><br/><p>worries.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s more loyal than she seems.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much time is there for me to practice on my</p><br/><p>own?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much time is there left until rehearsals?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is about 2 months.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk picked up the ringing phone early in the morning,</p><br/><p>Argento\u2019s questions poured through.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Then will you be able to direct for me for 2 months? At my</p><br/><p>house?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk bolted up from his bed and adjusted the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. That\u2019s actually what I wanted to ask of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Well, it seems like you\u2019re really out to get me. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk went to check on his schedule with President Stern.</p><br/><p>\u201c2 months is too much. You can\u2019t just cling to Argento. Starting</p><br/><p>in a month, you need to check on everything including from the singers, stage</p><br/><p>sets, to the lights. You\u2019ll be so busy you won\u2019t even have time to lift your</p><br/><p>head. End it in a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then I\u2019ll spend that time at the least at Argento\u2019s house.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern went through his entire schedule and stated firmly</p><br/><p>that he cannot stay with Argento for more than 1 month.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done working on the songs, so it\u2019ll be enough time</p><br/><p>for the cast to practice on their own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk packed a bag that day and went into Argent\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>After spending just 1 day with Jun Hyuk, Argento began exercising</p><br/><p>again. He realized right away that this young composer would push his limits to</p><br/><p>get what he wants. And those limits were only getting higher.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After 1 month, the major cast and officials for</p><br/><p>the Godfather opera gathered in Milan, and the stage in La Scala Teatro was</p><br/><p>full of advanced equipment.</p><br/><p>La Scala Teatro was remodeled under Toscanini\u2019s direction in March</p><br/><p>of 1946 and there is an orchestra that is well-tuned to Toscanini.</p><br/><p>They had the most rigorous conductor they met since Toscanini, and</p><br/><p>was not able to spend a single day comfortably.</p><br/><p>How long has it been since there has been a premiere at La Scala?</p><br/><p>Everyone memorized and practiced the scores that they were seeing for the first</p><br/><p>time, but Jun Hyuk, the young composer and conductor, did not seem to know</p><br/><p>satisfaction.</p><br/><p>They thought the opera would have the feeling of the movie because</p><br/><p>they heard that the movie\u2019s main theme song would be used, but the movie theme</p><br/><p>song was just an intermezzo.</p><br/><p>The opera Godfather is a true Italian opera that expresses the</p><br/><p>tragic beauty of death.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

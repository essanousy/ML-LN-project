Do you compose as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Do you want to play something? Something you wrote.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk sat in front of the piano without hesitation. He shook his stiff fingers a few times and started playing the piano.</p><br/><p>Plink~ plink.</p><br/><p>The song began with a repetition of two simple notes that continued for a time. After he sped up and built suspense, there was the hearty sound of the piano filling the room.</p><br/><p>The sound that filled the room disappeared in moments as though it was sucked back into the piano, and the song ended with one low note that laid across the ground.</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin who had been drunk in the sound of the piano for 2 minutes clapped and rubbed Jun Hyuk\u2019s face, pulling him into a hug.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpressive. There really was something else so you don\u2019t have to become a pianist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 this is a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>An old woman making contact was uncomfortable not just for Jun Hyuk, but for any teenage boy. Jun Hyuk tried to wriggle out, but the old woman was strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? This is when I get to hug a handsome young man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Hwang Suk Min did not hide his surprise either.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought it was impressive when I saw you arrange a song, but I guess that was nothing. Goodness. There really was something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was delighted with their compliments and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin put her thumb up as Jun Hyuk had,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard such a lively song since Chopin\u2019s Dog Waltz. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwang Suk Min still looked surprised when he spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the title of this song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA Scherzo for you who has difficulty eating a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s difficult to eat a meal? What does this mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wrote this while watching a stray cat tear open a garbage bag to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Stray cat? Ha ha. It\u2019s the perfect title. You have great sense as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin clapped as she began to laugh loudly. She thought the title was fun, but also liked that he could create music from such trivial matters.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk recalled when he created this song.</p><br/><p>A stray cat that had been watching a garbage bag from under a parked car in front of the cafe. It needed to be swift and alert to seek its prey as if a wild beast, keeping watch all around it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did it end all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwang Suk Min was asking in analysis as a conductor does,</p><br/><p>\u201cA cat doesn\u2019t run away even if a person appears while it\u2019s eating garbage. It stops eating and watches the person until it can check whether the person is just passing by or is going to chase it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I looked at you wondering why it ended so suddenly\u2026 It\u2019s a song that made the audience into the cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! If you felt that way, it\u2019s a success. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin sat next to a Jun Hyuk who was laughing in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, so you\u2019re appearing in an audition program right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to be a singer when that\u2019s over? Like an idol?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t be a singer because I can\u2019t sing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem like you have no intention on becoming a singer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty much. There are a lot of good singers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin lightly hit her head. She could see this surprising child\u2019s profile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, instruments are just tools you need when making songs? Whether it\u2019s the piano, guitar, or drums.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought wrong. You weren\u2019t just copying what you heard from CDs. You wanted to know what it would be like for a world-renowned pianist to play your song\u2026 You wanted to know that feeling, and to hear it yourself\u2026 So you cloned those pianists. Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s impressive. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was sincere in his admiration. He started to see this playful old woman, who could hear his self-composed song once and figure out his intentions, in a different light. He thought that he would need to purchase Professor Jeon Hye Jin\u2019s CD and listen to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo Sae Won didn\u2019t say anything because he also knew this. Then let me ask one thing. Why don\u2019t you play the piano in your own style?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I have my own style. For each song, there exists a pianist who can play it best. Those people\u2019s performances are much better. That\u2019s why I copy them. If I play it in my own way, it doesn\u2019t sound very good\u2026 and it kind of sounds like I\u2019m ruining the song\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s just a difference between individuality and expression. Who plays better or worse is meaningless. Each has individuality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if there\u2019s individuality, I\u2019m sure we would only pick one person if we had to choose. Regardless of individuality, a better pianist exists.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only pursue the best? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re arrogant or if you\u2019re confident\u2026 You\u2019re impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin had a feeling that she had guessed one of her thoughts precisely. This child could not live without music.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll be anticipating the music you\u2019ll make from now on. Feel free to contact me if you need anything. I\u2019ll help you in any way I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her expression and tone showed that she said this out of sincerity and not courtesy. Hwang Suk Min may have brought Jun Hyuk here for him to hear those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, make sure you go to the hospital every month to get a check-up. The body is everything for a musician. You can\u2019t have something happen to your hand. You have to keep checking while you\u2019re healthy. For someone like you who plays multiple instruments, your hands are bound to deteriorate first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll contact the hospital. You go when they call you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk politely gave the professor his farewell and left. When he came outside with Hwang Suk Min, the hall was full of students who had heard the rumor and gathered. Everyone had their phones out to take pictures of Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese kids! Practice like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Professor Jeon Hye Jin yelled at the students, she grabbed a student and brought him back into the practice room.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me about that kid who just left. What kind of kid is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor, you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking because I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The student told her about Jun Hyuk\u2019s past, participation on the audition program, and the issue that created news online.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After the 1st live stage was over, Producer Kim Ki Sik went to Yoon Jung Su\u2019s recording studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Su, I heard Jang Na Rae\u2019s track and it\u2019s so good. Even our music director said he predicts she\u2019ll be 1st place this week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great, right? I was really surprised too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you offered to scout her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but I told her to think about it more. She might get other offers after the 2nd performance goes out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Ki Sik brought up a difficult favor,</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you just scout her? Jang Na Rae is going to be eliminated this week. Save me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJang Na Rae was this week? I was under the impression she was going until the 3rd stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was supposed to. Lee Hae Jun and a boy from another agency were supposed to be eliminated this week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Hae Jun? He\u2019s pretty good too, but he\u2019s getting eliminated already? That\u2019s a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLee Hae Jun\u2019s going to debut next month as an idol. He\u2019s the main vocal there\u2026 They\u2019re thinking it\u2019s enough if his vocals are recognized twice on a live stage. Anyway, the agency of one of the people to be eliminated asked to have him advanced to top 8. I guess they looked into it on their own and the reaction was pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying the pushover is the one without an agency.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. What are we to do? But listening to her track, it\u2019s so good it\u2019s a waste to eliminate her.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Jang Na Rae does not make a mistake, she could give the best performance. But if she is eliminated? The viewer protest would be fierce. Though of course it would not go for more than one week.</p><br/><p>Producer Kim was not against eliminating Jang Na Rae because of the viewer reaction. He was just struggling to keep the program alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigning a contract immediately is difficult. I\u2019m thinking of training her slowly. Since she\u2019s young, she might want to gain popularity quickly. If that\u2019s what she\u2019s thinking, I can\u2019t sign her on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su was looking far into Jang Na Rae\u2019s future. Enough to flatly refuse Producer Kim\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened with Jun Hyuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk? Damn, I gave up too. The 3rd round is the last. He needs to get ready for the 4th performance, but he\u2019s saying he hasn\u2019t finished for the 3rd. I can tell he has no intention of doing anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim, you must be having a hard time.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was obvious what would happen if Jun Hyuk who had been the reason for high viewer ratings left. Producer Kim needed to prepare for that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he going to sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su could not hide his curiosity. From the way Jun Hyuk had directed Jang Na Rae, he instinctively knew how to express with vocals.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, I gave up. Whatever he does, the 3rd round is the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut his track record is great, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. His mission songs from the preliminaries are good too, but his piano from the live performance is incredible. It\u2019s topping all the charts. But I think the two versions of Kanon are the biggest waste. Especially the rock version. If we had aired edited parts of him playing all of the instruments like a music video, it would have sold better than this round\u2019s piano song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the rights to that. No one thought of this kind of situation. We didn\u2019t show the whole song on air\u2026 and it\u2019s just footage anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim looked as if he had lost out on something big.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. Hyung Joong has an agreement for those two versions of Kanon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Hyung Joong? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. For Jo Hyung Joong who only composes and produces to get involved in distribution issues meant that he was that confident in Jun Hyuk\u2019s music.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He handed a blank check to Jun Hyuk\u2019s lawyer to tell him to write the price of the songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? That cheap man? It\u2019s no joke. Well\u2026 he did listen to it himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. They agreed to go half and half in the end. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll release the songs as soon as Jun Hyuk is eliminated. They got footage from our station as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess Jun Hyuk is a goose that lays golden eggs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll be wild. Jun Hyuk will be able to make $200,000 or $300,000 in six months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe viewer ratings will plummet once Jun Hyuk is out. The kids this season are pretty much the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you for this favor. I\u2019m trying to make Jang Na Rae popular. She needs to take Jun Hyuk\u2019s place. I\u2019m thinking of pushing it to a battle between Jang Na Rae and Jessica.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBattle? They seemed to be close. The picture seems like it would come out well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two people who are close in a competition of good faith. There\u2019s bound to be applause regardless of who loses. However, Kim Ki Sik scoffed,</p><br/><p>\u201cClose? They hate each other. Where are friendships on a program where they have to step over each other? We just edited it so it seems that way. They\u2019re both clever. They pretend to care for each other whenever there\u2019s a camera present.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 anyway, I\u2019m sorry. Signing her on now is hard. If we rush a contract or pressure her into it, the end result isn\u2019t good. If it\u2019s not something she really wants, she\u2019ll lose her will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Ki Sik needed to create a new strategy upon Yoon Jung Su\u2019s refusal. He needed to review the contracts to ready someone to eliminate instead of Jang Na Rae.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

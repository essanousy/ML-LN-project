Jun Hyuk was not a simple aspiring singer, but a performer. He had accepted Jun Hyuk as a musician whose tastes needed to be respected and that he could not just be thrown a repertoire.</p><br/><p>When Nam Seung Hee and Kwak Hye Sung went into a small room in the recording studio, Jun Hyuk showed interest in the studio equipment he had been squinting at,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, can you make sounds even without an instrument just by using this machine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you can make almost every sound. If you prepare MIDI operations with the master keyboard, you can make the sounds with programs. You can\u2019t bring out a great performer\u2019s emotion or technique though. If you can\u2019t do as well as the machine you\u2019re a lower class performer, middle class if you\u2019re similar, and A class if you\u2019re much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk seemed to be disappointed that perfect music was impossible with a machine.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Are you interested? I guess you want to try producing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s not it. A few days ago, I was at a different studio to record a mission song from the qualifiers\u2026 and I saw them fixing the music and making new sounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Studio equipment can do just about that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just wondering. I was thinking I could make the symphony I wrote, but I guess that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Symphony?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve made a few, but I always wanted to be able to hear one of them. There\u2019s no orchestra willing to perform a symphony that I made.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong remembered a call he had with judge of Tomorrow\u2019s Star, Yoon Jung Su.</p><br/><p>[A kid named Jun Hyuk is in your group, right?\u201d]</p><br/><p>[Yeah, why? You know him?]</p><br/><p>[Watch him with care. He might be an amazing genius.]</p><br/><p>This was not the 18th century. It was not an era when teenagers tried to compose symphonies and write sonatas.</p><br/><p>It was an era when a few teenagers these days trained diligently to play the music that was created in the 18th century.</p><br/><p>But here was a teenager who made a symphony without ever receiving proper education or training in classical music.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you bring your score? For the symphony?\u201d</p><br/><p>It did not matter if Jun Hyuk\u2019s symphony was not a masterpiece. Jo Hyung Joong did not care if Jun Hyuk had just written something basic. The fact that he had written music for dozens of instruments that would have to play for 30-40 minutes was talent itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scores are at home. Why? Do you want to see them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. A symphony at your age? I can\u2019t believe it. What\u2019s the title?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give it a cool title like with old classics. It\u2019s just Symphony No.1 in A Major.\u201d</p><br/><p>This side of him was just a teenager. It showed that he wanted to show off his music.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. I guess if someone were to go through your works later, there would be several Op.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that what would happen? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I guess you have to make your second piece?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. The new one has to be No. 5 since I already made four. Three aren\u2019t that good though. Even I can tell that I was trying too hard with those.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong had to wrestle with his work for at least a month to make a pop song that went just over three minutes. The work itself for a symphony was different. Moreover, for four symphonies. Even if they were rubbish, it was important that he had written four.</p><br/><p>On top of that, one of them was good enough that he wanted to hear it performed. How did he have to understand this?</p><br/><p>This was not the end. Jun Hyuk\u2019s continued boasting brought him from being surprised to shocked,</p><br/><p>\u201cI only really like one of the symphonies, but I like most of the ariettas I made for the piano and violin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you saying that you\u2019ve written other songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. For piano songs\u2026 um\u2026 I think I have 20? I have around the same for the violin too\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>While Jun Hyuk was trying to count the number of pieces he had on his fingers, Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>He had heard that it had only been two years since Jun Hyuk started music. The reality was that there had to be less than 10 people in Korea who composed 20 songs even after majoring in classical music.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many songs have you made until now? Is that it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just telling you about the classical\u2026 70 or 80 for pop music? Of course the ones I actually like don\u2019t make up half of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have scores for all of those as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pop music composer Jo Hyung Joong wanted to see those scores immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re all at home. I wanted to toss the ones I didn\u2019t like, but my boss told me I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour boss? Oh, at the cafe you work at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Though I hardly do any work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you working while you eat and sleep there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do eat and sleep there but I don\u2019t work. All I do is clean and open the doors in the morning, and close the doors and clean at night. I spent the rest of my time in the practice room my boss made for me in the basement writing songs and playing music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou even had a practice room? What instruments did you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk became excited as soon as Jo Hyung Joong asked about the instruments. He had only the best, so that was of course something to brag about,</p><br/><p>\u201cFor drums, he set TAMA and SABIAN. Fodera for bass, and for the electric guitar, I have a PRS (Paul Reed Smith), Custom, and two James Tayler BuringWaters. Yamaha for the piano.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was listing instruments that would be in a professional band.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re saying you have all of those?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. And the AV receiver in Yamaha while the amp is MESA/BOOGIE). Oh right, the speaker was normally for the cafe but my boss gave it to me. He said it was something really expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! That\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. My boss prepared everything for me saying that my instruments and equipment needed to be expensive and good.\u201d</p><br/><p>This kind of investment for one teenager to have was excessive. Jo Hyung Joong began to wonder what kind of person the cafe owner was. How could a man who was being torn apart on the internet as some villainous slave driver be willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on one teenager no matter how talented he seemed to be? It did not make sense.</p><br/><p>\u2018Typical. You can\u2019t believe what you read on the internet.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong began to feel bad for the cafe owner whose face he did not even know.</p><br/><p>As Jun Hyuk carefully raised a question to Jo Hyung Joong who had been lost in thought, he forgot all about the cafe owner,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, will you take a look at my score?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Symphony No. 1?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll get it from my dorm tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 yeah. Let\u2019s see it. I\u2019m actually not an expert in classical, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a good song if I say it is? If it\u2019s so good that even someone who isn\u2019t an expert says it\u2019s good? And if I can, I\u2019ll show that score to someone I know in the classical field.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes widened when he said that he would show the score to someone in the classical field. It could be the first chance to have his music assessed by an expert.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk knew Yoon Kwang Hun had limitations. Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s understanding of music was incomparable to the average person, but it stopped at that of a music lover and mania.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun himself knew his own limitations and evaluated Jun Hyuk\u2019s music less and less. If he could get the opinion of an expert, he could verify if he really had the talent that Yoon Kwang Hun kept assuring him of.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

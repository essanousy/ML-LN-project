Why are you here instead of the operas?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay. The performing team is entirely settled. We\u2019re done with the shows in Italy, including the ones in Rome. I saw them off to Germany, so there\u2019s no problem even if I\u2019m not there. Our employees are always with them, so they\u2019ll contact me if there are any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>The recordings of Jun Hyuk\u2019s opera \u2018Godfather\u2019 are selling out every day and is trying to reach record breaking sales. Once the European performances are over, there is a tight schedule waiting for them in North America.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd once the world tour is over, we\u2019re going to work on the album and film with the original cast. We\u2019ve already finished discussing it with Mr. Argento. He wants to leave a record of his last work. Jun, that\u2019s okay, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We have to do Argento\u2019s last work together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t come all the way here with your employees to talk about that, have you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia blinked her sleepy eyes and put coffee down on the living room table.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. That\u2019s what was important.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern looked at the employees he came with, and they prepared a portable beam projector and several documents.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well to what these people are explaining. It\u2019s a headache for me, too. Because of you. Begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The beam projector filled a side of the wall with complicated numbers.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just Maestro\u2019s income for this year. This is a first for us as well, so we\u2019re coming up with a plan with our tax lawyers\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Stern Corporation staff member shook his head and smiled mysteriously. This strange expression could be understood by his following explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst is the item related to Maestro\u2019s album and concert with Alvin Lee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Various records on the album appeared on the white wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are Billboard standards. The album was charted 1st place for 16 weeks. 4 songs hit No. 1 and all 12 songs took 1st place in turn in the online store.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern looked satisfied while thinking of next year\u2019s Grammy Awards.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, Alvin\u2019s band finished their concert in 32 cities and they\u2019re still in the middle of their tour.\u201d</p><br/><p>He brought up an Excel file full of numbers on the monitor.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust look at the last item. It\u2019s the amount you made on the album and shows alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at the wall and did not get a real sense of the size. The staff saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s expression of surprise and smiled because it is not yet time for him to be surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurprising, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the peak sales volume for single albums of the recent 10 years. You\u2019ve brought back the wind towards buying records instead of downloading tracks. And\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>A new number appeared and the staff continued his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is your income for the music you released before and album sales. It doesn\u2019t fall behind Alvin Lee\u2019s album.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s jazz album in particular is settling as a steady seller.</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly\u2026 First, I ask you not to be surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a list of 25 songs with clear sales ranking. The top 5 songs were A, E, I, O, U. And the other 20 were the scores that Jun Hyuk revealed.</p><br/><p>It is about the original song fees and royalties.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, we only revealed 20 songs as a test. We chose 20 at random. You probably noticed, but these numbers are the sales for right of use and royalties for each.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia looked at the numbers with the most surprise and almost spilled her coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since we revealed the 20 new songs. Though it was just the scores without even albums or shows, all producers and agencies that succeeded with the 5 songs before all signed on without exception.\u201d</p><br/><p>The previously released 5 songs had Laura\u2019s album and a show at Carnegie Hall, and had become news. There were a lot of places that wanted to use the original songs because there is a record that they can confirm for themselves.</p><br/><p>However, no one had expected that there would be such a reaction from just releasing scores with melody lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cHang\u2026 hang on. This number isn\u2019t wrong right now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It is exact.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff laughed at the surprised Amelia, and continued explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, you have surpassed Madonna and become the top earning musician. It is $7.4 billion in total, though there is still 1 month left for the year to end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madonna and Michael Jackson, who are the same age, lived entirely different lives but their final goals were the same. They are both icons of American culture. Michael Jackson became a legend and Madonna is continuing to create her legacy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadonna is including her merchandise sales, perfume business, and the money she made in investments. Maestro, that\u2019s what you made through just music. Even still, you\u2019re 7 times Madonna in 2nd place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overwhelmingly ahead of all stars in film and sports, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern already knew the number, but he even felt fear whenever he saw it. The staff member explained where the fear stems from.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe biggest problem is that this is just the start. The companies that pay for use haven\u2019t been able to finish arranging or recording yet. There will be a lot of music that uses these original songs next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff is saying that the true revenue is starting next year. Next year when music that uses Jun Hyuk\u2019s original song comes pouring out, a tremendous amount of royalties will come in and it is easy to predict that the income will be incomparable to what has come in now.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to delay on releasing the rest of the scores. Hitting jackpot has to be to a certain point to be fun, too. This is to the point where it\u2019s scary. We might be able to do something if it were a company, but this is just personal revenue.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is why President Stern said that he had a headache. It is the company\u2019s job to help its musicians reduce tax payments. Jun Hyuk barely spends his money, so there is a tax bomb that follows the revenue bomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe estimate that it\u2019ll be over $20 billion next year. Your income can be compared to that of a record label instead of other musicians.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what are you going to do with this money?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern laughed as he asked, and Jun Hyuk was speechless, only looking at Amelia.</p><br/><p>She blinked her big eyes and just looked at Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do really\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk stammered and Amelia started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? It\u2019s such an unrealistic amount that you don\u2019t get a feel for it. And you really don\u2019t have anywhere to spend it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you have to spend some before the year ends. It\u2019s good to buy a mansion or something. Though that won\u2019t make a big difference or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if he purchases a giant mansion, it wouldn\u2019t chisel away at his money. But Amelia\u2019s eyes sparked at the mention of a mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is one thing that does come to mind for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What comes to mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia bolted up and opened the door to the recording studio.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk bolted up and hugged Amelia as he smiled brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. Make a studio for me. One big enough to record a choral concerto. A studio with a perfect sound system. I want a recording studio comparable to Carnegie Hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia and President Stern shouted out at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? That\u2019s not it? You weren\u2019t talking about creating a perfect studio?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was puzzled by Amelia\u2019s surprise. Amelia\u2019s action had clearly referred to the recording studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was\u2026 but not to that scale. I just meant for you to make a normal studio.\u201d</p><br/><p>There needs to be a recording booth that fits at least 200 people for Beethoven\u2019s choral concerto. When thinking of the microphones necessary for this, it is basically like creating a stage performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really want to create a recording studio that can fit an entire orchestra?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked like a child with a new toy.</p><br/><p>\u201cA large studio\u2026 That looks like an investment and not like you\u2019re spending money. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the kind of large studio that Jun Hyuk is asking for, there will be a fair amount of orchestras requesting to use it. Of course requests won\u2019t be frequent enough to earn back the amount invested.</p><br/><p>However, President Stern\u2019s first thought was not that it is an investment simply to make money, but that it is a cultural investment for music overall.</p><br/><p>Of course Jun Hyuk had not said that he wanted the studio with this kind of deep thought. It is so that he can call in the New York Philharmonic if he needs to in order to create the music he wants.</p><br/><p>Recording in studio instead of in live performances makes it possible to re-record at any time. President Stern started fleshing out Jun Hyuk\u2019s request in his head. He is thinking of something like the Performing Arts Center facilities at the Kennedy Center. As he was imagining it, he had an ominous foreboding.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of living in that great studio to just spend the rest of your life creating music there, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk could not answer President Stern\u2019s sudden question immediately. The jaws of Amelia and the company staff who saw this, dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew. I thought so.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern frowned and let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make that perfect studio that you want. But you can\u2019t think of it as a home.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern look Jun Hyuk straight in the eyes and became resolute.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no intention of watching you become like a music-producing machine, locked up in the studio, looking only at sheet music. My skin crawls just thinking about it. Live like a normal star. If it\u2019s hard to live like a star, live like a normal person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk flinched at President Stern\u2019s seriousness, and pat his shoulder as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay. Well\u2026 You\u2019re so scary I can\u2019t say anything. Relax, Isaac. I\u2019ll live like every other star.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had suddenly become light.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then tell me. What do Americans do when they get rich?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what do you they do? They use it. They build a giant mansion, get a private plane, buy dozens of super cars, buy artwork\u2026 If there\u2019s still money left, they donate it.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern spoke heartily as he always does.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not everyone is like that. There are those who live in normal houses instead of grand mansions and drive Toyotas, living life like average people. It\u2019s just a matter of individual philosophy.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

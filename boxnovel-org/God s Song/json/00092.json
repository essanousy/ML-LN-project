No matter how relentlessly they asked for a comment on his performance, he just gave the simple response that he does not know and is sorry.</p><br/><p>If there was anything that they got out of him, it was what was to come in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen if an agency calls, do you intend to sign a contract and continue your activities in music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t know about an agency. There is a promise I made with Teacher Jo Hyung Joong\u2026 We said we\u2019d release a record.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA record? Then it\u2019ll be your debut album?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit much to say it\u2019s a debut album. It\u2019s just to commemorate I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCommemorate? Are you saying you\u2019re going to produce an album before going to study abroad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided on studying abroad yet. We\u2019re going to make our decision slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>All they got from the interview was that he would be making an album. Jun Hyuk\u2019s producer, Kim Jong Suk, gave a better analysis of last night\u2019s events.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim. You had a hard time yesterday? He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really\u2026 You took 10 years off my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Kim Jong Suk suddenly appeared at the station, Producer Kim Ki Sik made a fuss.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat 10 years\u2026 I\u2019m sure you hit the highest viewer ratings. Don\u2019t you need to buy me a drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had gone back and forth between heaven and hell, but they had recorded the best ratings at 17%.</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk made a request to the music director to see Jun Hyuk\u2019s videos from the day before, and carefully watched all of the videos of Jun Hyuk\u2019s rehearsal and performance from different angles.</p><br/><p>The music director rewatched the rehearsal video and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really impressive. How did you get this out of Jun Hyuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? The rehearsal is his real image. What a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s an overlap with folk singers from the 60s and 70s. Though I\u2019m sure kids these days won\u2019t buy into it\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. That\u2019s enough. I think a good song will come out after time passes and Jun Hyuk is a little older. Whether he sings or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim who was watching from the side was more curious about something other than the music.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what happened? Can you guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 roughly. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right or wrong though.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men just looked at Kim Jong Suk\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s normal during the rehearsal. And it\u2019s the image that I had wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then what happened on the stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that either. But this is what I\u2019m thinking. Don\u2019t you think he saw his own image instead of his mother while he was singing on stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis own image?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. His abandoned self. He saw himself as an infant being abandoned through the eyes of his mother singing the song. Don\u2019t you think it could be that his singing became rough and he saw himself pathetically because he saw himself thrown away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Ki Sik had been expecting a grand secret and could not understand. The music director on the other hand, nodded lightly and showed sympathy. Only the singer can know the emotions he felt while he was singing, but they could make various interpretations as the listeners.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I guess this is Jun Hyuk\u2019s first and last image.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean his last?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I mean as young Jun Hyuk singing. You think he\u2019ll sing going forward after showing that side of himself? Though it might change when he gets older\u2026 Producer Kim. Keep this saved. It\u2019ll become incredible footage. If Jun Hyuk becomes a world-famous musician, these videos will become really valuable.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was then that Producer Kim Ki Sik realized that this video is the most expensive treasure they obtained from this season. Top stations, even international stations, would need to pay MV channel to use this footage. The fee for the footage of Elvis Presley\u2019s first appearance on CBS is $30,000.</p><br/><p>Though his would not be to the point of Elvis Presley, it would become a generous source of income if he even won an award in a competition.</p><br/><p>After Jun Hyuk was eliminated from the audition program, his fans swarmed to the cafe starting early in the morning. They looked around the cafe waiting for him to appear. Yoon Kwang Hun took Jun Hyuk and came out of the cafe. If they stayed any longer, he would be imprisoned in the basement practice room.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun stopped by the bank before taking Jun Hyuk to his house.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, why are we going to the bank all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to make an account under your name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? My account?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m going to move the deposit from your modeling contract to your account. We need to have one made for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Jun Hyuk had never earned money himself before, $20,000 is not an easily quantifiable sum to him. When he first saw the modeling contract, he had been counting the number of zeros on his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll start getting incentives from the songs you arranged and performed on the broadcast. They said they\u2019ll settle the amount every 3 months, so you really need an account.\u201d</p><br/><p>The average child would be putting the money he received over the holidays into his first bank account. That time is very late for Jun Hyuk, but he had earned an amount that children at his age could not even touch.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk opened his first account while receiving courteous treatment from the bank employees and was only able to escape after taking a commemorative photo.</p><br/><p>While they were coming home after, Yoon Kwang Hun wondered,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe modeling fee is $20,000\u2026 What do you want to do? Is there anything you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, I think you should just keep the money\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why should I keep it when I didn\u2019t earn it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you. I\u2019ll make money and repay your kindness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid. You think $20,000 will cut it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk started to stutter in surprised at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s retort,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m saying you should keep everything I earn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun smirked at Jun Hyuk\u2019s surprised face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you make $2million or $20million, I\u2019m going to keep it all. This kid! Lawyer Baek said it too. I used to work with hundreds of millions. $20,000? That\u2019s not even money to me. You use that as pocket change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun who had been joking until now spoke seriously,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve earned money. Don\u2019t save it and just use it. You\u2019ve never been able to have anything you wanted for 17 years. Have it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was walking with an apologetic face when he smiled a little. Yoon Kwang Hun did not miss it and asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is something. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the truth is\u2026 there is something I really want to get, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me. I\u2019m telling you to do whatever you want as long as it isn\u2019t anything bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA motorcycle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A motorcycle? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Music, star, model\u2026 Because of these words, he had been forgetting for a while that Jun Hyuk is a teenager who likes to look cool.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind? Is there a model that you have in mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk spoke excitedly because he thought that Yoon Kwang Hun would oppose it saying that it is dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, Suzuki? The rear shock absorber went up so\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>It is an age where bikes that race through traffic look cool. That is, before they see luxury goods.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to see what a real motorcycle is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA real motorcycle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. See the real thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun brought Jun Hyuk back to the cafe and got in the car to go to Seoul. Where they went was not a neighborhood motorcycle shop, but a blaring specialized dealership with impressive motorcycles.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are real motorcycles. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was already standing in front of a red motorcycle, speechless as if in a trance. It was so polished that he was scared to even touch it.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk stood staring at it and slowly reached a hand out to stroke the red motorcycle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDucati Monster 696. You picked a good one. Masterpiece of masterpieces. The shock absorber Suzuki 125cc is just a tractor. This is what you call a motorcycle.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Jun Hyuk\u2019s modeling fee, he would only be able to afford the Monster model which is the lowest of the middle level Ducatis. The bigger problem was that they are really monsters that are too powerful for a beginner to handle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, your father is awesome. Gifting a Ducati to his son.\u201d</p><br/><p>An employee approached the two as he started his small talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow \u2013 your son is really a model. He\u2019s tall and handsome. It looks like this one found its rightful owner.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee stroked the Ducati and looked back and forth between the bike and Jun Hyuk when he started stammering,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre\u2026 Are you Jang Jun Hyuk? Tomorrow\u2019s Star? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Jun Hyuk was so enwrapped by the motorcycle that he did not hear him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. But we\u2019re not buying right now. We just came to look today. He doesn\u2019t have a license yet. We\u2019ll come back once he gets his license.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, look all you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee called the dealership manager who had left while the two were looking at the bike. There was no windfall like the appearance of such a rising star.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, hurry up and call headquarters to tell them that Jun Hyuk is here. Don\u2019t we need to give him a lot of discounts? We\u2019re getting free advertisement.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

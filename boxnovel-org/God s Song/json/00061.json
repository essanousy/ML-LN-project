Our boss was that successful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was repeating the same question in disbelief as he ate the food they had ordered as room service.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Kwang Hun was the king of Yeouido. Everyone knew who he was.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey kid. You didn\u2019t believe me all this time? Wow\u2026 I feel betrayed\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 who would believe it? It doesn\u2019t make sense that someone who used to move hundreds of thousands of dollars and made over a million is running a cafe that doesn\u2019t even do very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Back in the day\u2026..\u2019 Of the adults who said that they had been really great back in the day, he had never seen someone who really had been. Jun Hyuk had not believed anything Yoon Kwang Hun had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut sir, were you really going to send me abroad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had heard that Yoon Kwang Hun and Professor Go Sae Won were looking into famous schools abroad where he could study for the first time at the press conference. He was grateful, but a little sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t tell you. Nothing is decided yet. We were just looking into it. Why? You don\u2019t want to study abroad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I do want to go, but it\u2019s scary\u2026 and I also get the feeling that I just want to lock myself in a recording studio and make music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho who was drunk at this point, emptied his glass and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. I was curious about that too. What is he going to study when you say he\u2019s like Mozart? Shouldn\u2019t he just go straight to releasing his music with a debut? I thought you said music was just spilling out of his head. What more can he learn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so ignorant. You don\u2019t think Mozart learned the theories of music? Mozart\u2019s father, Leopold Mozart, was a famous piano teacher in Salzburg. Do you know how many books he wrote on music? Mozart was home schooled on music from an impressive teacher from birth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun was also drunk,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk\u2019s lacking theory the most. He needs to know the theories to get the notes of the music spilling out of his head more elaborately so he can make music. No genius can make music without knowing the theories. I\u2019m sure understanding it will be quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Isn\u2019t a genius someone whose music is naturally made to the theories? What are you going to do if learning the theories messes up Jun Hyuk\u2019s talent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men kept speaking their opinions. To Jun Hyuk, this just looked like a drunk banter.</p><br/><p>Adults fought over useless things when they drank too much. He did feel good that there were now two adults who worried about his future.</p><br/><p>While their voices grew louder, Jun Hyuk was lost in thought.</p><br/><p>Did he need to learn theory? Would the music in his head become more stylish if he learned the theories?</p><br/><p>No. Good music, stylish music, what could this be? What was Teacher Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s method to making stylish music?</p><br/><p>These thoughts kept coming up in Jun Hyuk\u2019s mind without rest.</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho yelled loudly as if trying to interfere with Jun Hyuk\u2019s thoughts,</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Turn on the TV. The broadcast is going to start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk bolted up and when he turned on the TV, \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019 was about to start. Since it was still about the area preliminaries, Jun Hyuk should not be making an appearance.</p><br/><p>However, to raise viewer ratings, the broadcast started with highlights from Jun Hyuk and Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s press conference. After that, they showed scenes of Jun Hyuk\u2019s area preliminary auditions that had not come out on broadcast before.</p><br/><p>They showed the guitar version of Jung Tae Chun\u2019s \u2018Poet\u2019s Town\u2019 that Jun Hyuk had arranged on the spot along with the surprised faces of the judges. For a broadcast that only aired for 1 hour, it could have been seen as a special on Jun Hyuk because all of the clips regarding him added up to 15 minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to admit the people at the broadcasting station are fast. When do you think they prepared all of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The 10% viewer rating that Baek Seung Ho promised may have been incorrect, but it was definitely twice the rating of last episode.</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho who had been drunkenly cursing the broadcasting station stood up shakily. When he went home, Yoon Kwang Hun and Jun Hyuk became quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? No, it\u2019s nothing. Just.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. You don\u2019t have to study abroad if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun knew that Jun Hyuk had become much more quiet when talk of studying abroad came up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun pat Jun Hyuk\u2019s shoulder gently like a father and teacher,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just do what you want. If you decide later that you want to study, you can do it then. You\u2019re only 17. It\u2019s not too late even if you decide to study 10 years later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thing is\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I want to do right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun knew better what Jun Hyuk wanted to do now. Make music. He wanted to make the melodies in his head into concrete sound. That was all.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk said he did not know, it probably meant that he did not know what he needed to do to prepare for his future.</p><br/><p>He had said that making music on the audition program was fun. Is it not definite that he is enjoying himself because he can hear the melodies in his head with his own ears?</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone is like that at your age. The kids who are in high school, studying for college entrance exams are just studying to go to college. They choose their schools and majors according to their exam scores. You\u2019re much better off compared to them. It\u2019s already decided what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk could not believe that he was better off than other kids his age because he had never even attended school.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost kids just choose to be a lawyer or doctor to make a lot of money because they\u2019re smart. I was like that too. When I was going to school, economics major was really popular because it was easy to get hired at a large company. That\u2019s why I just decided to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you really want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I still don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You still don\u2019t know? Geez.\u201d</p><br/><p>17 year old Jun Hyuk was having trouble believing that a man over 40 had gone through life without knowing what he wanted to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like that since I didn\u2019t know until college that I would become a stockbroker. When I graduated, I just found employment at a financial firm that would pay me a lot. When I was working, I saw that people with MBAs were paid much more than I was, so I quit and went to study abroad. That\u2019s how it progressed. I just fell into the excitement of making money later. After I lost everything\u2026 I started this cafe thinking I\u2019ll just live while listening to music.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was something difficult for young Jun Hyuk to understand. There weren\u2019t very many people in the world who did what they wanted to do. No, it was rare for people to even know what exactly they wanted to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I have a dream now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA dream?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you know what it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Is it\u2026 me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I want to make it so that your music doesn\u2019t stop as the world makes a full turn. So for the 365 days in a year, your music is playing from somewhere at any time. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s classic or pop since there will be someone to listen to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk spent the entire night talking to Yoon Kwang Hun about the future and dreams as such, and went back to the dormitory.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

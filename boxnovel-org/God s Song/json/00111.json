Such a sweet thing.]</p><br/><p>Everyone finished the 20 fierce days of Long Thibaud and returned. However, the results had not been good. According to Danny, it was a breakthrough for East Asia and annihilation for America.</p><br/><p>Korean, Chinese, and Japanese participants\u2019 names were on the list of runner-ups, but there was not a single American. This is not talking about American as a nationality, but as the place where the participants completed their studies.</p><br/><p>It was to the point where students who had the competition as their priority were considering moving to a school in Europe.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, I\u2019m going to go out for Long Thibaud no matter what the year after the next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny was full of confidence after seeing the participants\u2019 abilities with his own eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out for it together. With your piano, you\u2019re definitely a winner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny had heard the pianists who had been labeled as being at a high overall level. However, he had not heard a piano that made his heart beat as much as Jun Hyuk\u2019s did.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It isn\u2019t my dream to become a pianist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I know that. But you should know that a lot of composers are famous pianists.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t want to. If you want, I can do the accompaniment for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s obvious that the accompanist will overshadow the performer. Am I crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny was extremely jealous of Jun Hyuk\u2019s talent but there were a lot of times when he thought that it was a relief that Jun Hyuk had not chosen to play the piano. He thought it a relief that this tremendous competitor, a competitor that he could never follow, had chosen composition.</p><br/><p>On top of that, if he shows his music to this future maestro, Jun Hyuk might compose a song with his violin in mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, tell me honestly. What do you think of my violin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good. Have confidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why is the song for the performance a piano concerto? Don\u2019t you need to write a violin song for me, your best friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke as though joking, but his tone was full of regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat? That\u2019s nothing really. It\u2019s just a practice song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPractice song?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was chosen for the performance with a practice song? Danny had already seen Jun Hyuk\u2019s score on the internet. If that song is just a practice song, what is a real one like? Danny remembered the title of that song.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, it said the title of that song is Piano Concerto No. 7\u2026 Then doesn\u2019t that mean there are 6 other songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I wrote them while I was in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy chance, do you have the scores with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk tapped his head with his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the songs are in your head and the scores are in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Danny saw Jun Hyuk nod his head, he spoke in a quiet voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you have a song for the violin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do. Why? Do you want to see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be an honor, maestro.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny rotated his arms and bowed.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took out sheet music and started writing notes quickly. Danny\u2019s eyes quickly followed the notes from beside Jun Hyuk. When Jun Hyuk completed the score within moments, Danny quickly took it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I finish practicing this song, you\u2019ll play the accompaniment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s show this at the concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Jun Hyuk suddenly started laughing, Danny\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI played around with that a little while I was arranging it. If you want to play that perfectly, you\u2019ll have to practice that like crazy this winter break. And if you can play that song completely, you\u2019ll be good enough to go out for the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny\u2019s widened eyes did not come back to their original state. Had he made it so that he could practice?</p><br/><p>Though Jun Hyuk always seemed indifferent, he was very considerate of others at times like this. Danny was touched and hugged Jun Hyuk, kissing his cheek.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel decided to stay in New York until the Philadelphia Philharmonic\u2019s Christmas concert with the excuse of the Clayton performance. Once he arrived in New York with his whole family, he left them at the hotel and headed to Clayton.</p><br/><p>Unlike the conductors who usually arrived at the school 2 days before the concert, he had come to New York a week before. The students cheered at the maestro\u2019s surprise visit. The maestro smile and was friendly to anyone who approached him and spoke informally with the students.</p><br/><p>Of course he drank coffee with the professors as they discussed the defeat at Long Thibaud.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can I meet the leaders of the concert?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Would you like to start with the orchestra members?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I was hoping to meet the composers first. I\u2019m sure I should get information on the songs first. Also, it may be uncomfortable, but I wanted to meet them separately. One at a time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The professors were puzzled because they did not know why he wanted to meet them separately, but they had to think that he had his own reasons.</p><br/><p>Alexander Dubchek could not let go of Bruno Kazel\u2019s hand and was full of awe.</p><br/><p>There is a reason why the students are in a craze over Bruno Kazel. He is someone who demands novelty so much so that he is called an innovative conductor. He prefers contemporary music to classical or romantic music and he often includes jazz into his repertoire. He does not even hesitate to work with pop musicians who are not very famous.</p><br/><p>When he was inaugurated as the conductor and music director of the Philadelphia Philharmonic, he put a joint performance with South American jazz greats on his first stage against the opposition of the Board of Directors.</p><br/><p>Local supporters pressured the Board of Directors for his dismissal even though there were 3 years left to his contract. The Board of Directors were going to kick him out with the resolution to pay the contract fees, but they all kept their mouths shut when his live performance album had a sales rate of 4 million copies.</p><br/><p>This Bruno Kazel was receiving the overwhelming support of young musicians.</p><br/><p>While Bruno Kazel looked at Alexander who could not let go of his hand, he suddenly remembered something,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you by chance that Dubchek? Of Prague?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a modest response, but his voice was full of pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I used to enjoy your grandparents\u2019 music\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be the grandson. I guess it\u2019s in the genes?\u201d</p><br/><p>A family with three generations of music. This is common in Europe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems your mother had a great influence seeing as how you chose the oboe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a question of choice rather than influence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour parents must be proud. You excel in composition, not just the oboe.\u201d</p><br/><p>It could be that this young Czechoslovakian musician has more talent in composition than he does in the oboe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we discuss the song? Should I say that it\u2019s fun? It even has a comical feeling to it\u2026 How did you come to write it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI once saw three women having a picnic in Central Park. I could not tell if they were single moms or housewives, but while the children were running around on their own, the women looked like they had been freed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alexander recalled the moment he thought of the music and started chattering his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey had looked annoyed while they were holding the children\u2019s hands before they found their spots on the park lawn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that you saw the change in their expressions and guessed what they were thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had found music in an unexpected moment. It meant that he is extremely sensitive.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t feel that openness or joy in your music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause those women also know that it is only for that quick moment. When they return to their daily lives, they\u2019ll have to endure the stress of clashing with their children.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had expressed a feeling that anyone who had cared for a child could agree with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. It\u2019s so realistic. I know that feeling. I have three kids. None of them are over 10 years old yet. It\u2019s really war everyday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel was pleased and laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why sopranos instead of the oboe? Isn\u2019t your major the oboe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI tried it a few times, but the three women\u2019s feelings did not come out no matter what I did. A better player might have been able to\u2026 But I thought a direct depiction would be better and chose the sopranos.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. The oboe is a gentleman\u2019s instrument. It would be difficult for anyone to try to express a young mother\u2019s hysteria with the gentle oboe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel spoke cautiously,</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen the song that was chosen along with yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alexander shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I thought it is a bit boring. Isn\u2019t it too generic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel watched Alexander\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt could be, but not just anyone can come up just something like that in a matter of a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA week? Are you saying that he wrote that piano concerto in a week?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had thrown the question to see how Alexander evaluated a competitor\u2019s music, but he had come to know something unexpected. A week\u2019s short time also meant that he had not revised the song.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, it meant that he had written it while pulling inspiration from any incident or moment. What kind of moment had he experienced that he came up with such a classical music? Had Haydn come out in his dreams to give him that song?</p><br/><p>Alexander looked at Bruno Kazel\u2019s surprised face and kept speaking,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s a freshman who is rumored to be plenty capable of doing that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFreshman? Well\u2026 this is more of a surprise than the music. A freshman writing a song that has the essence of Haydn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be more surprised when you meet him yourself.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

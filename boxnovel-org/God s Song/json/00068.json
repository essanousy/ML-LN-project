You thought I wouldn\u2019t see it? You endured such a hard time well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s hand that was holding Jun Hyuk\u2019s as he pat his back was so warm that Jun Hyuk could feel that he had been sincerely concerned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was able to forget because I was working on music with you. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong did not forget the words he wanted to say before Jun Hyuk left,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, if you do end up going abroad next year\u2026 let\u2019s make music together before you leave. I wanted to work with you properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA record? How could I\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk waved his hand as though it could not be, but his heart was beating fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I want to produce your debut album\u2026 Why? Do I fall short?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. I wonder if I\u2019m qualified to release an album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? If you\u2019re not qualified, no one in our country is. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t make money. It\u2019s because I really want to make an album full of music at a high level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Making an album with my own music. Jun Hyuk\u2019s heart beat faster when he imagined that a CD with his own music would stand with Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s thousands of CDs at the cafe.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll come back once the broadcast is over. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk could not let go of Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s hand and expressed his gratefulness multiple times.</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk sadly left the studio, the assistant producer opened his mouth,</p><br/><p>\u201cWill Jun Hyuk really go to study abroad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will. He\u2019s good enough to play in bigger waters. And I think Jun Hyuk is already oriented to classic. No matter what music he\u2019s working with, he makes classic his base. Eventually, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll need to go abroad.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant producer lightly hit his forehead,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk said last time that he made dozens of pop songs. I wanted to see those all over this industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that the cafe owner didn\u2019t throw any of them out and saved everything. They\u2019ll come out one day, even if it\u2019s not right now. And you think that kid will create a debut album with songs he made in the past? He\u2019ll fill it with new songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>A producer did not know how a composer thought. The desire to use songs that were left for later disappears. It was in a creator\u2019s mentality to want to create and release new works.</p><br/><p>It is said that the Beatles recorded dozens of songs and chose the ones that would go in their album. Reportedly, the record label was always disappointed that there were so many good songs that got taken out.</p><br/><p>When they were working on a new album however, they never used an old song no matter how good it was, and wrote new ones. As they recorded in this way, there could be 50 more Beatles albums with the songs that they did not use.</p><br/><p>Even now, the record label fits one of these songs in whenever they release a best hits album. They are making an enormous amount of money on the legacy that the Beatles left behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong suddenly remembered something while thinking of the scores that Jun Hyuk had.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe symphony. Where\u2019s the score for the symphony Jun Hyuk brought?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong found the score in a corner of the messy recording studio and started to look over it quietly. When compared with Mozart, it was a symphony written by a 17 year old genius though 10 years late.</p><br/><p>He read the score full of expectations, but put the score down after the third sheet.</p><br/><p>The assistant producer who had been looking at the 2nd sheet started looking for a cigarette,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 What is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. Is this music? No matter how much we say it\u2019s the post-modern era, isn\u2019t this just noise?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the music they had heard from Jun Hyuk so far, his specialty was his compositions filled with beautiful melody like Mozart. However, not only was this not a beautiful melody, but its irregular arrangement made it difficult to even read.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we say that this irregular sound that\u2019s like noise is music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s already a work that makes noise into music. It\u2019s John Cage\u2019s .\u201d</p><br/><p> premiered on August 29, 1952 in New York\u2019s Woodstock. had four bandmasters, and each bandmaster\u2019s score was completely blank. There was only a Tacet accent (to rest without performing) written on the sheet. The performer sat in front of the piano and opened the cover of the piano. The time had been decided randomly so the 1st bandmaster was 33 seconds, the 2nd bandmaster was 2 minutes 40 seconds, and the 3rd bandmaster had two sets of 1 minute 20 seconds. After that, the performer shut the cover on the piano again.</p><br/><p>As a result, the performer had just opened the piano and sat still for 4 minutes and 33 seconds before closing the piano again.</p><br/><p>In this absurd performance, the bustling noise of youths was the music. Even if the performer and audience had been silence, there would be a sound in the concert hall.</p><br/><p>The sound of this performance changed by the location. It was a work that could be changed in infinite ways. However, this song was still considered a challenge to the meaning of music.</p><br/><p>\u201cUsing a philosophical topic like that happens just once. From the second time, it\u2019s just noise. No one will recognize it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 What do we do\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong scratched his head. He had promised Jun Huk that he would show the score to an expert in classical.</p><br/><p>He needed to keep his promise. It was something he did not know. Jun Hyuk\u2019s song could be avant garde, and receive great recognition.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

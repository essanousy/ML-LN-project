Kailua-Kona is a big island with a beach and has relatively less tourists.</p><br/><p>After going through a front entrance with security guards and driving for a while, they could see a large mansion. The front of the mansion is decorated like a park and the beach spreads out in the back. Jun Hyuk\u2019s jaw dropped at the incredible scale of the place. \u201cIsaac, is this your villa too? It\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern\u2019s eyes widened as he waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no, you think I would have such a luxurious villa? You saw the small house in Switzerland, didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s more my type. This is borrowed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBorrowed? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKirk Hammett.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKirk Hammett? You\u2019re not talking about Kirk Hammett, the guitarist for Metallica, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This place has a complete studio. You can work on music and it\u2019ll be nice and quiet since it\u2019s far from the downtown area.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pictures hanging on the walls inside told them whose villa this is. Metallica and Kirk Hammett\u2019s pictures are hanging everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlvin Lee wanted a quiet place too. Oh right. Two maids will be here, so it\u2019ll be comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>They followed President Stern into the basement and saw a studio that could hold at minimum, a 24-person band. The studio is so complete that they could record an entire album with the equipment filling the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen rest until the other people get here. Tara and I will be at a hotel in the city, so call if you need anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe house is big. Why don\u2019t you just stay here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we came all the way to Hawaii? No thanks. I\u2019m going to relax while watching beautiful women in bikinis under the hot sun, so the musicians can spend their time preparing for the concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first member arrived not long after Tara and President Stern left. Colin\u2019s reaction was not very different from that of Jun Hyuk\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cKirk? Kirk, the Kirk from Metallica?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. There are even a few guitars he uses in the basement, though we can\u2019t touch them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in Kirk\u2019s villa right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin examined all corners of the house and basked in the presence of Kirk Hammett. \u201cAlvin Lee isn\u2019t here yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll arrive soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it incredible? Alvin Lee is going to be singing your song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cColin, don\u2019t make too much of a fuss when Alvin Lee gets here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I won\u2019t. I\u2019m a member of the band, not a fan from now on. And Jun, that\u2019s your band.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Alvin Lee entered with his manager however, Colin and Jun Hyuk immediately became fans.</p><br/><p>Colin, who is also a bassist, is meeting his idol and seemed to have no thoughts of letting go of Alvin Lee\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, my maestro! Since I started music again, this is the first time I\u2019ve been so excited.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s have fun together.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 3 people drank refreshing beers and talked about each other\u2019s movies until the sun set.</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho was the last to arrive and was escorted by an employee of Stern</p><br/><p>Corporation from the airport, and wandered around the house until he found Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk! Geez. How long has it been?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMin Ho. It\u2019s nice to see you again. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d meet again like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho was more surprised now than when he was when he was first contacted about joining in the concert. He is surprised that Jun Hyuk remembers his name and is speaking to him in such a friendly manner.</p><br/><p>A few years ago when he had told Jun Hyuk to speak to him informally, Jun Hyuk had been a tough teenager who refused to do so, but he was now doing it so naturally. His thorny side was gone and he seemed to be much more relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026 I\u2019m touched. You remember my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Honestly, I didn\u2019t remember it. I found out your name after you were confirmed to join the concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you did. He he. Anyway, you\u2019re really something. You\u2019ve got the stance of a great now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve gotten older. Oh right. Say hi. This is Colin, who will be on the bass. He\u2019s a friend from school. And I\u2019m sure you know this person without my having to tell you? He\u2019ll be singing for the concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho did not even realize that Alvin Lee was holding his hand out to him. He was just frozen, staring at him.</p><br/><p>One of the heroes who took over his childhood is standing in front of him, smiling. He did not hear Alvin Lee\u2019s blues album, but the 2 he recorded before were masterpieces that shook Kyung Min Ho\u2019s soul as it did for countless other youths at the time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? You have to take the hand first. This kind of opportunity is rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho quickly took Alvin Lee\u2019s hand and shook it as he stuttered,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Alvin Lee. I \u2013 I \u2013 Nice to\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, this friend can\u2019t speak English, right? Tell him not to worry about it. I can tell what he\u2019s trying to say just by looking at his face. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho never thought that the day would come when he regrets not learning English. He had not studied English because he could not even guarantee success in Korea. At this moment however, he was extremely jealous of Jun Hyuk speaking English fluently.</p><br/><p>While the three spoke in English and laughed, Kyung Min Ho could only drink his beer.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. I\u2019m okay. It\u2019s enough for me that I\u2019m drinking beer with Alvin Lee like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay when we start playing for the concert tomorrow. Music doesn\u2019t need words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho was more concerned about Jun Hyuk who kept taking care of him. He is happy just watching these people right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cMin Ho, how have you been?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m living off of doing drum sessions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk started to completely talk to Kyung Min Ho. He is also more curious about the situation in Korea.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the band? You\u2019re incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe places that want me aren\u2019t to my liking and the better bands already have great teamwork, so I can\u2019t fit myself in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you ever think about making your own band?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I? Band leaders need to know how to create music like you. I only play. If I just have people float together, the band will be no good.\u201d Kyung Min Ho let out a forced laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre sessions doable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually make a lot more money than when I was in the band. There are so many recordings to do. There are a lot of dramas and a lot of movies. And you know there are a ton of girl and boy bands. The music is simple too, so it\u2019s quick work. Anyway, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d Kyung Min Ho took a gulp of his beer and his face hardened again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut do you think I\u2019ll be able to do well? I got really scared once I saw Alvin Lee\u2019s face. I don\u2019t have the confidence either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you play. It\u2019s plenty. I\u2019m sure Alvin will be surprised too.\u201d He felt a little better at Jun Hyuk\u2019s encouragement not to worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut do you know what you\u2019re like in Korea right now? It\u2019s no joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of Koreans who got on the world field in sports. But in music, especially in classical, this is the first time anyone\u2019s gotten as famous as you have\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Korean TV is currently full of news about Jun Hyuk in real-time. There was even news on the Monterey Jazz Festival not too long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven people who have never seen classical concerts know that you challenged Beethoven and succeeded. The Korean press releases articles just say that you\u2019ve gained recognition as the 21st century Beethoven.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were times when Kyung Min Ho saw these kinds of articles and found it hard to believe that he had participated on Jun Hyuk\u2019s album.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much your album has sold, right? It was sold once this concert was announced and promotions started. I\u2019m telling you there\u2019s no stock.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hesitated slightly and asked cautiously,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the tickets sell at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t know? It sold out in a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? How many seats are there that it got sold out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSangam soccer stadium alone has over 60,000 seats. It\u2019ll be over 80,000 including the field standing seats. Oh right. Your agency is really great. They used the single ticket policy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSingle ticket? The seats aren\u2019t assigned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. The price is $100. It\u2019s first come, first served. There\u2019s no distinction between A, B, S, and VIP or anything like that. You just have to enter the venue first. People saw that in an even better light.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the requests that President Stern drove at the company doing promotions in Korea, was the ticket policy. He insisted that the performance with Alvin Lee is the main event, not the orchestra and piano concerto.</p><br/><p>He thought that the way to fill good seats in a pop music concert is through passion, not money. It was the result of Stern\u2019s insistence that there would be plenty reward for waiting for a long time on line.</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho forgot his exhaustion from the long flight and his jet lag, and stayed up until the morning, enjoying this time that feels like a dream.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had felt like it would have been too burdensome to stay in a place like a large European castle. The villa however, is a small 2-story house on a small hill that looks down on the Schwangau forest.</p><br/><p>Other than the grand piano in the spacious living room, there was no clutter. There was just the expensive wine in the wine cellar.</p><br/><p>The friendly woman who greeted Jun Hyuk is from Eastern Europe, and they could not understand each other. They can just use body language to communicate since she will only be taking care of his meals.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk organized his luggage and went out into the Schwangau forest. There is just the sound of nature everywhere with nothing to interfere. Since there is such a forest right next to him, he felt like 1 month would go by easily.</p><br/><p>Until now, it had been a busy 10 days. With time to relax, he remembered someone he had been forgetting.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I heard you\u2019re a great star now? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s pleasant laughter rang over the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? How did you know? Did the news already come out in Korea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s still quiet here. Didn\u2019t I tell you? You\u2019re in the palm of my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sometimes, Jun Hyuk has the feeling that Yoon Kwang Hun might have someone following him around to report back to him. Yoon Kwang Hun will not tell him how he came to know anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that, but where are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m at Sir Simon Lettle\u2019s villa. It\u2019s a small countryside village called Hohenschwangau.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Simon Lettle? Simon Lettle of the Berlin Philharmonic?\u201d</p><br/><p>This is how Jun Hyuk gets revenge. He imagined Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s surprised face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Ha ha. Aren\u2019t you jealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk told him about everything that happened over the last 10 days. The shock he felt when he heard his 1st symphony in the concert hall, the party with 16 maestros, and how he showed off in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how did your score get leaked? There\u2019s no way it came from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I was most curious about that as well\u2026 I gave Teacher Jo Hyung Joong my score before. He said that he would find out what it is worth from a professor of music. I never did receive an assessment. There\u2019s nothing other than that though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did? Hm\u2026 I\u2019ll look into it. How is it over there? Is it okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It isn\u2019t a luxurious villa, but it\u2019s small and perfect. Oh, you could come here. I\u2019m alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. Why go over there? I have to run the cafe.\u201d</p><br/><p>He does not even care that much about the cafe. There must be another reason why he will not come when Jun Hyuk knows that all Yoon Kwang Hun does is drink coffee and listen to music until it is time to close as if he is a regular customer. It seems he is trying to step by from Jun Hyuk\u2019s life little by little so he can learn to live on his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that, but what are you going to do now? Are you going back to school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be okay when it\u2019s like this? Reporters trying to write about you isn\u2019t even the biggest problem. I\u2019m sure your professors are also going to make a fuss to hand over \u2018Inferno\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. I want to keep going to school\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is there a lot to learn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good. The special classes are good too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 Then how about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDisappear for about a year. Take a leave of absence from school. Don\u2019t you think everyone will forget after about a year? Just reveal the whole score for \u2018Inferno\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun spoke to Jun Hyuk while thinking of what he had just discussed with Isaac Stern. He is still young. It would be okay for him to travel the world for a year.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t very many people who know your face. It\u2019s hard for people to differentiate between Asian faces, so I\u2019m pretty sure you won\u2019t face anything too bothersome. I\u2019m positive reporters won\u2019t recognize you even if you were hanging out in the lobby of the New York Times building.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do I do for a year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to figure that out. You want me to tell you how to rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. Anyway, get a lot of rest since you\u2019re in a good place. Oh right! Send me all of the pictures you took with the maestros. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting off the phone, Jun Hyuk thought about the idea that no one would recognize him even if he were hanging out in the lobby of the New York Times building. It figures since the only people who know his face precisely are in Korea, school, and the people he met in Salzburg. His name has risen to stardom, but he himself is just an Asian boy.</p><br/><p>Everyday, Jun Hyuk walked through the Schwangau forest or went to the morning marketplace with the housekeeper to buy food. Other than the occasional video chats with Amelia and the calls from Sir Simon Lettle to check up on him, he was completely cut off from the outside world.</p><br/><p>This peaceful state did not last over 10 days. A phone call came, which made him realize that he cannot push matters off any further.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, hello lawyer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSave the greetings for later and tell me where you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNear Fussen in Germany.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez\u2026 That\u2019s not good since we need to meet immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lawyer Lim So Mi was not speaking in her usual dry voice, but had an excited tone. It is a voice that was not fitting for someone who had always been so calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to save me. I can\u2019t live like this. Even now, reporters are camping outside and making a fuss for me to tell them where you live. I can\u2019t leave my house.\u201d</p><br/><p>For someone asking to be rescued, her voice was bright. She might be enjoying this attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no\u2026 But how did the reporters find out about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you think they know! The only places that are connected to you are CH and LA Sound. The school doesn\u2019t know about me, but LA Sound does. They probably pushed the reporters off to me when they went swarming to their offices.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It happened so suddenly for me as well so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t call to fight you about it. Anyway, you can\u2019t just ignore it like this. It\u2019s definitely the timing to reveal something or another. And you need to stop by LA Sound.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour tribute album. They finished recording and are going to release the album soon. But I guess the metal musicians with the long hair are saying they need to meet with you. I\u2019m told they\u2019re pretty famous, but I have no idea who they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had clearly told Alex Zakin that he would not see his heroes in their aged state. By calling him in now with the musicians as an excuse means that they are using this press as an opportunity to garner more attention for the album.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hesitated to answer and Lim So Mi realized what he is thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can ignore them. The contract clearly says that you won\u2019t participate in promotions for the album. But you\u2019re not some kind of mysterious character\u2026 I\u2019m telling you though because I thought it was weird that you created tribute songs but won\u2019t even show your face. If you don\u2019t want to do it, I\u2019ll reject.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Then can you reject it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Then this talk amongst the reporters\u2026 Hm\u2026 Jun Hyuk, let\u2019s do this. Think about it for 2 days and then call me. What you need to make a decision on is what you\u2019ll do with the score for the symphony. And what your future plans are. It\u2019s just these 2 things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll give you a call as soon as I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this is good news, but LA Sound is celebrating because you\u2019ve been labeled a young genius in the press. Your album is selling a lot for a jazz record. They also said that there are a lot of pre-orders for the tribute album already. You\u2019re going to make a lot of money very soon. Ho ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lim So Mi brought up the matter of money, Jun Hyuk suddenly remembered something. He had come up with plans according to Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s suggestion to take a year off, but he would need money for those.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh Mrs. Lim. How much have I made until now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t know? Lawyer Baek doesn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I don\u2019t ask him. I just use my card and take out cash from an ATM whenever I need it, and he fills it back up to 10 or 20,000 dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He puts in 10 to 20,000? How much have you made? Hang on. I\u2019ll check for you. I don\u2019t check your account\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>From the sound of typing coming over the phone, he could tell that she is checking his balances.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

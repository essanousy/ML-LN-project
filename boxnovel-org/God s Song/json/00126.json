Last month, he had prepared a project album with Japanese pianist, Uehara. He returned after recording all 4 songs in Japan when Uehara pulled the brakes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean you\u2019re pulling the brakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s saying he isn\u2019t satisfied with one of the songs. He sent back what he played last week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust the piano part?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure you know, but improv on scene is important in jazz\u2026 Mr. Uehara likes sophisticated things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex looked over Stanley Clarke.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, Stanley is really annoyed because of that. We barely got him to agree to this because he was angry that they\u2019re not even recording together and that he\u2019ll have to re-record while listening to the piano as a music file. Honestly, the piano version that was redone is much better. I would like to use this piano song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a recording of what Stanley played again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have that\u2026 but there isn\u2019t anything that was done properly. We stopped all of them as he was playing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I guess we\u2019ll have to start by listening to the piano.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put on the headphones and began listening to the piano. His fingers naturally tapped his knees according to the melody. He took off the headphones,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m done. The song is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, Stanley? I\u2019m telling you the piano is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex looked at Stanley Clarke as he spoke, but Stanley still had a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, he\u2019s saying that it\u2019s a jazz performance but there isn\u2019t any hype, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. This kid knows something. It has to have a good feeling to perform it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s bring out its feeling first. It\u2019s lacking, but I\u2019ll play the piano.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk entered the recording booth, Alex Zakin\u2019s gaze changed. It is time to see for himself.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put his hands on the electric piano and played the piano by Uehara he had just heard. A gentle melody fitting for fusion jazz filled the booth. It is a song that brought out the Japanese characteristic of piano with a tranquil emotion.</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke looked back and forth between Jun Hyuk in the booth and Alex sitting beside him, and stuttered,</p><br/><p>\u201cDi\u2026 Didn\u2019t he just hear it? By\u2026 By chance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you saw. He put on the headphones and listened to it just now. That\u2019s the first time. This\u2026 Seeing something I\u2019d only heard of with my own eyes, it seems like magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething you\u2019d only heard of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s someone like Mozart. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men had a more blank expression than when Jun Hyuk first met Stanley Clarke. Jun Hyuk lifted his head and spoke to Stanley Clarke,</p><br/><p>\u201cStanley, play it with me. Hurry up and come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke entered the recording booth and picked up the bass guitar.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecord everything from now on. Don\u2019t stop it anywhere and keep recording until they both come out of the booth. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin warned the sound engineer and began to watch the two.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk played Uehara\u2019s piano in repetition so that Stanley Clarke could play the bass with it. They played it three times and each time, Stanley\u2019s bass brought out a different melody.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk began to change the piano melody little by little when Stanley gave him the eye. Stanley\u2019s bass started to give an entirely different melody as he matched Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano.</p><br/><p>Two wave tracks on the monitor outside the recording booth were dancing. Melodies were filling the computer hard drive through the thick copper wires running from the bass guitar and electric piano.</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin felt a deep bliss. This is an improv performance coming from a small recording booth that is not even 400 square feet, that can only be heard at the likes of the Monterey Jazz Festival. On top of that, the entire sound is being recorded without any noise mixed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is why I can\u2019t help but love geniuses!\u201d</p><br/><p>The excited Alex Zakin shouted as he patted the two sound engineers on the back. Directing? Producing? They do not need this kind of stuff. When two geniuses meet and sparks fly, there are unexpected results.</p><br/><p>Those results become incredible music that no famous producer can bring out.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s vision faded until he could not see anything. He could not see Stanley playing the bass or his fingers pressing the keyboard. He could only see the wavelengths created light fireworks from the sound of the piano and bass colliding.</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke did not even realize when his glasses fell off of his face because he was shaking his head so much. He could not feel the saliva forming in his slightly open mouth. They were both lost in the music that they were creating together.</p><br/><p>They performed for over almost an hour before they stopped.</p><br/><p>Even though he was sitting still and not playing the piano, his fingertips tingled and there was a tremor throughout his body. He had played jazz properly for the first time after only having listened to it.</p><br/><p>This is the first time he is feeling something like this. He found out that the bliss felt by someone listening to jazz is incomparable to what the performer feels.</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke put the bass down and hugged Jun Hyuk who was sitting blankly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m asked to choose my best performances, this will be in the top three.\u201d</p><br/><p>They did not know that Alex and the engineers outside the booth were clapping endlessly.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk and Stanley Clarke did not leave the booth because they were talking about music. Alex Zakin checked the recording as Jun Hyuk even showed his happiness by taking a picture with Stanley on his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many minutes is the entire thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlaying to Uehara\u2019s piano is 20 minutes. The rest is 48.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin got lost in thought for a moment after checking the amount recorded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it means Stanley played the song to go with Mr. Uehara\u2019s piano three times?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Which one should we use?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst combine each with the piano file that Uehara sent over. We can use the best of those\u2026 Or we can use all three. Oh right, try mixing Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano too so we can compare it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Three versions of a song where only the bass is different. Shoving all of them into one album is something that jazz manias would like, but it is better to separate them for the sales of Stanley\u2019s next record release.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with the 48 minutes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking? We need to release a record of course. This is good enough to get a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin\u2019s words were full of certainty.</p><br/><p>The $25,000 contract with Jun Hyuk had come back as 48 minutes worth $2.5 million. It could even be $25 million. Alex Zakin would need to receive permission from the two leading men of the record, but he was decided on releasing it.</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of something and came out of the recording studio, leaving the two behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen they\u2019re done, send them to my room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin quickly went up to his room. When he saw the secretary sitting in front of his office, he spoke quickly,</p><br/><p>\u201cCall Charlie and tell him to hurry up and come to my room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCharlie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about Charlie Dwayne! Quickly within a minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex sat back in his chair, but he kept shaking his leg. He had only met Jun Hyuk twice, but this is the first time that he is meeting someone who surpasses surprise and shocks him every time they meet.</p><br/><p>He could not tell where Jun Hyuk\u2019s talents ended. He thought of the existing jazz performers who could maintain a performance with Stanley Clarke for 50 minutes, but could not even come up with 10. Even if there is musical inspiration, there needs to be solid playing skills to support it. It would be fitting to call him a master already because he is able to take the inspiration in his mind and express it with an instrument on the spot.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

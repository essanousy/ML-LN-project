But let\u2019s find out what will happen with Coline and JH.]</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, please do it with us. I\u2019m telling you Alex Zakin himself called!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I told you I can\u2019t. And who is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know? The top record label in LA. Zakin is the top producer at that company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s fine. Isn\u2019t it over once you get the attention of someone like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 To tell you the truth, he could tell at once what you produced and what you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>When looking at one record as a movie, the singer is the actor, the lyricist and composer are the scenario writers. The producer is the director.</p><br/><p>The first detail checked while deciding on investing in a movie is who the director is. In the same way, the important person in the recording industry is the producer.</p><br/><p>Occasionally, an outstanding musician makes the music, performs and sings, while doing the producing. However, there are not very many outstanding musicians. Most records need to go through a famous producer to bring out proper music.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk dramatized a scenario that actor Coline had brought and directed it in a refined way. Coline knew that if this Jun Hyuk dropped out, Alex Zakin would not take another look at him.</p><br/><p>He had not mentioned Jun Hyuk in his e-mail because he had not heard Jun Hyuk\u2019s definite answer yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cColine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that LA Sound is a tremendous record label, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Not just in LA. It\u2019s now one of the top 3 labels in the whole country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there will be a lot of great producers at that company. Those people can do the directing for you since your music isn\u2019t bad. I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s good as long as you do the arranging and producing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk thought that he was being cold but that he should not drag it any longer. A famous label would not have gotten in contact just by looking at the producing. If they had seen potential in Coline\u2019s music, Coline needs to make that potential a reality.</p><br/><p>If he is unable to do that, Coline will have to disband his group and face the choice of becoming a great bassist or cellist.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Hyuk did not know that LA Sound\u2019s reason for paying attention to Coline had been greater for something other than his music.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cIli, go listen to it in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Is there a need to go in person\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>A long time ago if they heard rumors of a great band, they needed to fly hours to go meet them in person. After the smartphone and online store appeared however, the tasks of record label\u2019s managers were made easier.</p><br/><p>All they had to do was look through the online store for good music. It is now an age where music shows itself by riding the cables.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten lazy. Don\u2019t you think we need to check for a last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, are you talking about the bassist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. If that song on the store is the only thing they have, just get the bassist. It\u2019s not easy to find a player like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Alex Zakin recognized someone\u2019s talent, he is worth listening to in person. Ili Gotez had to fly to New York in the cold winter.</p><br/><p>The New York winter was colder than he had expected, but something more surprising was waiting for Ili Gotez.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this? Was it a high school student?\u2019</p><br/><p>He checked the lists of New York clubs for bands, but there was not a band called Violon. Not performing at New York clubs meant there is a high possibility that they are minors. It is obvious that they are playing by themselves in a home basement or garage.</p><br/><p>If they really are minors, he would not be able to see how they perform without them noticing.</p><br/><p>If they are high school students, they would have caught a big fish. It is hard to imagine how great they would be in 10 years if they are at this level as teenagers. It would not be bad to maintain a relationship with them and wait to see how they grow.</p><br/><p>Ili had no choice but to call Coline.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>A young boy running into Starbucks and looking around. For a moment, Ili thought he was being fooled. He is not a high school student.</p><br/><p>It is the moment he decided that he would just listen to one song and go back to warm LA.</p><br/><p>Ili raised his hand and signaled to Coline.</p><br/><p>\u201cColine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I am Coline Spartos.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Ili Gotez.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili needed to say what he was curious about while looking at Coline who was so nervous he could not speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your profession? You\u2019re not one of those spoiled types who\u2026 live off their parents and dream of becoming stars, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, of course not. I\u2019m a student at the Clayton-Hoffman School of Music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Clayton?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili was surprised when he heard this unexpected answer and put his coffee mug down. It is enough to make someone curious. Is it not a place where musical geniuses went?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think you would be a student at the famous CH School of Music. Phew \u2013 I was surprised. Then does everyone perform classical?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s only me\u2026 The other members are students at New York College.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStudents at New York College? This is\u2026 too dandy?\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder the music had a strong mushy feeling to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Paganini? Chopin? Karajan? What genre are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a cello major.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCello? I see. I knew the bass melody line was good. You\u2019re the bassist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho made the songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was positive this cellist is the band leader. Rock and roll by model students. What little expectation Ili Gotez had, disappeared. He only wanted to get out of this cold place and quickly get back to LA.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s end this quickly. I\u2019d like to hear your band perform live first. Is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Gotez.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline called the other 2 members to hurry up and get to the practice studio and went with Ili Gotez on the streets of Queens to the studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you know the song on the online store? Let\u2019s hear that first. Both versions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? What do you mean 2 versions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the version before it went through arranging and producing. That\u2019ll be your real music.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Coline\u2019s signal, they performed the two songs for an audience of one. There is only one person, but that person is more important than the countless general audience. They put all of their strength into giving a perfect performance without room for a single mistake.</p><br/><p>When they were done playing the 2 versions of the song, Ili Gotez\u2019s straight face changed. It is not a performance worthy of admiration, but he could clearly see that there is potential.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you guys\u2026 have never performed live?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. How did you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili looked at a surprised Coline and laughed arrogantly.</p><br/><p>\u2018How would I know. I know since I looked through all of New York club lists.\u2019</p><br/><p>There is no reason to tell him the truth. He needs to give the airs of an expert.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can just tell by listening. And\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure you won\u2019t be able to play the songs other than the one on the store in a performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour band\u2019s music is for listening. It\u2019s not for live performances. It\u2019s too grand and complicated for the audience below a stage to cheer for. It\u2019s impossible for them to try to leave their bodies to the music.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is too grand.</p><br/><p>Coline remembered where he had heard Ili\u2019s words before. Jun Hyuk had said the same thing.</p><br/><p>He needed to forget about Jun Hyuk from Ili\u2019s continued words.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust do one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cello or bass \u2013 do one. The same goes for you guys. It\u2019s impossible to succeed in this industry while getting As at New York College.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline had gone around saying that he is working towards becoming a professional, but he started to be scared when he heard that he needs to learn to be a professional from an expert in the industry. There was fear in the faces of the other two members as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit your studies at New York College and start performing at New York clubs for $50, $60. There\u2019s no way to know what your music is like even if you practice by yourselves without an audience for 100 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili\u2019s words were not of criticism, but caution. He is telling them how to become a professional band.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come to know what your music is like once you perform in front of an audience drunk off of beer with their cold response, ragging, cursing, or worst case, ragging on you while throwing their bottles at you. And then you\u2019ll learn how to bring out the cheering from those people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili Gotez continued with his warnings while looking at the guitarist who also took on the vocals.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce you start touring, you\u2019re on a bus for at least 10 hours. A private plane? That doesn\u2019t exist. You sleep inside the bus. You eat at highway rest stops. And rehearsals, performances\u2026 You\u2019ll have to spend a year with a tight schedule like this. Will your voice be able to handle that? How about your stamina? Music comes after that. What good is it if your music hits 1st on Billboard charts when you can\u2019t even handle a tour?\u201d</p><br/><p>During the 9 years that Bon Jovi did not have a name, he performed at clubs from 7 at night to 5 in the morning every single day. The reason why he still has not lost his vocal power is that he created a strong voice in this period. The Beatles also performed for 7 hours in Germany when they were unknown. Paul McCartney could not endure much more and suggested splitting up the singing, bringing out the members\u2019 skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour band\u2019s music is good. The song isn\u2019t bad and your playing is on par. Prove that music in a real situation. Start here in New York. Make all of the clubs in New York want your band. That\u2019ll be your first gateway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their music and playing skills are good. Ili Gotez\u2019s last evaluation made Coline more inspired.</p><br/><p>Ili saw all three of their faces brighten and went on to say his 2nd reason for flying to New York,</p><br/><p>\u201cNow tell me honestly. You made the first song perfectly. What happened with the rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s still a secret? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not a secret but a promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline quickly spoke so that Ili would not misunderstand them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s because he promised to help us just one day, with just one song..\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili Gotez was gripped by the words that it was one day. He had brought out the essence of a grand and complicated song to make it receivable to the public. In the short period of one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy chance, did that person all do the arranging? Guitar and drums?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bass had been the same as the original. Leaving something that does not need to be fixed alone is the arranger\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn one day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess so, since he heard the music in the morning and we recorded in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili Gotez found his reason for flying to New York in this cold winter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen would I be able to meet this person as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be at the library now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline scratched his head with an uncomfortable expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLibrary? Is he at the same school? CH? Or New York College?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili looked back and forth at the students of the 2 schools.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a student at our conservatory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that means he\u2019s a classical boy\u2026 What\u2019s he doing at the library? Do music students study scores in the library?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019ll be studying history, physics, or math right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What are you talking about? I thought he\u2019s a music student?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is but he has some circumstances.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili looked at Coline\u2019s uncomfortable expression and spoke quietly,</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you tell me what those circumstances are? Your band\u2019s future could be riding on this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline gulped at Ili\u2019s straight face. The future is riding on this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But their expressions were still firm. Their unrest, anxiety, and worries had not gone away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so anxious. Maestro Jun\u2019s performance yesterday, especially the 2 performers in the afternoon performance, were really impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to express the freedom the pianist performed with in today\u2019s performance\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 performers could not get rid of the image of the competitors who had surpassed them, and had already lost confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I thought that there wouldn\u2019t be anyone to follow violinist Daniel from yesterday\u2019s afternoon performance. I\u2019ve watched his performance since the finals, but he really is in the lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>The violinist who is to perform with Jun Hyuk tomorrow, Michele Placido, has an honest personality like the Italian he is. He is blinded by the jealousy he felt while watching Danny.</p><br/><p>The roommate of the young genius sitting in front of him. The lucky guy who was in the same room for over 1 year, receiving inspiration and enlightenment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I also think that Danny\u2019s performance was the best. He showed overwhelming ability among the 6 violin finalists. Looking at skill alone, I expect he will win.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Italian violinist laughed despondently.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Well, well. Even so, for you to say it so blatantly\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the win can\u2019t be guaranteed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Now what does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk became inconsistent, the 2 people could only stare at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were a lot of mistakes. If the judges use a deduction system rather than judging the overall performance when scoring, he won\u2019t have a lot of points. That\u2019s the scoring method of a competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 people had not even known that Danny had made mistakes. There were parts where he strayed from the score, but it was because he had been so natural that it seemed he had done it on purpose.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. If it\u2019s okay, can I give you a piece of advice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Anything you say will be helpful now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 people swallowed. Jun Hyuk is now an indisputable genius maestro. They remembered what he showed them during rehearsals. He is able to tell them exactly how to express a single note.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are all lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Lucky?\u201d</p><br/><p>Does it mean that the goddess of the competition is coming for them? They could not understand exactly what he meant yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know who\u2019s in the royal seats of the theater, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Aren\u2019t they the top maestros in Europe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Everyone gathered because I had an accident with the press. And they aren\u2019t judges who check for mistakes to deduct points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><br/><p>That is when the 2 people let out low exclamations. They understood what Jun Hyuk was trying to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, right? Your paths as professionals have nothing to do with the judges. The people who will call for you are the maestros.\u201d</p><br/><p>Competition goals are winning, but their real goals are to make themselves known to the world. Their ultimate goals are to show their music to the world and to stand on great stages.</p><br/><p>There are over 10 maestros who are the tickets to these great stages.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know if you saw the interview, but I\u2019m going to be performing with the New York Philharmonic once the competition is over. I\u2019m thinking of Danny as the violin soloist for that performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>A performer who stands out to a conductor heads straight for a great stage like this. They were both extremely jealous of Danny. The New York Philharmonic is not just a great stage, but the world\u2019s best.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it. Showing your talent to a group of Europe\u2019s maestros and showing your talent to 12 judges. Isn\u2019t the conclusion too obvious?\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 people could feel a flash pass through their heads. They could fully understand why Jun Hyuk had said that they are lucky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe real winners of this competition aren\u2019t the people with high scores but the people who receive more calls from maestros.\u201d</p><br/><p>A performance with perfect technique, without error, cannot move the maestros\u2019 hearts. They need to give performances that are full of soul in order to capture their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo forget any thoughts about mistakes or being compared to others. You two just need to show your abilities to the fullest. Perform and take the challenge boldly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their faces looked much more comfortable than they had in the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s practice. Forget mistakes and ensembles, and show me your real selves. There\u2019s no orchestra here anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 people listened to Jun Hyuk\u2019s advice and focused on practicing until the sun set and darkness settled in. When they were going home, they left smiling after they thanked Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>After seeing them off and returning home, Tara and President Isaac Stern were drinking tea in the living room.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac! When did you get here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. I was in the kitchen with Tara because you were in the middle of practice. I have to see tomorrow\u2019s performance since it\u2019s the last one.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern spoke as though it was obvious. Is it not the hottest performance in the world of music right now?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s broadcast on the internet and on cable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to see it live. And there\u2019s some business I need to take care of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBusiness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The Belgian National Orchestra\u2019s tour starts once the competition is over. Your choral concerto is inevitably going to be the main repertoire\u2026 They can\u2019t have it for free. I need to negotiate the royalties. And it\u2019s not just that. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk became curious with President Stern\u2019s sinister laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that strange laughter because there\u2019s something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hail of phone calls from the record labels that saw your performance. They want to schedule recording right away. It\u2019s not just the record labels. It\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration, but there have been requests from symphony orchestras all over the world to perform your song.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is something joyful, not something sinister or strange. Jun Hyuk also felt pretty good, hearing that countless places wanted his song.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it seems you\u2019ll be pretty busy. Can you be spending time like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t do that work myself. The employees work hard. I\u2019m the company\u2019s boss. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re basically here for fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatching you perform is also work for me. And there\u2019s something I need to discuss with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern stopped laughing, and his expression became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the competition is over, are you going to tour as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>He has worked enough with the Belgian National Orchestra. It is also boring to conduct the same song for several months.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. The composer\u2019s participation in the tour isn\u2019t included as a provision for the competition anyway. Then you\u2019ll be able to start with the New York Philharmonic right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m anticipating that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut for the soloists\u2026 the piano and violin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Dimitri Carras wants Daniel, who performed with you yesterday. It seems he was quite impressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Isaac?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was surprised too. I thought he was just your roommate, but it was the birth of a great violinist.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern is so lost in Danny\u2019s performance that he regrets that he has already signed on with a different management agency. If he performs with an outstanding conductor for a few years and is well conditioned, he is sure to take a top class position.</p><br/><p>When President Stern was about to bring up the most important thing, Yoon Kwang Hun opened the door and came in. He must have been drinking because his face was red.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Yoon. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern. When did you get here? It\u2019s really a pleasure to see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>They embraced and showed their friendliness.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, you\u2019re late considering the performance should have ended early.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. I ran into the maestros again when I left the theater after the performance. They asked to eat together so\u2026 I had a glass of wine too. Ho ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk started laughing when he imagined Yoon Kwang Hun following the maestros around.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was just one glass of wine. Looks like you drank a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not important. The important thing is that they wanted to be friends with me. They told me not to call them maestro and to just call them by their names. We exchanged numbers too. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun proudly wiping his phone screen was not very different from a man admiring his favorite young singer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was the afternoon performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it was great? The committee told me that the morning and afternoon performances were exactly 74 minutes long. There wasn\u2019t a second in error.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once they started talking about the performance, Yoon Kwang Hun stopped joking and became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect interpretation and performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe critics said the same thing. The 19th century Beethoven conducted the song that the 21st century Beethoven wrote. I thought that was the most precise evaluation.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern spoke, laughing lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe greatest beneficiary in this year\u2019s Queen Elisabeth Competition is Belgium.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Is that what it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yoon Kwang Hun thought about the competition from the business end, President Stern could tell what he meant by the greatest beneficiary.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey leapt past cable and internet live broadcasts will have reached the ceiling for advertising rates. It is by far the best in terms of topicality alone. The competition committee is about to give Jun a medal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even in the world of classical music, a hot topic star is changing the field. Jun Hyuk has proved that he is a goose who lays golden eggs that bring in more revenue than the newly emerged stars in China.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern. Go on about the New York Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara had been listening quietly, but she spoke up so as not to lose out on something important.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. I forgot for a moment. Jun, do you by chance want to play the piano?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe piano?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 Maestro Carras asked cautiously if you might become the choral concerto\u2019s pianist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an okay thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun became excited first. It has been a fairly long time since he has heard Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano. On top of that, it would be him playing the piano on stage with the New York Philharmonic. His heart fluttered just imagining it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t really want to from the way you can\u2019t answer quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026 Is there really a need for me to do it when there are so many great pianists\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? How many pianists are better than you when looking at skill alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk did not immediately reject the idea, President Stern gained confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re thinking of releasing the New York performance as an album. In my opinion, your music is better in concert than in studio.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn album\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun was about to say something, but stopped. He did not want to unnecessarily give Jun Hyuk the impression that he was pressuring him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac, we\u2019ll think about that issue once the competition is over. That\u2019s okay, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You don\u2019t have to do it if you don\u2019t want to. There will always be a pianist who is willing to perform if it\u2019s your work.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

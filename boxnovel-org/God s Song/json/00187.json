Instead of being chased by inspiration to complete it, it is as though after designing it, the weak parts are reinforced, and beautiful aesthetics are added to fill in any empty spaces to create a full building.</p><br/><p>The choral concerto is a piece that follows this kind of Beethoven\u2019s thought perfectly. However, the present age wants to see new conversion of ideas that make people think though it may not be perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommittee Head. If we choose this song, it means that we\u2019re undermining the development of the music we\u2019ve advanced until now. Isn\u2019t it difficult as it is to endure with contemporary music? If we choose a song like one of the past, we\u2019ll have music from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic ages flooding in next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The real reason for being against Jun Hyuk\u2019s song came out. Their desire to block not the music but a retrogression from the flow of time is even making them forget the nature of music.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really what you think? That songs like this will come flooding in? How many composers are capable of this! That is unreasonable. This may or may not come out once in every 100 years. It has been 200 years since the choral symphony came out. This means that one has come out in 200 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as it was yesterday, the opinions that they cannot go back to the past and that they need to simply accept the music by itself are standing against each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will all know that when choosing judges, anyone prejudiced toward modern music was excluded. But now that we\u2019re here, there is someone who really has a prejudice. Is anything that is a classical form an imitation and impure?\u201d</p><br/><p>It had reached personal attacks. If this is how they are going to speak, they can no longer hold the discussion. Marion Cotillard needs to prevent it before the matter grows worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone stop! This is all. Everyone stop speaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marion Cotillard asked the competition board employee outside for coffee. Once all of the judges calm down, they will listen to what she has to say.</p><br/><p>No one spoke for over 10 minutes as they drank coffee. Marion Cotillard checked everyone\u2019s faces to make sure that they calmed down, and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cMusic needs to be more innovative and needs to develop. This is not the case with just music. This is necessary in art because the art we create today is a legacy that is passed on.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke slowly and clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it is not for us to practice a new challenge. This is what artists and philosophers do. We just encourage them through this competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked at the judges and started to play her role,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright everyone, please close your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone closed their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpty your minds. And don\u2019t lose the one melody of the 12 works that is constantly ringing in your head. That is the song that you need to choose. Think about our dear \u2018Palais des Beaux-arts\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Palais des Beaux-arts was erected by famous Belgian architect Victor Horta in 1922 to 1929, and the beautiful art center is the pride of Brussels. It has the Henry Le Boeuf Hall a large concert hall with 2,200 seats, a chamber concert hall with 476 seats, a studio with 210 seats, and multi-purpose halls. It is called BOZAR in shorthand.</p><br/><p>The biggest hall, Henry Le Boeuf, is the stage for the Belgian National Orchestra, Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Queen Elisabeth Competition final performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe melody that you want to hear ringing out in that wonderful space. The song that you want to hear most. That is the song that you choose.\u201d</p><br/><p>She could tell just by looking at the expressions of the judges with their eyes closed. Their faces show that they are thinking of the same song. Marion Cotillard had nothing more to say. The only thing left to do is give an honest vote with what their hearts are telling them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the 2nd vote in front of us, I will say one last thing before starting the vote. If you were all conductors, which song would you perform?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will announce the results of the 2nd round of votes.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the judges focused on Marion Cotillard.</p><br/><p>\u201c1st place, \u2018Choral Concerto\u2019 10 votes. 2nd place, \u2018World of Europe\u2019 2 votes. That is all. If anyone has objections, speak now.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the judges except for 2 looked relieved. They did not have lingering regrets in the results because they had left everything to the melody and rhythm instead of a belief or rational thought like philosophy.</p><br/><p>There were no objections to the votes that confirmed 2nd and 3rd places.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen check the ballot and if you don\u2019t see anything amiss, sign the final report.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marion Cotillard looked pleased as she passed the voting sheet to the judges.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we check to see whose work this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the board employee received the results of the vote, he checked the 3 composers. After more than 10 minutes, the employee pulled out the list of composers and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI will announce the composers. 1st place, Choral Concerto, Jun Hyuk Jang, Korea. 2nd place, World of Europe, Marlin Oscar Guggenheim IV, Austria. 3rd place, Deception, Jipuji Chang, China.\u201d</p><br/><p>The most familiar name to the judges is Guggenheim. The youngest son of a tremendously wealthy family in Austria. He is a young 20 year old showing exceptional talent in composition and the violin.</p><br/><p>The rumor that the father used an entire orchestra in order to teach his young son the violin, shows how wealthy the family is.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis year is quite peculiar. Normally, people over the age of 30 have good results in composition\u2026 I guess they are getting younger as time goes by.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe development of Asians doesn\u2019t stop. It\u2019s impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the 2 Asian finalists complete rookies? The name seems familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the judges kept mumbling,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk Jang, Jun Hyuk Jang\u2026 I feel like I\u2019ve heard the name before. Ah\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>He stopped mumbling and quickly started a search on the laptop.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk Jang a.k.a. Jun. Conductor. Composer. Jazz &amp; rock musician. Record: Symphony Inferno, Jazz Album \u2018The First\u2019 \u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cIn \u2013 Inferno!\u201d</p><br/><p>The judge who read the search results could not continue speaking. The other people who heard \u2018Inferno\u2019 gathered around the laptop.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this. No wonder the name seemed familiar. The composer of Choral Concerto is Inferno\u2019s Jun. How could this be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you talking about that Jun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be two people with the same name? Asian names do sound similar\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the judges quickly ran outside. He caught the board employee and gave him an order.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet, so let\u2019s wait. We need to confirm it for sure first.\u201d</p><br/><p>An employee came running into the conference room, panting.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s right. It is the same person. We just checked with the phone number on the entry, and it was Stern Corporation. They say that he signed with the agency.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marion Cotillard finally understood why President Stern had called. She remembered that Jun Hyuk had signed on with Stern Corporation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe backlash will be big. The winning song is Jun\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would someone with such fame enter a competition? Does he want the laurels as well\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrictly speaking, he is still a rookie. It\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t feel like one because his first song was so famous.\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the conference room became excited due to this unexpected truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere there. Let\u2019s not be fazed by it. Our work is done. Let\u2019s tell the committee about our decision, and then what do you think about getting a refreshing beer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone left the conference room at Marion Cotillard\u2019s suggestion. They went into a pub with a refreshed spirit that they had perfectly completed their homework. Belgium, the beer capital. All of the judges were thinking that they should drink a lot tonight. The hot topic of the night would of course become Jang Jun Hyuk.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

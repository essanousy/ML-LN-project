No one can step foot in Damrosch Park because it is already packed with people.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure everyone is here because of today\u2019s concert? There could be people taking walks in the park.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what we hear, they\u2019re all there for the concert. There\u2019s a barrage of questions regarding tickets, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reviews on the concert that came pouring out last night made people gather to the park. Ironically, it brought in more people who were criticizing the concert than those praising it.</p><br/><p>A performance that delved all the way into Beethoven. The criticisms that it completely ignored the sublime aspect of choral symphony had brought people out due to their curiosity.</p><br/><p>The New York Philharmonic board laid out their opinions while fighting back the desire to laugh. They cannot lose such a great opportunity. The more people there are who watch the concert, the higher album sales are bound to be.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think about just opening it up? People who bought tickets can sit in the seats and the rest can enjoy the concert from the grass even though they won\u2019t be able to see the stage very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to increase the sound equipment. They\u2019re almost done setting up already\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It is an open space as it is. Opening the concert so that everyone can hear is the same thing as saying that they should increase the number of speakers that they are using.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a festival period right now. Though it might be a little tiring, what do you think of preparing it for the citizens of New York?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to worry much if it\u2019s just a matter of increasing the number of speakers. The issue is that it\u2019s difficult to prepare it so that the sound is relayed properly. Don\u2019t you think poor sound quality could become a nuisance to the maestro?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will speak to the maestro about that. We\u2019ll have to tell him that the sound quality going outside will be a little low and ask for his understanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>If a crowd surges to an outdoor concert, it is difficult to expect great sound. To compare with a theater, it is the difference between the high quality sound of a CD and an MP3 file.</p><br/><p>Every June in Austria, the Vienna Philharmonic holds its Midsummer Night Concert on an outdoor stage by the Schloss Schonbrunn Neptune fountain. The crowd that comes to see this easily runs over 100,000 people. The admission is free.</p><br/><p>London\u2019s BBC PROMS is the same. The summer festival performances are at the Royal Albert Hall, Royal Music Academy, and Cadogan Hall under a banner for popularization of classical music. The closing performance on PROMS\u2019 last day at Hyde Park in particular, is presented to hundreds of thousands of people.</p><br/><p>Because these outdoor concerts happen periodically, the fitting sound systems are planned and prepared in advance. Even still, it is difficult to expect great sound quality anywhere that is not close to the stage. With an unexpected situation like today, they need to give up on perfect sound.</p><br/><p>The only person who can decide on giving up on sound is the maestro. There is no conductor who welcomes the fact that his music will be ruined by the sound system.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it better for more people to be able to hear music? We need to give up on sound quality to a certain point since it is an outdoor concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour thoughts are exactly the same as mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maestro Carras and Jun Hyuk\u2019s agreeing opinion put the concert planners at ease. They can give up on sound quality and gear the direction toward doing a service for the citizens of New York.</p><br/><p>Once this news was out, more people swarmed to Damrosch Park.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. Are you going to put some change into today\u2019s performance too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s impossible. Even changing the tempo is scary. I\u2019m thinking of performing like we did yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk waved his hand as Dimitri Carras laughed softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not talking about your conducting but your piano. Can I expect a different piano from that of yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same for that as well. You can enjoy a new piano with a new pianist. I\u2019ll perform in the same way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNew?\u201d</p><br/><p>Maestro Carras\u2019 face darkened because he knew what it meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re saying you won\u2019t continue working with the New York Philharmonic? I was thinking of performing with you again in the fall repertoire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there a lot of pianists who would come in a heartbeat if you call? Even New Yorkers will get tired of it if it\u2019s constantly the same performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to get tired of it if it\u2019s someone like you with a unique sound. It\u2019s hard to find something as fun as performing with you\u2026 This is upsetting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to find fun in performing a new song with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see that confidence? You must tell me if you write a new song. You need to premiere it with our New York Philharmonic. Promise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Carras thought that they would be able to come across a new work by fall at the latest since Jun Hyuk is always writing new music. His face quickly brightened as he thought of experiencing fresh surprise again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. Isaac told me that you turned the Seattle Symphony down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I think I\u2019m still lacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I heard differently. I heard you said it needs to be better than Seattle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Are you saying that Isaac said that to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. I\u2019m joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Carras laughed at Jun Hyuk\u2019s surprise and then became serious again. He wanted Jun Hyuk to take his next words seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of recommending you as my successor when I retire from the New York Philharmonic, so don\u2019t turn it down then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould the New York Philharmonic ever let go of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Karajan, so a lifetime contract isn\u2019t possible. It\u2019ll change in 5 years if it\u2019s long-term and 3 if it\u2019s short. They used an old man like me for so long, so they\u2019ll definitely want a young conductor as my successor\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure if it\u2019s you, the board would unanimously agree. The orchestra is in love with you too, so there\u2019s no issue there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than being surprised by Dimitri Carras\u2019 words, Jun Hyuk first wondered if President Stern had not pushed for Seattle yesterday because of this.</p><br/><p>He said 5 years at most. If he is certain for Carras\u2019 successor, there is no reason to spend 2 years with Seattle. The New York Philharmonic\u2019s status has fallen a bit, but it is still the orchestra representing America. Jun Hyuk\u2019s heart began to beat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your kind words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. If you just gain some more experience from now on \u2013 actually the question is whether or not you even need that \u2013 no one doubts that you\u2019ll become the greatest conductor in the world. It\u2019s not just me. I\u2019m sure all maestros are thinking the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>His comfortable mindset flowed naturally into his performance. Music of a drowsy weekend afternoon permeated the park through the piano, violin, and orchestra.</p><br/><p>Maestro Carras\u2019 baton moved in a relaxed manner. Right now, the New York Philharmonic\u2019s music is not an art that needs to be focused on but background music for the park. It is a performance that shows another role of music.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s performance at 8 did not have less of an audience. The people actually laid back and relaxed as they breathed in the fresh summer air.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk said that he would conduct in the same way he did yesterday, but he conducted in a slightly slower tempo so as not to break the tranquil atmosphere.</p><br/><p>It may be difficult to notice this minute difference in tempo, but he conducted so that the performers fully knew his intention.</p><br/><p>The orchestra also performed in a relaxed state, and this comfortable choral symphony spread out into the night sky above Damrosch Park.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cYou always show us something new. You changed the vibe completely with such a small change in tempo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was surprised again. He said that there wouldn\u2019t be a surprise show. That he would give the same performance he did yesterday. But\u2026 Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the concert, everyone related to the production celebrated the end of all of the performances in a Lincoln Center hall reserved for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that wasn\u2019t planned. Today\u2019s performance was totally the orchestra\u2019s stage. I was just faithful to my role in keeping the tempo. We just delivered the orchestra\u2019s feeling of being encompassed by the park\u2019s easy going atmosphere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that you\u2019re already so connected with the orchestra that you don\u2019t even need words? That\u2019s even scarier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Realizing the conductor\u2019s intent just by looking at his eyes, and recognizing the orchestra\u2019s state from listening to the first note \u2013 it is like the relationship of an old married couple. It is what every conductor wants. That is why there are lifetime conductors.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not just me. Everyone would have had the same feeling. Everyone really melted into the comfortable atmosphere of the park today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The difference between the theater and park is not the sound, but the attitude toward the music. It is the difference between appreciating the music and feeling it like a wind that is momentarily warding off the summer heat.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the concert is over now, what are your plans going forward?\u201d</p><br/><p>The New York Philharmonic asked as they have a lot of interest in Jun Hyuk\u2019s happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. I don\u2019t really have any special plans made yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know those plans well.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern appeared out of nowhere, put his arms around Jun Hyuk\u2019s shoulders, and waved to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of places who want our friend. But he\u2019s going to just rest for at least a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? You\u2019ll just be resting for a month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laughed as well and put his arm around Stern\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s summer vacation when everyone is taking a break. If you can, go to my villa in Switzerland and rest. And it\u2019d be fine for everyone to go. Mr. Yoon, Amelia, Danny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern. Thank you, but I need to go to Philadelphia tomorrow. I have a concert scheduled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny had been listening to the maestros quietly when he spoke with a flushed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was decided in the morning. My agent told me. A solo concert for 2 days. And a concert with the Philadelphia Philharmonic. We\u2019re planning on performing in September.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, congratulations. So what about the repertoire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Yoon. It\u2019s Paganini and Brahms.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been able to be relaxed and give a steady performance today because of the concert atmosphere, but also because he received the request from the Philadelphia Philharmonic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we should save the young people, shouldn\u2019t we? They\u2019re going to be smothered if they keep hanging out with old people like us.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern spoke to Jun Hyuk and Danny.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, Danny. We\u2019ll let you go, so get going. It\u2019s late. Go before Amelia tears me apart. I\u2019ll go to the apartment tomorrow, so let\u2019s go into the details then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk and Danny said their goodbyes to the people at the party and left. They rushed to the apartment to spend some time to themselves. When they left the party, they saw a familiar face waiting for them outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cCollin!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There were kids who roamed into the back streets after school to smoke.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s radar caught 4 schoolgirls. Two were smoking cigarettes and two were distracted by their smart phones.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you girls think you\u2019re smoking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk turned around after he had pretended to be passing by and punched the two girls who were smoking. He then smacked the two girls who had been looking at their phones and took their phones.</p><br/><p>He knew that he had succeeded when he saw the girls were recoiling in fear. Even without using force, Jun Hyuk\u2019s long hair, dirty and worn clothing, and odor were enough to scare the young schoolgirls.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and take the money out of your wallets or I\u2019ll break these phones.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he raised the phone to smash it to the floor, the owner clumsily took her wallet out and handed it to him. The two girls who had been smoking before Jun Hyuk punched them were standing with their hands to their cheeks, unable to lift their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. What are you guys doing? Hurry up and take out your money.\u201d</p><br/><p>He kicked the two girls slumped on the floor a few times and they took out their wallets. He shoved the money from the four girls\u2019 wallets into his pocket and quickly fled out of the alley, towards the main street.</p><br/><p>All he had in his pocket were a few dollar bills and one 5 dollar bill. Maybe it was because they were middle schoolers, but there wasn\u2019t one 10 dollar bill.</p><br/><p>When he came out onto the main street and some boys who weren\u2019t in uniforms walking with some in uniforms looked at Jun Hyuk in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that bastard\u2026 isn\u2019t he that bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk recognized them as the guys who had been going around looking for him right away and ran back into the alley.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Catch that kid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s heart started beating as wildly as the countless footsteps that were chasing him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

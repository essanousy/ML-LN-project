Forget recording, isn\u2019t it over if you haven\u2019t even been able to arrange the song yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik was frowning at a Kim Jong Suk who had run to the broadcast station himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. We haven\u2019t been able to arrange the song yet because it can\u2019t be expressed as an instrumental. He needs to sing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJong Suk. Why is Jun Hyuk being like that with \u2018Must Erase You in this Sadness\u2019? It\u2019s not even very unique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lyrics aren\u2019t about breaking up, but about the moment two people turn from each other after they break up.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Kim Jong Suk thought of the song, he recalled a scene as though from a movie.</p><br/><p>\u201cI showed him the version that Lee So Ra sang on purpose. If you fit it all together well, the picture becomes clear.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how Producer Kim Ki Sik tried to fit the pieces together, a special picture did not appear.</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk began to go through the details for Producer Kim Ki Sik who could not put the pieces together.</p><br/><p>Leaning on a cold wall</p><br/><p>Watching a dawn coming brighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis means she wandered until dawn after breaking up since couples don\u2019t meet at dawn to break up. Whether they met at night or at dinner, she wasn\u2019t able to brush it off and go back home. It was that difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now I must leave your side.</p><br/><p>Though I might regret leaving your side</p><br/><p>It\u2019s because I love you.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe truly loved him, but decided that breaking up is better for the other person. Since the singer is Lee So Ra, this was the woman\u2019s decision. And the reason why I didn\u2019t let him listen to the version by Lee Hyun Woo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik started to listen to Kim Jong Suk\u2019s interpretation with interest.</p><br/><p>I love you but I can\u2019t help but leave.</p><br/><p>This moment is so hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it means that breaking up is great suffering for the woman as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though I only cause you pain</p><br/><p>You\u2019ll be able to understand me one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is important. \u2018You\u2019ll be able to understand me one day\u2019. There will inevitably be a day when he understands the reason why they broke up, the reason why this was the only choice. This is the most important message to deliver to Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Goodbye, my love</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not [my former love], but [my love]. She\u2019s not saying that her love faded, but is confessing that she still loves him. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo why are you saying that this makes Jun Hyuk look back at himself? What\u2019s the relation to the lyrics?\u201d</p><br/><p>A scene where a man and woman who are in love, break up. What is he saying is special? Producer Kim Ki Sik could not understand Kim Jong Suk\u2019s interpretation yet.</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk looked at Producer Kim pathetically,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? You still don\u2019t know? Your imagination is too short for a producer of a music program.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJong Suk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it carefully. The woman is Jun Hyuk\u2019s biological mother. The man is Jun Hyuk himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Ki Sik yelled as he had just understood it.</p><br/><p>These lyrics were the story of the day that Jun Hyuk was abandoned.</p><br/><p>After leaving a baby at the door of an orphanage, a woman who cannot leave and leans on a wall in an alley. That woman\u2019s confession.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk cried hard when he first heard this song. But after crying for a while, he expressed the joy of farewells on the piano.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJoy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He thought that his mother did this for him. It was because she loves him and not because he was bothersome or because she did not love him. For him. That\u2019s why he was happy. Of course, we don\u2019t know if this is true or not. Jun Hyuk\u2019s mother who abandoned him is the only person who can know, but Jun Hyuk thought the same way as the lyrics.\u201d</p><br/><p>Emotions came through the listener. The composer melted his intentions into a song and the audience melted their emotions out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he had listened to Lee So Ra\u2019s song and freely gushed his feelings, he wouldn\u2019t have needed to sing. He can express himself on the piano and guitar. That\u2019s why he was able to create the piano song. But he said that he would forget it. He\u2019s brushing it off so he doesn\u2019t have to think about it twice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s on-the-spot piano. That was the song that Jun Hyuk had interpreted from Lee So Ra.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he needs to arrange the song for the mission. He needs to do it from his mother\u2019s position and not by his emotions. He can change the melody. He\u2019s only controlled rhythm and inserted parts, so he can\u2019t express lyrics. That\u2019s why Jun Hyuk hasn\u2019t been able to finish the arrangement yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed cruel. Kim Ki Sik is the one who had thought that it was necessary to rub salt in his wounds. However, as Kim Jong Suk had assured, Jun Hyuk did not run away or quit. He was looking back at himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim. Send him back to me once the 2nd stage is over. Something will come out after 2 weeks. Can you wait a little longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can I do when you\u2019ve pushed me into another corner? I\u2019ll have to wait, won\u2019t I? Just make it so he isn\u2019t absent for the live stage. If you can\u2019t get him to sing, just make sure he has a great instrumental.\u201d</p><br/><p>Singing could wait just a bit. Now it was time for the orchestra.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

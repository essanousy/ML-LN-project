Do you remember for movies as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. No. I can remember the music, but not the movies. So I have trouble remembering scenes with only dialogue and no music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you remember all of the music in the movie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s easy. If the music and video are not in harmony, it\u2019s hard to focus on the movie because of the bothersome music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louis O\u2019Connell felt his heart pound faster. Jun Hyuk brought up the perfect harmony between video and music that all directors seek. He asked Jun Hyuk the most important question,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have standards on film music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 I\u2019m sure the audience can\u2019t feel the music when they watch a movie. Music is a way to support the video message. The visuals become overwhelmed if the music is too strong. But it needs to be good to listen to as a separate track.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louis O\u2019Connell realized that the perfect music director is sitting across from him. He spoke cautiously with a trembling heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cFilming ends soon. I\u2019ll end the editing quickly and send it over. I hope you won\u2019t turn it down even if the movie falls short a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019re an incredible director. You\u2019re being too modest. I\u2019m also anticipating it because it seems like it\u2019ll be fun work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s response basically means that he has come halfway to accepting. Louis O\u2019Connell\u2019s face brightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut can you tell me who the main actor is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t want entertainment programs on TV. It\u2019s all been announced. It\u2019ll be Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Robert De Niro.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes sparkled. Louis O\u2019Connell knew what it meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall I arrange for a dinner or something? If you would like that, I mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that for real? Is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>The seriousness had gone away and his excitement at the possibility of meeting Hollywood stars is him as an average person in his 20s. Louis O\u2019Connell laughed and took out his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHang on. Let me ask about Anne\u2019s schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Anne? Anne Hathaway?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk grimaced and waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t know that woman well. I was talking about Robert De Niro. \u2018Raging Bull,\u2019 \u2018Godfather II,\u2019 \u2018Goodfellas\u2019. And the real masterpiece, \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk started listing movies that came out before he was born, Louis O\u2019Connell\u2019s eyes widened. Most people in their 20s do not remember Robert De Niro in \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019 unless they are film fanatics.</p><br/><p>There is no way for Louis O\u2019Connell to know that Jun Hyuk\u2019s cultural life began with Yoon Kwang Hun, a man in his 40s.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The synopsis and script that Louis O\u2019Connell provided, created waves in record marketing. His plans were done with special effects for a documentary, filming outside without a set.</p><br/><p>Since there was not much time for the record label and director, there was a way to work as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>It took 2 days to film a music video that was barely 4 minutes long. Jun Hyuk and the band had to stand in front of a blue screen and keep changing their clothes while singing the same song dozens of times.</p><br/><p>Excluding Alvin who has a lot of experience, the 3 of them had fun in the beginning but started to get tired and annoyed after a little time passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho suddenly apologized to Jun Hyuk in the middle of filming.</p><br/><p>\u201cI secretly cursed you for your meticulous directing while we recorded. But you were nothing compared to that director.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>There were 2 big events in New York on December 23. One was the New York Philharmonic\u2019s year end concert and the other was the showcase for Alvin Lee and Jun Hyuk\u2019s album .</p><br/><p>The main person for the album is Alvin Lee, so Jun Hyuk made sure not to miss out on the New York Philharmonic\u2019s concert. Half of the interest in the New York Philharmonic\u2019s show is about Jun Hyuk, so it is also a good opportunity for promotion.</p><br/><p>Reporters were camped outside Lincoln Center Avery Hall, waiting for Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk is the only person that they absolutely need to get an interview from today. This is because each city\u2019s maestros had not been able to attend because of their own year end concerts.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk\u2019s limousine arrived at the concert hall, reporters encircled it and started pressing the camera shutters. The middle-aged couple that got out first took in the flashing cameras with confused expressions, and the reporters did not look much different either.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you with Maestro Jun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, but what is your relationship?\u201d</p><br/><p>The couple hesitated and could not respond to the reporters\u2019 questions, while Jun Hyuk and Tara got out of the car and the microphones were directed to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. Will you first tell us your thoughts on today\u2019s show?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to thank Maestro Carras and the New York Philharmonic. Though it\u2019s a song that I wrote, I have never been able to perform it properly. I did record it, but that was through shortcuts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laughed and looked around at the reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sitting back and comfortably enjoying that song for the first time today. Of course I am happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a showcase going on in Manhattan today. Please say something about your new album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 You\u2019ll be able to hear Alvin\u2019s honest singing. The music is as great as today\u2019s performance will be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s group got through the reporters and went into the concert hall. There was not a single empty seat, and it was evident that the hall was full of curiosity regarding the music rather than expectation.</p><br/><p>The orchestra members\u2019 expressions were bright as they walked out on stage. As it said on the placards, they were not wearing headphones or earphones.</p><br/><p>Moments later, conductor Carras entered to passionate cheering. Dimitri Carras smiled and greeted the audience before standing on the podium.</p><br/><p>At that moment, most of the audience gulped and held their armrests tightly. They are preparing to face and endure the music.</p><br/><p>As soon as the conductor\u2019s baton moved, the stringed instruments\u2019 uneasy sound started to come out lightly. As soon as the strings\u2019 melody began, Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyebrows wriggled.</p><br/><p>After almost 3 minutes, Jun Hyuk realized exactly what Dimitri Carras meant when he said that he is looking at the music objectively and from a third party\u2019s view.</p><br/><p>Looking around, people in the audience were frowning. There were also those staring blankly with their mouths open, focusing on the stage. It is an entirely different scene from when Petrenko conducted the 1st part with Berlin Philharmonic, and everyone left their seats without being able to withstand it.</p><br/><p>The music did not cause pain. It was just uncomfortable. There were times when everything in front of them looked blood red or as though a demon form was present, but the audience seemed to know precisely that that is an illusion.</p><br/><p>When the 1st part was over after more than 10 minutes, sighing could be heard from everywhere in the audience. However, not a single person left their seat.</p><br/><p>When the 2nd part began, Jun Hyuk wanted to clap loudly. Since Inferno was revealed to the world, this is the first time that the 2nd part is being performed in a concert hall.</p><br/><p>Unlike Jun Hyuk\u2019s recorded CD, the tempo changed. Unexpected parts were speedy, and moments that needed to pass by like a storm were weak and slow, changing the parts that needed to be endured with difficulty. It even felt like he was breathtakingly following the limitations of permissibility from the score.</p><br/><p>Conductor Carras finished performing until the 4th part, and did not move while holding onto the podium handrail. The orchestra members also had their heads down and were panting.</p><br/><p>When the conductor did not turn around, there were short bursts of clapping among the silent audience, and then everyone stood up to start clapping. It is not an enthusiastic cheering however. It was encouragement for the toil that the New York Philharmonic had gone through.</p><br/><p>This reaction is the general audience\u2019s evaluation of Jun Hyuk\u2019s Inferno. It is difficult and interesting music, but there is no philosophical message or emotional charge. It is as though they decided that is sound, not music.</p><br/><p>When the applause faded, Dimitri Carras turned and greeted the audience by bowing. The orchestra followed suit, getting up from their seats to bow before quietly leaving the stage.</p><br/><p>As though they had waited for the New York Philharmonic to leave, the audience quickly left. There was no curtain call.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not move until everyone had left. When the couple who had come with Jun Hyuk also left and the theater was completely empty, Tara cautiously spoke up,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. You\u2019re not going to go to the waiting room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I think it\u2019ll be better to just go. I need to join the showcase too. And\u2026 Maestro Carras will want to be alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You think the concert was a failure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe performed up to the 4th part. This in itself is a success. I thought it was okay, but I think critics are going to give bad reviews when they compare it with the album. He chose a method that was too safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara did not miss the ray of disappointment that passed over Jun Hyuk\u2019s face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

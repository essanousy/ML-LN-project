The feast\u2019s hostess had asked politely. And it is courtesy to request to hear a musician\u2019s music if invited. But Jun Hyuk who had rejected without a particular reason was being ill-mannered.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at Queen Mathilda and spoke up in order to clear the situation,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd honestly, there\u2019s something people like more than my piano or conducting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it. I\u2019m doing all sorts of things.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it much more than my piano.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk pushed his chair back and stood up. He spoke to the other tables.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Everyone, look at the 3 glasses in front of you. Wine, champagne, and the last is water, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s attention shot over to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I give you the signal, take your fork and lightly tap any one of the 3 glasses. Like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk used his fork to tap the 3 glasses one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hit all 3 glasses like I did. Just pick one, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone held their forks in their hands and looked at the glasses in front of them, including the queen.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. One, two, three.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk said 3, the sound of forks and glasses clinking spread out.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk moved his finger for a moment and laughed quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWine, 24 people. Champagne, 26 people. And water was 18 people. Is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked astonished. Does this mean he distinguished between the sounds that rang at the same time? Someone needed to check, but Jun Hyuk did not give them the time to.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk flicked his finger. He met eyes with the attendant and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201c3 people have completely empty glasses. One person is wine and two people are champagne.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk spoke, the people with the empty glasses held them up high. They could see one wine glass and two champagne glasses. This basically proved that Jun Hyuk\u2019s numbers were correct.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled when he saw that the two queens\u2019 jaws had dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t this much more fun than a piano performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two queens could not respond because they were still in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we raise the level of difficulty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk held his fork up again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, we\u2019ll include all of the tableware. Before that, I\u2019ll check to see what sound each makes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hit each of the plates on his table with his fork to check the sounds they make.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, everyone. Again. One, two, three.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk\u2019s signal came, a sound with more variety rang this time.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk picked up the plates on his table one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were 8 people who hit this plate. Please raise your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Precisely 8 people raised their hands. People started murmuring when they confirmed the number.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk said the numbers by plate and glass, and people shouted or whistled when the numbers matched up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 There\u2019s always that one person who is doing something else. The person who hit the table instead of a plate. And there\u2019s someone who hit the chair leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was suddenly clapping. When Queen Mathilda smiled brightly and clapped, everyone yelled bravo and applauded Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible? I saw it with my own eyes, but I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Queen Mathilda was looking at Jun Hyuk, wide-eyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty. Maestro Jun is able to differentiate between the sounds that people in an orchestra of over 200 make. And that\u2019s for a performance that goes over 1 hour. This right now is really easy for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Pierre Boulez politely explained on Jun Hyuk\u2019s behalf, the two queens had looks of disbelief again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whew \u2013 This means I haven\u2019t made a mistake, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>The cold air inside had become warm again with Jun Hyuk\u2019s magic show.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019ll be performing with the New York Philharmonic, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that is right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to make something to do there if I can, just to go watch you perform.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern had said that knowing the royal family will be helpful in the future, but Jun Hyuk had made the two queens into his fans.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. Why didn\u2019t you play the piano? Squash the pianists\u2019 energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny spoke in regret in the returning limousine after the feast.</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny. Will you play the violin if the queen asks you to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s an honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh \u2013 Why can\u2019t you get your senses?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk poked Danny\u2019s side, looking at him pathetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a professional performer. You need to be paid to perform. Whatever the situation is. What honor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only perform for free if it\u2019s a charity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying you refused to play because of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny was shocked in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not exactly\u2026 But now that I think about it, that\u2019s what I should do. Look. They said they\u2019ll come for the New York performance. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny looked at Jun Hyuk\u2019s joking laugh and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Belgian queen\u2019s salary is $2 million. Why should I perform for them for free? From now on, there are no performances except at events where the rich are donating money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Then why did you show them a good time with your perfect pitch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny smirked at Jun Hyuk, who looked as though he had made a tremendous decision. Jun Hyuk is greatly mistaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be paid to do that. And the atmosphere had gotten so cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you do know. If you really hadn\u2019t done anything, it would have been a big deal that you have no manners.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny talked about the tacit etiquette that exists between the host and guest.</p><br/><p>\u201cInviting a musician and requesting to hear his music means they enjoyed the music that much. It would have been more ill-mannered if we had only eaten and she hadn\u2019t asked to hear your music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then I have to perform at places like that from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you were taught from the way you greeted the Queen. You weren\u2019t told anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. Tara only showed me how to exchange greetings and didn\u2019t tell me the really important things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one would think that you would outright reject the Queen\u2019s request. That\u2019s the same for Tara.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny kept sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you had played the piano today and that had been great, the Queen would have donated on her own capacity. She could give it to you\u2026 or the competition committee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You showed them something more incredible just as you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny jabbed Jun Hyuk\u2019s side in revenge. Jun Hyuk looked at Danny and remembered something.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Danny. You\u2019re going to tour with the finalists, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I am the winner. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen carefully because I\u2019m telling you in advance. Of course a formal request is going to go through your manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that I\u2019m going to be performing with the New York Philharmonic, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Conducting for the New York Philharmonic. And with your song at that! Amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny\u2019s heart started beating with anticipation. Jun Hyuk can choose the violin soloist to go up on his own stage. Has he chosen him as the soloist?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Maestro Carras is going to be performing my choral concerto. I\u2019m conducting Beethoven\u2019s choral symphony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Really? I thought you were doing the choral concerto. The 21st century Beethoven is conducting the choral symphony of Beethoven from 200 years ago? That\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re switching because it\u2019s for an event. Anyway, Maestro Carras is looking at you for the choral concerto violin soloist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny could not believe that Maestro Carras himself had singled him out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I wanted you to be the one to do it too, but Maestro Carras saw you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, you really didn\u2019t arrange it?\u201d</p><br/><p>If the composer is stubborn, soloists can be appointed according to his wishes. Danny knows well enough that Jun Hyuk is not one to tell such lies, but he wanted to make sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you I didn\u2019t! He watched you perform and chose you. He called the day we performed. This means he didn\u2019t pick you because you\u2019re the winner. You were chosen on your performance alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had finally been called by one of the top 3 philharmonics in the world. On top of that, the performance is a special event. It is obvious that it will receive the entire world\u2019s attention. Danny jumped inside the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny, it\u2019s not something to just be happy about. You need to think hard about it. I just thought that it was a good thing when I first heard, but this could just be twice. It\u2019s a performance that finishes after doing it 3 times at the most. But the tour with the Belgian National Orchestra is 2 months. Discuss with your manager to see which is better and make your decision.</p><br/><p>Danny quickly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s New York. It\u2019s a special event, but it becomes a completely different matter following the kind of performance I give. And performing with Maestro Carras is an incredible opportunity. Every word he says is a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll call Stern Corporation now to consult with your manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny could not hear Jun Hyuk. He was already imagining himself standing on stage with the New York Philharmonic.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

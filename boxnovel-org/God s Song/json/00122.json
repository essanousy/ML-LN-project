So I\u2019m off to my X-country trip today. I wanted to leave you guys with a translation before I left &lt;3 Enjoy!]</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not look at Coline and spoke quietly,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour band Violon is a bit old. Hey, don\u2019t get mad. It\u2019s not something bad. Your music has a strong feeling of heavy metals from the 70s and 80s. While the riff and melody are alternative rock.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline also knew what Jun Hyuk was talking about. Old music. However, Coline loved the old music that showed each player\u2019s grandiosity much more than he likes the simple and strong alternative rock of current times.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe important thing is that you have to choose. You can do the music you want to and appeal to only the audience that will love your music. But if you\u2019d like to match yourselves to a changed audience, you\u2019ll need to get rid of that heavy metal feel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have our own color. Even if it\u2019s old.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this, but it falls short to become a star with just your band\u2019s color and the music you want to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was known to give frank evaluations. It is also the most precise evaluation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe song is good. The only problem is what color you give that song. The important thing is that no matter what color you give it, the nature of it doesn\u2019t change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Trees change the color of their leaves according to the season. A ginkgo tree that is green in the summer begins to yellow in the fall. However, there is no change to the fact that it is a ginkgo tree.</p><br/><p>\u201cArranging doesn\u2019t ever change the nature. So you have to make the choice. Are you going to maintain the present color and arranging it so it\u2019s refined? Or do you want to make it refreshing by getting rid of all traces of the old heavy metal? Coline, I\u2019ll do it the way you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline yearning for success was greater than his desire to stick to his unique color.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you said\u2026 Jun, you take it in the direction you want since I\u2019ve requested it of you. Our band Violon\u2019s producer is you right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Jun Hyuk arranged each of Violon\u2019s 5 songs, he even finished playing them himself. Unlike the last time he arranged for them, the band\u2019s guitarist and drummer did not make any objections and started practice according to Jun Hyuk\u2019s arrangement. They had received a call from a top agency because of Jun Hyuk. With a little more luck, they might be able to debut.</p><br/><p>They were full of the thought that they could not throw away an opportunity from the heavens just because of their pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cColine. I\u2019m going to go first because I have something personal to take care of. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to perform this fine if you practice the arranged songs for two days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline and his band members exchanged looks for a moment before nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen practice today and tomorrow, and let\u2019s go to LA the day after. Tell the man from LA that he can go back first if he can\u2019t stand the cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk saw Coline focus on practice before leaving the studio and started walking quickly. Jun Hyuk arrived at the place where Coline and his band had recorded their first song.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, do you remember me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Perfect boy. Of course I remember you. What brings you here? To record?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Perfect\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. That\u2019s the nickname the people working at this recording studio gave you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled and said his reason for coming,</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I use one of your recording booths? I\u2019d like to use it today and tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll empty one no matter what. It\u2019s a joy to listen to your music. So, is there anything else you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only going to play the guitar and keyboard today. I brought the guitar, so just set a keyboard up. We\u2019ll need both source and mixing for the tracks. We\u2019re going to record the drums and bass tomorrow\u2026 please set up the bass guitar and drums with these.\u201d</p><br/><p>The engineer\u2019s eyes widened when he saw the note Jun Hyuk handed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? How many tam-tams is this? Will his arms even reach?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Is it possible to get this ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is possible\u2026 but the bass guitar and the drum set\u2026 It\u2019s too expensive. The renting fees will be high.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine since there\u2019s no issue with the fees.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what are you recording for 2 days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else could it be? Of course it\u2019s music. We\u2019re going to record 10 songs. Please pay attention. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the recording studio staff members\u2019 jaws dropped. It is surprising when someone says that they will record 10 songs over two days, but it does happen. Poor musicians need to record as much as they can in the time that they rent the studio.</p><br/><p>Their jaws dropped because of the guitar that came out of Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar case.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 That\u2026 It\u2019s a custom. Who are you? Are you royalty in Asia?\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a shabby studio in a New York alley. In this place where amateur bands come to record, this is the first youth to come in with a guitar worth over $10,000. He had appeared in person with a guitar that everyone had only looked at and drooled over.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift from my father. And that\u2019s how I came to New York. Alright, there isn\u2019t much time. Let\u2019s start quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put the headphones on in the recording booth and started playing. He had asked Coline for a simple intensity, but Jun Hyuk\u2019s performance now was the opposite. He created a grand and explosive guitar phrase.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, it\u2019s just 4 or 5 days. Why do you have so much stuff?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I have to go to Japan from LA.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJapan? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess the album I released in Korea is doing well in Japan. I have to attend some promotion event and I\u2019m going to see people I\u2019ve missed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing words like album, promotion, and Japan made Coline realize the reality that Jun Hyuk is a professional musician.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 really are a star in Korea. You\u2019ve already broken through Japan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow that it\u2019s an honor. There\u2019ll be a day when your music goes flying off shelves just because I did the producing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laughed and spoke as if joking, but Coline thought that it could be a prediction of the future.</p><br/><p>Los Angeles, the other half of American culture from New York.</p><br/><p>If New York has the New York Philharmonic, New York Ballet Company, and New York Metropolitan Museum as its representatives of traditional art, LA is the place where innovative and experimental artists gather.</p><br/><p>LA is the place that exhibits works that become social controversies and create echos without hesitation.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk and Coline\u2019s party came out of the airport, there was no space for them on the platform for buses and taxis. There was a surging crowd from all over America, coming to LA to get out of the cold.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk and Coline\u2019s party was also in an uncomfortable situation because they did not know how they were going to get into the city with all of their instruments. While Coline and his band members were calculating how much it would cost to take two cabs, Jun Hyuk was on the phone.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk got off the phone, he gave a look to the band to follow him and took lead.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, where are you going? The taxi platform is on this side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline called for Jun Hyuk to stop while pushing a cart full of luggage, but Jun Hyuk\u2019s response was entirely unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently the reserved limousine is here. They said there\u2019s a lot of traffic on the road to the airport. Said it might take over 2 hours to get us into the city?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Limousine? What limousine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I reserved it. To go to the hotel comfortably. We can\u2019t suffer when we have big business to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver of a long 6-seater limousine discovered Jun Hyuk waving his hand and bowed politely.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

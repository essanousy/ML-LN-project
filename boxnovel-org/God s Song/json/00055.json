Where is my boss right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just spoke with him. He\u2019s resting in a place with fresh air. Stop worrying about him and answer me. You want to get a sincere apology and end it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? End it with something like that? We have to ruin them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow? Should we go beat them up? Set a fire and run?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk only knew how teenagers fought and did not know how to finish someone without a physical altercation.</p><br/><p>He felt how pathetic he was because all he could do was clench his fists and swear.</p><br/><p>\u201cKwang Hun told me that you\u2019re weak against the strong and strong against the weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was questioning whether this lawyer who had been smirking at him since they first met was really someone that his boss trusted. In this situation, he should be expressing anger with him or at least being serious. This man was acting as though he were having fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo? I heard you said that you have to be quick-witted and a coward to survive?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only when Baek Seung Ho threw his cigarette on the floor and put it out with his shoe that he stopped smiling,</p><br/><p>\u201cMost people are like that. What are you to do? If I act strong in front of someone with power, I\u2019m the only one who gets hurt, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo are you a coward too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not like that. Do you know why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say it. Why do you keep asking me questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. You have a quick temper. Actually, I\u2019m really strong. There\u2019s almost no one stronger than me in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a really famous lawyer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. My company is really famous and huge. If I want to, I can ruin them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you can ruin all of the assholes who wrote these articles?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m going to make them crawl. But there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy company and I don\u2019t exist just to punish bad people. We get paid to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have money. I got $20,000 as an advertising model. I\u2019ll give you all of it, please ruin them for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c$20,000? You can\u2019t get someone like me to work for just $20,000. You have to give me ten times more than that. And even that\u2019s cheap, but it\u2019s because I\u2019m close with Kwang Hun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten times $20,000. It was an amount difficult to even imagine. Jun Hyuk had needed to count the zeros in his modeling fee.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, so what are you telling me to do? I don\u2019t have the money.\u201d</p><br/><p>The swearing he had been holding back because this man was his boss\u2019 close friend came out involuntarily. However, the lawyer did not seem to mind. He was smiling again,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it on credit. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCredit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Once this program ends, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll make money. Pay me back with that money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then you tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you going to finish them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho thought that he had done enough to prevent Jun Hyuk from quitting the program. Having endurance in order to reach a goal is what it meant to be an adult.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe best way to finish off an adult is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoney!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk spoke before Baek Seung Ho finished his sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re smart. The best way to ruin an adult is to take his money. Not by stealing it, but in a legal way. That\u2019s exactly what a lawyer like me does. Our job is to lawfully take money, which is what adults consider most important.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking their money. Jun Hyuk remembered when he had mugged kids on the street. There were more people who fought back for their money than they did to avoid getting hit. They fought back harder the more money they had in their pockets. Adults were not different.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to act as if you don\u2019t know anything about what\u2019s going on. You\u2019ll understand because you\u2019ve gotten into fights before. When the opponent is throwing punches like crazy, you have to step back for a second and wait until he\u2019s tired out before you give that last swing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. These guys aren\u2019t tired enough yet. In exactly 10 days from now, they\u2019re going to be still because they\u2019re tired. That\u2019s when I\u2019m going to finish them. You understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll make all the people who made Kwang Hun a bad person angrier than you are right now, so just wait. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have to make a lot of money to pay me back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo do well on this program. Then you\u2019ll be able to make enough to pay back the credit easily. What I mean is that you can\u2019t cause accidents. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk understood well enough but did not think that it would be as easy to do.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next morning, Jun Hyuk did not get up from his bed until the staff came into his room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Jang Jun Hyuk! What are you doing? All the other kids are waiting on the bus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rest today. I\u2019m not in the mood to go out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? We were too lax with this kid\u2026 Are you here to play? You think you get to rest because you feel like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk sat up abruptly,</p><br/><p>\u201cShi\u2026 Then? What are you going to do? Are you going to kick me out? Fuck\u2026 I\u2019ll leave if you want me to. Happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laid back in his bed again.</p><br/><p>Unlike the rumors about him, Jun Hyuk had obediently followed the schedule. They had worried that he might resist, but they never thought that he would act so rudely.</p><br/><p>The staff had been able to put up with teenagers like this cursing for the past 10 years because their seniors had built up with their tolerance with harsher words.</p><br/><p>Also, they were positive that something that happened because he changed overnight as if he were a different person. Their first thought was that they needed to check the cameras installed in the dorm and ask the other kids what had happened last night.</p><br/><p>The staff slammed the door closed and went back to the bus where the other kids were waiting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

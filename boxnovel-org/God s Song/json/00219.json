It was mostly filled with youths. These vigorous youths react with their bodies first. They are not uncomfortable with the young maestro\u2019s interpretation that undressed Beethoven. They reacted to the dramatic and fierce melody first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about how he undressed Beethoven?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t feel it? Today\u2019s choral symphony is not Ode to Joy. He showed the rude and arrogant Beethoven. We\u2019ve gone back in time 200 years to see Beethoven for ourselves. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were a lot of different evaluations. There were people saying, \u2018The most rude and arrogant of thousands of performances of choral symphony\u2019, a style of \u2018malignity\u2019 that overburdened Beethoven, and that it showed him as a \u2018rebel\u2019 of the time.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled as he looked at the New York Philharmonic members who could not hide their excitement. Their expressions were a praise that touched him more than the audience\u2019s fierce tribute had.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. I\u2019ve been playing the violin for 30 years, but I felt like I had gone back to my younger days. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve played with passion rather than emotion and my head\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat passion was relayed to me. It was an incredible performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bandmaster Samuel Gilberto could not hide the flush in his cheeks and embraced Jun Hyuk warmly. While he was speaking with the orchestra including the bandmaster, the maestros encircled him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat performance was meant to completely undress Beethoven, right? Looks like you\u2019ll be hearing some bitter feedback tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what of it? Aren\u2019t they critics who only say negative things anyway? It was work that someone needed to go at least once. Is this one of those things that\u2019s only possible when you\u2019re young? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>A factor that is considered important when interpreting a song is the background of the song\u2019s birth or the situation that the composer was in. The composer\u2019s thoughts and psychological state, according to the circumstances, are bound to be firmly buried in the song.</p><br/><p>Of Mozart specialists, there are many who perform his light works with expressions of anxiety and restlessness. Though he created a light melody for the public, they are trying to show his thoughts precisely. He always craved love and recognition, and had to go around borrowing money because of his difficult economic situation.</p><br/><p>The foundation of today\u2019s performance had shown, not just Beethoven\u2019s feelings, but his inner conflicts. There will be a lot of people who are uncomfortable with the fact that Jun Hyuk has dragged the malignant Beethoven down to the position of average people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does the conductor\u2019s intent matter? You all saw how the audience reacted. We\u2019ll know when the album comes out. I\u2019m positive it\u2019ll see tremendous sales. Judged on music alone, it\u2019ll be able to show that it was the most passive aggressive rendition of choral symphony performed in the past 10 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>The party backstage was not long. There is still the outdoor concert in Damrosch Park. The real party will open after the performance tomorrow.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Danny\u2019s agent shouted gleefully at the endless calls. Planners who saw today\u2019s performances were asking to meet for all types of performances, including solo concerts and collaborations.</p><br/><p>Stern Corporation employees kept receiving calls as well. Even though it was late, they were asking about Jun Hyuk\u2019s future plans and showing their interest in preparing a concert.</p><br/><p>The people gathered in Jun Hyuk\u2019s apartment were celebrating the end of a successful concert with wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Is this why you prevented me from seeing the rehearsals? Honestly, it\u2019s not my style. I like solemn and holy symphonies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Mr. Yoon had been a critic, we would have had a scathing review.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern laughed at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s sullen words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. How should I put it\u2026 It\u2019s like he took a noble relic from the depths of a museum and decorated it in a department store window?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt almost sounds like a compliment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia put her arm around Jun Hyuk\u2019s shoulder and interpreted Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s evaluation differently.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no. It\u2019s not bad criticism, but it\u2019s more so not a compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you saying that it was a performance that anyone could approach, not just those who love classical music? That\u2019s a compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone laughed and enjoyed the aftertaste of the concert, an employee went to President Stern and whispered in his ear. His eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. They are saying that they will send a formal offer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid someone from them come to today\u2019s performance? I didn\u2019t see anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause so many maestros attended today\u2026 They say he was secretive so no one would see. They wouldn\u2019t have wanted to get caught up in unnecessary rumors.\u201d</p><br/><p>When President Stern\u2019s expression grew serious, everyone stopped their conversations and looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, something came up\u2026 Jun, can you come with me for a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern glanced at Jun Hyuk and went up to the 2nd floor bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually something we could announce in front of anyone, but I wanted to be sure. I want to hear your honest thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern is being conscious of Yoon Kwang Hun. He is someone who has a great influence over Jun Hyuk\u2019s decisions. He already knows that Jun Hyuk is willing to force himself to do something if it is what Yoon Kwang Hun wants.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen such a serious expression.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just got a call that Seattle Symphony wants you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Seattle? But, what do they want from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey want to leave Seattle Symphony to you for 2 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was speechless. It is not a one-time special concert. 2 years is a short period, but his first thought was that it is a reckless decision to leave an orchestra to him when he does not even have a career to speak of.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe music director position with Seattle Symphony is vacant right now. They\u2019re rotating through guest conductors, hm\u2026 It could be that your character as a guest conductor is strong since they\u2019ve set 2 years for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was finally able to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why me? I don\u2019t have the experience\u2026 I\u2019ve conducted twice. Isn\u2019t that all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy guess is\u2026 Since Seattle has a strong progressive tendency, they\u2019ll think of that as nothing. They could have looked solely at ability rather than experience and achievements, and there will be something to the show business aspect of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not know what he meant by show business.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruthfully, their situation isn\u2019t good right now\u2026 Concert and album sales are at a low. It wasn\u2019t a bad decision for them since they are the friendliest neighborhood to Asians. From Queen Elisabeth Competition to today, you\u2019re at the center of news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seattle is where Starbucks was first created. It is where guitar hero Jimi Hendrix was born and the place alternative rock legend Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain chose for his tragic death.</p><br/><p>The exhibitions change every month at the Seattle Museum, but the Nirvana and Jimi Hendrix corners stay the same even now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a good condition. They\u2019ll leave the repertoire entirely to you and not interfere with that. I thought that\u2019s a definite, but there\u2019s another meaning to it. It means you can put whatever songs you\u2019ve made or what you\u2019re going to make from now on, on that stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern thought that it was an incredible condition that Jun Hyuk would be able to put whatever song he wants to on stage. But, Jun Hyuk did not look happy or excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake your time to think about it since it\u2019s not urgent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? Is my opinion necessary? It\u2019s important what you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t hurry up and tell me, the empty end date on our contract is going to be filled with today\u2019s date. You would have started making some money too. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk joked as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell well. You only say the scariest things. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern laughed and became serious again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea to go to Seattle if you think of the Seattle Symphony as an instrument that you can tune up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the contract term is just 2 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 2 years in a first contract is meaningless. It\u2019s not a term that they mean to keep no matter what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not the contract term?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure the 2 years doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll say bye to you after 2 years. It\u2019s their demand for you to bring out some kind of result within 2 years. There\u2019ll be an extension if there are results. They\u2019ll be saying bye if there are none.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, the Seattle Symphony is assessing me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. If the results are unbelievably great, they might try to get you to stay on for another 10 years on the next contract. If you bring end game results, it won\u2019t be hard for them to hand over a lifetime contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>Results he could accomplish in 2 seasons. Breakthrough success in concert and album sales, and raising the orchestra\u2019s level. This is what he needs to show them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, the important part of the contract isn\u2019t the term but the details. Aren\u2019t things like your salary, vacations, house, and car more important to you? I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Making the Seattle Symphony into my own instrument.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk thought about the meaning of this thoroughly. He would become the owner of an orchestra, the greatest, grandest, and diverse instrument in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn orchestra\u2019s fame and level are almost entirely dependent on the conductor. The reason why Seattle is so criticized now is because they haven\u2019t had a good conductor in a while and the members\u2019 dissension is great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since an orchestra changes drastically according to the standing conductor, it only takes moments to plummet if it does not meet a good owner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, does that mean I can reject if I don\u2019t need an instrument of my own?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern\u2019s eyes sparkled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. To work with something that\u2019s not even mine for 2 years? The difficult part is going through all of the hard work to make them useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then, reject it for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I see you aren\u2019t after a standing conductor position yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern was not surprised by Jun Hyuk\u2019s rejection, and seemed to welcome it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I would rather experience orchestras right now. Oh, I guess that doesn\u2019t go the way I want it to either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me. I\u2019ll let you get experience until you\u2019re bored of it. There\u2019s going to be a line of orchestras who want to work with you from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern did not want to leave Jun Hyuk tied up in one place as a conductor. He wanted to let him be free until his shining talent was known all around the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s one more thing I\u2019d like to ask for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be conducting choral concerto from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why? Do you know how many places want the composer\u2019s conducting?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern jumped back surprised and Jun Hyuk laughed as he spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cI already conducted it with the Belgian National Orchestra and performed as a pianist. That\u2019s enough. I\u2019m more curious as to how other maestros express my music. I think that more, especially, after hearing Maestro Carras\u2019 concert today.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern looked at Jun Hyuk and burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I guess it won\u2019t be bad to put your work out to the world and see how it changes either.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern stood up. He fully understood Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen rest. I\u2019ll be going. It\u2019ll be good to go to sleep early since there\u2019s the concert tomorrow. You\u2019ll need an acoustic check and rehearsal since it\u2019s an outdoor performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>When President Stern left, everyone went to bed. The concert is not over yet. The real party will open tomorrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. What did you and Isaac talk about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia asked cautiously as she dug deeper into Jun Hyuk\u2019s embrace. She is more curious as to why President Stern did not announce it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, it was nothing. He said the Seattle Symphony got in contact to sign a 2-year contract with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Seattle? Goodness! So? Did you say okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I rejected it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia was so surprised she bolted up in bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t it every conductor\u2019s dream to have an orchestra of his own? Even though it\u2019s only 2 years, you don\u2019t know what might happen after.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 It hasn\u2019t been long since I started playing orchestras as an instrument. I want to get more experience. And Isaac is someone who can support me in the experiences I want. There\u2019s still a lot of time left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia stared at Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? You\u2019re gaining more confidence by the day. Great. You have to have his much confidence if you\u2019re Amelia\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia laughed and laid in Jun Hyuk\u2019s arms again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He just thought that they were people with the ability to make fun and good music.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Their performance skills are lacking and the song is simple, but they overcome that by putting in a few lyrics. And it\u2019s exciting. This won\u2019t be something just anyone can do. That\u2019s what a talent is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think their point is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ability to release lyrics like eogiyeocha with thick voices at the exact timing. It\u2019s exquisite.\u201d</p><br/><p>The threesome smiled widely at Jun Hyuk\u2019s elation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! We received praise from a genius. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something for you to fix in our songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>The members were happy at Jun Hyuk\u2019s words and full of expectation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot. It\u2019ll be good if we pull everything apart to fix\u2026 But then it\u2019s riding on your performance skills and you won\u2019t be able to perform, so you should just leave it the way it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch brutal assessment without hesitation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three men did not seem to regard Jun Hyuk\u2019s evaluation very much. They just thought that this was also something very fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not brutal\u2026 It\u2019s because a completely different music will result if I fix it. There\u2019s a band\u2019s color, and no one should touch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, what do you think about performing with them? So they can see the floor of their skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk, who wanted to see something more fun, kept pushing Jun Hyuk, but he kept shaking his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. What more could you need when it\u2019s good now? It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Threesome Bank Robbery left the studio, Kim Jong Suk spoke as though he had been waiting,</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s be honest since it\u2019s just us. What did you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good. The problem is what will happen from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since those three members started music, right? I could tell by their performance skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s been\u2026 2 years? Around there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir skills will keep improving now\u2026 and they\u2019ll start to dislike the simple songs now. Then they\u2019ll change it to music that\u2019s a little more colorful, then they\u2019ll become similar other skilled bands and be compared\u2026 and that\u2019s how they\u2019ll fail, I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their novelty was their weapon, but if that were to disappear in a musician. It meant that they could have a long run if they maintained their novelty with a simple performance.</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk slightly showed why he showed the threesome\u2019s performance,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t very many lyrics, but what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was really impressive. When they said eogiyeocha is something that can\u2019t be expressed with an instrument.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not hide his admiration and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought about what it could be switched with while I was listening, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had tried to remember a sound effect in the sound library that he had listened to in Yoon Jung Su\u2019s studio, but was unable to think of anything.</p><br/><p>If Jun Hyuk had realized even a little that the human voice could not be replaced with any instrument, Kim Jong Suk had reached today\u2019s goal.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I slowly lower the bait?\u2019</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk handed over a CD. A title was written on the CD in marker.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, do you know this song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>It said, \u2018Must Erase You in this Sadness\u2019 on the CD.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a song that was in Lee Hyun Woo\u2019s first album from 1991\u2026 It wasn\u2019t paid too much attention to back then, but became popular once Lee So Ra sang it on I am a Singer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hyun Woo\u2019s 1st album was a hit with the revolutionary dance song \u2018Dream\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI recommend that you remake Lee So Ra\u2019s version. Her version only has a piano accompaniment. Lee So Ra is\u2026 she has the best voice so\u2026 I was thinking what if you express Lee So Ra\u2019s voice with a classic guitar. Is it possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: This is the actual performance \u2013 LINK]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll listen to the song first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. This is better to watch as a video. I asked the broadcast station for it. Watch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put the CD in the computer and started to watch the 4-minute video.</p><br/><p>The video was from the special Australian concert of \u2018I Am a Singer\u2019. She came out into the amphitheater with a shaved head and black clothing like a priest and sang quietly.</p><br/><p>It was a song that Lee So Ra had to sing while reading off of a score because they had changed her song 4 hours before the performance, and she did not have the time to memorize them. She had been in 7th place at the time but with this song, she rose to 1st place with 48% of the viewer votes.</p><br/><p>The only accompaniment was a sweet electric piano that was not elaborate or grand.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk just stared blankly at the screen. As he had only listened to her early albums, he was shocked by how thin she had gotten and by her shaved head. She also must not have been feeling well on the day of the recording, because she looked sickly. She looked like a woman who had just gone through a breakup\u2026..</p><br/><p>Lee So Ra\u2019s voice came as more of a shock than her weak appearance did. Strictly speaking, the lyrics she sang touched Jun Hyuk\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>As it was the first time he was crying while listening to pop music, he did not even have the thought to wipe his tears. It seemed he had even forgotten that Kim Jong Suk was next to him.</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk watched Jun Hyuk and quietly went outside. He needed to leave him for at least an hour for him to wipe his tears and calm down. Teenage boys going through puberty did not like to show other people their tears. As soon as he came outside, Kim Jong Suk clenched both of his fists.</p><br/><p>It was a success.</p><br/><p>He was not crying because the music is good or because is impressed by Lee So Ra\u2019s voice since he said that he had already listened to many of her songs before. There was no doubt that he was crying because of the video\u2019s somber atmosphere and lyrics.</p><br/><p>This was enough. The key now was to see if the emotions that Jun Hyuk was feeling could be expressed with instruments. If they could be expressed with instruments, he would fail in his objective. But if it could not\u2026he would be able to make Jun Hyuk sing. Jackpot.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

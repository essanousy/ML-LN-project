How was the concert? Did you enjoy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s not only the audience that thought it was a pity that the concert was short. I regret it even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the last concert was over, President Stern handed a sweaty Jun Hyuk a towel.</p><br/><p>When he saw that Jun Hyuk looked satisfied, he also felt satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a party with the concert officials. There\u2019s something I want to check before then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll release today\u2019s performance as a live album, but what do you think of releasing a studio album? Without the orchestra. The Korean version is the original, but I want to create a global version with Alvin Lee\u2019s vocals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thought. I\u2019ll arrange it again so it fits the band, so let\u2019s start as soon as we get back to America.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk wiped his sweat with the towel and accepted President Stern\u2019s suggestion without a moment\u2019s hesitation. It is obvious that he really regretted the end of the concert.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne more thing. The same 2 people for the bass and drums?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think we need to? We performed together so we can\u2019t tell them to fall out.And, there\u2019s no reason to tell them not to do it when they have the talent. Why? Isaac, you don\u2019t want to keep them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m satisfied, too. Okay. Then, leave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Jun Hyuk\u2019s response, President Stern had the employees go back.</p><br/><p>Rather than something for the concert\u2019s leads to enjoy, the party in the hotel was for the people who worked hard in silence to create 2 perfect concerts.</p><br/><p>The organizers on the Korean side worked really hard to meet President Stern\u2019s difficult requests, but they did earn a lot of money. Even if they paid Jun Hyuk and Alvin Lee huge guarantees, they made 3 to 4 times what the top idol groups in Korea would have made for them, so it is a night they could get drunk.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk showed his face at the party, and then, he went into his room with his close acquaintances to drink wine and throw a party of their own.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor me, the best was Colin\u2019s cello at the end. Even the audience didn\u2019t make the sound of their breathing. It was the best finale.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun did not hesitate to praise him. It was the best configuration for the end as the passion in the concert hall settled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose idea was this finale?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac\u2019s. We only had 10 songs to perform with and it\u2019s obvious that the audience will think that\u2019s too short, so he decided that we need to cool their passion down before sending them away. That\u2019s why the calm bass of the cello came out.\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone was discussing the concert and having fun, Kyung Min Ho was just drinking beer.</p><br/><p>It was heavy on his heart that the concert was over. Performing with world-renowned stars felt like a dream. It was hard to accept the reality that he now needs to go back to being just another drum session man. He felt even more sullen that no one seemed to care that he felt like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. Where are Isaac and Alvin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I think Isaac had something to say to Alvin\u2019s manager. And, Alvin should be sleeping in his room. This is the first large-scale concert for him in a while, so it seems he was really tense. He said that he\u2019d come after a nap.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cStudio album? Of course we\u2019re down for it. Alvin won\u2019t refuse it either. He\u2019s already a fan of Jun. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill there be any problem proceeding with it as soon as we get back to America?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, our company will figure it out when we can start working in New York. I\u2019ll write up the contract and send it over right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern ended his conversation with Alvin Lee\u2019s manager and went back to Jun Hyuk\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Everyone\u2019s already here. I have news for everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>When President Stern smiled brightly and announced the plan to produce a studio album, Kyung Min Ho was the most surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. So, you\u2019re making another album with this concert? With me on the drums?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s exactly as President Stern said. He said we\u2019re recording in New York, so you\u2019ll have to pack up again.\u201d</p><br/><p>This dream did not end. It\u2019s continuing. Kyung Min Ho slowly got up and went into the bathroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to cry of happiness, is he? Why is he going to the bathroom all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun laughed as he spoke, and Baek Seung Ho clucked his tongue. \u201cOy. He\u2019s emotional for the drummer of a rock band. It\u2019s not cool.\u201d Yoon Kwang Hun laughed for a bit and then got up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going now. Everyone must be tired, so get some rest. Jun Hyuk, you leave tomorrow in the afternoon, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Will you come with us? Until the holidays\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not good to follow a kid who\u2019s all grown up around. Just send me the album when it comes out.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a separation they always go through, but they\u2019re still not used to it and still regret it. Jun Hyuk eased his regrets by holding Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s hands tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Kwang Hun, you go first. I still have stuff to talk about with Jun Hyuk as his lawyer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Alright. Don\u2019t bother him too much and hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun left and Baek Seung Ho took Jun Hyuk into the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you figure out what we talked about last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Hang on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk opened a drawer next to his bed and took out a sheet of paper. Baek Seung Ho read through it. There is not a lot of content, so it took less than a minute to understand all of it. Baek Seung Ho put the paper down and let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is what you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be alright. And don\u2019t forget that you can change it whenever you want to. Call me as soon as possible when you do change your mind..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But, I don\u2019t think it will change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho returned the paper to Jun Hyuk and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back tomorrow morning with an official will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Official?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. A will is invalid if it doesn\u2019t follow the legal process precisely. And you need a witness. It\u2019ll be over quickly because it\u2019s not anything difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho was about to leave the bedroom when he turned around all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll come to know, but I\u2019m curious\u2026 Can I ask how much the guarantee you got for this concert is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ll find out anyway. I heard it\u2019s $4 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c$4\u2026 4 million? Wow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho\u2019s jaw dropped and Jun Hyuk giggled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is it too much? Should I change what\u2019s on the will? He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Early the next morning, Baek Seung Ho came back to Jun Hyuk with 2 lawyers. When they made a fuss setting up a camcorder, Jun Hyuk looked puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need 2 witnesses for a will. There\u2019s really no need to record it, but we\u2019re just trying to keep all grounds covered. Are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho turned at the 2 lawyers and they pressed the record button on the camcorder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Mr. Jang Jun Hyuk. Please say the content of the will out loud.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at the sheet and said what is on his mind, and Baek Seung Ho wrote everything Jun Hyuk said verbatim.</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho handed the complete will over to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease read the content again loudly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took the sheet and read through it slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this aligned with your thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please sign at the bottom.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Jun Hyuk signed, Baek Seung Ho and the other 2 lawyers signed as witnesses. Baek Seung Ho took the tape that had recorded this and the content of the will, put it in an envelope, and sealed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. You did well. You guys as well. You can go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the 2 lawyers stood around awkwardly, Baek Seung Ho tapped his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, I forgot. Jun Hyuk. Can you give them each a signature? And take a picture. I promised them this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 lawyers held out Jun Hyuk\u2019s CD and, after he signed and took pictures, the 2 men bowed their heads and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, who are those people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLawyers I work with. You need 2 witnesses, other than me as the person writing your will, to sign. And you don\u2019t need to worry whether they\u2019ll tell the others what\u2019s on the will because they\u2019re both lawyers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for what. It\u2019s my job. Don\u2019t hesitate to call me if you need anything. Got it?\u201d Baek Seung Ho gave Jun Hyuk a big hug and left.</p><br/><p>The airport was full of reporters and fans to see Jun Hyuk and his group as they were leaving the country. They gave a short interview, thanked the fans, and boarded the private plane to New York.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

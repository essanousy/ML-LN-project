The calls haven\u2019t ended since the concert in Korea. There are a lot of promoters who say they want to push Alvin\u2019s performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s the first large-scale performance since Alvin\u2019s resurgence.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Alvin Lee\u2019s manager got back to New York, he looked for President Stern. Since the concert in Seoul ended, foreign press put up articles titled Alvin Lee\u2019s perfect resurrection. Excluding the distinctiveness that it is Korea, it is a definite that the attention would go to Alvin Lee who is already a legend in the pop music industry, than to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>Since the concert in Seoul ended, foreign press put up articles titled Alvin Lee\u2019s perfect resurrection. Excluding the distinctiveness that it is Korea, it is definite that the attention would go to Alvin Lee who is already a legend in the pop music industry, than to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe success of the Korean concert is from a collaboration between Jun and Alvin, but Alvin\u2019s ticket power is greater in Europe and America.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The concert planners are also thinking of a big-scale show like there was in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you can go ahead and proceed as long as Alvin accepts. Why are you going through the effort to tell me\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 Alvin said that he wouldn\u2019t turn down a concert if it\u2019s with Jun. He says that he doesn\u2019t want to do a solo performance if it\u2019s going to be so noisy.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern had guessed why Alvin Lee\u2019s manager had come looking for him, so he showed a little smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 What exactly does performing with Jun mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. First is that it means Jun\u2019s performance is perfect. He was the only guitarist who brought out a sound that he could be satisfied with, and didn\u2019t he arrange the configuration of all the songs? And it means that Jun\u2019s music is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that means he wants to keep doing concerts with Jun and his music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but we don\u2019t know Jun\u2019s future plans. The show in Seoul was a one-shot event\u2026 And Jun is a maestro no matter what people say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. It\u2019s not like that. Jun isn\u2019t a maestro, but a musician. He is a free musician, who is not tied down to any one genre. Alright. I\u2019ll ask Jun what he thinks. I just play the role of a mother who does whatever Jun wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting proposal. But Isaac. How many times do you think we need to do that performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing at least 3 times? After that, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be based on how the performances go? If all 3 are successes, we need to consider a world tour.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk spoke up again after thinking for a while, President Stern clapped. Jun Hyuk had given the response that he had wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a condition. Turn it down if they want to perform with Alvin\u2019s old songs. I have no intention of acting as the band in the background while Alvin sells memories with his fans as targets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat! That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll create an album with Alvin to release. We can do the performances with that album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we can create the global version of your 1st album and a new album. Great!\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern took the calendar on top of the table and started checking off dates.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen can you be done with what you\u2019re recording now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne month maximum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking of writing all of the new songs within that period?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can finish up the composition by tomorrow if I need to. The lyrics are the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlvin for the lyrics?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Alvin is better for lyrics than the songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk revealed his thoughts on Alvin\u2019s blues songs since he made a comeback. This is why he had not wanted to perform with Alvin\u2019s songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Then we\u2019ll release what you\u2019re recording now and then release the new album. I\u2019ll make both into mega hits, no matter how much money goes into marketing. The performance will come after. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern put his palm out and Jun Hyuk laughed as he gave him a high five.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cColin. I\u2019m releasing an album with Alvin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat album? The one we just finished recording, that you\u2019re wrapping up\u2026 Oh. Is it a new album?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019re going into the new one as soon as post-production is done for this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Colin heard about the new album, he felt excitement and was worry at the same time.</p><br/><p>He knows that Jun Hyuk brought it up to him because he wants to work on it together.</p><br/><p>The music he created with Jun Hyuk always brought him a new kind of happiness, but this also meant that it pushed back the time he works on his own music.</p><br/><p>\u201cNew work\u2026 Isn\u2019t it done if you write the songs and record? It\u2019s an honor for me if I participate in that album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we need to think about performing after releasing the album. Alvin can\u2019t perform alone after releasing the album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that means I can\u2019t do my personal work until then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. And you\u2019ll have to leave your musical views aside. I\u2019m going to make the music the way I want to. Of course I\u2019ll interfere with the way you play.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that means you\u2019re going to produce the album, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlvin said he\u2019ll follow your directing as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe actually welcomed it. It seems he thinks he\u2019ll be able to take a thorough look at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Colin accepted without another thought. This could even be a great opportunity in forming his own band. His name needed to have more value in order for him to be able to recruit members with the ability he was looking for.</p><br/><p>Amateurs may not, but professional performers gather in because of the name. This was evident just from looking at Jun Hyuk smiling in front of him. With Jun Hyuk now, there was no musician who would not come running at a single motion from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did the drummer say? I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll say okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He won\u2019t miss out on the chance to show himself outside of Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at Colin for a moment and said what he had felt faintly,</p><br/><p>\u201cColin. If you like the drummer, say what you feel honestly and make a proposal. His drum skills are developing even now. He isn\u2019t famous because of the barrier of being Asian, but I\u2019m sure thoughts on him will change if he gets to do a world tour. Then you\u2019ll just be one out of several options. If you want to get him, this is your chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to do that, too. But I\u2019m just one of many bands that can\u2019t guarantee him anything. Do you think he\u2019ll take it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell you won\u2019t know until you ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk silently tsked at Colin as he hesitated. Colin was so bold as to quit Clayton, which was extremely difficult to get into, but he was being timid with such matters. He couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cAlvin. There are 2 ways for us to write the songs. The first is for you to write lyrics after I\u2019m done composing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the 2nd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou give me key phrases or approximate lyrics first. I\u2019ll write a song that fits that. Then you create complete lyrics with that song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the difference is whether we write lyrics that fit the songs or songs that fit the lyrics.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin said that he would follow Jun Hyuk\u2019s lead while writing the songs in everything except lyrics, so he frowned at this inevitable situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like the 2nd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll write the song to the lyrics?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But I want honest lyrics. If you want to make songs that are fluffy and comfortable for people to listen to, it\u2019s better for me to focus on the melody.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonest lyrics\u2026 What is it that you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had said that he would leave the lyrics entirely up to him. But it felt like he just said he was rejecting average lyrics.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sound of the honest truth that\u2019s hidden in your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sound that\u2019s hidden in my heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin\u2019s heart felt a little twinge at the way Jun Hyuk was looking at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe forgotten sound that\u2019s the buried and hidden truth. If you have the will to hear that sound, you can hear it whenever you want to. And you\u2019ll be wanting it to come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes wanted him to create lyrics with the truth that only he knows.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to release the album quickly. While you write the lyrics for several months, I have to hang out during that time\u2026 I don\u2019t really like that. Try listening to the sound that\u2019s hidden in your heart. Then you\u2019ll be able to write multiple lyrics in a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to expose my face to the public buying the album? Isn\u2019t that too much? Do you have the confidence to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already showed mine. Through music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell well. Isn\u2019t that too shrewd? How many people out there are able to figure out someone\u2019s true self through an instrument or orchestra? I have to do it through words, that everyone can understand. With words and sentences! It\u2019s completely different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of it as being too unfair. Everyone just uses the method that works best for them. I do it through melody and you through words and sentences.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. I know how to create great melodies, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we can switch roles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk kept smiling, and Alvin laughed as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more sly than I thought. I think wanting to release the album fast is just an excuse, and you really just want to see the true me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk nodded and whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cAn honest sound is the standard for the birth of a great song.\u201d</p><br/><p>A long story was already swimming around Alvin Lee\u2019s head from his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201c1 week. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c3 days is enough. It\u2019s easy if you just write down what your heart is saying. If you hang on for no reason, you\u2019ll just edit it for the remaining 4 days and damage the original meaning. Alvin, this could be the last opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Last opportunity? What does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not now, when will I be able to work with you on music? Take this chance to let the public hear your real story. I\u2019ll put your story into incredible music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk tapped his heart and winked. After Alvin left the studio, he reappeared in exactly 3 days.</p><br/><p>Alvin handed over a stack of handwritten papers rather than computer printouts, but his expression was not bright.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, don\u2019t say anything about the lyrics. Nothing is for show and there\u2019s no pretense, and it just has what I wanted to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not say anything, and slowly read through Alvin\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>Alvin\u2019s lyrics did not follow the conventional format of a song at all. It was too long to say that he only wrote the key topics yet lacked a format like a chorus and refrain, and was more like a completed poem.</p><br/><p>There are some forms of prose and even what look like short proverbs.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk read over 15 pages of lyrics, sighed, and mumbled in Korean.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. Life is fucked.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were words that Alvin couldn\u2019t understand, but he could tell how Jun Hyuk felt from his expression and tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop saying things I can\u2019t understand, and hurry up and write the song. You have to do that so I can trim the lyrics appropriately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to make the song so not a single word is added or taken out. We need to preserve the entire coarseness. You wrote this over 3 days? Then I\u2019ll complete it within 3 days as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took the sheets with the lyrics and locked himself in the studio in his apartment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019ll go down now.\u201d</p><br/><p>6:30 at night. Tara\u2019s call at precisely the decided time showed how sharp her personality is.</p><br/><p>When he went down to the hotel lobby, Tara was waiting for him. However, she was frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. Your clothes\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk looked down at the jeans and hoodie he was wearing, Tara brought him back to the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to wear a suit. It is a restaurant where you cannot enter unless you are wearing a suit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do? I don\u2019t have a suit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut \u2013 whew \u2013 You haven\u2019t looked in the closet yet? There is a tuxedo and suit in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk saw Tara let out a long sigh and felt bad. She is just working hard, but he felt like he was just giving her a hard time. Thinking that this is all part of the job, he started seeing people\u2019s actions in a different light.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ll hurry up and change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara followed Jun Hyuk who ran back to the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go by myself. You can just wait in the lobby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll pick out your tie. Do you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know how to tie a tie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara pulled a shirt and suit out of the guest room closet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just the one now, but someone from the tailor shop will be coming tomorrow. They will get your sizes and prepared a couple shirts, tuxedos, and suits. It will be the same for shoes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Jun Hyuk came out in a suit, Tara looked satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour skin is light, so let\u2019s use the red tie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk took the tie from Tara and winked, she smiled for the first time since meeting him.</p><br/><p>In the car to the restaurant, Tara did not rest in order to detail his schedule going forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. After tonight\u2019s dinner, you don\u2019t have anything scheduled for tomorrow. From now on, twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you will take over the orchestra. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Maestro Quinn will take over for the regular performances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I just do 2 days out of the week?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do I do for the other 5 days? Hang out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ll have poster photo shoots, press interviews, meals with Boston\u2019s powermen, and attending associations. There will be events like special lectures at New England\u2019s music schools.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sounds busy just hearing about it. Whew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is nothing. Since becoming the standing conductor and art director, Maestro Quinn has not been able to rest for a single night. He does interviews with the press as well as power bloggers, and even participates in podcasts. There is nothing he can do until the first season is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The standing conductor of the symphony is similar to the coach of pro baseball team, Red Sox. He needs to constantly communicate with the public until the first season\u2019s score comes out.</p><br/><p>Tara saw Jun Hyuk let out a long sigh and smiled again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. I\u2019ll try to reduce your schedule as much as I can. That\u2019s okay, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTara, you\u2019re my savior.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wall between the two is slowly coming down. In the meantime, their car arrived at the restaurant.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The restaurant that Tara talked about is famous, so all of the seats and tables are full. With the escort of an employee, he made his way through the passage as though getting through a maze. Once he got to the reserved seats, he saw the Board members and Patrick Quinn drinking.</p><br/><p>Chairman Mark Boff introduced each of the board members to Jun Hyuk and he sat among them.</p><br/><p>Among these people, there are those who genuinely love music and those who joined the board in order to gain the title of being cultured and refined. What they have in common however, is that they contemplate over realistic matters.</p><br/><p>Surplus management and a reputation comparable to the New York Philharmonic. These two things.</p><br/><p>Board members also have roles as great donators who give the Boston Symphony about $1 million every year. They want gains from the Boston Philharmonic in order to continue the surplus and save the money to use the donations in other places.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Jun. We would like to be the first to put the full Inferno on stage and release an album at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>They spoke about the Boston Symphony for a while and finally arrived at the topic of Jun Hyuk and Inferno. They even said why the Board had agreed to invite Jun Hyuk as a visiting conductor on Patrick Quinn\u2019s request. It is now Jun Hyuk\u2019s turn to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what I\u2019m thinking. Both are possible. But\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone stopped moving their forks and knives when he said that it is possible, and gave him their attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut? What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will take a fair amount of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil the Inferno score in all of the orchestra members\u2019 heads are completely erased.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the board members looked at each other without understanding what Jun Hyuk was saying, Patrick Quinn burst out in laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. How novel. But Jun. Will it be possible to erase a score that\u2019s embedded in their heads along with shock? Even if they somehow erase it, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll think of it again when everyone gathers for rehearsal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The table conversation became lost in the world of music. It is not a matter of simply enjoying music, but at a standard that only musicians can understand. Thus, it is a place for just Jun Hyuk and Patrick Quinn.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe album recording will be possible by recording by instrument part. That\u2019s thanks to you, Jun. You\u2019re the only person on earth who can conduct Inferno without a problem. But the performance? Since it\u2019s an orchestra, the members will have significant skill. I\u2019m sure it will only take moments for them to recall a score that they had forgotten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said, it\u2019s just an issue of time. I can think of a couple methods, but we\u2019ll have to test them out to see what would be appropriate for the orchestra.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk quickly chewed and swallowed a piece of steak.</p><br/><p>\u201cErasing doesn\u2019t always mean forgetting. There is also the method of changing it by tangling it up and mixing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patrick Quinn was silent for a moment, trying to understand what Jun Hyuk is saying. As if he had been waiting for this, Chairman Mark Boff looked at Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Jun, you\u2019re different from when I had met you his morning. You seem to have a lot of drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore than drive, I mean to do my duty. I already invited someone to come to the performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mark Boff was not the only person who was satisfied with Jun Hyuk\u2019s confidence, and the other Board members were smiling. Patrick Quinn was lost in thought for a while. He could understand Jun Hyuk\u2019s intention, but could not imagine what method he was going to use.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, can I attend rehearsals? I\u2019ll shut my mouth and stay quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an honor for me, Patrick.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dinner became a pleasant place of light excitement and anticipation. They quickly finished their champagne and wine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

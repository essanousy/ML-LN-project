You know that\u2019s just the reproduction of other pianists.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Do you now want to properly express your bloody rage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at Yoon Kwang Hun with surprise. How could it be that there is nothing he does not know? Jun Hyuk\u2019s face suddenly told red.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve heard it just once before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun recalled Jun Hyuk\u2019s moonlight sonata. His face became calm again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Well\u2026 I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m going to say since you\u2019ve heard it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He has matured quite a lot. He is able to speak calmly about the anger inside him that he had so concealed. Yoon Kwang Hun had the thought that sending Jun Hyuk to study abroad was one of the best things he had done.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to refine my own color during the new semester. I\u2019m thinking of creating a unique color for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Famous pianists need to have their unique color. Yoon Kwang Hun could figure out Jun Hyuk\u2019s real reason for ripping up the contract with LA Sound.</p><br/><p>What Jun Hyuk is seeking is music, not success. He thought he was going to cry again when he thought of how well Jun Hyuk is growing up. Yoon Kwang Hun quickly spoke to avoid an awkward situation,</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you met a good professor for lessons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone at the conservatory is a teacher. When I see their intense efforts, it makes me want to keep doing something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun recalled something he had been forgetting because of the mention of professors.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. Do you remember Professor Jeon Hye Jin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The chatty old woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He he. Yeah she is a bit talkative. Anyway, give that professor a gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery time Professor Jeon Hye Jin has a concert, you know your piano song? The last track in your album, Close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe always performs that song. It\u2019s fixed in her encore repertoire. And she\u2019s been on TV before where she played that song and praised you a ton. A lot of your albums were sold thanks to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could imagine how that talkative and nosy, kind woman acted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 I see. What do I send her? Should I get her an expensive bag that old women like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. You think she doesn\u2019t have expensive bags? Not stuff like that, but something she would really appreciate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that? Just tell me. Don\u2019t you know what old women like since you\u2019re an old man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat! It\u2019s not an issue of old women and old men. Make a piano song for her. You\u2019ve gotten a lot from her until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk thought of a song that would be perfect for that talkative woman, he started laughing already. He thought of a comic accent that would not be appropriate for her powerful and incredible piano skills.</p><br/><p>Just then, a music video flowed from the TV they had left on without much thought. Both men who were half lying on the bed bolted into a seated position. Two types of music that did not go well together at all mixed to stimulate their eyes and ears.</p><br/><p>There is an odd feeling to the unbalance between the music and video. Yoon Kwang Hun was lost in the screen while Jun Hyuk in the music.</p><br/><p>When the 5-minute video ended, they looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 What on earth is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. It\u2019s really irksome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that on the verge of child abuse? Goodness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their jaws were dropped at the shocking Japanese music.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe saw on TV yesterday. There\u2019s something that a metal band and girl group were mixed to make\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that band is pretty popular these days. They\u2019re so popular that they have their own concert. It\u2019ll probably be Baby-Girl Metal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Japanese supervisor coordinating their work now had an interesting expression regarding Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe girls are so young.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo are elementary school students or something and the main vocal is a high school student? Well\u2026 it\u2019s pretty common to see idols in elementary school here.\u201d</p><br/><p>It has been said that the age of Korean and Japanese idols has been getting younger because of the increasing number of kidults.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why is the band in charge of the accompaniment wearing masks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re embarrassed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Japanese supervisor\u2019s expression changed from that of regret to the affirmative.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve covered their faces because they\u2019re embarrassed that they\u2019re just performing behind a girl group. They perform without their masks as well, but who they really are is shrouded in mystery.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reality is that it is becoming more difficult to be a rock band in Asia.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe main vocal of the girl group is pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But if you just configure a group with a main vocal, it\u2019s only a female vocalist metal band. And the music needs to change a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk wondered who it was who was able to make this music by a band of a bizarre combination as it was not bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a hit created through the planning of a record label. Since it\u2019s a combination of a metal band and cute girls, it isn\u2019t awkward no matter what kind of music they touch and it\u2019s a given that they\u2019ll have a fan base.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk remembered that Alex Zakin said \u2018music that sells\u2019. A record label has the very important role of \u2018planning\u2019 in order to create music that sells.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means that the Japanese market for music is that hard. Since they can\u2019t break into the international market through like Korea with its Hallyu movement, they need to come up with all sorts of ideas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Japanese record labels are most envious of Hallyu. Japanese popular music has not been able to the international realm since the 80s. There was no need to look overseas when domestic demand is large and robust.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Mr. Jang were to have activities in Japan, he will really become a superstar. He is able to work with a variety of genres and has outstanding looks. He would have fans of each genre and even old women who love Hallyu\u2026 Honestly, it\u2019s just a pity for us. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the end of the supervisor\u2019s expression of regret regarding Jun Hyuk, they began discussing Jun Hyuk\u2019s promotion schedule.</p><br/><p>There is no way to express how tiring the interviews with the three magazines were. They focused on Jun Hyuk\u2019s unfortunate past rather than on his music. However, the following joint interview with five power bloggers was so fun that his mood lightened.</p><br/><p>They had the temperament of nerds no matter who looked at them and they relentlessly asked Jun Hyuk about each song in the album. When they even had a sharp question analyzing the variations with the classical chord hidden in the music, it was suspicious whether these people were just bloggers or music critics.</p><br/><p>When all of the interviews were complete, he had to go to a photo shoot for an album package that would be sold as limited edition for promotional reasons.</p><br/><p>This shoot with meticulous Japanese people was harder than the time he worked with XOR. It was dawn when they finished the shoot.</p><br/><p>His promotions ended sign meetings in Tokyo and Osaka. The fun aspect was that most of the people who waited on the long line to get Jun Hyuk\u2019s signature were men.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun rejected the Japanese company\u2019s request to extend Jun Hyuk\u2019s promotion period and basically chased Jun Hyuk back to America. He did not want to waste Jun Hyuk\u2019s precious time in Japan when he had such a clear goal ahead of him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

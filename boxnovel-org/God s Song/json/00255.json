He is already using President Stern\u2019s plane as if it is his own. He is already used to its convenience and doesn\u2019t feel anything against purchasing one.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince there are several uncomfortable aspects of living in this apartment, let\u2019s look into a house first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019ve never felt uncomfortable in this apartment. The location is good and something like this is like a palace to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. Forbes reveals star incomes in June. A lot will change after that. You can\u2019t live here any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a young musician right now, but you\u2019ll become a billionaire musician after the Forbes release. There will start to be dangerous and bothersome things happening. We need to find a place for you where you can be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm. Then I\u2019ll have to buy a house first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk decided to throw away his preconceptions of America\u2019s rich. He has already made an enormous and unimaginable amount.</p><br/><p>He thought that it would be better to enjoy his wealth, rather than becoming an oddball who insists on living a normal life.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. A house could have no meaning to you though. You won\u2019t have a normal life of coming home every night. You won\u2019t be able to live in it half the time, but there\u2019s a feeling of security in simply knowing that you have a home.\u201d</p><br/><p>He might live like a nomad, but it is a good thing to have a home that he maintains and embellishes. The only problem is where the house will be. Since Jun Hyuk has already left Korea, it is okay for him to think of any place in the world that he wants to as his hometown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere would you like it? America? Europe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like New York. It feels like my hometown because it\u2019s where I\u2019ve been living since I first arrived in America.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Then I\u2019ll look into houses in New York. What kind of house do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk quickly pointed to Amelia,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to follow what the woman wants rather than what the man wants when choosing a house. Don\u2019t we? Amelia?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia could not speak for a while. Jun Hyuk said it as if it were nothing, but the meaning hidden behind it is not simple.</p><br/><p>He has never said anything about marriage. And it does not seem like he will say the word in the future either.</p><br/><p>Amelia knows why Jun Hyuk does not talk about their future. There is a fully understandable reason for this in his past.</p><br/><p>But asking to choose the house that they will live in together is the closest way Jun Hyuk will get to proposing. It\u2019s okay even if they do not marry. Amelia has nothing more to ask for if they can just keep going as they are now.</p><br/><p>Amelia wiped a tear from her eye and turned her attention to President Stern.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to decide on a location first. Isaac, where would be good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe East Hamptons in Long Island is the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The seashore full of the villas and yachts of famous people like designer Calvin Klein, singer Billy Joel, and film director Steven Spielberg.</p><br/><p>The best beach in America, Cooper\u2019s Beach, is located in Long Island. As much as it is the place where New York\u2019s rich are gathered, it is a place with safety and security.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be adequate because it takes a little over 2 hours from Manhattan to Long Island by highway. There are a fair amount of houses on sale too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c2 hours? I think that\u2019s too far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat of it? You can take a helicopter when you\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk learned of another way that rich people think. Helicopters are just another form of transportation to the rich.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia. What do you think? Will Long Island be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s the dream place for New Yorkers. You\u2019ll fall in love with that sea too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once they made the decision to buy a house, Amelia who had been rolling around in bed became busier than she had been during her tour season.</p><br/><p>She went around the Hamptons with a real estate agent for several days, but became exhausted when she was unable to find a house that was perfect for them. Jun Hyuk massaged her swollen calves and spoke like a billionaire.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia. What do you think about just building a house? Buy a house in a location you like first. Then we can bring the house down, design what you want, and build it new.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia flowed with energy again with Jun Hyuk\u2019s idea.</p><br/><p>President Stern introduced her to several of the best architects. When they found out that they were faced with building a house for a couple of rising musicians, with Jun Hyuk being one of them in particular, they created blueprints with the best conditions.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the architects seemed to consider it a great career to have Maestro Jun\u2019s house included in their records.</p><br/><p>However, not even the best architects could satisfy Amelia. Jun Hyuk even started to think that at this rate, they would never be able to own a house.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. I\u2019m thinking of just resting with Amelia until next summer. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNext summer? Hm. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be okay. The only confirmed thing you have on your schedule is the opera recording. The opera tour will be over by around next summer too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go to your Switzerland villa. We\u2019ve also matched Amelia\u2019s schedule to start after the next summer season.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Get a lot of rest before you come back. Oh right. How\u2019s the house going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, I don\u2019t think we can get a design even after 10 years. I think I need to cut it off at an appropriate line.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Of course she\u2019ll be like that. She\u2019s still a young woman. It\u2019s impossible to bring the house of her dreams into reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to go to Switzerland. I\u2019m sure we can compromise Amelia\u2019s dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk threatened to go to Switzerland alone, Amelia approved the architect\u2019s blueprints with an attitude as if she were giving in a lot.</p><br/><p>They went back to enjoying their peaceful and quiet life. This time, in the beautiful winter of Switzerland.</p><br/><p>When the new year came around, they were surprised with President Stern and Tara\u2019s surprise visit, but more so with the news that President Stern brought with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. You know Amsterdam\u2019s Gebouw in the Netherlands, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The Royal Concertgebouw orchestra?\u201d</p><br/><p>Concertgebouw means \u2018concert hall\u2019 in Dutch.</p><br/><p>The Concertgebouw opened in Amsterdam in April 1888, an orchestra was created, and Willem Kes was invited as standing conductor. Until it received the royal title from the queen of the Netherlands, Beatrix, it was called the Concertgebouw orchestra.</p><br/><p>Royal Concertgebouw is one of the best venues in the world regarding its acoustics and in 2008, it beat the Berlin Philharmonic to take 1st place of 10 orchestras chosen by Gramophone.</p><br/><p>Of course Gramophone\u2019s judgement cannot be taken as an orchestra\u2019s skill because the largest item in deciding the ranking is ticket sales.</p><br/><p>There is an advantage to having a lot of sponsors for ticket sales. Sponsors are enterprises. Those companies purchase season tickets to give out as gifts. Because they buy the expensive seats like R and S, ticket sales are guaranteed.</p><br/><p>Amsterdam was a trade city that took over Europe in the 16th century and can still be considered a center of finance and trade, so there are a lot of sponsors.</p><br/><p>\u201cA proposal came in from that Concertgebouw. They want to leave the orchestra to Dimitri starting next season. They made a proposal for standing conductor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Maestro Carras?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Concertgebouw always has successful shows but the album sales aren\u2019t that good. They\u2019re just selling show albums.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was curious as to why he is being told of Dimitri Carras\u2019 circumstances. Isaac Stern would not have flown all the way to Switzerland to tell him someone else\u2019s news.</p><br/><p>\u201cDimitri put your Inferno on stage. It seems they considered that bold experimental spirit highly. And they think it\u2019s great that he has a record of releasing entire albums with Tchaikovsky and Marlowe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes\u2026 this call for congratulations? The New York Philharmonic and Concertgebouw are both top-notch\u2026 I\u2019m sure he has a lot to think of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Dimitri is asking me to find out what you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean what I think?\u201d</p><br/><p>A great maestro who has gone through all of the hoops to reach the peak is asking for him opinion? When President Stern continued, Jun Hyuk was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to go to Amsterdam, he says that he\u2019ll really push for you. And if you like New York, he\u2019ll go to Amsterdam and recommend you as successor to the New York Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern laughed in satisfaction at Jun Hyuk and Amelia\u2019s surprised and blank faces.</p><br/><p>There was also something that Dimitri Carras had asked him to be sure to relay to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only half the chance that you would become the standing conductor for Concertgebouw, but he made a big fuss saying that he could put you on the podium for the New York Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>A young Asian in his early 20s becoming the standing conductor of a top orchestra. Even without a distinction between East and West, it is unimaginable.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

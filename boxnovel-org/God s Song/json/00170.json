Tara\u2019s description that it is a gathering for young female sponsors was inaccurate. It was a gathering for leopards who did whatever they needed to in order to succeed, putting in more effort than the men.</p><br/><p>They are loud and expressive. They poured questions out on him and did not hesitate to make dirty jokes about his beautiful girlfriend.</p><br/><p>A few were even blatantly flirtatious. It was to the point where even Tara was sweating.</p><br/><p>They could understand why these women who never requested dinner with white-haired old conductors had been quick to ask for a dinner with Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>Once the over 2 hour dinner was over, Jun Hyuk thought that this would be more tiring than conducting all symphonies.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was thankful to Tara for not scheduling another meeting with sponsors for him for 2 weeks. But Jun Hyuk did not know Tara\u2019s true toils. She was moving quietly on behalf of Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>When a Korean player enters the major leagues, the first sponsors to appear are from the Korean society abroad. As such, the Korean society in Boston was trying to create a sponsor association.</p><br/><p>However, Tara respectfully declined. She did not want Jun Hyuk to have to be called away to a gathering to drink at least once a month.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will respectfully decline having sponsors who have never seen the Boston Philharmonic, but would like to participate just because the conductor is Korean. The Boston Philharmonic only receives donations that are for music. I will let you know the best way to give support. Purchase tickets and watch the concert. Maestro Jun will be most pleased with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not just that. She made sure to block access from Korean reporters. She did not know why, but she could tell that Jun Hyuk hates the Korean press.</p><br/><p>Two weeks went by after the first rehearsal. The orchestra members have a goal, but it is not easy to achieve that goal. They still cannot perform even half of the 1st part.</p><br/><p>They even used the method that the Berlin Philharmonic used. The members put in ear plugs, paid attention to other sounds, and played the music focusing only on the score and Jun Hyuk\u2019s conducting. However, they only came to know the complaints of the Berlin Philharmonic for over a year. The Berlin Philharmonic is really persistent for performing in this frustrating method for over a year, and conductor Maestro Saril Petrenko really has extreme patience.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had been expecting the orchestra to forget at least a bit of the score and started to fret. He was not sure if they would be able to complete the song by next May when the season is over. It is also unprecedented that a visiting conductor can be put up for 2 seasons with the same song. Even if he had Patrick Quinn\u2019s support, the Board would not tolerate it.</p><br/><p>As Yoon Kwang Hun said, a professional must do as much as he is paid.</p><br/><p>He finished a rehearsal without development, came back to the hotel, and contemplated how they could succeed in a short period of time.</p><br/><p>While lost in thought, he heard the sound of a visitor. When Jun Hyuk opened the door, Amelia jumped into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call you so I could surprise you. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou succeeded. I\u2019m really surprised. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how much I suffered to switch my schedule around? I completely pushed the concert in Japan back.\u201d</p><br/><p>After winning the Tchaikovsky Competition, Amelia was the emerging female pianist. She is about to surpass Yuja Wang who is currently the best in China. A flashy appearance with a fitting performance full of charisma and power. Even a fashion that shows the passion of South America.</p><br/><p>The number of fans she had increased as they admired her videos on YouTube and in Japan where there are a lot of piano fanciers, her popularity is explosive. If she pushed the Japan concert back, it means that she has pushed back an incredible income.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about in Boston? You don\u2019t have a concert?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh \u2013 Why wouldn\u2019t I? My manager won\u2019t let me rest. I have 2 concerts, one at Harvard and one at MIT. And I have to go to Philadelphia in 3 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t come here to spend Christmas together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry. Philadelphia is the Christmas and New Years concert. Boston Philharmonic has a concert too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we don\u2019t have time to be doing this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk picked Amelia up and went into the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c3 months to record the album. The performance should end with this season? We need to put it on stage in May. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk leaned on Amelia and spoke confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cOho. It looks like you\u2019re overflowing with drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he. There\u2019s a reason why I have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia felt like the maestro title brought Jun Hyuk motivation. To her, the most fitting image of Jun Hyuk is as a conductor. Furthermore, a conductor who conducts his own music.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what happens once this season ends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Amelia had worried, Jun Hyuk was not preparing at all. She cautiously brought up what she always wanted to say to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way and listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because you make the world talk doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll keep getting opportunities like the Boston Philharmonic. You only have Inferno as the one objective data.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world\u2019s famous maestros might praise you, but philharmonic orchestras will react coldly. A young genius whose everything is Inferno. That\u2019s it. If you perform and release an album with Boston, other places won\u2019t call for you. And\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia hit Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand when he jokingly stuttered. She is in the middle of saying something important.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Inferno is experimental and underground, there\u2019s a high possibility it\u2019ll end after this one time. The reason for other philharmonics to perform it disappears.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is what Colin said a long time ago when he quit the cello to do popular music. Experimental contemporary music ends with the premiere and is not fated to be put on stage ever again. The audience, conductor, and orchestras will eventually go back to Beethoven. They can foresee the future of Inferno.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll end it. Whatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Huk spoke as if it is not a big deal. He was intending to end his receiving money to create something he has to take responsibility for with this anyway. He was brought all the way here with Boston Philharmonic\u2019s fame, but it is more fitting for him to live while doing what he wants rather than working for money.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? End it? Ho ho. Will it be that easy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia pinched Jun Hyuk\u2019s lips and twisted them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ll be able to let go of the world\u2019s most perfect and complete instrument when it\u2019s been placed in your hands? Jun, you\u2019ve already experienced it while performing Magic Flute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It wasn\u2019t attractive to that extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry. Those kids were lacking. But it\u2019s the Boston Philharmonic. One of the best instruments in the world. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll never the thrill of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He had not experienced what Amelia is talking about yet. Of course he had countlessly experienced the moment when his mind and finger playing an instrument became one. The joy of feeling like 1 hour is 1 second.</p><br/><p>Would he be able to experience something more than this with the Boston Philharmonic?</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at Amelia flirtatiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe introduction is long. I thought you said you don\u2019t have time. Get to the point.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to build your career. It\u2019s something every musician needs to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA career\u2026 Specifically?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia said the fastest way to show the world Jun Hyuk\u2019s talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSubmit a work to the Queen Elisabeth Competition. In the composition area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>The competition\u2019s name is not taken from the British Queen Elizabeth, but from Queen Elisabeth Von Wittelsbach of Belgium.</p><br/><p>This competition started in 1951 and is composed of 4 sections, the violin, piano, composition, and vocals. The violin, piano, and vocal sectors are alternated to be held every 3 years while the composition sector opens every 2 years. It is held in May every year.</p><br/><p>Participant ages are limited to under 27 for the piano and violin, and under 40 for composition. The composition portion\u2019s age limit is higher because it is thought that maturity from experiencing life\u2019s ordeals will produce better music. Most composition winners are in their thirties.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Submit a song that\u2019s so great it would make someone pass out. A concerto. You\u2019ll win, I\u2019m sure. The pianist or violinist who makes it into finals plays the composition winner\u2019s song in the finals. That\u2019s where you conduct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConduct too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBerlin\u2019s national philharmonic takes the orchestra in the finals, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll give you the baton since you already have experience with the Boston Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>The unique aspect about this competition is that the winners who reach the finals, excluding those from the composition section, practice the selected winner from the composition section\u2019s piece for 1 week to perform it. That is why candidates for the composition section need to submit their pieces by December, and the winner is notified in January.</p><br/><p>It is just that the win is canceled if the winner reveals the fact to the world.</p><br/><p>It is a measure taken to ensure that the piano or violin participants do not see the score beforehand.</p><br/><p>Since 12 finalists need to perform this, there can be at least 12 stages. In May of the next year when the contract with Boston ends, the timing is perfect to prepare for the Queen Elisabeth Competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe goal isn\u2019t an experimental song like Inferno, but to show them that you\u2019re capable of composing anything. After that, you reveal all of the songs you\u2019ve written. It\u2019s going to shake the world up. It\u2019ll be incomparable to what happened with Inferno. Ho ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>The competition is just an appetizer. The main course is releasing Jun Hyuk\u2019s incredible pieces. Amelia laughs at just the thought of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your great works are revealed to the world, you\u2019ll get your first chance to conduct a performance of your songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You really want your boyfriend to be a maestro? I\u2019m no longer qualified to be your boyfriend if I just have fun and write songs once in a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia knows that it is a joke, but it is a welcome thought to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relief for me if you say you want to rest while writing songs. Then we could always be together. Is that really what you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on how you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hugged Amelia again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

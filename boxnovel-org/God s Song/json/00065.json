He shrugged as he spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019m sure you all will know better if what he is saying is true or false\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Concertmaster heard Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s words as an insult as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just the last check before recording, not a concert. I don\u2019t hear this as anything but him trying to point out our faults. I admit that he has an ear for music, but you should have just brought the Berlin Philharmonic in if it was going to be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Concertmaster had said something he should not have. He meant that there was nothing he could do about it because they were getting the talent they had paid for. This angered even Jo Hyung Joong.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t agree with that. If Jun Hyuk\u2019s criticisms are correct, this isn\u2019t a level of checking before recording. That means this is the first time you\u2019re trying to play it\u2026 It upsets me more that you didn\u2019t think of practicing it once when you knew today would be the day or recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong who had always been smiling had become angry. The 16 performers left the recording studio at his reproach. Some left out of embarrassment, some left out of anger.</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong scratched his head in the empty recording studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis has become quite bothersome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, teacher. It\u2019s because of me\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can tell by looking at those people who had nothing to say that you\u2019re right. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s definite for someone working with music to demand perfection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong had the thought that he would need to bring in the Seoul Philharmonic if he wanted to satisfy Jun Hyuk, but that was impossible. His sight seemed to dim at the thought that they would need to spend the next three or four days using the machines in the recording studio without sleep.</p><br/><p>The phone call he received as soon as he got to the studio made him forget that they would not need to stay up all night.</p><br/><p>After Jo Hyung Joong spoke on the phone for a while, he quickly called Producer Kim Ki Sik.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim, the first stage is MR, right? The backing band isn\u2019t coming out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the backing band is live from the top 5.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know Jun Hyuk\u2019s mission song, \u2018From the Sun to the Boy\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik had just been watching the video because the VJ had come running to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know we can\u2019t work with the Fine Philharmonic you set us up with, right? Jun Hyuk didn\u2019t like it and stopped it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I heard from the VJ.\u201d</p><br/><p>The VJ had come running to him with news that he had filmed something great. Producer Kim had also wanted to shout in joy as he watched the video. The highlight was when the performers ran out with bright red faces.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had created a scene that could only be found in a drama. It was a reversal that made it so the money they would need to pay the performers was not going to waste.</p><br/><p>They would need to cover the performers\u2019 faces for confidentiality. He had picked up Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s call while he had been happily thinking of how to edit the clip.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe conductor just called to say that he will do it himself. He said that he\u2019ll do it perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the condition that they can perform live on the live broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? On the live broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He kept talking\u2026 but he just wants to get publicity for his orchestra since a local orchestra doesn\u2019t have a name. He wants to go out on a national broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was difficult for a local orchestra to become well known unless the maestro was famous. There was no better publicity in a Korea where the place for classical was not big, than to go out on a broadcast.</p><br/><p>There was even a case when a conductor of an OST with classical music had become famous overnight. Having a face or name go out on TV was better than any publicity money could buy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Can you arrange it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe picture looks good but\u2026 we might get feedback that we\u2019re favoring him over the other kids.\u201d</p><br/><p>Going on the live stage meant that they were allowing for their faces and names to go on air. The drama in Producer Kim Ki Sik\u2019s head became complete with the second reversal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe stage is a problem too. Is there enough space for 60 people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? 60 people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the full orchestra. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to do it no matter what if it\u2019s to that extent. Contact the conductor and let him know that it\u2019s an okay. I\u2019ll take care of the details with their representative.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Producer Kim Ki Sik got off the phone, he thought that though the conductor\u2019s intention may be publicity, the opportunity was Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had the power to drag people in. He was like a powerful magnet. He thought that he himself might be getting pulled in to Jun Hyuk\u2019s genius, but also could not stop thinking that Jun Hyuk may be more of a genius than he thought.</p><br/><p>The episode two days ago had an average 4% viewer rating, while Jun Hyuk\u2019s air time was 6%. Last year, the ratings had remained under 2% during the area preliminaries.</p><br/><p>Was there a reason to eliminate this Jun Hyuk at the end of two or three performances? The average person is fascinated by genius. What would happen if they showed everything that Jun Hyuk is capable of?</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik wanted to go over how this season would go again. He could show a completely different side from the last four episodes. Producer Kim had another worry to add to his list.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

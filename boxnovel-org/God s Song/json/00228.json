Ibrahim Maalouf\u2019s bass performance was selected of the 2 night 3 day show.</p><br/><p>All of the reviews said that he showed his genius and artistic talent with performances that were not just romantic and delicate, but also ingenious.</p><br/><p>Trumpet performer Ibrahim Maalouf is popular for creating unique music by mixing Arab and electronic music with jazz. He is gaining more fame at the moment because of his soundtrack for the movie .</p><br/><p>It is not that there are no articles regarding Jun Hyuk. But they were mostly plain articles.</p><br/><p>\u2018It is difficult to handle falling a little short if your expectations are too high.\u2019</p><br/><p>President Stern folded the paper he was reading. He could tell what kind of performance Jun Hyuk gave just from reading the articles. The First, the album where he played with Stanley Clarke nonstop for an hour.</p><br/><p>Because of The First, critics will have expected an endless spirit of jazz from Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar, but they just got a reproduction of Lee Carlton and Stanley Clarke\u2019s hit songs.</p><br/><p>This difference will have brought disappointment to critics and die hard jazz fans, and pleasure to people enjoying the festival.</p><br/><p>Critics and jazz fans will be enthusiastic about another of Jun Hyuk\u2019s performances anyway.</p><br/><p>President Stern heard the file that Lee Carlton\u2019s exclusive record label sent over. Jun Hyuk\u2019s true Monterey Jazz Festival performance is in this 3 hour file.</p><br/><p>The first 20 minutes contains the 3 people talking and laughing, and then 1 hour is Jun Hyuk leading the session. They discussed a new style while resting for 30 minutes, and the following performance was Lee Carlton and Stanley Clarke going back and forth as though in conversation with Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar presenting themes.</p><br/><p>Lee Carlton\u2019s record label wanted to edit just the performance parts to create 2 albums, but President Stern\u2019s thoughts were different.</p><br/><p>Their conversations are another part of jazz. He cannot find a reason to go out of their way and omit these gem-like opinions on jazz, music, and performing. He wants to reveal the entire thing as long as Lee Carlton and Stanley Clarke are okay with it.</p><br/><p>As soon President Stern walked into the apartment, Jun Hyuk held a score out to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. This is the score I\u2019m going to use for the show in Seoul. It\u2019s the arranged score with orchestration, so you can give it to Seoul Symphony. This is the score for the piano concerto.</p><br/><p>\u201cPiano Concerto? What is this? You wrote a new song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I arranged AEIOU into a piano song. Oh, just make sure that Amelia plays the premiere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a gift for your girlfriend? Ha ha. Fine. I\u2019ll hang on to this\u2026 Oh right. It\u2019s okay if you conduct, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019ll become a better gift if I conduct. But is it the New York Philharmonic again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. The New York Philharmonic has a full schedule through the end of the year. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll check Amelia\u2019s schedule and look into it separately.\u201d Isaac Stern gave Jun Hyuk a CD.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, listen to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what the singer who will be performing at the show in Seoul sent over. He wrote the lyrics himself, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you listen to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk turned the CD on, a song from his 1st album \u2013 already a thing of the past \u2013 came out with an acoustic guitar accompaniment and a man\u2019s rough voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlvin Lee? Is this really Alvin Lee?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk yelled in surprise as soon as he heard the voice on the CD. President Stern laughed without saying anything and only nodded. He put his finger on his lips and signaled to Jun Hyuk to listen to the end.</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee\u2019s lyrics are completely different from those of the original song. Yoon Jung Su\u2019s lyrics contained each day of Jun Hyuk\u2019s daily life spent in the cafe. But Alvin Lee\u2019s lyrics are about life. It is a succession of anxiety, washed over in rough waves, but has the meaning that there is reason and value to go on living \u201ceven so\u201d.</p><br/><p>The CD track ended and President Stern turned to Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Do you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis man is really impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was already standing up in excitement, pacing the living room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I asked if you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe tried to sing without touching the original song at all, even though his vocal color is so different from that of the original singer\u2019s. His ability to control emotion while controlling the tone of his voice is outstanding. He really\u2026 is the embodiment of a legend.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern\u2019s prediction had been on point. Jun Hyuk does not seem to care about the lyric\u2019s message. When President Stern first listened to the CD, he thought of when Alvin Lee said that he is not Yates. He is not a top poet like Yates, but the lyrics are thoughtful with his reconsiderations on life.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Hyuk is lost in Alvin Lee\u2019s voice and tone. Isaac laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. You\u2019re really strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care much about the lyrics even though lyrics have incredible power in pop music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk calmed down bashfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do about it. You need to enjoy lyrics, but I can\u2019t do that. They don\u2019t get relayed as words and sentences but as sounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>This aspect of Jun Hyuk is an advantage that he can catch music precisely, but also a disadvantage that he will never be able to write lyrics. This also means that President Stern needs to keep looking for lyricists who can create lyrics that fit with Jun Hyuk\u2019s music.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another strange thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he. What\u2019s so strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour expression and attitude towards classical and pop music. It almost looks like you love rock, jazz, and the blues more than you do classical.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. I love all of them. It\u2019s just that the happiness I feel with each is different.\u201d</p><br/><p>As an average person, President Stern will never know what happiness Jun Hyuk is talking about, so all he could do was shrug.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho decided to take on the bass and drums?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both people you know. The bass is Colin and the Korean drummer from the 1st album is on the drums.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Colin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It worked out for his schedule too. Why? Don\u2019t you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I know Colin\u2019s bass well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s sealed. Does this mean that Jun\u2019s first band has been formed? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The part that President Stern is looking forward to most for the show in Korea is not the orchestra and piano\u2019s joint performance, but the band. What will the combination of Alvin Lee\u2019s voice and Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar be like? It is a combination where anticipation is inevitable.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, now decide where the band rehearsals will be. Here in New York? Or LA? Or\u2026 do you want to just go abroad and have fun while you practice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac, will you be there too when we do rehearsals?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be different by the location. I\u2019ll go along if it\u2019s abroad.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern did not hide the excited expression of someone preparing to travel, and Jun Hyuk smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the drummer needs to come from Korea anyway, I guess somewhere in the middle like Hawaii wouldn\u2019t be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Then let\u2019s say Hawaii and I\u2019ll prepare it.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cHawaii?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I sent a plane ticket too. We leave in 3 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>He is holding the plane ticket to Hawaii in his hand, but he feels like it is a dream and not reality.</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho, who was the drummer of the band Steel Blade, had also thought that it was a dream when he found out that he had been chosen as the drummer for Jun Hyuk\u2019s Seoul show. But all the way to Hawaii just for rehearsals? This really does feel like a dream.</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho left the band after he and Jun Hyuk were done with the audition program. He needed to be a little more selfish for his future. If he stayed in Steel Blade, which Jun Hyuk had said was not progressive, he would be done in music.</p><br/><p>He looked for a new band, but that was not easy either. Thankfully, there was no end to places looking for him because they saw how he played the drums on the audition program.</p><br/><p>Many studios called requesting drum sessions.</p><br/><p>He participated in various types of music, from girl group dance songs to movie soundtracks, and did not stop practicing. Then this amazing opportunity with Jun Hyuk had come to him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

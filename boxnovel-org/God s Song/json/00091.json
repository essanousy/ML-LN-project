Producer Kim Ki Sik picked up the call confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Director.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKim Ki Sik! You jerk. Why won\u2019t you pick up my calls!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just picked up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Jun Hyuk? Where\u2019s that brat right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be in the waiting room or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha ha. You did well. I was so anxious the whole time I was watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about me? I thought I was going to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou worked hard. You can\u2019t leave once you\u2019re done with work today. Let\u2019s get everyone together for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pay it off with alcohol. Bring me a bonus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a brat. What are you going to do now? Is Jun Hyuk out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. We need to take him out of the running. If we save him now, it wouldn\u2019t make sense. We\u2019ll be advertising that this isn\u2019t an audition program.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Just make sure you get a good interview today. At least get him to say why he cried.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep working hard. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngest member of the production team came running as the Director\u2019s laughter rang over the phone with his certainty that they would have high viewer ratings.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim! Jun Hyuk\u2026 Jun Hyuk disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in the waiting room or the bathroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go crazy. Hurry up and find him!\u201d</p><br/><p>How long would these unexpected situations last? He had never been part of such a rollercoaster ride in all of the live shows he had done until now. Producer Kim Ki Sik only hoped that they could get past today safely.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk was lying down on the sofa in the recording studio watching TV, but got up as soon as Jun Hyuk\u2019s song stopped. He could tell from the timbre as soon as Jun Hyuk started singing that he was not following his biological mother\u2019s image, but her sight.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun was watching the broadcast on the large TV in the cafe and could not stay still when Jun Hyuk disappeared behind the stage. He wanted to run to the broadcasting station, but it would be over once he arrived. He could not figure out what to do and paced inside.</p><br/><p>After hesitating for 10 minutes, he put on his jacket to leave the cafe when his phone rang loudly. An unknown phone number. He picked it up thinking that it would be an employee at the broadcasting station.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sir?</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. You\u2026 What about the broadcast? Where are you? Why is there so much noise? Whose phone number is this\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, this is the taxi driver\u2019s phone. I\u2019m on my way to the cafe right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Taxi? Hey! What about the broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, I don\u2019t know. Really. The broadcast or whatever.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re on your way to the cafe? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes. And sir, please come to the cafe if you\u2019re at home. I don\u2019t have any money on me. The taxi will come out to a lot\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m watching the broadcast at the cafe right now. Don\u2019t worry and hurry up and get here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun ended the call and checked the phone number again. He thought that he would need to hurry up and tell the station this. A participant disappeared. Would they be able to rectify the situation? It is a great broadcast accident.</p><br/><p>Then the phone rang again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, Mr. Yoon. I\u2019m the youngest writer at MV. Do you remember me?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yes. I was just about to call.\u201d</p><br/><p>I have something to tell you\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling because of Jun Hyuk? Don\u2019t worry. I just spoke to him. He said he\u2019s on the way here in a taxi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Excuse me? A taxi?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I think he was so surprised after he made an accident on live broadcast.?</p><br/><p>Sir, wait a second. Please don\u2019t hang up the phone.</p><br/><p>He could hear someone\u2019s cursing, grumbling, and sighing through the phone.</p><br/><p>Sir, can\u2019t you convince Jun Hyuk to turn the taxi around now? All we have to do is wrap it up\u2026..</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun could only feel sorry at the youngest writer\u2019s cautious voice. If the kid was someone who would go back, he would not have run away in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll be hard. It\u2019s also uncertain whether he\u2019ll even go back on stage if he does go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, I see. I\u2019ll give you a call again.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun hung up the phone and turned the TV on again. He did not have to worry about Jun Hyuk because he was on his way home, but he wanted to see what would happen to the broadcast.</p><br/><p>He was sure that the sweat on MC Yoon Kyung Min\u2019s forehead was not from the heat of the lights. He started announcing the eliminations as he stuttered.</p><br/><p>As soon as he announced Jun Hyuk\u2019s name, they screened the scene where his song stopped. This came along with a request to excuse his absence as he is not in a state to appear on stage.</p><br/><p>As soon as the broadcast ended, his phone rang and he heard the youngest writer\u2019s weak voice.</p><br/><p>Sir, it\u2019s me, the youngest writer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sure you had a lot of issues with the broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019s okay since we somehow wrapped it up. Oh right, sir.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>We need to meet Jun Hyuk tomorrow, so please convince him for us.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow? Can I ask why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since we finished the last like this today\u2026 we thought we would at least need to get an interview to air next week.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be compliant too since he did cause a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thank you. The cafe opens at 11? Can we go looking for you before you open?</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, is 9:00 okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes. Then we will see you tomorrow.</p><br/><p>30 minutes after he got off the phone, he could see the bright light of a car outside the cafe.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun paid the taxi fare and took a Jun Hyuk who could not look him in the eyes inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had not been able to lift his head because he thought that he would be scolded, but looked up at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s gentle voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just came. I was going to be eliminated anyway and there was no reason to stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so. You need to finish up the broadcast before you come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. You said it too. You told me to just quit and come back if I didn\u2019t want to do it anymore. I guess that\u2019s why I came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, did that mean you should quit and leave in the middle of a live broadcast? You should have finished up the live broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Embarrased? What\u2019s embarrassing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know. I almost cried in front of the entire nation. I made myself a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you saying you came here because you were embarrassed? You\u2019re driving me crazy. Geez. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it. I think I\u2019m going to go crazy. What kind of embarrassment is this\u2026 whew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you really almost cry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s real. I would\u2019ve cried if I sat there for another second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun also had the thought that it might have been better if he had just cried his heart out. Crying is a way to shake one\u2019s feelings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Well whatever happened, you worked hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun poured two glasses of sparkling wine in the kitchen and handed one over to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrink it and calm down a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this alcohol?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving it to you to congratulate you on finishing the broadcast. You worked hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun pat Jun Hyuk\u2019s back and clinked his glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never drank before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid. You think I don\u2019t know? I know you take beers and wine from the fridge. I just pretended I didn\u2019t know. I drank when people weren\u2019t looking at your age too. You\u2019re acting like it\u2019s something new.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun saw Jun Hyuk laugh and drank his refreshing wine. Whatever had happened, Jun Hyuk had experienced a lot in a short period of time and had taken a step into society.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

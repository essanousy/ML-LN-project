The anonymous applicants were just checked casually to see if they had anything unique in their resumes and weren\u2019t really given too much attention. They started by choosing the applicants with unusual histories or funny videos. Because this was entertainment. More than talent, it was important to find something they could sell.</p><br/><p>After filtering through the 1st round, thousands of applicants went to the gymnasium or auditorium in their respective areas. These locations were filled with booths set up for each applicant to show off their talents and try to make it to the next round. The broadcasting station\u2019s goal was to find qualifying participants in each area who were cool, admirable, or funny. Search for any real musical talent or ability was a farce. If it could sell, they wanted it \u2013 whether they could sing, dance, perform, or not.</p><br/><p>On the day of the preliminary area qualifier, Jun Hyuk went to the auditorium with his acoustic guitar. When he arrived, the young writer he met last time came running out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome Jun Hyuk. Come this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was obvious he was drooling at the marketable young boy.</p><br/><p>In the waiting room the young writer led him to the main writer, Production Chief ,Kim Ki Sik and a well-dressed middle-aged woman who looked as though she had made countless men cry in her youth. The two had been holding a meeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim, this is the piano genius we told you about. This is Jang Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Shik was already at a loss for words. He could not take his eyes from the long curly hair, tall height, and well proportioned body. Now this. This is he could sell. This would bring viewers!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m the producer in charge of \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk awkwardly shook Producer Kim Ki Shik\u2019s hand lightly and let go.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have great expectations for you because you most definitely stand out. Anyway, we\u2019re going to make you and the top 10 the main focus until Star Week. Of course the top 10 varies, but the candidates we predict usually make it into the top 10.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk seemed to be half-listening, but Producer Kim kept chatting.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you can\u2019t sing, becoming one of the finalists will be difficult. This program does run on singing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk only nodded his head. A person\u2019s voice was just another instrument, but he could not understand why they made such a differentiation. Songs with lyrics just had text that made it easier to deliver. Ultimately, it was just a relaying of emotion and this could be fully accomplished with a melody from an instrument.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd since you don\u2019t speak very much, what do you think of going with a chic concept?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning when you\u2019re going through screening and when you\u2019re with the other contestants, you act indifferent and a little annoyed. Maybe even a little snobby?\u201d</p><br/><p>The writer next to him pitched in,</p><br/><p>\u201cWith your image, you have to act a little snobby to look more attractive. We should go with a rebellious image and not that of the kind protagonist in a romantic cartoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had no idea what these people were talking about. It wasn\u2019t like they were filming a soap opera, but what was all of this with concept and protagonist?</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk is naturally chic. You won\u2019t have to worry about it. Jun Hyuk, just be yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young writer sensed Jun Hyuk\u2019s discomfort and spoke up again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why the guitar? Aren\u2019t you playing the piano today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim had already placed a grand piano in the screening room, but there was a guitar case hanging from Jun Hyuk\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to play the guitar today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim could not hide his inconvenience. He had already imagined him playing the piano, and a guitar did not have as much impact.</p><br/><p>He did look forward to the expectation that Jun Hyuk would sing since he brought out an acoustic guitar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the song you prepared for today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it yet\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you bring the guitar to sing a song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim thought that it was an error in judgment to hang their expectations on a kid like this who did whatever he wanted. He even had the thought that with one mistake, they might have to edit out all of Jun Hyuk\u2019s air time.</p><br/><p>All that was remaining was to see how they could sell his looks.</p><br/><p>After sending Jun Hyuk from the room, the middle-aged woman who had been silent turned towards Producer Kim.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim. Now that I look at you, you have an eye for seeing talent. How did you find him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur youngest writer found him. What do you think? You think he\u2019ll be any good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAny good? You\u2019ve hit jackpot. Great, our XOR will sponsor on the condition that he makes it into Star Week no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Marketing Director of Korea\u2019s representative casual brand XOR was already thinking of how to use Jun Hyuk as the model for their new line.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Director. How can I decide that? There are other kids who can be used so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? We just found a kid who could stand on the runway now and you want me to use something recycled?\u201d</p><br/><p>In contrast with the smiling Producer Kim Ki Sik, she held a straight face and waved her hand as if he said something ludicrous.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it like this, Producer Kim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Director.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t think that child can make it to Star Week, pass him over to us now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to make him our exclusive model altogether. He\u2019ll need to have talent as a model of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want to have priority over him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the sponsorship?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that boy signs a contract with us, we\u2019ll go through with the sponsorship. How does that sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s opinions were unimportant. No teenager in Korea would turn down this opportunity to be made into a model or celebrity.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs is expected of you, Director. I\u2019ll arrange for a meeting with the legal team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik gave her a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>But Jun Hyuk was not other kids. How would he react to this new idea?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

An opera with a moving and changing stage, and a background screen with video that makes a car chase scene possible. Jun Hyuk is dreaming of a dynamic stage like a movie.</p><br/><p>To him, Paul Kieve\u2019s stage effects and techniques are perfect.</p><br/><p>Once he chose the stage art and sound directors, and brought on a writer who would make Ungaretti\u2019s lyrics into a complete scenario, all of the people left were those who would take on the most important roles.</p><br/><p>These are the lead vocalists and the director who would lead the acting. The triplex dancing, singing, and acting need to be in harmony for it to be an opera and a musical. Jun Hyuk\u2019s opera however, does not have dancing, but the major axes are acting and singing.</p><br/><p>President Stern was busy starting vocalist auditions and selecting a director to lead the acting.</p><br/><p>Already famous star singers simply expressed their interest in participating instead of auditioning. What they need is to coordinate those stars and casting.</p><br/><p>Everyone wanted the role of the hero, Vito Corleone, but Jun Hyuk shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he too old? Will he be able to take it on when he\u2019s over 70?\u201d</p><br/><p>The card that Jun Hyuk held out for the role that needs to take on the whole 2nd act and middle of the 3rd act, or half of the entire opera, would seem irrational to anyone. It is natural that President Stern is worried.</p><br/><p>If the opera is a success, it will not end after a few performances. The actors will need to handle doing at least 50. Jun Hyuk\u2019s card, Dario Argento, is not young enough to take on such a rigorous schedule.</p><br/><p>Dario Argento, a vocalist from Spain, was born in 1941. There is no need for him to be the same age is the role, but he cannot make the same sound that he made during his heydays.</p><br/><p>He made his official debut as a baritone in 1961 and after, he raised his range to tenor and became active.</p><br/><p>He is the opera singer who has taken on the most roles in human history and he has almost no language barrier, so though his native language is Spanish, he was also able to take on roles in languages including Italian, French, German, English, and Russian.</p><br/><p>Though he is more than 70 years old, he is not thinking of retiring and is still active. The old man is still expanding his repertoire by starring as baritone and in new roles in forgotten works or premieres.</p><br/><p>He cannot beat the wall of time though, and rejects main roles on his own and mostly takes on supporting roles.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we offer it, he\u2019s likely to turn it down. It\u2019s a big burden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI chose him because of his age. I don\u2019t want someone who sings too perfectly with a clean voice. He really needs to seem ill especially in the 3rd part where the old man barely recovers after being shot. We need to show the retired boss\u2019 deterioration, and a young tenor won\u2019t be able to express that.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a given that a great singer wants to fully show his talent on stage. But what Jun Hyuk wants is someone who fits the role perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis acting is like that of a movie actor, so there\u2019s no need to change that and since there is \u2018spinto\u2019, there\u2019s no better person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spinto is Italian for \u2018push\u2019. It refers to the strength and weight of a tenor that can intensely push a high pitch while being sustainable.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll arrange a meeting. What are you going to do? Are you going to meet him with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whatever happens, Jun Hyuk is the person in charge of this opera. President Stern has no choice but to follow his lead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to, won\u2019t I? We need to show that we\u2019re asking this of him earnestly.\u201d</p><br/><p>There is a character more important to Jun Hyuk than the protagonist.</p><br/><p>The female vocalist barely appears in the original. But the soprano who expresses the tragedy in the introduction is a very important role.</p><br/><p>Vito Corleone\u2019s mother. Vito\u2019s father was killed for disobeying the area\u2019s mafia boss Don Francesco Ciccio, and Vito\u2019s older brother was shot to death at his father\u2019s funeral for swearing revenge.</p><br/><p>Vito\u2019s mother went looking for Don Ciccio and begged for him to save the second son, Vito, but he said that he could not let him live because he will, without a doubt, try to get revenge if he grows more.</p><br/><p>So Vito\u2019s mother takes out a knife, holds Don Ciccio hostage to let Vito escape, and she takes a bullet to her death.</p><br/><p>The soprano needs to leave after just 2 songs that express this powerful motherhood and a tragedy that leads to the death of the entire family. She needs to sing the devastating situation of having to beg the enemy, who killed her husband and oldest son, to save her last remaining son.</p><br/><p>On top of that, her son will die if she slashes the mafia boss\u2019 neck with the knife, but she cannot push the knife in if she wants to save her son. In this incredible situation, she holds him hostage until her son gets away and she needs to sing while crying out for her son to be safe.</p><br/><p>It took Ungaretti over 2 weeks to write the script for these 2 songs alone. Jun Hyuk was strangely fussy and obsessed over it, repeatedly demanding edits. When he was pleased with the lyrics, he told Ungaretti with confidence,</p><br/><p>\u201cThese 2 songs will become the representative songs of the opera.\u201d</p><br/><p>They are called the representative songs, but it is a supporting role that needs to sing just 2 songs before exiting. There was no one who wanted to audition for this role.</p><br/><p>Andalucia is the 2nd largest district in Spain, located in the south of the country on the Mediterranean Sea. The climate is hot even for warm southern Europe, so it is a top vacation spot for Europeans.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? By myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He said that he wants to talk with you alone. I\u2019ll be at the hotel, so call when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern left Jun Hyuk in front of a big mansion, and briskly went back to the hotel.</p><br/><p>With white hair, a face without wrinkles, tall height, and brawny build, Dario Argento does not look like he is over 70 years old. He welcomed Jun Hyuk who came in looking around at the living room that is as large as a gym.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome, Maestro.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, Mr. Argento.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Argento took Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand, he could feel vigor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it have to be me? Isn\u2019t there Salvatore Licitra who is at an appropriate age and is the best tenor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento slowly enjoyed a glass of wine as they exchanged greetings before he asked in a straightforward manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still vigorous. There are 3 acts but young Vito Corleone comes out in the 1st, so you\u2019ll be able to handle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know, but I can\u2019t even do a C5 (3 octave, high C) right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is one of the biggest reasons why I want to work with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Well, ha ha. You\u2019ve come determined.\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento laughed good naturedly. It is the work that is currently receiving the most attention, and the fact that the musician at the center of it all wants him helps to momentarily get rid of the sadness of growing older.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not just something I\u2019m saying. A singer who does a high C perfectly needs to take the role of the son. I want a treble that feels like it is worn out. It\u2019s the last flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento drank the last of his wine and stared at his empty glass for a while. He spoke again when there was an awkward silence and it was about to become uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Did you notice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I realized after I heard you in the London charity concert in the Spring. There\u2019s someone wrong with your throat, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom hearing that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento almost dropped his wine glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you get surgery?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLast year. It wasn\u2019t a big procedure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dario Argento\u2019s dropped voice showed his feelings.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. That\u2019s why your voice changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised. This is something that only my family and the hospital know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have noticed either if you had an average voice. I was able to catch that subtle difference because your voice is so delicate and it has strong character.\u201d</p><br/><p>Argento filled his glass and buried his body deep in the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to retire now. Singing lightly at a charity concert is okay, but it\u2019s possible for me to sing passionately in an opera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but what exactly does impossible mean? Does it mean you can\u2019t sing at all? Or does it mean that your voice isn\u2019t smooth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not mind at all even though Argento said that it is impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s closer to the latter. As I go higher, I\u2019m sure my voice will crack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 it doesn\u2019t mean that your life would be at stake or there would be damage to your vocal chords if you sing too much in an opera\u2026 right?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

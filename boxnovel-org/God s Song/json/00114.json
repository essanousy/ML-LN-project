Yeah\u2026 I\u2019m going to leave the day after tomorrow. I need to stay an extra day\u2026 There\u2019s nothing I can do. Adjust my schedule in Philadelphia\u2026 Yeah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel came out of Jun Hyuk\u2019s room and changed his itinerary to return to Philadelphia. It was not that he did not realize this is a nuisance to his manager, but he felt that there would be lingering regret if he just went back like this.</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel left the room, but Danny could not get out of his shock. It has already been 3 months since they shared a room. He had thought that they had gotten a lot closer and that he knew Jun Hyuk well. But he realized today that he had been mistaken in thinking that he knew his roommate well.</p><br/><p>Since the first time he got in trouble for reading a score first, he had not even looked at Jun Hyuk through the side of his eye when he was composing. Danny meant to respect Jun Hyuk\u2019s solemn consciousness. He did not know why, but Jun Hyuk always sent his songs to Korea when he completed them. It was not even in an e-mail, but postal with the paper score.</p><br/><p>Scores he sent at least once a week. Danny hated himself for not even taking a peek at them. If he had seen even a little, he would have been able to notice Jun Hyuk\u2019s true self.</p><br/><p>He needed to push all other thoughts in his head and ask the most important question. Danny cautiously opened his mouth,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. A slow development with advancement one step at a time\u2026 Does that mean there\u2019s a lack of talent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it just now. Amelia has the potential to jump over a wall but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny dropped his head when Jun Hyuk responded without a second of hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oy. This kid grew up in a lenient environment. He has a fragile mentality.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Danny. Are you misunderstanding me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny still had his head down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m saying that Amelia is a genius and that you\u2019re just average?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you meant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was trying to come up with a way to explain the difference between Amelia and Danny when he thought of two musicians.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 Do you like jazz?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s better? Miles Davis or John Coltrane?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! How do you pick? They\u2019re both amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? Aren\u2019t they both geniuses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>A great alien who unluckily crash-landed on this planet from space, the king of jazz, Miles Davis.</p><br/><p>When major record label Columbia gave a scouting offer in 1955, he was already under a contract with Prestige Records.</p><br/><p>To cancel the contract, he would need to release as many albums as the agency had demanded. The saxophonist who joined then was John Coltrane.</p><br/><p>In order to figure out the problem of the dual contracts with Columbia and Prestige, Miles Davis needed to record with Prestige more. In 1956, he ended up recording 4 albums for the so-called \u2018in\u2019 series \u2018Steamin\u2019\u2019, \u2018Relaxin\u2019\u2019, \u2018Workin\u2019\u2019, and \u2018Cookin\u2019\u2019. This record became one of the best in Hard Bop (spirit of jazz that is melodic and funky).</p><br/><p>\u201cMiles Davis made two albums a day, four albums in two days. That kind of music comes out even if he is improvising and playing without much thought. But what about John Coltrane? He\u2019s someone who really made an effort, practicing until he went to sleep. Going up one step at a time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny finally lifted his head when Jun Hyuk compared him to John Coltrane.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey both called geniuses now. This is the difference between you and Amelia. And\u2026 you think anyone can become John Coltrane with just the effort? It\u2019s impossible. Whatever you say, John Coltrane is a genius with a tremendous talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny\u2019s face brightened when Jun Hyuk admitted that he is a genius. He could not help it because he had dedicated himself to an area where talent is most important. With a large palate (roof of the mouth), it is possible to make a good sound with stringed instruments. It is a world where even the shape of one\u2019s mouth is a determining factor in the ability to enter the first class.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just different kinds of geniuses. Didn\u2019t you win in the Montreal junior competition that all violinists under 16 went out for? At age 11? You think that\u2019s possible through effort alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk tapped Danny\u2019s shoulder and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to have confidence. If you don\u2019t stop trying, you can become the greatest violinist. And someone like you lasts for a long time, people like Amelia are uncertain. You don\u2019t know when they might collapse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny spoke carefully again,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? I was born with an unimaginable genius plus effort. You didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Bruno Kazel came out of Jun Hyuk\u2019s room and ran back to the party. He found the professors still drinking beers and went next to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor, let\u2019s perform again one more time tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I would like to perform just the piano concerto on stage one more time.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the professors, reopening a performance that the maestro had not been satisfied with was a grateful thing for the students. The students would welcome being able to see such a great\u2019s command for two days in a row. However, the maestro\u2019s continued words made everyone silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly, I would like to leave the command to composer Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun as the conductor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not just the professors but the students began to murmur. It was not strange or new for a composer to command his own song. It was not even important that Jun Hyuk is a freshman or even that he is young. It is not uncommon for a classical musician to command as a teenager.</p><br/><p>It was just shocking that Bruno Kazel himself was making this request. They did not know what he had discovered in Jun Hyuk\u2019s song, but the maestro wants to hear the performance from the composer himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that would be an honor for us. Is it that you would like to teach Jun Hyuk command?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I would just like to watch Jun Hyuk as a conductor. Will that be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>This meant that Bruno Kazel had accepted Jun Hyuk as a fellow conductor.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the end of this conversation, the students who had been drinking bottles of beer, scattered. The CH orchestra members were thinking that they would finally know the identity of the rumored kid. The other students disappeared to text those who had not been present at the party.</p><br/><p>Early the next morning, Jun Hyuk and Amelia were called to Professor Randall who told them about Bruno Kazel\u2019s proposition from the night before. They could guess why Bruno Kazel had made this suggestion. Only four people knew of last night\u2019s events.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Poster saw Jun Hyuk hesitate and continued his cautionary words.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Kazel asked this of us because he said that he would like to see you command\u2026 It would be ill-mannered to to reject.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with it but\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked sideways at Amelia and watched her expression. Amelia turned to Jun Hyuk instead of the professor to speak,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Jun, give me time to practice separately. I\u2019ve played this song with the orchestra plenty of times, so is there a need for me to go into rehearsal again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Do what you want. Then I\u2019ll see you at the concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>They stood up before listening to Professor Randall\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t those two have a friendly relationship?\u2019</p><br/><p>Professor Poster who did not know anything of last night\u2019s events had a bad feeling about tonight\u2019s performance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

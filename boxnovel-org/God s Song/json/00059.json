That was really impressive. How did you think to propose such a deal? I couldn\u2019t even imagine that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Then who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoon Kwang Hun? The cafe owner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. That man was a fearsome beast in the past. He\u2019s living quietly because he\u2019s a wolf without teeth now. He can easily ruin a producer of a broadcast station.\u201d</p><br/><p>The junior lawyer had a difficult time conceptualizing the cafe owner he had seen once as a fearsome beast. He could not imagine that from that quiet man who had only smiled cheerfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was only going to confirm the facts with the broadcast station. I was just going to end it after seeing if they spread the subject matter for the tabloids. The broadcast station isn\u2019t our target. We need to ruin the press offices and the people making malicious comments since the objects of the lawsuit are these two. The broadcast station doesn\u2019t have a link to Yoon Kwang Hun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I thought it was strange as well. Even if they did spread the rumors, it\u2019s obvious that they\u2019ll pretend they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe still need to check. What did you think? That producer seemed to be surprised, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m certain he has a relationship with that agency you talked about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s nothing we can do. There\u2019s no evidence and he\u2019s not a direct party. If we shake the press office, they\u2019re bound to fight each other. If the agency paid them off, you think they\u2019ll stay still? As they do that, I\u2019m sure something more will come out. I was going to wait, but Yoon Kwang Hun said that we need to wield the knife while we had it by the hilt. Later later. It\u2019s stupid to rely on later when we don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll end up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho recalled Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s past when he was like a fearsome beast. He had been the person able to crush a perfectly good company without hesitation in order to guarantee success in future investments.</p><br/><p>He used to be a cruel beast who would laugh and say that it was the law of nature for a wolf to eat a lamb.</p><br/><p>Life was really unpredictable when seeing a man like now running a cafe while taking care of a talented boy.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik sat in the conference room alone for a while and then ran to the legal team.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Producer Kim. Good that you came. I was going to request a meeting with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? How did you know? Did they go to you too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. They said they wanted to check a few things\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk must really be a gem. He\u2019s only been on air once or twice, but magnate company like this starts managing him. It\u2019s a good thing they appeared after our contract with him was already completed. If not, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to contract him. They would have made a huge deal that it\u2019s an unfair contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>The legal team looked as though they were relieved that Peace had come later without realizing that Producer Kim Ki Sik was burning up inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why those people came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s something else, but it doesn\u2019t matter for us. It\u2019s an issue with the media. But\u2026 is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rumors that provoked the internet. Age and position had nothing to do with wanting to know the truth behind these gossip articles. The middle aged chief of the legal team had eyes full of curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe articles in the media? No. Jun Hyuk and the cafe owner don\u2019t have that kind of relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then the press offices are dead. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief of the legal team laughed sinisterly as though he already knew what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see the warrant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it. That\u2019s not something special, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the date it was delegated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cafe owner signed the warrant the day the first article went out. But it\u2019s been three weeks and Peace hasn\u2019t done anything.Why do you think they would do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if Jun Hyuk and the cafe owner had held a press conference as soon as the first articles went out? If Jun Hyuk had cried while saying \u2018Yoon Kwang Hun is like a father to me,\u2019 wouldn\u2019t it have been heartwarming?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik had a vague idea of why the time the warrant had been delegated was important.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t they announce gender equality last week? After checking, Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s attorney said that he would review everything. The internet became quiet after the gender equality announcement too. That situation was resolved with this. Peace has been waiting until now. They\u2019ve been gathering the materials for their counterpunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief\u2019s explanation was no longer necessary. Producer Kim Ki Sik knew enough about Peace\u2019s strategy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many articles are there on the internet? Didn\u2019t the press offices go overboard and write more when the cafe owner disappeared? Tsk tsk, they wrote articles as undoubtable facts instead of leaving room for suspicion. All of the comments were covered in swearing. Peace has been waiting for that. Now the press office and the people who left comments are all dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that bad? But it\u2019s a press office\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you wouldn\u2019t know. Once, there was a scandal about an actress and people commented all sorts of bad things like that she was dirty and a tramp. That actress hired Peace to sue those commenters.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief stuck out his tongue while thinking of how severe the people at Peace are,</p><br/><p>\u201cThey went through criminal proceedings for malicious libel and got fines for $200. And going on to civil rights, they claimed damage fines of $2,000 per person. That\u2019s hundreds of people, hundreds. Peace made sure they received every last bit of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen that actress hired Peace, she had agreed to give them all of the compensation as their fees since it doesn\u2019t look good for a successful actress to take money from random people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><br/><p>One question had been answered. Now he knew how a cafe owner had been able to hire Peace.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim, you have no sense. What money does a cafe owner have to hire Peace as his attorney? I bet Peace will take more than 80% of the compensation they receive. This is a lawsuit resulting in at least $10 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold sweat he showed in front of lawyer Baek Seung Ho was nothing. The events to come were not going to end with the internet press office. The wounded press office might charge Dine Music for the money. This link needed to end at Dine Music.</p><br/><p>The chief of the legal team had a hunch that something was wrong when he saw Producer Kim Ki Sik\u2019s cold sweat,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are you like that? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? We\u2019re not involved, are we? Hurry up and tell me before the problem gets bigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth is\u2026 It seems that someone on our end was drinking with a person at some agency and talked about the two people\u2019s relationship. And that was spilled to the press office through that agency.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew\u2026 That\u2019s fine. I was surprised. I knew the articles had gone up too quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just something he said drunk. If you\u2019re looking at it legally, the problem is the person who wrote the article. Is everything you say while you\u2019re drinking the truth? That\u2019s just a personal thought or guess. The person who wrote it without checking the facts is at fault. There\u2019s no power in the spoken word. It needs to be printed, photographed, or recorded. It needs to be detailed. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, okay. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They could slip out of it and they could end the connection. Producer Kim Ki Sik thought that he needed to hurry up and tell the director of the entertainment station this and cut their ties to Dine Music.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They\u2019re saying they have the upper hand, are they? He\u2019s trying to make as much off of the kid as he can. Shit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik did not want to lose Jun Hyuk. He knew that it was hard to find a musician of this level, not a singer.</p><br/><p>He wanted to examine his intuition again.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim, today\u2019s not the day. It feels like we\u2019re holding auditions for the national talent show. How come there\u2019s no one useful?\u201d</p><br/><p>The program\u2019s main music producer was grumbling about the contestants\u2019 low potential as if it were the producer\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, there\u2019s not one good person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking when you know? That handsome kid. The guitar performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Jun Hyuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, I cried. How could that kind of emotion come out of a guitar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you know those rappers from yesterday? The duet group from Pyeongtaek. What do you think of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, those kids were good. The guitar and those two stood out the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk heard that rap once and arranged the music for them. He changed the chorus a little bit too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? After hearing it once?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you that\u2019s what happened. And that\u2019s after he just happened to hear them practicing next to him in the waiting room. Can you do that too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter hearing it once and on the spot? And hearing it for the first time on top of that? That kid really is a genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik made up his mind to sign Jun Hyuk even if he had to modify the contract. If a music producer with 30 years of experience in the industry said that he was a genius, there was no doubt that he was a genius.</p><br/><p>Even if they adjusted the profit share so that they were only receiving a small amount, geniuses always made up for it. It was possible that Jun Hyuk alone could bring in more money than all of the other contestants would combined.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

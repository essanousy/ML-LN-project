It was none other than New York Philharmonic\u2019s standing conductor, Dimitris Carras. The first item on his schedule upon arriving in New York was to visit Jun Hyuk\u2019s apartment with Isaac Stern.</p><br/><p>Dimitris Carras was shocked when he saw Jun Hyuk open the front door and welcome them. He had not imagined that this would be the house of the composer of Inferno.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy friends sent me pictures they took with you and said that it\u2019s a face that I must remember. I didn\u2019t know what they were talking about at first, but you don\u2019t know how surprised I was when I was told you\u2019re the composer of Inferno. I was expecting you to be a white-haired old man. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>After laughing refreshingly, Carras pat President Stern on the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. You signed on yet another amazing treasure. I guess I won\u2019t receive a good treatment from Stern Corporation from now on. You\u2019ll have 2 young geniuses at the head.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Dimitris Carras debuted as a conductor, the first person to hand him a contract was a 35-year-old Isaac Stern. He did it with the promise to make him the standing conductor of one of the top 3 philharmonics in the world.</p><br/><p>And 20 years later, Isaac Stern kept that promise. 5 years have already passed since he became the standing conductor and art director of the New York Philharmonic at the age of 55. The two men are friends who have confided in each other their whole lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about right. Even if you say that you want to terminate your contract with us now, it won\u2019t matter to me. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then that means I\u2019ll have to think differently too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while they had been chatting jokingly, Carras kept glancing at the front door.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. When is the person who wrote the choral concerto coming? Jun, have you met him already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitris Carras looked at the two of them in curiosity and Isaac Stern could not hold back his laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you waiting for when he\u2019s already living in the apartment? Isn\u2019t he sitting right in front of you? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitris Carras just blinked for a moment. He is not understanding what Isaac Stern means when he says that the person is already living here. His eyes grew larger when he looked at Jun Hyuk smiling at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Then is it you? Goodness!\u201d</p><br/><p>No one could speak until the New York Philharmonic\u2019s standing conductor\u2019s surprise disappeared.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Won\u2019t it become quite big news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It could become news, but isn\u2019t it a completely different melody and rhythm? The only common factor is the timing of each movement \u2013 and there\u2019s going to be a bit of a difference according to the conductor \u2013 the vocal appearing in the 4th movement. Isn\u2019t it only this? The song\u2019s subtitle is \u2018Choral\u2019 but other people put Beethoven to it and this concerto was put by the composer himself, so they can\u2019t be seen as the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitris Carras spoke as if it is insignificant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll try to find fault with the vocal\u2019s lyrics \u2018Ode an die Freude\u2019 but it\u2019s just a citation of Friedrich Schiller\u2019s \u2018Ode to Joy\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you looking at it too lightly? That\u2019s enough to find an issue in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he. You\u2019ll win anyway. The judges will realize as well. The more they argue, the more they are proving that this choral concerto is a match for Beethoven\u2019s choral symphony. There\u2019s no reason for it to become a hot topic if it\u2019s just copying because they can just eliminate the submission.\u201d</p><br/><p>He means that the more it becomes news and the more disagreements there are, it is the same as their admitting the level of the piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, next year\u2019s competition committee is lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m sure this level of work is going to raise the competition\u2019s position.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern agreed with him, but Dimitris Carras shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. Isaac, assuming Jun\u2019s song wins what do you think will happen? You can\u2019t imagine it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern and Jun Hyuk just stared at Dimitris Carras. They could not think of anything in particular.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey can take care of everything in the finals with this one song. Piano, violin, and even vocals. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019ll be really interesting?? It\u2019ll be important who they become placed in groups with as well. For the first time, the finalists will have to make draws to configure their groups. Like with the World Cup. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. So it\u2019s possible to take care of the competition part with Jun Hyuk\u2019s song alone. I didn\u2019t think about the vocals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern hit his forehead. The finals will become very interesting. The competition committee will certainly not overlook this aspect.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, don\u2019t worry. If your choral concerto doesn\u2019t win, that itself will become the beginning of a hot topic. It won\u2019t match the public opinion and the competition\u2019s authority will be groundless. I\u2019ll be the first to criticize them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The maestro of the New York Philharmonic was sure that Jun Hyuk would win. Since a great is this certain, President Stern did not think that he would need to pressure the competition committee.</p><br/><p>Dimitris Carras brought up what he was more curious about than the competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. From what I hear, you quit the Inferno performance with the Boston Philharmonic because you said that you didn\u2019t want to use shortcuts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I thought that and so did the orchestra members.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitris looked regretful at Jun Hyuk\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would have been better to hold the concert even if you had to use a shortcut. Conducting the Boston Philharmonic would have been a very valuable experience. When you become a candidate for world renowned philharmonics from now on, it\u2019ll be a really important resume. You shouldn\u2019t have been so stubborn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitris Carras had gone through a lot before becoming the standing conductor of the New York Philharmonic and knows the process better than anyone else does. Not everyone who takes on the role of operating an orchestra is an expert in music. There are a lot of politics.</p><br/><p>Dimitris has absolutely no doubt that Jun Hyuk is the future standing conductor of the New York Philharmonic. The reason why he is mentioning the importance of experience is that he wants Jun Hyuk to be standing on the podium right this moment.</p><br/><p>He did not think that there would be more special cases like the Boston Philharmonic from now on.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, you don\u2019t have any thoughts to conduct Inferno now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. The album came out well. I think that most of what I want is in there. From now on, what I want to see is how other maestros interpret it differently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Dimitris realized that Jun Hyuk has no lingering regrets for Inferno, his lips curled into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then I\u2019d like to put it on stage next year. Do you have any good tips?\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern was startled and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on, Maestro. Are you preparing now? Do you think it\u2019ll be possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I heard it. I liked it. It wasn\u2019t that painful or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Jun Hyuk was surprised by his nonchalant tone. He had seen for himself how much the Boston Philharmonic suffered. The conductor, Patrick Quinn, had said that he barely listened through to the 4th movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that? Is that for real? This is surprising.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is? When I looked at the score honestly, I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be possible. But it was completely different when I listened to the album. I understood Jun Hyuk\u2019s interpretation. The subject of Inferno isn\u2019t pain. It\u2019s completely different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitris turned his attention to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, this might be rude but answer honestly. Isn\u2019t Inferno based on your experiences?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve experienced severe pain in the past, right? Whether you were abused by some severe violence\u2026 and you expressed that with music. Isn\u2019t that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s right. How did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s voice trembled. How could he figure out Jun Hyuk\u2019s experiences by listening to his music? It is something he has not told anyone other than Yoon Kwang Hun.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think someone who hasn\u2019t experienced pain can relay the feeling to this extent to the audience? That kind of expressiveness would go beyond a genius, and it would be inhuman. It would be impossible for even you unless you experienced it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitris looked at a surprised Jun Hyuk and spoke carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the pain in Inferno was definitely physical, not mental. I also grew up under an abusive father. I could tell because I had experienced it to some extent. It\u2019s something I had been forgetting completely, but the memories came up.\u201d</p><br/><p>He is showing the power of time in speaking of painful memories of his youth in such a calm manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cDimitris, why is that important? Just because Jun Hyuk experienced it? No one gets used to violence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern lost interest in what method this impressive maestro knows.</p><br/><p>\u201cI objectified Inferno as I listened to it. Shall I say I was looking at someone who is experiencing pain? That someone could be me when I was a child, or Jun. It was okay once I changed the perspective.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>It is easily said, but the possibility is another issue. Even if Jun Hyuk had not asked it, Isaac Stern would have.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You can\u2019t believe it? I think it\u2019s more unbelievable who created a song like Inferno. I\u2019m sure everyone has their own advantages.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly does it mean that you objectify it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means I don\u2019t empathize with it. Hm\u2026 like watching a horror movie? It\u2019s uncomfortable to see the characters tortured and killed, but I can bear to watch it because I\u2019m not the one going through it. And if you think about the set as you watch a movie? It\u2019s easier if you think about the cameras, staff, NGs, and laughing actors. I thought I\u2019d be able to maintain that feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are the conductor and performance just playing the role of delivering?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. That could be a more accurate explanation. I\u2019m just a messenger to the audience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern was watching the two men speak when he brought up the question that would not go away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the members of the New York Philharmonic? Are you saying that they can objectify it like you can?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not yet. But a few are already capable of playing it perfectly. We\u2019re just trying out different ways right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>There are a lot of people in the world with talent. And each of those talents has the color of the person they belong to. Jun Hyuk could understand why Dimitris is famous for his perfect song interpretation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? I was going to find out if there are any good tips to performing it, but I\u2019ve only told you my know-how. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll seal my lips.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can you promise me one thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce you end the competition with this great choral concerto, I\u2019d like to put in on stage for the very first time with the New York Philharmonic. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>A proposal he had not been expecting. Jun Hyuk bolted up and grabbed the maestro\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor. I feel like I should be the one asking for the favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to the end. There\u2019s one more thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitris smiled playfully and Jun Hyuk\u2019s heart started beating. Is he thinking of leaving the conducting to Jun Hyuk as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go on stage together. I\u2019ll conduct your choral concerto and you\u2019ll conduct Beethoven\u2019s choral symphony. We\u2019ll perform the two songs together.\u201d</p><br/><p>If they play the 2 songs in succession, it will approach 3 hours. If they put in an intermission, it is at least 3 and a half hours. It will become a tremendous event.</p><br/><p>Perform Beethoven? And with the best in the world, the New York Philharmonic? Jun Hyuk thought his heart would burst.</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern was even more excited than Jun Hyuk was.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Leave it to me. I\u2019ll make sure this concert happens. I\u2019ll make New York come alive for you. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern was already drawing a picture of New York City on that day. Placards and posters that will be all over the city. The meeting of a young genius and a great maestro. And Beethoven.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

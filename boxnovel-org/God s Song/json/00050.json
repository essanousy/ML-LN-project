I\u2019m Jo Hyung Joong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong was in his mid 40s and at one point had established his name as a hit song maker with over 200 songs registered in the Copyright Association. He was a composer and famous producer.</p><br/><p>He had a gentle impression and as he made coffee, he took the time to get to know the three rookies better,</p><br/><p>\u201cSeung Hee, you like hip hop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do hip hop in the qualifiers, right? You sang a ballad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. There wasn\u2019t a hip hop song in the mission songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a hip hop mania, there\u2019s a hip hop audition program but why\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 My agency\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you have an agency?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m in JYS Entertainment. I\u2019m just a trainee. It\u2019s my third year.\u201d</p><br/><p>A slender girl whose voice was fit for singing ballads but she liked hip hop. There was no doubt JYS liked her for her slender body and fresh face, not her ballad or hip hop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell that still means you\u2019ve gotten recognition since you\u2019re in one of the big 3 agencies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung looked dejected at the talk of agencies.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard Hye Sung doesn\u2019t have an agency yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes that\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you thought about why an agency hasn\u2019t gotten in contact?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m fat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung rubbed his bulging stomach. He had lost 2 inches over the last 10 days that had been no different from fasting. His expression remained dark though.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, your self-criticism is harsh. The reason is simple. They haven\u2019t been drawn to you yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying I don\u2019t have charm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I saw the tapes for all of the elimination rounds. Anyone would agree that you have great vocals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong gave him a thumbs up,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour range is amazing\u2026 but that\u2019s it. Your high notes and control of your voice can be advantages since there is a lot of music that you can execute. But music isn\u2019t about who can go higher or who can be louder. There\u2019s an emotion in the song. You need to express that. You\u2019re lacking a bit in that area.\u201d</p><br/><p>His faults that a famous producer had specifically picked out. Kwak Hye Sung could not lift his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026 cheer up. You still have a lot of time left. And you have two really strong weapons. Let\u2019s use those weapons to make a stage full of emotion. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong smiled warmly at Kwak Hye Sung whose face had brightened and looked at Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re Jun Hyuk. Hey, you\u2019re as good looking as they said. With that face, you would do better as a model or actor than as a singer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong thought that if the votes were done fairly, Jun Hyuk would get tons of votes just by standing on the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I heard that you don\u2019t sing. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of good singers. I just need people who will sing the songs I make well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. That\u2019s the mind of a typical composer. Okay then, who do you wish would sing your song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Adele, Marvin Gaye, Floor Jansen of Nightwish, John Mayer, Eva Cassidy, Thomas Cloverope, and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s too ambitious. Ha ha. There aren\u2019t any Korean singers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there are. Lee So Ra, Kim Chang Hwan, Lee Sun Hee, Jeon In Kwon when he debuted, Kim Gun Mo 10 years ago\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Kim Gun Mo 10 years ago? So not the Kim Gun Mo now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I think he\u2019s aged a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think so? He\u2019s still great though. If he meets a song that fits him, he\u2019d be able to get the value out of it. Well\u2026 I think it\u2019d be a good idea for you to make a song. You have no thoughts of singing on the live stage as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to try to stick it out with an instrumental.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s cool. I\u2019ll help you as much as I can, so try sticking it out. I have expectations to see how much you can advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>These were not words he was throwing out as a broadcast moment for the cameras next to him. He had heard that Jun Hyuk was only now 17 years old. It was a rarity to find a young child with such a firm sense of music. Aspiring celebrities were all hanging onto the idea of success. Jun Hyuk gave him pride.</p><br/><p>This was enough for first meetings and they started preparing for the mission in earnest.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeung Hee, I chose a song fit for you but it\u2019s a drama OST. It\u2019s a slow song but I changed it so it\u2019d be a little fast and light. Listen to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jo Hyung Joong finished speaking, the person in charge of the recording studio sound system turned on the music. The theme song from a popular drama that had aired not too long ago came from the studio speakers in a different version.</p><br/><p>It was not a dance song, but it was youthful and light enough to incite automatic humming. The arrangement could have been perfect for a pretty and cute girl group to sing.</p><br/><p>It seemed that with the strength of the original song\u2019s popularity and the audience\u2019s desire for lively music, everything matched up well and would bring good results.</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong saw that Nam Seung Hee looked pleased with the arrangement and turned on Kwak Hye Sung\u2019s mission song in succession.</p><br/><p>The original version of Kim Kyung Ho\u2019s \u2018The People Who Make Me Sad\u2019 played from the speakers. Unlike Nam Seung Hee\u2019s song, it had not been edited in any way. Kwak Hye Sung just blinked as he could not figure out Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHye Sung can easily sing this song, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing your expression, looks like you\u2019re wondering why this song wasn\u2019t arranged.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yes\u2026 because the original song came out all of a sudden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe tone of your voice is the arrangement itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? My tone?\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not understand yet. Jo Hyung Joong just laughed as if this appearance was amusing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe arrangement is unnecessary because they both have extreme vocal tones. On top of that, it\u2019s possible to dominate the stage with his overwhelming vocals which is his advantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>In contrast to Kim Kyung Ho\u2019s sharp vocals was Kwak Hye Sung\u2019s thick and heavy voice. Jun Hyuk who had been still expressed Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Jun Hyuk and I are cut of the same cloth. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had not been long since they met, but he could see the flash of talent. No explanation was necessary. He could figure out a producer\u2019s motives just by listening to the music. Producers could work comfortably if singers had as much sense as Jun Hyuk did.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be easy for Hye Sung to practice. There, will the two of you go and start practicing? I think my talk with Jun Hyuk is going to take some time.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

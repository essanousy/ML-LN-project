Now, no one glares at the work that Jun Hyuk releases. Instead, they are full of anticipation for what Jun Hyuk will start from now on and what other surprising image he will show them.</p><br/><p>It felt like a festival was being held twice every week in Milan. Once it became known that Jun Hyuk and Argento would only perform in these 10 shows, all famous people trying to see it used all possible methods and contacts to acquire tickets.</p><br/><p>One Italian soccer player even posted on Twitter that he is willing to pay $100,000 for a ticket.</p><br/><p>In the midst of all this, Yoon Kwang Hun was the only person with the honor of watching all 10 performances. However, someone appeared who he had no choice but to give up his last 2 tickets to.</p><br/><p>Amelia had announced that she would be resting for 1 year as soon as her sponsor contracts expired. She quickly came over to Milan and took away Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s tickets.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy. You already saw it 8 times. You can give 2 to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Milan performances were over, President Stern took the cast and producers to Rome. The 2nd round of performances began after 2 weeks and they needed to go around the Europe area for 6 months.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk wanted to hurry up and have a sweet and relaxing time with Amelia, but he could not leave Milan. He still has work to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I need to do before I leave Milan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn advertisement shoot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdvertisement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you before? Was it around the time of the concert Seoul? I said there was a big deal as an exclusive model.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I remember. It was some car advertisement, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Aston Martin, a British sports car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun and Amelia\u2019s eyes grew wide at the name Aston Martin. It seems the conditions were pretty good from Tara\u2019s bright expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a British brand, but a private equity in Italy took over it. They considered for a bit over the modeling fee, but the opera was the decisive factor. Fund investors saw the opera and signed the contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they were first negotiating the contract, even Tara thought that President Stern was demanding too much. But thinking of the money that Jun Hyuk makes now, it made her think that it was too little.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s a 2 year exclusive contract. 4 photoshoots. 2 advertisement filmings. Of course the modeling fee will come in 4 installments.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much is the modeling fee?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun asked cautiously and Tara laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s similar to Tom Cruise\u2019s fee to film a movie. What do you think? Isn\u2019t it incredible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Tom Cruise\u2019s guarantee?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Amelia who had been listening casually, could not hide her surprise and bolted up from her seat. She heard that Tom Cruise makes about $40 million per film. But with an advertisement? She thought of the money she makes in a year spent in planes and cars to handle a tight tour schedule. It was difficult to even calculate how many times the difference was.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s really a big shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara thought of the words \u2018big shot\u2019 and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s not a big shot considering Jun\u2019s royalties right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy me? For that money, Tom Cruise would come running too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir target is the young and rich in Asia. I\u2019m sure they want to bring in the rich who are fawning over Porsches and Lamborghinis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means we truly can\u2019t get over this ethnic wall. Does that mean that I, as an Asian, am not appealing globally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Don\u2019t take it the wrong way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara quickly waved her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cAston Martin is Bond\u2019s car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBond\u2019s car? Oh, 007?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The 007 Bond edition is plenty of advertisement in the global market. This is a special case. With such a tremendous fee, they can choose any Hollywood star or sports star, but they chose you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara recalled the negotiation table where they created the tremendous guarantee.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, they signed willingly because of what Isaac said at the end of negotiations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c4 photoshoots and 2 advertisement filmings is over at least a week in total turnaround time\u2026 but 1 week is enough time for Jun to create 7 albums. There\u2019s no reason for him to shoot the advertisement when thinking of his album sales and royalties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed, but Tara continued to look serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. There\u2019s no reason to shoot the advertisement. We considered it a lot before we decided on it too because of his image.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Jun\u2019s image has been made too much into that of a hermit. So we\u2019re trying to make him more of an active young genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun had been listening quietly when he could not hold back his curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s the model?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes. It\u2019s the Aston Martin Vanquish Volante. Of course he\u2019ll receive a model vehicle as a bonus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a convertible since it\u2019s the Volante.\u201d</p><br/><p>The convertible sports car that James Bond drives. Yoon Kwang Hun blinked.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled at this. This is the person who taught him what a Ducati bike is. Since he is someone who thinks more of design than performance, he will already know the car lineup.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir. Throw that junk car away now and ride a Bond car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with an account with tens of millions of dollars, he is someone who does not even take a single dollar out to use. But he is sure to accept a car that he wants \u2013 especially one that is free. And Jun Hyuk was not wrong.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun was already smiling from ear to ear.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun laughed at Jun Hyuk\u2019s Korean. Tara and Amelia watched their faces in curiosity, so Jun Hyuk told them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. It\u2019ll be work, but make it so we can receive that bonus car in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 people finally realized why Yoon Kwang Hun was smiling, and burst out in laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s not hard. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara checked their schedule and looked happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to Napoli tomorrow to film, and the studio shoot will be in New York. You can go directly to New York from Napoli\u2026 Do you want to take about a week\u2019s break? It\u2019s not that busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia was happiest with what Tara said. There isn\u2019t anywhere in Europe that she has not been because of her concerts, but it had all been work. There would be nothing better than to be able to spend a relaxing time with Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds good. Oh right. Is Sicily far from Napoli?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that far. Sicily is in southernmost Italy\u2026 so about an hour and a half by plane?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go to Sicily. It\u2019s the mafia\u2019s hometown. I made a mafia opera, so shouldn\u2019t I try visiting it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s something more famous in Sicily than the mafia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun had been laughing when he spoke up quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Sicily\u2026 it\u2019s the food.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is not an exaggeration to say that Sicilian cuisine is representative of Italian food. In the west, Sicily is even called \u201cGod\u2019s kitchen\u201d.</p><br/><p>Sicily is influenced by Greek, African, and Arabic ingredients due to its geographical factors and complex history, and has come to establish its own style. This was introduced to Italy and becomes the root of Italian cuisine.</p><br/><p>It is particularly famous as the origin of pasta, from the saffron of the Arab world to the tomato from the New World, many foods symbolic of Italy were first implemented in Sicily.</p><br/><p>Tara listened to Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s explanation and looked at him in fascination.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yoon. I\u2019ve felt this from before, but you\u2019re like an encyclopedia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laughed at Tara\u2019s admiration of Yoon Kwang Hun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat he does all day at the cafe is listen to music and watch documentaries. National Geographic and Discovery are the channels that taught him that vast knowledge. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s look of satisfaction quickly flushed.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Napoli, a long coastal road following the Mediterranean with stunning scenery and a lot of cultural heritage, is called one of the world\u2019s 3 greatest harbors along with Australia\u2019s Sydney, Brazil\u2019s Rio de Janeiro.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk filmed on that coastal road and harbor, going back and forth from the island of Capri from sunrise to sunset, unable to even count how many cuts they had done.</p><br/><p>The 4 people spent their time leisurely once their work was done, looking around Napoli and Sicily. They enjoyed a relaxing time eating, drinking, and talking like in the movie \u2018Eat Pray Love\u2019.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun went back to Korea with the excitement of receiving an Aston Martin. Jun Hyuk and Amelia, who went back to New York, forgot about music and enjoyed their long-needed break.</p><br/><p>Amelia in particular spent more than half her days in bed as though determined to reward herself for the busy way she had spent the last few years.</p><br/><p>When the two people were about to spend the year at home, President Stern and a few employees came to Jun Hyuk\u2019s apartment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We need to hurry up and do some research. The name is Jun Hyuk Jang. He\u2019s Korean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKorean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. This person did the producing for Coline\u2019s music. He\u2019s not a normal kid. Since he already released an album in Korea, there\u2019ll be plenty of information on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he isn\u2019t normal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you to look into it. This kid could be the big shot instead of Coline.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Alex Zakin got off the phone with Ili who suddenly got excited, he passed the memo to his secretary.</p><br/><p>After about an hour, a producer instead of the secretary came running with a CD.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlex, who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew \u2013 that\u2019s what I told you to do. Why are you asking me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was about to sigh in annoyance, but his secretary also came running in.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk Jang. He\u2019s an 18 year old Korean. He went out on an audition program in Korea a year ago, and is an orphan. He wandered the streets for about 10 years and then met a kind Mr. Tom\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin watched his secretary blabbing and exploded in annoyance,</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. Stop going on about some fairy tale story and get to the point! I don\u2019t care how some Korean kid lived. Why is everyone being like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay. He\u2019s known as a genius musician in Korea. They say he\u2019s a one-man band. He plays the guitar, drums, and piano like a professional. His composing and arranging is perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>A young 18 year old genius. A perfect musician who can do everything himself. The people of this industry are good at blowing things out of proportion. Alex Zakin did not believe 1/10 of what his secretary was saying.</p><br/><p>The last is always music. The producer whose life is music, cut the secretary off and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlex, this kid even has an album\u2026 Just listen to 3 songs first. I\u2019ve chosen the essence of his music.\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer put the tablet PC he was holding on Alex Zakin\u2019s desk.</p><br/><p>When a piano song called \u2018Close\u2019 came out, Alex Zakin\u2019s eyes widened. He could not judge the piano skills through the cheap tablet PC speakers, but the melody captured his attention. If he had not known, he would have thought that he was listening to a song by Ennio Morricone, a master of film music. He could tell enough about Jun Hyuk\u2019s composition skills with this one song.</p><br/><p>The second song, the rock version of \u2018Kanon\u2019, showed his drum and guitar skills. He could go on stage immediately. Alex Zakin realized that none of his secretary\u2019s explaination had been exaggerated.</p><br/><p>The last heavy metal song showed his power in just the first half.</p><br/><p>\u201cIli was right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid is really a big shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin asked again to check,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid that kid really compose all of these songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure this kid is in New York right now? What does he do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a student at Clayton-Hoffman School of Music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2019s another one of those kids digging at Mozart\u2019s grave? What a bother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The producer admiring Jun Hyuk\u2019s music spoke carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we need the last verification?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin looked at the producer with disappointment because he had not understood what he meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cIli\u2019s still in New York?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell Ili to bring the band and the Korean kid here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying you want to release Coline\u2019s record?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to decide whether we\u2019ll release a record or just record it when they get here. At the least, we\u2019ll be able to check one thing. What weapon this Korean boy has.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin\u2019s heart beat for the first time in a long time. They had become a goose laying golden eggs because of these kinds of geniuses who appear occasionally. It is a happy event just to see how large of a golden egg this Korean prodigy would lay.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cAlex, it\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m telling you this kid won\u2019t leave the library. He has no interest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIli. It\u2019s not normal for a talented kid to be obedient. Have you seen kids like that who listen? Anyway, don\u2019t come back if you can\u2019t bring all of them. You know it\u2019s expensive to live in New York, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili ended the call with Alex Zakin\u2019s reckless warning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat more is he trying to see? Damn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili\u2019s conclusion had not been very different from Alex Zakin\u2019s. There is plenty of potential and he is a great bassist. And the kid from Korea has a talent for producing.</p><br/><p>With these 3 points, all that needed to be done was to have Violon play at New York clubs. A record release is something for the future, and the Korean kid who did the producing has no thoughts of coming outside of CH School of Music. He is already someone of a different world, having fallen into classical.</p><br/><p>Ili also knew that he could not change Alex Zakin\u2019s stubborn mind. He called Coline,</p><br/><p>\u201cColine, make sure you bring that bookworm out of the library. Alex Zakin is telling me to bring you guys to him with that kid. I\u2019m sure you know what this means?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili\u2019s call made Coline go running to Jun Hyuk again.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, what do I have to do? I\u2019m begging you. I\u2019ll become the world\u2019s biggest idiot if I let go of an opportunity like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk let out a long sigh at Coline\u2019s desperate eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew \u2013 You\u2019re saying I have to go all the way to LA?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Why do you think he\u2019s telling us to go to LA with you? It means he wants to record an official record.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Coline saw hope for Jun Hyuk\u2019s permission, his heart started beating faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 How many songs did you say there are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c5 songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline\u2019s fingers trembled as he gulped.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Jun! Thanks a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just have one condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. From now on, you and your band have to do whatever I say. Don\u2019t argue with me. You have to play and sing the way I tell you to. I have no intention on directing your band while having to explain why. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay! Of course. Those kids are already your fans. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had not felt this good even when he had completed a perfect performance. Coline felt that he could vaguely see the door to success before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly, tell that guy from LA to bring a contract. With the arranging, session, and producing fees in detail. I\u2019m really expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline blinked at Jun Hyuk\u2019s unexpected words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen? You expected me to do this for free? Didn\u2019t you say it yourself? That you\u2019re heading towards becoming a professional? When is anything free in the world of professionals? And this might be your album, but I\u2019m working with LA Sound. Not with Coline and his band.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been forgetting something. Jun Hyuk is a professional musician who released an album in his country. He is not an amateur like Coline, waiting for an opportunity while practicing in a studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right. Sorry. I didn\u2019t think of that because I was so happy. You\u2019re right. I\u2019ll meet Ili again first. Jun, thanks again.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Coline ran out, Jun Hyuk looked annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did I act like a professional for no reason? How much do I have to ask for?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk locked his door and made a phone call.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

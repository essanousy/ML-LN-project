Enjoy guys!]</p><br/><p>Coline who said he would become a rockstar, stayed at the dorms like Jun Hyuk. He was preparing for his band\u2019s first single.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, you\u2019re not going to Korea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. My grades aren\u2019t good. I need to study.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grades aren\u2019t good? What? Ah\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline saw the book Jun Hyuk was reading and realized it was his special class.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard for anyone to get good grades in. What is that? Is there anyone in this school who reads that book?\u201d</p><br/><p>He flipped the book Jun Hyuk was reading to read its cover and stuck out his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s pretty fun. It\u2019s just a little frustrating because there are a lot of words I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that book is hard for me to understand too. Why on earth are you reading Nietzsche?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline thought Jun Hyuk\u2019s special classes were too harsh, but also fascinating that Jun Hyuk did not lose interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently Nietzsche wrote this when he worshipped Wagner. It\u2019s interesting. But\u2026 Hey! If you\u2019re going to talk nonsense, go. I need to study German too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk swatted at Coline\u2019s hand as he went through the books.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s good that you didn\u2019t go to Korea. We\u2019re not going away either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe? Ah, the band?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019re going to record during the break. Won\u2019t you participate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I won\u2019t. You do the band alone and succeed. I have a lot of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou convert my rock spirit to money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline who had been speaking in an exaggerated tone spoke cautiously,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy German is perfect\u2026 You want me to teach you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Really? You\u2019re American. Where did you say you\u2019re from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChicago. But I\u2019m Slovakian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo they speak German in Slovakia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Slovakia has its own language. My mother is German.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a quite appetizing offer. He knows from experience that language is learned faster by practicing speaking than by reading.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Then it\u2019s just one day. I\u2019ll take a look at your band\u2019s music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but you can\u2019t bother me any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh\u2026 my maestro! How can I thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it in German.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline put his band\u2019s music on a CD and gave it to Jun Hyuk. It was just music they had not played properly in the practice room, but Jun Hyuk kept admiring Coline\u2019s bass.</p><br/><p>He had not been fooling around when he said that he wants to become a rockstar. He was good enough to contemplate between becoming a cellist and bassists. Coline is an extremely talented player performing with nearly perfect rhythm, funk, and melody.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are these members? A band that performs at clubs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Students at New York College. The guitar is a journalism major and the drummer is management.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpressive\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? They\u2019re good, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline gained confidence at Jun Hyuk\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cColine, are you really going to do the band? What do you think about going all in on the cello instead? It\u2019s a pity because you\u2019re already comparable to Jacqueline Mary du Pre.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jacqueline du Pre is a genius cellist from England who debuted at age 15 and became internationally renowned in her early 20s, formally retiring at age 28 due to a chronic disease. She is also the wife of Daniel Barenboim, the conductor of the London Philharmonic, Paris Orchestra, and Chicago Orchestra.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk said that Coline is a top genius cellist, but Coline did not waver a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks but I\u2019ve already given up on classical.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk let out a long sigh at Coline\u2019s calm answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew \u2013 Then reserve a recording studio. Let\u2019s make this song well. I\u2019ll produce it, so tell your members that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Produce it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t believe in me? If not, forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just surprised because I was only expecting a little advice and you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll even produce it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t want your bass to go to waste. This kind of bass can\u2019t be buried. Also, the song isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll tell you as soon as we reserve a studio.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Coline stood with a light heart, Jun Hyuk asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s the band\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cViolon.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Jun Hyuk watched Coline say the name and run out, he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018That kid still wants to play the cello.\u2019</p><br/><p>Violon.</p><br/><p>The official name of the cello is the violoncello, and this means that it is a double bass. Viol means a big violin or or big viola as seen in the violin or viola, and eventually means double bass. Since the diminutive cello is attached here, it becomes \u2018small double bass\u2019.</p><br/><p>Coline still loves the cello.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too grand. And too complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is what Jun Hyuk said during the first take while recording the guitar. The guitarist of the band Violon was confused as to whether or not it is a compliment, but realized that it is not a compliment from Jun Hyuk\u2019s frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to play harmoniously because you\u2019re not supposed to be showing off your technique. The song has a simple riff\u2026 but the guitar is to Yngwie Malmsteen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yngwie Malmsteen is a classic kid who loved Bach but after watching Jimi Hendrix perform on TV, became a prospective guitarist in Sweden.</p><br/><p>Like a classic kid, he added a baroque melody to heavy metal and is the person who changed the average speed of guitar playing with sweep fingering and technique.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was not praising him on his technique, but telling him not to play something that is unnecessary.</p><br/><p>Violon\u2019s guitarist was about to refute but closed his mouth. He remembered what Coline had warned him about.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen up. This kid calculates each note while making a song. He\u2019s recognized as a genius by a great musician. Make sure you do as he says without complaining because he\u2019s someone who will make our song great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk whispered to Coline after listening to the 2nd take for the guitar,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll spend the night like this. Can\u2019t we take the easy route?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEasy? How?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I rearrange it? I tried to go with the original song the way it is\u2026 but honestly, it\u2019s hard to bear with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll only touch the guitar and drums. The bass can go the way it is in the original since there\u2019s nothing to change there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline spoke with the band members for a moment and went back to Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Those guys also decided to trust you and go with it. But you can\u2019t change the song completely. That\u2019s our pride.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, the song is good. I\u2019m really just going to arrange it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took the guitar and spoke to the guitarist,</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here, guitar guy. With your skill, you\u2019ll get it just by listening once. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk went into the recording studio and played the guitar and drum more concisely than in the original.</p><br/><p>The guitarist and drummer looked full of complaints because all of the parts that would have shown their grand performance skills had disappeared. However, they left their performance to Jun Hyuk when they saw the recording engineer move to the music.</p><br/><p>They still seemed to have complaints after finishing the recording and listening to the full song. It does not have the rough taste that is characteristic of rookie rock bands and its grandiosity. All that was left was a simple refinement. This felt like music from the 3rd or 4th album of an experienced group rather than that of a rookie band.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s it for me. I brought out the best I could so if you don\u2019t like it, just record it again according to the original.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline and the Violon members listened to the recording repeatedly for two days and came to one conclusion. The song is a little outside the band\u2019s color, but it is not one that they get sick of easily after listening to it continuously.</p><br/><p>Coline put the song on the online store and boldly chose the price. It was valued at $1.99.</p><br/><p>From that day on, all Coline did was from the moment he woke up was to check the views.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

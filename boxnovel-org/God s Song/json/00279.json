Other than the path to walk to the basement studio, there were pieces of paper stuck to the floor and all of the walls.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk must be in the basement because she could not see him anywhere.</p><br/><p>When she looked up at the ceiling, it was the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was so surprised that she did not even notice Jun Hyuk had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. What\u2026 what\u2026 on earth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Amelia couldn\u2019t even speak properly, Jun Hyuk slightly frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m working on. It\u2019s nothing. You don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia was about to say something, but stopped. It is a scene that is hard for her to understand, but Jun Hyuk said that it is his work on music. She knows that there is no point in saying anything to him about music.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I came because of something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of Jina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJina? Why? Did something happen at school?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she said Jina, Jun Hyuk jumped in surprise. This was so unbelievable she almost laughed. She realized again that to her husband, she is not there and he only cares about Jina and music.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not school but you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not understand and his eyes grew wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. What on earth are you doing to the kid? Jina\u2019s just 15 years old now. Her body is weak too. How can you make a girl like that sing for 5 or 6 hours everyday when that\u2019s even difficult for adults to handle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh that. It\u2019s okay. Jina\u2019s plenty capable of handling it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Even if she was born with a great voice, this could ruin her body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia\u2019s voice became sharp and Jun Hyuk frowned more.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia. There\u2019s a world that you don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t make hasty conclusions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about geniuses right now. I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s difficult physically.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put up his hand and stopped Amelia from speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Mozart created his opera, a 1 person opera was being created in Korea. Thoughts on the song might be different but looking at just the singer, Western vocalists are young kids. The singer of the 1 person opera in Korea performs 3 or 4 hours alone. There are songs that are nearly 8 hours too. The only prop is a fan and the only accompanying instrument is a drum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia was hearing such an unbelievable thing for the first time. A 1 person opera performing an 8 hour opera?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. And I know Jina\u2019s condition best. She\u2019s able to do an 8 hour performance even now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The long song that Jina talked about, 1 person opera, and 8 hours. Amelia became scared when she combined these words.</p><br/><p>Is the song Jun Hyuk is writing now, one that is over 8 hours long? And does he think of Jina as just an instrument to bring out the music that he wants?</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t it be that he is thinking that it\u2019d be okay to ruin Jina if it means that he could listen to that music even just once?</p><br/><p>Amelia ran out of the studio and looked for Yoon Kwang Hun. If what she is imagining is true, she needs to stop it now. And the only person who can stop Jun Hyuk is Yoon Kwang Hun.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When Yoon Kwang Hun went into Jun Hyuk\u2019s studio with Amelia, he was speechless.</p><br/><p>Pieces of paper stuck everywhere, even to the ceiling. Those papers created a giant maze and notes filled up the maze\u2019s pathway.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, what is it? It\u2019s so early in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had been laying on the ground and staring at the ceiling when he bolted up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to have a coffee with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little busy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even have time for a coffee?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk flinched under Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s prickly glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at Yoon Kwang Hun and Amelia, and made coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that? Are you creating a maze?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I made it like that because I can\u2019t organize it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith notes inside a maze?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun shook his head. It is a world he cannot understand anyway. There is no point in discussing a maze right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can think of that maze and those notes as the inside of my head. And I need to solve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it your style to write things out on a piece of paper. Being able to write out the music in your head within moments?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. But that\u2019s not working for this song. I\u2019ve drawn out exactly what\u2019s in my mind through that maze. I need to find a path within that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun took a glance at Amelia and spoke again,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you teaching Jina pansori?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Pansori?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Your wife said that it looks like you\u2019re making a 1 person opera that goes for over 8 hours. I realized right away. That\u2019s Chunhyangga.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk blinked for a while and suddenly burst out in laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia. What misunderstanding was there? I don\u2019t know what kind of music is coming out. Look at this maze. The form will come out once I solve this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk gestured to the pieces of paper stuck everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you working Jina so hard? Does 5 to 6 hours make sense for a young girl like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Jina\u2019s an instrument that exceeds our imaginations. I actually shortened the time because I was worried. If you leave her alone, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019ll sing for 24 hours straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun was silent. It seems Amelia had misunderstood. This is Jun Hyuk as he is. He is just bringing out the music that is inside his head. It is just that this time, it is taking more time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia. Father. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but Jina\u2019s my daughter. I don\u2019t do anything that would harm her in any way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia seemed reassured as well. Jun Hyuk took a deep breath in and out. And then he spoke slowly and calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that I\u2019m sensitive because this is hard work for me. And I can\u2019t think of anything beyond this maze. This is music I\u2019ve kept with me my whole life. I can\u2019t say how happy I am that I\u2019m able to make a try at it because of Jina.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Music you\u2019ve kept with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia\u2019s eyes grew wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt occasionally tangles up like thread\u2026 It was music that showed that a little. I was just giving up on it because there isn\u2019t a tool or way to express it anyway\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk grew more excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe music I\u2019ve made until now is just one piece of this thread. I\u2019ve expressed the tangled thread through that maze. I\u2019m anticipating what kind of form it\u2019ll take.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun spoke cautiously,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re okay, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m done with more than half now. You know, right? No matter how tangled a thread is, it becomes easier to untangle as you go forward. I\u2019m going to complete it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk squeezed Amelia\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia. I\u2019m going to retire completely once this song is complete. And I\u2019ll stick to you 24 hours a day. There\u2019s no need to make more music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia and Yoon Kwang Hun jumped in surprise. What retirement all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, you\u2019re saying you won\u2019t create music? What on earth are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause no matter how long I continue making music, there\u2019s never going to be one better than this. All of me is in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled brightly at Yoon Kwang Hun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen this is all over, I\u2019m going to tag along behind Jina and Amelia like you did and be jobless. I\u2019m living out your life. The only difference is that I have a lot of money? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun took Amelia out of the studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think everything Jun is saying is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun pat Amelia\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll find the music he\u2019s been seeking all his life. That\u2019s an inevident reaction. There was a song you practiced like crazy too, right? Music that you practiced so much even eating seemed like a waste of time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that. The only difference is time. Jun is just taking a few years. No, for us it\u2019s years but for Jun, it\u2019ll be a short moment.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

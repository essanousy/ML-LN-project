LOL but I get to cross it off my bucket list so\u2026.anyway, enjoy!]</p><br/><p>While his mind was busy with thoughts, the door opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on that your secretary is making a fuss? What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Charlie Dwayne is the Senior Director of LA Sound, dealing with the real business aspect of the company. He had come running because the secretary made such a fuss.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a super rookie. He\u2019s an alien.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Charlie Dwayne could tell from Alex Zakin\u2019s expression that he had discovered a big fish.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly write up a contract and bring it to me. We need to get him before he leaves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe conditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1st grade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that good?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was certain he had heard Alex say that it is a rookie, but he is asking for a 1st grade contract. In the 15 years he had worked at LA Sound, there was only one time where he made a 1st grade contract for a rookie.</p><br/><p>Though he only released one album before dying in a car crash, it accumulated over 20 million sales until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI met him for the first time yesterday. Today\u2019s the second time, and we already got two albums out of him. Even 1st grade is too low. If there are better conditions, you have to put them in the contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you being serious? Or are you joking? What do you mean he made an album a day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. If I could, I would lock him in the recording studio. Stop wasting time and write up the contract. I don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Charlie Dwayne did not need to think about the type of music it was. Alex had said two albums, not two songs. If he said two albums, it indicated music that could top the charts.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get it ready right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Charlie Dwayne left, Alex Zakin paced his office imagining different situations. Should they create a band with Jun Hyuk in the lead? Or should they make an album with multiple bands that Jun Hyuk guest performs with? Should they try making a bunch of albums as a one-man band?</p><br/><p>However, his happy thoughts quickly ended. He remembered that Jun Hyuk is a student at CH School of Music. The path of a maestro and the path of a star. He did not yet know which path Jun Hyuk wants to take. Whatever path, he was sure that there would be the day when Jun Hyuk earns the title of a Grammy Award winner.</p><br/><p>Currently, the person with the most Grammys is not Michael Jackson or Madonna. It is 31 awards for Sir Georg Solti who is called the maestro of the century. Following behind him is renowned producer Quincy Jones with 27 awards.</p><br/><p>When his secretary delivered an envelope with the contract, Jun Hyuk entered Alex\u2019s office with the sound engineer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Stanley?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with his manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. You did well today.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the sound engineer left, Alex spoke while watching Jun Hyuk\u2019s bright expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, what did you think about performing with Stanley? Killer, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he. Yes. It was the best. I don\u2019t know how he brings out that kind of rhythm\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk gave a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe even exchanged phone numbers. He said that he would make sure to call me if he comes to New York.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, since his life consists of touring all year. You guys will get to meet again soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, Alex Zakin imagined Jun Hyuk standing on stage with Stanley Clarke. The citizens of New York would be surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, I enjoyed that incredible moment today\u2026 Will you do me a favor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hesitated because he was not sure what Alex would say, but Alex did not care. It is not an excessive favor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and select an representative. I\u2019d like to make an album with today\u2019s performance as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t want to and can\u2019t talk money with you. I\u2019m too impatient of a person to keep today\u2019s performance under wraps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 when you meet a good business partner, show this to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex handed over a manila envelope embellished with a large LA Sound logo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Didn\u2019t you say you would make the contract later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019re going to take care of the CD you gave me yesterday and today\u2019s performance separately. This contract is just a general contract. It\u2019s about how many albums you\u2019ll release with LA Sound going forward. It\u2019s mostly blank. You can fill it in with whatever you want. Your representative will know the details.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk just touched the envelope because he did not know what it meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust keep one thing in mind for me. The conditions of this contract are only offered to superstars who have an accumulated record sales exceeding 30 million copies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c30 million copies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m positive that you\u2019re going to exceed that.\u201d</p><br/><p>A contract with great conditions and recognition of his talent. Jun Hyuk packed the envelope.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Whoever my partner is, I\u2019ll be sure to tell them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then you\u2019re done with work here? What are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Alex Zakin saw Jun Hyuk pack the contract, he relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I have to go to Japan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJapan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I have some personal plans. But\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead. Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hesitated because he could be getting involved unnecessarily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to Coline?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Coline is now under Ili\u2019s jurisdiction. Why? Are you worried about him because he\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA little. I agreed to do the producing\u2026 but I feel a bit bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Coline has plenty of potential. What\u2019s left is how strong their will is. If they give up because it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s over. If they grit their teeth and make the effort, they\u2019ll succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk got up from his seat and bowed with all sincerity to Alex Zakin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Alex. I had an unforgettable experience thanks you to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop that. That\u2019s what I should be saying to you. The performance you two put on was the best gift for me as a fan of jazz, not as a producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin hugged Jun Hyuk who had his head bowed.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk got back to the hotel, he made a call to Korea. He told them that his work in LA ended earlier, so he would get on a plane to Japan the next day, and packed his bags.</p><br/><p>Coline and the band did not come back until midnight. Ili had worked them so rigorously that they collapsed on their beds and could not get up.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk called Coline and went down to the lounge in the hotel lobby.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline started to get nervous when he saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s serious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 I wanted to tell you what Alex Zakin said today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk repeated Alex Zakin\u2019s evaluation of Coline verbatim, without any exaggeration.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means that we\u2019re at a point where I have to make a choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not feel the need to say anything. Coline\u2019s expression was already speaking for him.</p><br/><p>The top producer leading the top record label in America said that he could succeed if he put in the effort. Coline did not start with such a light heart that he would hesitate here.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Jun. I was able to get here because of you. I won\u2019t ever forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline held Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand tightly for a long time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Thank you guys for the support as always.]</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk remembered something he had been forgetting,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. Didn\u2019t you say that your band has 3 people? You still don\u2019t have enough people when it\u2019s been almost a year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. Guitar, drum, bass. I\u2019m the bass. I do guitar and vocals as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s all full. Why are you asking me when you have everything \u2013 guitar, bass, drums, vocals?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a keyboardist. I\u2019m a major in classical too. I need the grandiosity that comes from a keyboardist instead of a simple configuration.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! You should have said that earlier. Then I don\u2019t have any interest. I play the piano so much in the quintet but to play the keyboard in the band? Forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk found the perfect excuse to refuse the offer. He was not just turning Coline down, but also his own self who wanted to be in the band.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t just say you don\u2019t want to do it and talk after you listen to our music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat famous band\u2019s songs do you guys normally practice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? You think we\u2019re doing the band for fun right now? Our goal is to release a record. We\u2019re professionals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline was miffed at Jun Hyuk who thought that he would just be copying others\u2019 songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. But is it easy to release a record?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than the marketing, what\u2019s so hard? Do you know how many recording studios there are in New York? If we don\u2019t record by instrument and track and record all together, we could finish it in a day. $500 is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nirvana\u2019s \u2018Nevermind\u2019 was produced in Detroit\u2019s Sound City studio for $600. With that, they sold 16 million copies.</p><br/><p>Because of this legend, there are still amateur musicians who try to record their music in small studios. And they are in a better environment than Nirvana was. They have Apple.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sell the track on the Apple store first and if it becomes a hit, producers are going to come to us. Then it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smiling Coline looked like he was dreaming that he had already become a star.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, you really won\u2019t do it with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not interested. It\u2019s hard even keeping up with my assignments.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had thought that all he would have to do at a university of music was write songs and perform. However, more than half of the assignments asked him to write his thoughts on various topics that were thrown at him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Jun, let me hear you play the guitar once. And the drums.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it next time. I\u2019m really tired right now. You\u2019re banned from my room if you keep bothering me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline who had already heard Jun Hyuk\u2019s album did not give up. It was okay even if he did not come in as a keyboardist. What the band needed most were the skills Jun Hyuk showed in the quintet with his talent in arranging and directing while correcting each member\u2019s music.</p><br/><p>With this, there was one more person following Jun Hyuk around.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Something caught Jun Hyuk\u2019s attention at once, more than the two people following him around. The harmonica.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was running to make it on time to his special class when the sound of a harmonica stopped him in his tracks. To think that he was hearing Bachs\u2019 Cantata played on a harmonica. He had only heard the harmonica played in folk or country music.</p><br/><p>When he looked toward the sound of the harmonica, he saw the back of someone sitting comfortably with her legs propped up on a chair in front of the cafeteria. Jun Hyuk waited where he stood until she was done playing.</p><br/><p>In the middle of his performance, Jun Hyuk\u2019s heart started beating when the part with the mashup of two cantatas came up.</p><br/><p>The performance became more and more bold. It gradually increased from two cantatas to three, four, and five. The end had such a complicated configuration that it seemed the five cantatas were used randomly, and he thought it was as though classical music had been reconstructed as avant-garde music.</p><br/><p>To bring out this kind of configuration with a harmonica. Jun Hyuk could not hold back his curiosity of who was playing the harmonica in such a way that he had not imagined before.</p><br/><p>The person who had played the harmonica lit the cigarette laying on the table.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk approached her carefully and slightly tapped her on the shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, but can I ask you a question?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could be sure that the performer who turned around was a bold beauty from South America. Her dark skin and swinging black hair showed that she is from a hot country.</p><br/><p>The girl looked at Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe song you just played\u2026 How did you come to think of something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>The South American girl looked at him. She had not understood Jun Hyuk\u2019s question. Jun Hyuk repeated his question again slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious as to how you thought of configuring that kind of music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just did. It just came to my mind while I was playing the harmonica.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had not interpreted \u2018just\u2019 incorrectly, it meant she had thought of it on the spot. Jun Hyuk thought about how he had said the same thing hundreds of times. The others\u2019 expressions at his words. That must be his expression right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I asked something useless. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The South American made Jun Hyuk stop as he was walking away,</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Are you Jun by chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am. You know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn unbelievable genius from Asia. Skinny and tall. I could tell just by looking at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A curious guy who says something unexpected in every class and is not well-versed in the basic theories but is able to explain everything with music. Though it had not been long since school started, Jun Hyuk had become the subject of such rumors.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk frowned as he asked, the girl hit her own head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right\u2026 It was true that our genius isn\u2019t interested in others. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>This South American beauty in her twenties laughed and got up from her chair.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Amelia. Piano major.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk shook the hand Amelia had put out. She stared at Jun Hyuk, but he could not take his eyes off of the harmonica.</p><br/><p>Amelia Lamarque is a genius pianist who is already recognized as the 2nd Martha Argerich in Argentina. She had shown this first at the New York Bernstein Music Festival and famous professor and professor Reny Greenfield had recommended her to enroll in the school.</p><br/><p>Professor Greenfield was so confident in her talent that he never failed to invite her as a guest pianist for his performances and went around telling people that she would become the queen of concerts.</p><br/><p>The ability to capture South America\u2019s passion in her piano. She was critically acclaimed because she could use that passion and even show simplicity.</p><br/><p>Last year however, she was eliminated in the 2nd round of the Poland Warsaw Chopin Competition and was not included in the final list. There could have been talk that she had not been able to advance because she is not European, but the organizers dismissed these rumors because a Japanese person came in 1st place.</p><br/><p>An important fact is that the Japanese person who won spent 10 years in France\u2019s Paris School of Music, and that played a large part in the win.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia, piano, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk mumbled each word as though he were saving them in his memory.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you liked the harmonica just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia kept making Jun Hyuk stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It was a really cool variation. The configuration was really impressive. I\u2019m saying this as a pianist, but try arranging that song on two pianos. I think it\u2019ll come out really great. Alright then, I have to get to class.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Jun Hyuk turned around, Amelia grabbed his wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. Whew \u2013 What do you mean 2 pianos? I\u2019m not a genius like someone. Shouldn\u2019t you at least give me a hint for how to configure it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia scratched her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You performed it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I honestly don\u2019t really remember it. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the students of this school saw Jun Hyuk as strange, he also thought they were strange.</p><br/><p>Danny who plays the violin so well is an dumb, and Coline who is a member of the quintet is an idiot who wants to become a rock star.</p><br/><p>Now this pianist suffers from short-term memory. How could she not remember what she just played?</p><br/><p>\u201cCantata A Major, E Flat Major, Gm. This is for the 1st piano. And the 2nd piano can play D, C, Majors. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have to change it a bit since the range of the piano and harmonica are different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia moved her fingers in the air a few times and snapped her fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>She put out the cigarette she was holding and ran.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s felt good as he watched her run. There was no need to explain multiple times in this school. Everyone could understand what he meant with few words. They also gave results that were up to and at times beyond his expectations.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk started running again as well. He was already late because of that forgetful girl. He would get a tardy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

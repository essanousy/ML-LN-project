I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He clenched his fists at Jun Hyuk who had thrown the words as if annoyed before turning his back on him. It made him mad enough that a kid a year younger was being so rude, but he could not take the insult that Jun Hyuk was acting as though he was not worth thinking of.</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun was better at enduring than he was at singing. He had endured five years of the strident trainee life. He relaxed his fists and spoke in a low voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying my singing is so bad it\u2019s not worth talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk turned his chair around again,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I mean I haven\u2019t heard you sing before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun\u2019s heart melted. Of course Jun Hyuk had never heard him sing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually preparing to debut in an idol group. I\u2019m the main vocal there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Well what does it matter if you can\u2019t sing when you\u2019re going to be an idol? Isn\u2019t stuff like dancing more important?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was experiencing this prejudice again. He was sick and tired of this prejudice. People did not realize that this trend was changing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. The main vocal of an idol group, especially for a boy group, is really important. That way we can be included in things like OSTs, musicals, and solo albums.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is. You\u2019ve been a trainee for a long time, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung understood why the vocal trainer\u2019s criticism of Lee Hae Jun had been rare.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Five years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you received all your vocal training?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder. That\u2019s why teacher Ryu Sun Hee doesn\u2019t criticize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSing for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk nodded to the guitar leaning on the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun hesitated before taking the guitar and started to sing,</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You\u2019ll meet again when you miss her\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lee Hae Jun sang Buhwal\u2019s Neverending Story, a few people from downstairs gathered at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh~ Ooh~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><br/><p>When his song finished, the people at the door clapped and cheered for him. He hit the high notes well and he had expressed the emotions of the song almost perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun felt a little lifted by the applause and put the guitar down to look at Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do. Just beat everyone with exact dancing. Make singing a backup.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one could breathe at Jun Hyuk\u2019s harsh criticism. How could he insult someone to their face without hesitation?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the reason? Am I that bad at singing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun was barely able to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What kind of question is that? Obviously it\u2019s because I like to sing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah. Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun could not speak because Jun Hyuk laughed lightly.</p><br/><p>He liked to sing. That was in the past. It was not like that anymore. Now, singing was tiresome, painful, and boring.</p><br/><p>Singing?</p><br/><p>It had been long since he had taken the road to money and fame by becoming a star. At this state, he could even become an actor if he was told that it was a faster way to become a star. Singing was not his goal but a road.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat object do you think your singing is? It\u2019s an object made by a technician. It\u2019s not even an object made because they liked it but because it sells well. Tell me honestly, you\u2019re sick of singing, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun could not respond to Jun Hyuk\u2019s fastball and stayed silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the person singing is thinking that, how do you think the people listening feel? Music is honest. It can\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun could not listen to Jun Hyuk anymore and left his seat. He needed to get some fresh air, or he would throw the punch.</p><br/><p>He went outside the entrance and stood on the small grassy lawn, thinking about what Jun Hyuk said. The judges had complimented him saying that he had a well-made vocal. He found it weird that he was so affected by Jun Hyuk\u2019s words. He was a teenager just like him even if he was called a genius. His words would not leave his head though.</p><br/><p>Singing was not fun.</p><br/><p>He could not get over the radical question Jun Hyuk had asked. He was still young, but it was the first time he had been asked that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey there. Is this the dormitory for Tomorrow\u2019s Star?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun jumped in surprise at the voice he heard out of nowhere. He forgot about Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but who are you? Reporters can\u2019t come in here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m a lawyer, not a reporter. Is Jang Jun Hyuk inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun took the man\u2019s business card. Lawyer Baek Seung Ho. Lawyer? Why would a lawyer be looking for Jun Hyuk?</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Don\u2019t misunderstand. I have to speak with Jun Hyuk regarding a sponsorship contract. I can meet him, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come into the house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re being difficult. It\u2019s not a prison or anything. Alright. I\u2019ll stay outside, please call him out for me. It\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho took out a cigarette when Lee Hae Jun disappeared into the house. How great of a broadcast did they think they were making that they locked the kids up in a place like this? He was looking at the blurry shadows of people in the windows when the front door opened and a tall, young boy came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look better in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m someone really close to Yoon Kwang Hun. First, take the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho took out his phone,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me\u2026 Okay. I just met him\u2026 You talk to him first. I\u2019ll put him on the line.\u201d</p><br/><p>A confused Jun Hyuk took the phone from Baek Seung Ho.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Is this Jun Hyuk? It\u2019s me. How are you? It\u2019s not hard? And fun?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, boss. Yes. I\u2019m doing well. How are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 I\u2019m good too.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why does your voice sound like that? Are you sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 No kid. I\u2019m just happy to hear your voice. Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 You know that man you\u2019re with right now? He\u2019s a lawyer at a really big and famous firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cLawyer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk eyed the man smoking a cigarette next to him and kept talking on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Yeah, so you can do whatever that man tells you to do. I trust him and he\u2019s like a little brother, so listen to him well. You understand?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But why? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 I said everything is fine. Anyway, have fun. And show everyone how good you are, okay?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Okay, put that lawyer back on the phone.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk passed the phone back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Tell him well. He has a temper but he\u2019s a fast thinker. He\u2019s not reckless like the rumors. He\u2019s smarter than you think, so he\u2019ll understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Just leave it to me. I\u2019m a lawyer who lives off of words. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho hung up the phone and smiled at Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, you\u2019re curious as to why I\u2019m here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho searched for the articles on Jun Hyuk and Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s relationship on his smartphone and showed them to Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cRead them slowly. This is what\u2019s happening outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand shook as he held the phone. He kept trying to touch the article, but random ads popped up as he kept missing it with his shaking fingers,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh shit.\u201d</p><br/><p>His hand shook and the swearing was uncontrollable. After the first article, there was another.</p><br/><p>[Jang Jun Hyuk\u2019s Guardian Villain Boss, Closed Cafe and Ran Away? Location Unknown.]</p><br/><p>After reading the articles for a while, Jun Hyuk\u2019s face turned red,</p><br/><p>\u201cThese\u2026 these assholes\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho took the phone out of Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would you like for me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt like he was burning up, but this lawyer was laughing with a cigarette in his hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

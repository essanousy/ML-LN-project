Can you send the original or make up another copy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf the score?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Do you need to modify it anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen send it right away. We\u2019ll submit it to the Queen Elisabeth Competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Isaac Stern told him the conclusion, Jun Hyuk was taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Isaac\u2026 I was just asking what you thought of submitting it, not that we need to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I think it\u2019s a good idea to submit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a time for everything. Competitions are a privilege for the young. Winning with concrete numbers against a lot of competitors isn\u2019t something you can do when you\u2019re older. Only because of useless pride. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk gained courage from Isaac Stern\u2019s vigorous laughter and told him the real goal.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Isaac. More than the competition or winning, I\u2019d like to conduct with the piano and violin soloists.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then you really must win. Fine. I\u2019ll make you into a winner.\u201d</p><br/><p>He will make him into a winner? It is a surprising thought beyond confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019ll make me? Is that what a competition is? Does that mean it\u2019s a show where a winner isn\u2019t chosen, but where it\u2019s possible to make a winner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stern laughed again at Jun Hyuk\u2019s surprised tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Jun, don\u2019t misunderstand me. This piece is certainly the winner. But there will be a lot of controversy. I\u2019m going to block any circumstances where that controversy might prevent you from winning. I mean that I\u2019m going to make it a fair competition that judges based on the works alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be controversy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t think about that while you were making the song?\u201d</p><br/><p>He does not even know what his own song might mean. Stern was more surprised by this.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I just thought it\u2019d be fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Well this really is fun. I did predict that there would be a lot of cases like this if I were with you. That case came too quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. Why will this song become a controversy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeethoven is the only one in history called an evil. Furthermore, his Symphony No. 9 has been put in the UNESCO World Register. It\u2019s play on the most important day in each country, and is the most worshipped piece. But isn\u2019t your song a challenge thrown at Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 9? It\u2019s a miscalculation to think that it won\u2019t become a controversy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern\u2019s long explanation made Jun Hyuk realize that this is how people could view his song.</p><br/><p>\u201cI say let\u2019s see what happens. Let\u2019s see how the judges of Queen Elisabeth and the world will accept this fearless challenge. It\u2019s thrilling just thinking about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern was still laughing when he hung up the phone with a stunned Jun Hyuk who could not speak.</p><br/><p>When he first opened the score that came via e-mail, his eyes and ears were disbelieving. When he finished the 1st movement, it felt like he had just gotten off of a rollercoaster. He was dizzy.</p><br/><p>There had not been a moment for relaxation. The music pushed forward so much that 18 minutes felt like a few seconds.</p><br/><p>When the 2nd movement unfolded and the violin and piano suddenly jumped out, it was shocking. No one could imagine that a symphony would transform into a concerto. Destruction of the form was not all.</p><br/><p>The piano and violin were like a captain that needs to get through the rough ocean of the orchestra by overcoming the rapidly changing melody and sprinting for 12 minutes.</p><br/><p>As soon as the thick bass and vocal tenor started, it brought up Beethoven\u2019s choral symphony. The orchestra, vocal, piano, and violin blended in harmony and when he closed the score as it ended the last movement in exaltation, he could understand the piece\u2019s intent.</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern went back to the 1st movement to start checking everything one by one.</p><br/><p>18 minutes, 12 minutes, 19 minutes, 25 minutes. 4 movements combined. It is like the choral symphony of Beethoven that the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s Furtwangler conducted. He had run for this long time without breathing, and the result is a challenge!</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern could not decide how to assess this piece. It is too radical of a challenge thrown at Beethoven.</p><br/><p>There is too much transition in this song that goes over an hour, making it hard to breathe. The 2nd movement that releases the anxiety that appears in normal sonata forms, does not exist.</p><br/><p>Stern has led a management agency for musicians well until now because of his ability to listen to a piece just once and lay down an assessment. Isaac Stern needed to know the true worth behind this song he was reserving judgment from.</p><br/><p>He had to call a meeting with the top staff of Stern Corporation. They are people with discernment and insight to find the essence of excellent music.</p><br/><p>8 staff members sat on the sofa in President Stern\u2019s office and looked over the score for over 2 hours before closing it. Their expressions were not very different from that of President Stern when he first saw this piece. Then a long silence began.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this was enough time to enjoy the aftertaste? Everyone, snap out of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern woke up each person while they were lost in their thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Jun. He really is impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? I can\u2019t imagine how he wrote such a song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore than that, my jaw dropped when I first saw the broad mindedness of this song. How could he think of fighting in the same ring as Beethoven? Isn\u2019t this him asking us to compare his choral symphony with this piece?\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff\u2019s enjoyment of the song was not different from Isaac Stern\u2019s. They had all loved the song for 200 years, but no musician had ever tried to challenge it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you think he\u2019s plenty qualified to go in the ring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. He\u2019s reckless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? How do you think the world will accept this incredible challenge that Jun Hyuk is throwing out there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one will be able to believe it. Who would believe that it\u2019s Beethoven, and none other than the choral symphony?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the challenge sitting right in front of you? What can\u2019t you believe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. You know that\u2019s not what I mean\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. Everyone, say your conclusions first. Who do you think will get the champion belt? Is it Beethoven who has held the throne for 200 years? Or 20 year old Jun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s challenge is reckless, but Stern\u2019s straightforward question is also reckless. Even if Jun Hyuk\u2019s song is better, how could they admit Beethoven\u2019s defeat?</p><br/><p>However, it is a question from a boss who pays them a hefty salary. And it is a difficult boss who hates ambiguous answers.</p><br/><p>The 8 staff members praised the piece first. But the conclusion is that Jun Hyuk loses. 5 of the staff were of the same thought as Isaac Stern. They voted in Beethoven\u2019s favor because it is so fast and there are so many changes that there is not a single moment to take a breath.</p><br/><p>The interesting aspect is the evaluation of the remaining 3 people. The con of Jun Hyuk\u2019s piece that had made the other 5 people raise their hands for Beethoven. They rather feel a catharsis from the speed and changes. It is not a disadvantage, but the device that will allow it to win Beethoven.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? I also felt uncomfortable with how rapid the changes are\u2026 but it is captivating to some people. Well that\u2019s interesting too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence fell again. They need to assess the grounds for this precisely. People who enjoy art think about it and analyze it constantly after enjoying it. The person who transcends from this thought and analysis is a critic. Stern Corporation needs to have precise praise or criticism from these critics, and they need to have the evidence to refute this criticism.</p><br/><p>It is a management agency\u2019s duty to prevent its artists\u2019 unnecessary flaws.</p><br/><p>The person to break the silence in President Stern\u2019s office was a staff member sitting in the back. He is young, but he already looks to be in his mid thirties.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. That\u2019s because of age.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s attentions turned toward the young staff member who brought up age out of nowhere.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

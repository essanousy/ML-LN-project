He won\u2019t make it to the top 10, but shouldn\u2019t we have enough to air about him before them?</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly! If he just goes on broadcast, he\u2019ll be more popular than the top 10. We\u2019ll have to push his story as much as possible before the main missions and change the direction later to that of a pianist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPianist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese girls! You need to think a little. Once the program ends, we can make him go on variety shows and the game\u2019s over when he plays the piano. Entertainment agencies will come flooding in to pick him up. They probably won\u2019t give the winner a second look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The broadcast writers did not pay attention to Yoon Kwang Hun and spoke amongst themselves excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me\u2026 \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cYes? Oh, sorry. We were chatting too much on our own, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but most of the agencies have already come with scouting offers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we know. We figured it would be so. But if he gets popular on our show, the contract conditions change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContract conditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. To start, you wouldn\u2019t have to pay the advance fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdvance fee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know about this stuff. A scouting offer doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll just debut the child.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Yoon Kwang Hun showed interest, the main writer took the opportunity and started explaining in detail.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese days, it takes 5 to 7 years to debut an idol group. The costs alone come out to at least $500,000. When there are a lot of members, it\u2019ll reach over $1 million. So they take about $40,000 to $50,000 per person.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard people like that who take money from the kids are scammers. That proper companies don\u2019t demand any money\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the writers burst out in laughter at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, all agencies are the same. The fees for vocal training and dance lessons alone are incredible. And how much are the costs for creating and marketing a debut album? Even after they debut, it\u2019s not like they start making money right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmong girl groups awaiting their debuts, there are even girls whose parents have invested $10,000 to $20,000 to have them placed in their groups.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the main member of the group won\u2019t have to pay the company. Instead, she\u2019ll basically be under a slave contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Yoon Kwang Hun sitting silently with his eyes wide open, the main writer thought that her plan had succeeded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo if he goes on our show and presents himself well, you won\u2019t have to pay the advance fee and he can skip years of training.\u201d</p><br/><p>She emphasized that it would not cost him anything, but Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s expression went back to that of apathy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Anyway, I understand. I\u2019ll talk to Jun Hyuk and get back in contact, but don\u2019t hold your expectations. Jun Hyuk doesn\u2019t have intentions to become a star or an idol singer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The writers had to leave without interviewing Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>Do you think Yoon Kwang Hun fell for the agency lady\u2019s lies?</p><br/><p>Stay tuned\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

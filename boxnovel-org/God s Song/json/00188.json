While 2 maestros were lost in the score in each office, the chairman of the committee was looking at the truck that had come with a delivery under his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did you say it was?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Isaac Stern of Stern Corporation sent this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout saying anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that he has prepared so that it can be practiced right away. He said that time would be tight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boxes unloading from the truck were full of Jun Hyuk\u2019s score, which had already been made into books.</p><br/><p>\u201cStore those boxes so none of them are leaked, and request a meeting with the maestro quickly. No \u2013 tell him I\u2019ll go to him myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chairman of the committee ran to BOZAR art center.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. Have you seen the winning score?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s an incredible masterpiece. I\u2019m sure you saw it as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men looked at each other in puzzlement. Rather than an evaluation of the music, they looked at the score with worries about the competition schedule.</p><br/><p>\u201cInferno\u2019s Jun came out with an entirely unexpected song this time. And in our Queen Elisabeth at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. This is a good thing, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. The competition\u2019s status will change.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is in the form of the competition, but it is still a premiere. It is hard to premiere a masterpiece that is standing proudly against Beethoven\u2019s symphony on a stage like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I keep worrying first. President Isaac Stern must have already been sure of Jun\u2019s win, because he made the score into books and sent them over. I estimate that there are over 300 of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. His humor is still the same. You must have been surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>The maestro could only laugh when he heard that the scores had been sent over already in book form. It is a result that anyone could have anticipated, not just Isaac Stern. Though he heard that there are controversies in the screening process, it is a given that Jun Hyuk\u2019s \u2018Choral Concerto\u2019 should win.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry because President Stern isn\u2019t someone who would go around telling people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe even left a message to start practicing right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I do need a lot of scores right away. We need to hurry because the choir will also need it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chairman watched the maestro and cautiously spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026 We had a meeting as soon as we saw the winning score. We discussed the final performance\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The maestro spoke while the chairman spoke carefully,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this because of the winner, Jun? Because he\u2019s a genius who has already gained experience as visiting conductor of the Boston Philharmonic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Our honest thoughts are that we would like to create a more exciting stage to bring the competition more attention from around the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to leave the conducting to Jun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe piano and violin have to perform with the Belgium National Orchestra and Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra in the final. Thinking of the final stage, isn\u2019t there not enough time until the finals in April as President Stern said?\u201d</p><br/><p>The maestro frowned for a moment and spoke when he made up his mind,</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman. Let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s decide on who will conduct once the detailed schedule is out. And let\u2019s discuss with President Stern. Check Jun\u2019s schedule and ask him to join as soon as he can. Of course include conducting on stage in the cases.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chairman thanked the maestro for his positive answer multiple times and left.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes opened at dawn because of the noisy ringing of his phone. He frowned because he had only been asleep for 3 hours.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. Are you awake already? So it\u2019s the same in the East and West that older people sleep less.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m still partying with beautiful women. He he. The weird thing is that a young man like you is sleeping at this time. Oh right. I didn\u2019t call to brag. I\u2019ll be at your house in an hour, so be ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need beautiful women and I don\u2019t care for parties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not beautiful women or a party. You\u2019ve been confirmed the winner. I just got the call. Well\u2026 It was bound to happen. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was not so happy he felt like he would jump up and down when he heard the fact that he won. Could it be because President Stern and the maestro of the New York Philharmonic had reinforced it in him multiple times? He just felt calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust pack lightly with some clothes. We\u2019ll go to Belgium.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Belgium? At this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The competition committee will look for you. Let\u2019s go ahead of time and get some touring in. I know a really great pub. You\u2019re going to love it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you rushing it too much? We should make our moves once we are contacted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, isn\u2019t it better to tour Brussels than to stay home alone? And it\u2019s much warmer over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>It did seem like charming Brussels would be better than lazing around at home.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then I\u2019ll get ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hung up the phone, packed a few things, and waited for Isaac Stern while sending text messages to a few people.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Sir. I won the Queen Elisabeth Competition. We were just told.</p><br/><p>\u2013 I\u2019ll see you the day you conduct on stage for the finals. Don\u2019t forget to send admission tickets.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s text message was still characteristically dry.</p><br/><p>Even inside the private plane to Brussels, Isaac Stern did not look the least bit tired. The person who was yawning from tiredness was Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. Isn\u2019t it weird that we\u2019re just going over there when the committee hasn\u2019t asked us yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe New York Philharmonic\u2019s maestro was certain of it. It\u2019s only a matter of time before they call for you. And you could show them how you solve the biggest problem that the world of contemporary music has. The competition\u2019s end will be anticipating that as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlike in the past, composers and performers are now completely separated. The composition and conducting departments are separated in college as well. One of the reasons why contemporary music has become farther from people is that there is an analysis that the composer doesn\u2019t perform himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beethoven played the piano himself while conducting the orchestra, and Mozart did everything to conducting opera music. In modern day however, music has become completely separated like an industry.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve already done it once before. Didn\u2019t you conduct Inferno yourself to record it? There will be a symbolic meaning to your conducting your own song.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to say more, but they both fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Brussels International Airport is a short distance of 12km northeast from the city. However, the limousine with President Stern and Jun Hyuk did not go into the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac, where are we going right now? Aren\u2019t we going to Brussels?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought somewhere quieter than the city would be better, so I borrowed a castle. It\u2019s a 20 minute distance from the city, so it won\u2019t be uncomfortable to go back and forth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Castle? Isaac! Geez! Let\u2019s just go to a normal hotel. It\u2019s totally obvious that you want a huge castle to throw those parties you like so much every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is something that Jun Hyuk realized while seeing Isaac Stern over the past few months. He is very serious and refined when he is dealing with music, showing features of an old gentleman. His personal side is humorous and shows signs of a playboy who likes to play.</p><br/><p>\u201cParty? Me? No. Once I handle the situation with your conducting and the competition committee, I\u2019m going back to New York. I\u2019m a pretty busy person, you know. I can\u2019t just sit back and relax here for months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to move to a smaller hotel. How am I supposed to spend my time alone in a castle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrust me this time. It\u2019ll be just to your liking when you see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He winked and laughed. Jun Hyuk did not feel his trust go to him, but thought that he should just trust him this one time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t is perfect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk stared blankly at the castle as the scenery stole his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a castle? Ah, it is great. But to be called a castle, it\u2019s a bit\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was normally a bit bigger than this. It was still a small castle, not to the scale of England\u2019s Buckingham Palace. That was restored and a small house was created. They just call it a castle out of habit.\u201d</p><br/><p>More than a castle, it is closer to a beautiful mansion in the countryside. The house\u2019s position on a low hill showed that it used to be a castle, and it is a secluded area as if there is a park around it. It is a peaceful place where a few birds flew around the small lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know your taste well now. Somewhere nothing is around. People, cities. It\u2019ll be quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s pleased face and got back in the limousine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen get some rest. I\u2019m going to go meet someone from the competition committee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern had only slept a few hours on the plane, but he did not seem tired at all. Where is that vigor coming from? Jun Hyuk threw his bags into the living room. He could not leave this beautiful scenery and fall asleep, so he slowly took a walk around the empty hill.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

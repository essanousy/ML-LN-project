My name is Yoon Kwang Hun. You can just call me Yoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the Mr. Jang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Jang Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk awkwardly took the hand that the interviewer held out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then shall we start the interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>Three professors sat with gentle smiles and started asking questions while the two tried to calm their nerves. Unless there was a special case, he would be accepted no matter what. There was no need to be so worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019ll tell you something very important. Our university really wants Mr. Jang\u2019s admission to the school, but we will make the final decision with the interview. This means that you may not accepted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>If someone goes against the school\u2019s values, even Mozart would not be admitted. To these people, musical talent was a given and they tried to take into acount even the person\u2019s personality.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, we went through the music files and essay you sent thoroughly. It seems Mr. Jang has never attended school. Is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that is the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why were they mentioning the fact that he did not receive a basic education instead of in music? The first interviewer\u2019s negative question stayed on Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the 2 years that Mr. Yoon cared for Mr. Jang as a custodian, what did you teach him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnglish and reading music scores. I also made it so that he could freely listen to and play music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I ask why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a talent I could do anything about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun put emphasis on \u2018talent\u2019. It is a talent that he is proud of.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe know that fully well. Pianist Hye Jin Jeon, Sae Won Go, and Maestro Hwang. We saw their letters of recommendation as well. Madam Jeon\u2019s letter was especially poignant no matter how many times we read it. It was quite convincing. I am asking why you didn\u2019t give him general education.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, Yoon Kwang Hun could not think of a response. Why had he not thought of sending Jun Hyuk to school? He was surprised, but he remembered that it had been an environment where that was entirely plausible.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Jang\u2019s musical talent was so outstanding. I think I decided that he did not need to do anything outside of music\u2026 I could not send a 15 year old boy to an elementary school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s response could be accepted as a difference in the educational system, but the interviewers continued to shake their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how is his reading? How many books has he read until now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBooks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Whether it be novels, historical books, et cetera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not give an answer. Jun Hyuk learned hangul late and the only text he had read were stories concerning musicians on the internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 Can we understand this to mean that Mr. Jang has the knowledge of an elementary school student?\u201d</p><br/><p>They made the judgment that Jun Hyuk did not have knowledge beyond music while Yoon Kwang Hun hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe that is too severe of a judgment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if it is. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have understanding of a single novel, a science experiment, history or culture\u2026 I don\u2019t think it would be lacking to say that he does not even have an elementary school level knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he were talking about the intellectual level, he would be better than an elementary school student, but he could not deny it when discussing knowledge.</p><br/><p>The three interviewers spoke with each other in low voices and made their final decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur conditions for admission are as follows. He needs to receive separate education in subjects outside of music for 3 hours every day and if he fails in that curriculum, he will be left back. I\u2019m saying that he would not be able to graduate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c3 hours each day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. If we think that he has reached the average education level of a high school graduate, we will end those classes. This means that he needs to receive a general education and profession musical training at the same time. We believe that if he receives this education, his English will also improve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, an interviewer who had been quiet added to this as if he had been forgetting something,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, language is also added. English is a basic, but we plan to teach him Italian, German, or French \u2013 one of his choosing. Most of the students in this school are fluent in at least one European language.\u201d</p><br/><p>If they made the wrong move, he could end up spending more time in general studies more than in working with music.</p><br/><p>\u201cJang\u2019s application says that he would like to major in piano, composition, and commanding, but will he be able to keep up with that amount of work??</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will be able to handle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not know about anything else, but Yoon Kwang Hun was confident that he could make it so they could not stop talking if it were about music.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe admit that Jang\u2019s talent is extraordinary, but this school is full of students with amazing talent. Our school holds classes with these talented students as a benchmark. That is how high the standard is. It won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk studied English ardently, but he was not at a level where he could understand the interview perfectly. However, he had fully understood that he would need to dedicate 3 hours everyday to general studies and learn another language.</p><br/><p>His hardened face already showed that he did not have the confidence to do this. Of the various schools he had interviewed with, this was the only place with such strong requirements, so he was thinking of the other schools that had said that all he had to do was music.</p><br/><p>However, Yoon Kwang Hun felt like he needed to make the decision at this moment. What this school was asking for is neither unreasonable nor deterring. He was actually disappointed in himself for not thinking of paying attention to Jun Hyuk\u2019s education outside of music.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are the conditions for admission. And now our questions are for Mr. Jang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The interviewer smiled at a tense Jun Hyuk to make him comfortable as he spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is music to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was easy English, so Jun Hyuk fully understood it and answered without hesitation,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is making the sounds of the world that disappear within moments, last forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaking sounds last forever\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the interviewers mumbled to themselves at Jun Hyuk\u2019s response. Then Jun Hyuk started to speak again,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, and one more thing. It\u2019s the best way to relay someone\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk added what he had felt while participating in the audition program.</p><br/><p>This professors of this school had already seen plenty in Jun Hyuk\u2019s music. Since they already saw his flash of talent in his piano and scores, they did not need him to go through the audition that all of the other participants needed to pass.</p><br/><p>It could be that the interviewer\u2019s question to Jun Hyuk was just out of personal curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Hm\u2026 When can you start participating in classes?\u201d</p><br/><p>It meant that he had been accepted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can start with the fall semester. Jun Hyuk is working on his record in Korea at the moment. It will be released before the fall semester.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA record? Oh, we have high expectations. Can I ask for a copy once it\u2019s released?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll send it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. And what do you intend to do for living arrangements? Are you thinking of having a separate residence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we would like to go in the dormitories. As you know, he hasn\u2019t had a school life, so he would like to make a lot of friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is an excellent choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>History is made at night and Clayton School of Music is no exception to this.</p><br/><p>When hot-blooded youths from all over the world are gathered in one place, there is no reason for them to quietly sleep at night. They party with alcohol and music every night.</p><br/><p>In the morning, someone is always lost in thought because they cannot remember the song they played while drunk the night before. This also means that the song was good enough for them to want to remember it. Spending time with these people would give him more opportunities to find such inspiration.</p><br/><p>With this, it was decided that Jun Hyuk would become independent in the fall semester.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

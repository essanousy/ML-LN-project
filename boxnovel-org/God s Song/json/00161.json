The Philharmonic is too large to fight over one song.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s that. Isn\u2019t it around time that your traveling will become boring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s so good I could do this for 10 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>He showed a little disappointment when Jun Hyuk said that he likes it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to go to America with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmerica?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I accepted an offer from the Boston Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then are you going to be Boston\u2019s maestro?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Why? You thought I would have been out of a job? As soon as the article saying I left the Vienna Philharmonic went out, I got over 10 calls with invitations. I\u2019m that good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. I see. So is Boston your final choice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Boston Philharmonic is in the fall season with regular performances from December to May. There is also a short summer season called Tanglewood that runs from July to the beginning of August.</p><br/><p>Tanglewood, or Tanglewood Music Festival, is one of the largest music festivals in New England along with the Newport Jazz Festival. Located 2 hours to the west of Boston, Tanglewood is in Lenox where author Hawthorne of \u2018The Scarlet Letter\u2019 wrote \u2018Tanglewood Tales\u2019.</p><br/><p>In 1936, the Boston Symphony Orchestra opened its first performance on a hill with a small and shabby house. In 1940, Russia conductor and composer, and contrabass player Serge Koussevitzky established a music summer camp for 300 young musicians. That was the beginning of today\u2019s Tanglewood Music Festival.</p><br/><p>The zest that can only be experienced at the Tanglewood Music Festival is of listening to world class music while surrounded by beautiful nature. Finding a comfortable and appropriate shaded area to lie on the grass while listening to the classical melody brings a different kind of emotion and awe.</p><br/><p>Patrick Quinn had become the maestro leading the Boston Philharmonic starting in the beginning of August, once the summer season has ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Boston is the only place that accepted my condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCondition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerforming Inferno. If performing it is hard, then recording an album. That was my first request, and Boston accepted it without another word.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with New York, Chicago, Cleveland, and Philadelphia, they are the 5 orchestras of America called the \u2018Big Five\u2019. The Boston Philharmonic has an audience of all ages because the citizens of Boston have great interest in the orchestra and there is a high ratio of students in the city.</p><br/><p>Due to the young audience, there were a lot of experimental performances and they released a lot of contemporary music albums. Since 2009, they even have their own record label called the \u2018BSO (Boston Symphony Orchestra) Classics\u2019 that releases records and has a digital track download system.</p><br/><p>The Boston Philharmonic was expecting a record of Inferno to become a big shot. The Boston Philharmonic and Patrick Quinn\u2019s understanding had fit exactly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a second condition? Like an incredible salary. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there\u2019s a second. That\u2019s not money but you, Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The condition was that you could conduct the performance or recording of Inferno. What do you think? Don\u2019t you want to give up your travels? Ha ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not understand what Patrick Quinn meant exactly. Could it be?</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, I would like to perform this song no matter what. But what I want more is to hear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to hear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Not imagining the song while reading the score, but it\u2019s music that I want to hear for myself. That\u2019s why my second condition was you. So I could listen to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patrick Quinn is saying that he would lend Jun Hyuk the luxury instrument, the Boston Philharmonic, to perform the song himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Would you want to fulfill my ambition?\u201d</p><br/><p>How does he need to respond? Patrick Quinn\u2019s suggestion shook Jun Hyuk up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake your time to think about it. Since the season begins in December, think about it until then.\u201d</p><br/><p>His hesitation meant that Jun Hyuk was already leaning towards doing it. Patrick Quinn thought that it would not be long before he could hear Inferno with his own ears.</p><br/><p>Life is a series of choices. After enjoying fall in beautiful Europe and going into winter, he was thinking of going down south. He wanted to go to warm southern Italy and take in the Mediterranean wind to see the Italian opera\u2019s unrealistic true background.</p><br/><p>But\u2026..</p><br/><p>Conducting the Boston Symphony. And traveling the Mediterranean as a symbol of freedom. There is of course Amelia as well.</p><br/><p>He was going to make the decision all on his own.</p><br/><p>He could start traveling again later. The opportunity to conduct the Boston Philharmonic disappears the moment someone releases a record of Inferno. And there is something that people still do not know. If he adds all of that together, now is his chance.</p><br/><p>But it is possible that the Boston Philharmonic is unable to perform Inferno. When Jun Hyuk thought that it may be impossible to perform the song, he thought about whether they would be able to release a record.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, choosing is not hard. Choosing is only difficult when someone has trouble finding determination. Determination is easy with courage as well.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took out his cellphone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Quinn. I\u2019ll meet you in Boston.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk turned the camping car around and headed back in the direction of Zurich. He sold the camping car for nothing and got on a plane to Boston.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk really was not a star. No one knew his name. The stars were \u2018Inferno\u2019 the song and Jun the name. No one recognized him when he bought his airline ticket, got his boarding pass, or when he went through procedures for coming and going.</p><br/><p>When using the name \u2018Jun Hyuk Jang\u2019, he is just a young Asian boy.</p><br/><p>When he arrived at General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport in Boston, a woman in her mid-30s, wearing a dress, was waiting for him.</p><br/><p>She must have used the photo on Patrick Quinn\u2019s to learn his face because she raised her hand as soon as she saw him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Jun. I\u2019m Tara Butters of the Boston Philharmonic. Call me Tara.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Maestro? I can\u2019t handle that. Just call me Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that. You are a guest conductor for the Boston Philharmonic. Anyway, I don\u2019t know how long it will be for but I am going to act as your secretary while you are here. It\u2019s an honor. Please let me know if you need anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a limousine waiting outside the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we go to the hotel? We have made reservations for you at the Plaza Hotel. We can move you somewhere else if you find anything uncomfortable, so just tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Do maestros always receive such treatment? He could not tell if it was out of genuine admiration or firmly placed custom, but he did not think he could ever get used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s go to the hotel later. I\u2019d like to meet Maestro Patrick Quinn first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then we\u2019ll be going to Boston Symphony Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Tara Butters had acted less like a secretary, they would have been able to have a conversation in the limousine. But Jun Hyuk completely shut his mouth and looked at Boston out the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Maestro. Can you take a look at this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA contract. I know you have a secretary, but don\u2019t know her contact information. Look over it and if you give me her information, I\u2019ll take care of it. It is the standard contract for visiting conductors with Boston Philharmonic. I will go over the details with your lawyer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. This is her phone number.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk found Lim So Mi\u2019s number in his phone and handed it over to Tara.</p><br/><p>Tara jotted the number down and pressed a few keys on the phone before handing it back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saved my number as well. Call me at anytime if you need anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk could not shake the feeling that he might be bothered a lot by this woman named Tara from now on.</p><br/><p>The Boston Symphony Hall, completed in 1900, is an impressive building reminiscent of European architecture and was selected as a National Historic Landmark. It is famous not just for the exterior, but as the concert hall with the best sound conditions in the world.</p><br/><p>He shook when he entered this historical building for the first time. He is not a tourist or someone here to see a concert. He is here as a performer to stand on the stage, and to conduct the orchestra at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Jun. Maestro Quinn is in rehearsal at the moment. He told us to go straight to the concert hall. What would you like to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman\u2019s timing is on point. She even takes away the time that he can stand back to be in awe. His shaking halted completely.</p><br/><p>When they entered the main concert hall, they could see Patrick Quinn conducting a Tchaikovsky piece on stage.</p><br/><p>He saw Jun Hyuk, put the baton down, and hugged him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! My friend, Jun. Welcome. Do you know how much I\u2019ve been waiting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Past Patrick Quinn\u2019s shoulder, Jun Hyuk could see over 90 orchestra members looking at him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

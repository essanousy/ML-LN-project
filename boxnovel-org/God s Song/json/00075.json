He needed to teach Jun Hyuk the decisiveness to be able to choose jewels to toss from a chest full of jewels. It is the feeling of a director who has to take a movie film of a 3 hour running time that moves people to tears, but needs to cut it down to fit into 2 hours.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cThe use?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I told you in the beginning, right? The music needs to match the use too. It\u2019s a little detrimental to the body but it\u2019s simple, and fast food came out to make something to eat quickly. You have to make fast food, but you\u2019ve made a French feast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t take some of it out, we\u2019ll have to end it around here. We need to finish recording today.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a time when the music needs to fit the delivery. The quality of today\u2019s popular music just passed a grade test to be produced, delivered, and consumed quickly to be thrown away.</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su felt like he was Joseph II when he saw a surprised Jun Hyuk, and laughed.</p><br/><p>The top opera, Mozart\u2019s \u2018Figaro\u2019s Wedding,\u2019 that dominated Austria was written on the command of the Holy Roman Empire\u2019s Emperor Joseph II.</p><br/><p>When Figaro\u2019s Wedding premiered, Joseph II made the assessment, \u201cYour music has too many notes.\u201d When opera had a lot of dialogue before Mozart, there was a lot of work to handle as if it were theater dialogue. However, Mozart created the opera according to his wishes.</p><br/><p>Since he heard an opera that was full of music as compared to the opera from before, anyone could understand Joseph II\u2019s assessment that there were too many notes. However, it is said that Mozart replied, \u201cThere is not one unnecessary note in my music,\u201d though there is no way to confirm this.</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su could not get himself to tell Jun Hyuk to take out notes as Joseph II had done, but he needed to tell him not to add more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Can you just end it here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019ll be better to just do it over again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Again?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Jun Hyuk laughed as he saw a surprised Yoon Jung Su. s</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going to do it completely, but I\u2019m going to take out a ton of it and make it really simply. I have to make fast food as you said. It\u2019ll take three or four hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>A genius musician who is not stubborn. Had he been customized to the modern time where music is business and not art? Or could he have realized that he needs to concede at this time?</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su was slightly taken aback that Jun Hyuk had accepted it so easily, but Jun Hyuk kept smiling as though it were nothing.</p><br/><p>He was an increasingly complex child. Could it be that he has pride in his music? Or was it confidence that he could make any form of music take the best shape?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s electronic song for the second stage completely transformed to be full of simplicity. Unless one looked for it, it was hard to tell that it was Yoon Jung Su\u2019s song. He had made the perfect music combining a simple drum beat, electric guitar riff, and electronic sound effects.</p><br/><p>It was dull however.</p><br/><p>Everyone who had been listening to the song that Jun Hyuk had fixed in 5 hours had the same thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis should be enough, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah. You did well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had made the music according to Yoon Jung Su\u2019s instructions. It was perfectly made for broadcast.</p><br/><p>It was dull, but it also felt like there was something missing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou took out the part you\u2019ll be performing during the broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, since we can\u2019t just turn the music on for the stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su saw Jun Hyuk who had made the music as though according to a client\u2019s demands as a music director instead of a musician.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Are you going to play the guitar on stage? Or the piano?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to play the keyboard so I can play multiple instrumental sounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is how Jun Hyuk\u2019s second mission song was completed.</p><br/><p>The three stayed in the studio until late at night to complete their songs so they could put them up on the track site as soon as the broadcast was over. When they finished working on their songs and returned to the dormitory, Yoon Jung Su quietly called Jang Na Rae over.</p><br/><p>\u201cNa Rae, listen to me carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to bring you into my agency.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Na Rae just bowed her head when she heard something so unbelievable. It seemed as though she was trying to hold back tears.</p><br/><p>How anxious she must have been. She was expecting to be eliminated during the first half of the finals that were soon to start. If no one wanted to take her by then, she needed to go back to her daily life. This difficult yet grand world of entertainment would come to an end.</p><br/><p>She had been thinking that her dream to make a living with music was coming to an end, but Yoon Jung Su had thrown her a rope of salvation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that if we work on your vocals, we can get them to an unreachable level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Could it be that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su\u2019s high praises were more difficult to believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. You don\u2019t believe my intuition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a joke. Anyway, I want to see you over time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOver time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. My intention is to make you a singer, not a celebrity. If I wanted to, I could get you on a couple variety programs and have you permanently placed on one. But I\u2019m thinking of having you do music while building a fence with TV for 10 years. With a focus on album, OST, and theater concert. Instead of music ranking programs, only broadcasts like Sketchbook with a concert format.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su meant for her to basically be a singer without a face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might not be able to make much money until you take a sturdy seat in the music industry. And you won\u2019t have fans following you around everywhere like girl groups do.\u201d</p><br/><p>For Jang Na Rae who dreamt of becoming a star, telling her to take the path of a musician inevitably made her hesitate.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in 10 years, Jang Na Rae will be a brand musician.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is difficult to tell someone in their 20s to be patient. Honor is important with age but in most cases, finding success quickly is the main goal for youths.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to succeed as a solo artist these days. You saw the girls who are the main vocals of their groups? Their vocal skills are amazing. It\u2019s to the point where each of those girls could be solo artists.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since there were over millions of aspiring celebrities, the reality was that there were tons of girls who had everything including good looks and skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to make you a singer with skills that overwhelm those girls. My goal is to make it so that they remake your songs and call you teacher instead of daring to call you sister or senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher. I\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su stopped Jang Na Rae from speaking,</p><br/><p>\u201cNa Rae, hang on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t respond now. I\u2019m sure you need to think about it thoroughly and discuss it with your parents. Give me an answer when the broadcast is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Na Rae nodded her head in understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy guess is that during the broadcast, there will be other agencies contacting you to sign with them. It\u2019ll be better for you to listen to them as well to make your decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jang Na Rae who had heard Yoon Jung Su\u2019s proposition boarded the car going to the dormitory. Among the three, Jang Na Rae\u2019s face was the brightest as she had put down a great worry.</p><br/><p>The three people who had finished their second mission songs took each of their experiences and thoughts to gain more experiences and teachings from another producer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

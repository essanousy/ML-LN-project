I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he entered through the cafe doors, Yoon Kwang Hun was wiping his hands and walking out of the kitchen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here? How was it flying on a private plane? Was it comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was amazing. It just felt like a house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun welcomed Jun Hyuk without making a fuss, as if he is greeting a son who has come home after a day of work.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are you temporarily closed? Are you repairing the cafe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Because you\u2019re coming. If we open, you need to stay locked up at home upstairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>In contrast to his calm demeanor, he had been waiting for Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be jetlagged. Go upstairs and get some sleep. I cleared up your room already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I slept a lot on the plane. Oh right. I heard you met President Isaac Stern.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He looked up your background so thoroughly he came to me first. How was it? Did you have a good talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I decided to sign with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I guess you liked him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun did not ask more. Circumstances where he needs to decide and act on his own will increase. Yoon Kwang Hun is thinking that he needs to hold his opinion back more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that terminating the contract is possible at any time. That\u2019s why I said we should do it. I haven\u2019t thought that I need a management agency yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. You\u2019ll know if you try it out. If you like it and it\u2019s comfortable, keep doing it. If it\u2019s uncomfortable, terminate it. Oh right, are you hungry? What do you want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Can you make me a plate of tonkatsu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTonkatsu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I was craving your tonkatsu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun must have already had it all prepared, because he quickly made a plate for Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there articles of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk spoke as he ate it in big bites and quickly emptied the plate.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It came up in a few places that you were fired from the Boston Philharmonic. It\u2019s not as noisy as before though. You\u2019re not a star. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Fired? Not resigned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s that. Articles need to be negative to sell. They need to make money too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk and Yoon Kwang Hun spent the first day drinking coffee and talking about the Boston Philharmonic.</p><br/><p>It is true when people say that children who live far away from home come back to their parents\u2019 homes to spend their time eating and sleeping. He kept feeling hunger and he always felt sleepy. Jun Hyuk forgot about music for the first time in a while and rested for 2 days while eating and sleeping.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk lazily opened his eyes, the cafe downstairs was a bit noisy. He decided to stay upstairs because he thought that reporters might have come for him, but he heard laughter and realized that they are not reporters.</p><br/><p>Downstairs, Professor Jeon Hye Jin, Fine Philharmonic\u2019s Hwang Suk Min, and Han Ye Ji were exchanging stories about how they know Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Jun Hyuk. You\u2019re awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Hello, Professor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwang Suk Min bolted up from his seat and held Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow. Jang Jun Hyuk! No. Maestro Jang! Let me hold this hand that\u2019s held the Boston Philharmonic\u2019s baton.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk tried to take his hand back, but Hwang Suk Min strengthened his grip. His eyes were frozen with jealousy and admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Why\u2019d you quit? If Inferno is hard, you should have conducted Beethoven. It\u2019s really a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew. Stop it Teacher Hwang. Isn\u2019t he a child who has endless opportunities going forward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk bowed to Professor Jeon Hye Jin who had her back turned to him, but he could not remember Han Ye Ji\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor, you\u2019re here as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Mr. Yoon called me when you got here. I was about to run here right away, but held myself back. I thought I should let you have some father son time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Professor Jeon Hye Jin said \u2018father and son,\u2019 Yoon Kwang Hun and Jun Hyuk did not feel awkward about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, hello. We met in Salzburg\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You forgot my name, didn\u2019t you? It\u2019s Han Ye Ji.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon saw Han Ye Ji smiling and Jun Hyuk scratching his head, took him by the hand and made him sit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere there. Now let\u2019s here this movie-like story. From Salzburg to Boston.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk told them everything that happened to him over the last 8 months, without leaving anything out. The shock he felt when he heard the Berlin Philharmonic playing the song that even he had forgotten about. Meeting world renowned maestros. And recording in Boston.</p><br/><p>When they imagined everything Jun Hyuk was telling them, it really felt like a movie.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, how long are you going to stay here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything planned. I just came. I don\u2019t even really have anything to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about school? Oh, nevermind. It\u2019d be weird for a guy who conducted for the Boston Philharmonic to go back to school as a student.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin asked half in worry and half in expectation, but her heart was not at ease. Hwang Suk Min saw her expression and also frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodness. Normally, Korea needs to be in a buzz\u2026 It\u2019d be definite for broadcasting stations and newspapers to be praising a 20 year old who was hired to conduct one of the top 5 American symphonies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s because I came into the country without anyone knowing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwang Suk Min tsked and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really what it is? I\u2019m pretty sure that even if they know, they\u2019ll write a few lines and that\u2019d be it. Ye Ji. How many articles were there that you came in 6th at the Tchaikovsky Competition? Was it about 100?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what do you mean 100?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the direction was suddenly changed to her, Han Ye Ji was taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Hwang. Why are you being like that to Ye Ji? Stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin knew why Hwang Suk Min is so excited, but she did not want to discuss it anymore.</p><br/><p>Hwang Suk Min\u2019s indignation is not because of the press or broadcasting stations. When Professor Jeon Hye Jin heard of Jun Hyuk\u2019s return to Korea, she thought that she must put him on stage in Korea since they do not know when he might come back.</p><br/><p>She quietly sounded her thoughts to various people, saying that he should leave something behind in Korea with this opportunity. She made requests to leading symphonies in the country because she thought it would be best for him to conduct, but they were apathetic. They regretfully refused, saying that it would be difficult to change their schedules.</p><br/><p>Behind these refusals, it must also be a big part that Jun Hyuk does not have a link to the Korean classical world. It would have been possible to overcome these issues if the press had pushed for Jun Hyuk as a national hero, but even this was impossible because Jun Hyuk had built a wall against the press.</p><br/><p>And Amelia was right. To the greats in Korea, Jun Hyuk has nothing in common with them and he is just a rookie who only released 1 song of a new contemporary music format.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun spoke up in order to get rid of the awkward energy,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere there. We\u2019re grateful that you care so much, but Jun Hyuk came to rest. Right now is perfect. And\u2026 Ye Ji.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the heavy atmosphere, Han Ye Ji was startled when Yoon Kwang Hun suddenly called out her name.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Why are you surprised? Ha ha. It\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just that I\u2019d like to hear you play the piano. Would it be okay? Korea\u2019s new star pianist is visiting my cafe and I can\u2019t just let you go back. I do often hear that I\u2019m a fanatic of classical music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>It was already such a heavy atmosphere, so she was taken aback by Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s sudden request.</p><br/><p>\u201cHo ho. Isn\u2019t the audience too scary? Your teacher, 2 maestros, and Mr. Yoon who raised a genius? You\u2019ll have to do well. Even if you make a slight miss, everyone will figure it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The playful Professor Jeon Hye Jin added this in.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust play comfortably for us. I haven\u2019t heard it yet, but really want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once even Jun Hyuk was chiming in, she could not refuse and sat in front of the piano.</p><br/><p>She closed her eyes for a second to choose a song, and then put her hands on the piano. The song she chose is Rondo Alla Turca.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

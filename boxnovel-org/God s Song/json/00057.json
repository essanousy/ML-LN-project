They had been surprised at the 10 seconds shown of Jun Hyuk on the drums, but this was the kid that Jo Hyung Joong had raved about. Everyone wanted to see how impressive he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, he doesn\u2019t need a metronome?\u201d</p><br/><p>The engineer preparing to record saw that Jun Hyuk did not have an earphone in his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave him. He\u2019ll be able to play one song on beat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong signaled to Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, you can start since everything is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk started to swing the drumsticks with force. Everyone focused on the performance, but it was not the drum they had expected. It was a plain drum, maintaining a very simple beat.</p><br/><p>The only thing unusual about it was that this simple drumming went on for 8 minutes.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk finished his performance and came out of the booth, the sound engineer and Jo Hyung Joong had puzzled expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it too monotonous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Uh\u2026 No. It was really breezy. It\u2019s good. But Jun Hyuk, 8 minutes is too long. It\u2019s a song to perform. No matter how famous the song is, there isn\u2019t an audience willing to hear 8 minutes of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 12 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe whole thing is 12 minutes. In the middle, there are going to be two points without the drums and just the bass and guitar\u2026 I held those places in the middle of the drum.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had not even realized that he held spots in the performance because he kept repeating the same simple rhythm. But 12 minutes?</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, it\u2019s too long anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen listen to the whole thing and shorten it for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk went back into the booth and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bass goes first\u2026 the guitar is second, first, I\u2019ll play them like this twice.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bass and second guitar were also plain. The bass did have a funky rhythm, but there was none of the grandeur shown on the piano.</p><br/><p>The last performance started. The performance beginning in glissando (holding strings down with left string while transferring a sound as if sliding) excited everyone watching.</p><br/><p>It was fast and magnificent. He played so quickly that the right hand picking the guitar was almost invisible, and the left hand was pressing and pulling the stainless steel strings freely as though they were rubber bands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs\u2026 Is he really 17 years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 thought so. How old was he when he first picked up a guitar pick?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had said that the instruments he knew how to play were the guitar, drum, and piano. He started with music 2 years ago. Just from his performance skills, this was impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this is what a performance is. That kid really is impressive. How can he do it in one go without a single mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJo Hyung Joong spoke after seeing the recording studio staff who could not stop admiring Jun Hyuk\u2019s performance,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard that as a perfect performance without any mistakes?</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe made a few mistakes. He\u2019s just passing the minor mistakes. It\u2019s fine as long as it has the effect he wants. That kid\u2019s not an amateur. Amateurs only have the thought that they can\u2019t make mistakes whether they\u2019re singing or playing an instrument.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong shared an episode from his past,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve recorded Kwang Suk before. Listening to this, I\u2019m thinking of Kwang Suk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about Kim Kwang Suk who passed away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. That was when he performed in Daehak-ro everyday. He was recording his new song holding an acoustic guitar and his voice was cracking. We still couldn\u2019t stop the recording. Even that cracking voice made us ecstatic. Music is like that. If it\u2019s full of atmosphere and that atmosphere comes out, it\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s satisfied expression did not go away.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk came out of the booth after completing all of the pieces, Jo Hyung Joong applauded him sincerely. He had been a musician for over 20 years. Though he heard the drum, bass, and guitar parts separately, he already heard them as a complete song in his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you start learning to play instruments? It\u2019s as if you were born holding a guitar pick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been about 2 years. There\u2019s a practice room in the basement of the cafe I work at.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You really practiced for 2 years and you can play like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had confirmed again. Talent ignored the laws of time.</p><br/><p>The sound engineer let Jo Hyung Joong and Jun Hyuk know that the song had been put together,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, the track is complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? That was quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe track lengths were exact, so there wasn\u2019t much work for me to do separately.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he pressed the play button, turbulent metal music filled the recording studio for 12 minutes. The guitar pumped intensely, the drum filled the emptiness, and the bass picked up the melody, creating a perfect harmony.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk spoke when the music was over. Jo Hyung Joong was the first professional Jun Hyuk was working with since he had learned music. He wanted to know what an expert thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, there are no flaws to point out except for one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too long. You have to perform this heavy rock song for various audiences. Heavy metal, an instrumental without lyrics, length of 12 minutes. There aren\u2019t many people willing to accept all three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 Then will you arrange it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? Ha ha ha,\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong laughed cheerfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that because to me, it\u2019s music without any flaws. I must not change it and I don\u2019t have the ability to change it. You have to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I don\u2019t want to take out a single note.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong had more advice to give, but saved his words. Jun Hyuk\u2019s version of Kanon was a song that unleashed the desire to show off. He must have had this thought while watching the countless electric guitar versions of Kanon on YouTube.</p><br/><p>I play a lot better. If there is someone who has mastered all existing guitar techniques better than I have, come out. It was a performance that gave off this vibe. In this way, it became long for no reason because he needed to show all of the techniques he had.</p><br/><p>However, this useless boasting would automatically disappear if the song was shortened to 4 minutes. They needed to take out all unnecessary parts in order to really get the essence of Pachelbel.</p><br/><p>He pushed a Jun Hyuk, brooding in thought as though already thinking of new arrangement, back into the recording booth,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we hear the version with the three guitars?\u201d</p><br/><p>The version where the violin melody from the original song was changed to guitars was completely different. He recorded the slow bass rhythm and calm acoustic guitar without a drum first. When it was difficult to predict what form the complete song would take, Jo Hyung Joong questioned Jun Hyuk as he prepared to record the last melody,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? I\u2019m setting the guitar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you doing two?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to play them together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTogether? You\u2019re going to play two at the same time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, because the performance is important.\u201d</p><br/><p>It could not be? Jo Hyung Joong thought of one guitarist,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to perform in Stanley Jordan\u2019s method?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stanley Jordan.</p><br/><p>He was an American guitarist who was able to play both the lead and rhythm guitars using both hands in methods like tapping and slapping. He could play the treble and bass at the same time in a twin melody.</p><br/><p>Like Stanley Jordan, Jun Hyuk put one guitar around his shoulders and one on the stand.</p><br/><p>The same melody of 8 bars flowed from the two guitars. This was Kanon itself. Kanon was a chorus where the the first part was sung followed by the chorus while leaving a certain measure in between. Jun Hyuk imitated the leading melody while playing in a format with successive chords in a temporal flow.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s two hands moved elegantly over the two guitars as though there were two people performing.</p><br/><p>After hearing both versions of Kanon, Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s instinct as a producer tingled. He did not know how long Jun Hyuk would survive on the program, but he wanted to put Jun Hyuk\u2019s songs together to make an album.</p><br/><p>He had already created four songs. Finkl\u2019s song NOW in jazz on the piano, the two versions of Kanon, and Shin Hae Chul\u2019s From the Sun to the Boy.</p><br/><p>There was no reason to gather only the songs from the broadcast. This was a child who had the talent to continue creating music.</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s phone rang as he was excited with this expectation,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Producer Kim. Why are you calling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Hi. I just wanted to see if the work was going well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s no problem. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Is Jun Hyuk working on the mission song?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a lot to think about because all three songs are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Excuse me? What do you mean there are three songs?</p><br/><p>He had called to check on Jun Hyuk\u2019s state, but heard something unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk arranged a classic and it\u2019s no joke. I\u2019m wondering which will be better too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 You know\u2026 we can\u2019t change that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a classic without copyrights.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Copyrights aren\u2019t the problem. There\u2019s another problem involved\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez. He\u2019s doing so well on his own. Is it a problem with the contract again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong spoke with a voice full of irritation. It was obvious that the variety show entertainment production executives and the main producer had agreed to share the profits with the agency holding the copyrights.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Don\u2019t say anything to me. I\u2019m just a wage earner. I have to do what the people higher up say.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll do the appointed song, but you have to listen to a favor me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Sure. Tell me what it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cArrange for an orchestra. We don\u2019t need a lot, just 16 people. You can\u2019t do students though. You have to get people beyond that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Why an orchestra all of a sudden? Can\u2019t you work on the MIDI operations?</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk\u2019s piano is really good and the orchestral accompaniment came out nicely. It\u2019s a waste to do as a MIDI operation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Alright. We have to do that much for you. Also\u2026 is Jun Hyuk doing well?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I was careful with him for no reason because you said stuff about him being rogue. He\u2019s a good kid and just does music. Why? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 No, it\u2019s nothing. I was just wondering.</p><br/><p>It seemed everything was still okay. Producer Kim Ki Sik kept praying that they would pass over this without any problems.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyung Joong painstakingly polished the three songs to the point where he would have no problem releasing an album with Jun Hyuk right away. For a week, Jun Hyuk forgot everything and concentrated on creating the best music.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

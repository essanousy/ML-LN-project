He needed to listen to the two people practicing with zeal in the next room.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, let\u2019s work together again tomorrow. Can you make a score for the orchestra that goes along with the piano song you just played and bring it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll write that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Then watch other people practice here. You can watch the MIDI operations you\u2019re interested in.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were not recording formal tracks. They needed to get used to their voices in the mic and practice their mission songs thoroughly.</p><br/><p>The future stars dragged home their bodies exhausted from practicing until it was night. They had just completed their schedules that were packed from 7am to 10pm. They could not even go to sleep right away. They needed to show the vocal trainer and producer something better the next day. They needed to find what they were lacking.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk sat at the desk and started writing out scores. Kwak Hye Sung watched enthralled as the notes filled the pages.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, is this classical?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s an arrangement of the orchestra that\u2019ll go in my mission song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is pretty simple\u2026 I\u2019m going to use around 16 instruments, so it\u2019s not that complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m jealous. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put his pen down and looked at Kwak Hye Sung,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you envy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour talent. Not everyone can create a song that a 16-person orchestra will play.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot everyone can sing like you sir do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling me sir again. Oy, forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not use the nominals \u2018brother, sister\u2019 that everyone in the dorms used comfortably. Older men were \u2018sir,\u2019 \u2018there\u2019 or \u2018excuse me\u2019.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk made everyone uncomfortable because it was difficult to become friendly with him, but they gradually became used to interacting with him at a distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, what good is it if my range is wide. Teacher Jo said it too, I can\u2019t bring out the emotion in the lyrics.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emotion in lyrics\u2026 Kwak Hye Sung saw Jun Hyuk smirk and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing? Is it weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you understand all of the lyrics of a pop song? Even when it\u2019s in English?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you still like the song. There are times when we become so emotional we cry even if we can\u2019t understand the lyrics. The lyrics are a problem for later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung went next to Jun Hyuk in order to hear him well while Lee Hae Jun laid on his bed pretending not to listen.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen Shawshank Redemption?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe movie? The one with Tim Robbins?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The one where he comes out with an old black man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw that. It was really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that movie, the main character turns on opera in the prison broadcast studio. The soprano duet so everyone in the prison can hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 That scene?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung remembered the scene where all of the prisoners stared at the speakers.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what that song is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMozart?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s \u2018Letter Duet\u2019 from Mozart\u2019s opera \u2018Marriage of Figaro\u2019. What did you think of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow- it was just like the movie itself. The melody\u2026 angels, freedom\u2026 that kind of feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. There\u2019s a narration by the old black man as that music comes out, \u2018That song must be about freedom. It was like birds had left their cage and flew over the prison walls, freedom\u2026\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung was taking in Jun Hyuk\u2019s every word. Even Lee Hae Jun had gotten up at some point and was sitting at the edge of his bed to listen.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut do you know what those lyrics really mean? That duet is like this; it\u2019s a scene of a countess speaking as a maid writes out the letter. That\u2019s why the title is Letter\u2019s Duet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLetter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s really nothing to the subject matter. \u2018Under the pine tree in the bush\u2019 \u2018Pine tree?\u2019 \u2018Yes pine tree\u2019 \u2018Oh, pine tree\u2019 \u2018You understand?\u2019 Stuff like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The lyrics are like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s no meaning. That\u2019s all. Something about winds from the mountains surrounding the pine tree\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thought that that beautiful song is just about a letter to meet under a pine tree. Kwak Hye Sung felt like a fantasy had come shattering down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s far from the emotions of freedom, angels, and wings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung looked bewildered but could understand what Jun Hyuk was trying to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what I\u2019m saying is to understand the sound before the lyrics. A singer is a sound. If the melody is great and that sound for that melody is good, people are bound to be impressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUse your voice? Hm\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy sing if you\u2019re going to rely on the effect of the lyrics? You would just recite a poem. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung was beginning to understand what Jun Hyuk was saying. He even thought he might have wasted his time being satisfied with his ability to hit high notes and having a wide range in the past.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at Kwak Hye Sung frowning and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, do you want me to tell you how you can get to the first stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet them with a high-pitch. Like a soprano.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSoprano?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Go between high notes and falsettos\u2026 You have to show the bass too, right? But instead of hitting the melody with the heavy tone, get that melody with a moderate tone and a wide range.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Kwak Hye Sung, it did not seem like this advice would be helpful,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew\u2026 Do you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone is going to think that your sound is like a big iron rod. But it would be as if you are jabbing at people with the tip of a sharp fencing epee. They\u2019ll be impressed and they\u2019ll be seeing a different side of you. I\u2019m pretty sure the judges will be surprised too. Then the game\u2019s over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t do what you said. I\u2019m not good with the high-pitch notes and falsetto.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of time left. And you have a really good vocal trainer, Ryu Sun Hee. Anyway, that\u2019s all for my opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk turned his chair and picked up the pen on the desk again.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Jun Hyuk. Who do you think is the best?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun who had only been listening to Jun Hyuk and Kwak Hye Sung\u2019s conversation had approached them and spoke carefully.</p><br/><p>They had not spoken since they got here and Lee Hae Jun had addressed him for the first time. But he was using informal speech.</p><br/><p>He did not know how old Lee Hae Jun was but they looked to be the same age, so he thinking of throwing a punch at first calmed down when he thought of his boss\u2019 warning.</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun thought that Jun Hyuk was not responding because he was thinking of his response.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. If we\u2019re looking at singing skills alone, Jessie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Jessica?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. But that girl with the braces\u2026 Who is she?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJang Na Rae?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. She improves so quickly I think she\u2019ll be the winner in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJang Na Rae improves quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung stepped in because he was surprised by Jun Hyuk\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe improves a lot every day during the vocal lessons. And her tone becomes more and more polished with vocal tuning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The unexpected Jang Na Rae would grow ominously. That meant there was another strong competitor. It was not something that Lee Hae Jun had wanted to hear,</p><br/><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t get that good in a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it one month? It\u2019s one month until the main starts, but an additional six weeks until the last round. She\u2019ll grow even more during that period since she\u2019ll be experiencing the real stage. And she\u2019s learning from a producer right now. If they go against each other today, Jessica will win, but in two months, Jessica can\u2019t keep up with braces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Hae Jun had not thought of the real live stage. Could Jang Na Rae beat Jessica in a matter of two months? They could not know whether Jun Hyuk\u2019s prediction would be right or wrong. What does this kid who even the judges call a genius think of him? Lee Hae Jun was becoming curious.</p><br/><p>He spoke again carefully,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you do think of me?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

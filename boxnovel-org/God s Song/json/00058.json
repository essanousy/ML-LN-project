What are you talking about?</p><br/><p>\u201cA couple of them came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik was annoyed that the legal team was bothering him with legal</p><br/><p>matters when he had spent two sleepless days sitting on the cutting room sofa.</p><br/><p>The company written on the business card the lawyer handed over was Peace Law</p><br/><p>Firm. Lawyer Baek Seung Ho. Producer Kim Ki Sik felt that something was going wrong.</p><br/><p>When looking at the number of lawyers and fees of Korea\u2019s countless law firms, it was</p><br/><p>a giant firm ranked in 1st or 2nd place. And each business card being handed over said lawyer.</p><br/><p>What could be happening that three of them came looking for him while flaunting their prestige?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are lawyers of such a big law firm looking for the producer of an entertainment</p><br/><p>program?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just here about some issues regarding Yoon Kwang Hun. Excuse our</p><br/><p>intrusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoon Kwang Hun? Oh, the owner of the cafe where Jun Hyuk worked?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I am his attorney.\u201d</p><br/><p>An owner of a small cafe in Misari appointed a lawyer from Korea\u2019s best law firm as</p><br/><p>his attorney? Producer Kim became even more confused,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re here to talk about the articles going around the internet, you\u2019ve come to the</p><br/><p>wrong place. If you want to file a lawsuit, you have to go to the press offices.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. It\u2019s not that bad. Aren\u2019t I a lawyer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a couple things to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s end this quickly since I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sure. When you sent out the press release, did you release information about Jun</p><br/><p>Hyuk as well? That he didn\u2019t get any wages for the past 2 years, that Yoon Kwang Hun acquired</p><br/><p>guardianship of him after he appeared on the program and right before they signed the contract\u2026</p><br/><p>Information like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was positive these lawyers had come to the broadcasting station to look for the</p><br/><p>people who spread the rumors first. He broke out in a cold sweat,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. You have to confirm that with the public relations team. The production</p><br/><p>team doesn\u2019t deal with that kind of stuff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I just met with the manager of the public relations team and he said that there</p><br/><p>was a request not to release any information on Jun Hyuk. We came here knowing it\u2019s a pardon</p><br/><p>because we wanted to see if there was a special reason for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, we did request that. We did not want to create news with such provocative</p><br/><p>articles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik wanted to run away to the legal team immediately, but he could</p><br/><p>not show the slightest sign of this. The lawyer\u2019s eyes were watching him and taking note of his</p><br/><p>complexion like a wild beast seeking its prey.</p><br/><p>Lawyer Baek Seung Ho already knew that the sweat building on Producer Kim Ki</p><br/><p>Sik\u2019s forehead was not because of the heat.</p><br/><p>The person whose secret has been revealed has already lost the fight. Baek Seung Ho</p><br/><p>spoke with more vigor than Jun Hyuk swung his drumsticks in order to wave his flag of victory,</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then one more thing. Is is true that only this broadcasting station knew about</p><br/><p>the \u2018facts\u2019 regarding Yoon Kwang Hun and Jun Hyuk\u2019s relationship? Jun Hyuk did a lot of</p><br/><p>interviews about his past. However, many articles came up just two or three hours after the</p><br/><p>program aired. There was even information that they could never know just by watching the</p><br/><p>broadcast. What do you think happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask the press offices. How would I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>His anger was proof that he was frustrated. Baek Seung Ho was certain that this main</p><br/><p>producer may not be the culprit of the media show, but was an accomplice at the least.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon the inconvenience. We just asked to check. So the broadcasting station never</p><br/><p>leaked information to the press office. We will keep this in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me. Did the cafe owner appoint you as his lawyer?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was checking a question he did not need to ask. He must not want to believe that</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun had a relationship with such an influential law firm like Peace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s like an older brother to me, so I said that I would take this case first. And as</p><br/><p>you can see, our law firm is treating this as a very important case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho was highlighting that the three lawyers were working together.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot condone the spreading of such vicious false rumors. We intend to give</p><br/><p>legal penalties even to people who leave malicious comments online.\u201d</p><br/><p>He made his point concrete to Producer Kim Ki Sik who was already at a loss for</p><br/><p>words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. We forgot the most important aspect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho pulled a thin manila folder out of his bag and handed it over,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a warrant. I\u2019m Yoon Kwang Hun and Jun Hyuk\u2019s counsel. Going forward,</p><br/><p>Peace Law Firm will review everything related to their contracts.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Producer Kim Ki Sik accepted the documents, Baek Seung Ho gave him a friendly</p><br/><p>smile. He was certain that he could make the last, decisive move,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s something we would like to propose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPropose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We would like to modify the contract between Jang Jung Hyuk and MV</p><br/><p>channel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cModify the contract? What nonsense! Both sides have already signed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it not already a much more generous contract compared to the other contestants\u2019?</p><br/><p>To modify that? It could not be done.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, Producer. Isn\u2019t that why I\u2019m proposing that we change it? Don\u2019t be so</p><br/><p>antagonistic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you know, hasn\u2019t Jun Hyuk been the hottest issue for the past 3 weeks? The</p><br/><p>viewer ratings for \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019 has increased greatly because of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you look at the contract, the revenue was structured so 40% went to the publisher,</p><br/><p>40% to the track producer, and the remaining 20% was split between the composer, lyricist,</p><br/><p>arranger, performer, and singer. But doesn\u2019t this structure make it so that MV channel takes 80%</p><br/><p>as the publisher and producer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not the only ones who do that. That\u2019s the standard in Korea\u2019s music industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I understand. Since publishers are created on idol standards these days, it costs a</p><br/><p>lot to produce music. To train idols, you need to buy the song, call in the session men to play the</p><br/><p>music, and find a producer\u2026 It\u2019s expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lawyer knows a lot about such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did a bit of research. Ha ha. Anyway, I heard that Jun Hyuk writes his own songs,</p><br/><p>performs, and produces his own accompaniments. He\u2019s doing everything on his own. If we</p><br/><p>calculate the production costs, isn\u2019t it just the recording fee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right? Are you asking to receive the producing profits?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou catch on quickly. We need to receive 15% of the production 40%. We were</p><br/><p>going to demand half but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis man! Are you crazy? Let\u2019s end this if you\u2019re going to keep talking nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik stood up from his seat while huffing in anger. This is a proposal</p><br/><p>that would be hard to accept even if it were for a legend like Jo Yong Pil. No matter how much</p><br/><p>traction Jun Hyuk brought in viewer ratings, how dare they try to claim the production profits.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we will admit Jun Hyuk to the hospital tomorrow. He will need to stay for one</p><br/><p>or two months of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho\u2019s low but clear voice stuck in Producer Kim Ki Sik\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think so? The man who might as well be his biological parent has been</p><br/><p>beaten up for the past three weeks as Korea\u2019s greatest villain. Don\u2019t you think his shock would</p><br/><p>be unimaginable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik could not help but sit back in his seat. The hospital. Even if they</p><br/><p>put the bustling media second, they would need to completely edit Jun Hyuk out of the broadcast</p><br/><p>airing in three days. The biggest issue was that all of the previews they had aired of Jun Hyuk</p><br/><p>whenever they had the chance to would all go to waste if he did not appear on the live broadcast</p><br/><p>stage.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had created an overwhelming fan base of women in their teens and 20s</p><br/><p>because of his good looks. Furthermore, his dramatic 17 year life built a compassion that</p><br/><p>gathered even people in their 40s to the TV.</p><br/><p>With such high expectations for Jun Hyuk, half of these viewers would disappear if he</p><br/><p>were to exit the competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you hear it as a threat? If you listen to the rest of my words, you will come to</p><br/><p>understand that it\u2019s a proposal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho knew well that the proposal would not stick with just a threat. In order</p><br/><p>to get something, something needed to give.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well. Let\u2019s hear the rest; see how far you take this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStar Week recording goes out again in three days, right? We will hold a press</p><br/><p>conference that day. It\u2019ll be a joint press conference for Jun Hyuk and Yoon Kwang Hun. It\u2019s</p><br/><p>going to end very warmly. Then the media will be abuzz\u2026 and that\u2019ll affect viewer ratings</p><br/><p>directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho took out a presentation and passed them over,</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look. We have organized the interview contents. You\u2019ll know by reading</p><br/><p>through it, but the questions are killer. I guarantee viewer ratings will surpass 10% no matter</p><br/><p>what.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Producer Kim Ki Sik who skimmed over the documents in front of him, Baek</p><br/><p>Seung Ho went over more of the proposal,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd every week on the day of the broadcast, we at Peace are going to release our</p><br/><p>work one by one. The lawsuit against the press office, lawsuit against the malicious commenters,</p><br/><p>et cetera. We\u2019ll make it first place in real-time searches every week. It won\u2019t be a damaging</p><br/><p>agreement to the broadcasting station in any way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if we say no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Jun Hyuk will be admitted to the hospital. It\u2019s an end to his</p><br/><p>activities. Then track revenues will disappear entirely. All you\u2019ll have are one or two songs from</p><br/><p>Star Week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe contract says that he can\u2019t refuse appearing on the broadcast until he\u2019s</p><br/><p>eliminated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can a child who passed out from mental shock appear on broadcast? This is a</p><br/><p>force majeure. There isn\u2019t a single judge in Korea who will send a child hospitalized after</p><br/><p>fainting to a stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>The actress who lays in a hospital bed to avoid a breach of contract. It was a common</p><br/><p>scenario. It was common because this method worked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if you refuse my proposal, we won\u2019t start this lawsuit that the media will be so</p><br/><p>interested in until after \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019 is over. Our Peace Law Firm has no intention of</p><br/><p>helping you with your viewer ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>This meant he was going to make everyone forget about Jun Hyuk during the</p><br/><p>broadcasting period.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re busy, so we\u2019ll get up now. Think about it and give us a call by</p><br/><p>tomorrow morning. If you don\u2019t call us by tomorrow morning, Jun Hyuk will be admitted to the</p><br/><p>hospital. Then, good day to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho left the conference room without looking back. When the lawyers left,</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik felt numb as if a typhoon had just passed. How could this happen?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You looked better with a guitar or drums than you did with a baton.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are you here so suddenly? All the way to New York from LA?\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 men hesitated before taking out their business cards to hand to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? This\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a decision to work with the great Jun. First, know that we\u2019re not doing this because of the incredible salary. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The business card said CEO and Chief Producer. The JS Foundation affiliate record label\u2019s last selections were Alex Jenkin and Eli Gotez.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern worried that it would become a label specialized in classical music. Our Maestro is working in all areas, so he wanted us to maximize the advantages.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like it whatever the reason is. It\u2019s uncomfortable for me to work with people I meet for the first time, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Then are you saying that your familiarity with us is more important than our qualifications?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQualifications are important to someone like Isaac. I like people I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded like a joke, but the 2 men had nothing to say. He is right. There is no reason to be concerned with ability when he is able to handle all processes of producing a record.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I needed help with organization so you came at exactly the right time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrganization? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk pulled files saved on the studio server up on the monitor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is music I\u2019ve been creating. I left the ones that need orchestration accompaniment separate. They\u2019re complete other than those, so look at all of them and let me know what you think I should do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? Sing? Did you sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Jenkin pointed to a folder titled \u2018Sing\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I played the singing part on the piano. The song can be sung according to that melody. They need work on lyrics, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eli Gotez checked the number of folders and his jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201c64? I\u2019m sure this means there\u2019s a total of 64 songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I just made them as I thought of them, so I haven\u2019t configured albums yet. You two can classify these songs, make them into album units, and bring on singers who fit them.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this many songs, they can make at least 7 albums. They heard that he had already created 4 albums\u2026 They could not even imagine how he was handling this incredible workload.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? You should hurry up and get started.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Call in the record label employees if you need to as well. You think Isaac is giving you a huge salary for nothing? This is a place where you need to get to work no matter what, starting on the first day. I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019re making, but you\u2019re on the losing side.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Mr. Yoon. We brought him on as JS Foundation\u2019s Chairman. And these are the people on the Board of Directors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun met the 4 people who would be directing the foundation with President Stern. They are well achieved in their respective areas and they have worked to create a better world than they have for their own wealth and glory.</p><br/><p>As the 4 directors enjoyed the restaurant\u2019s steak and wine, they passionately debated the business JS Foundation would need to focus on going forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cMalaria is a bigger problem than AIDS in Africa. AIDS just gets more attention because it has spread to western society, but the death rate from malaria is actually overwhelming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying we need to figure out the drinking water problem. Water is directly connected to hygiene. Since pipes are impossible, the best resolution for now are wells.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to work on the expansion of medical staff as well. How long are we going to rely on volunteer work for? They need a salary at least to support their families. Even with just that, there will be more people applying to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the directors were discussing the business that took priority to each of them, Yoon Kwang Hun said nothing, eating his steak and drinking his wine.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun finished eating, wiped his mouth, and turned to President Stern to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern. But are you sure these people are the foundation\u2019s executives?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The chatty 4 people also stopped talking at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s obvious provocation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrdinary businesses all think about how they can make money. On the other hand, foundations like us think about how to spend money. But isn\u2019t it strange? A foundation isn\u2019t a bank, so doesn\u2019t someone need to make that money? Does that money fall from the sky?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha. It seems the Chairman doesn\u2019t know JS Foundation\u2019s structure yet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the directors laughed and spoke, but he was unable to finish his sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I know it well. Mr. Stern and Jun put up the base funding and aren\u2019t we operating on that money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Maestro Jun promised to donate a lot of money every year. In addition, a large portion of profits from the foundation\u2019s affiliated businesses will come in as funds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha, so you\u2019re saying that we don\u2019t need to worry about making money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yono Kwang Hun snapped his fingers and spoke as though he just realized it, making the 4 directors\u2019 faces brighten. President Stern\u2019s stony face however, did not relax. Isn\u2019t this all what Yoon Kwang Hun already knows?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask again. If we don\u2019t need to worry about money, aren\u2019t executives unnecessary? The business team brainstorms and plans out how to use money. Then are the 4 directors here and I just in our positions to give approval? Our salaries seem to be pretty big.\u201d</p><br/><p>None of the directors could respond. It is a reproach about whether they are going to be in their positions without working.</p><br/><p>\u201cListening to you all today, it seems you would fit better on the business team than as directors. You\u2019re full of thoughts on how to use the money in a better way for better causes\u2026 There is no one more eligible for the foundation\u2019s business team.\u201d</p><br/><p>The directors\u2019 faces flushed. They worked on the business teams of various foundations until now. They are people who have cried with starving people in barren lands and people suffering from diseases. And they know too what the role of a foundation\u2019s director is.</p><br/><p>\u201cA foundation\u2019s director needs to bring in money from outside or become an investor, one or the other. That means this needs to be a person who makes money. Isn\u2019t this the most basic concept?\u201d</p><br/><p>One person who could no longer bear to listen to Yoon Kwang Hun say the obvious, laughed and spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Yoon, but to my understanding, you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t fit into either category either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not something you should be concerned with. The Chairman is appointed by the investor, and Mr. Stern who invested in this foundation appointed me. I just evaluate the directors as the Chairman. I can assess you four, but no one here other than he can assess me. Are you now thinking of overstepping your authority?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s voice had gotten a little higher and it pricked their consciences.</p><br/><p>They thought that he had put in the Chairman position solely because he is Jun Hyuk\u2019s father. And President Stern committed him as someone who would check the flow of funds completely.</p><br/><p>Looking at it now however, isn\u2019t he saying that he will completely play the role of Chairman? The 4 directors kept their mouths shut at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s firm tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get up since it seems like we\u2019re done eating. And I hope you\u2019ll think about it deeply. Whether you\u2019re going to fulfill all of your responsibilities as directors, or if you\u2019ll work on the business team. I\u2019ll hear that response tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun looked at the 4 people without moving, and they slowly got up to leave.</p><br/><p>President Stern had been watching them without saying a word, and let out a low breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cI misjudged you, Mr. Yoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you a little while ago? The person who can assess me is you as an investor. You can fire me whenever you want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I thought you were just a sleeping bull but now that you\u2019ve come out of the pen, I didn\u2019t realize that you were a savage beast. Ho ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall I go back into the pen?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite a happy old man. I got something wrong, but that was a treasure chest. Now not only the son, but the father will get involved to surprise me, so could there be a more joyful ending period to my life? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern laughed for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut those 4 people are people we need. Meet with them again.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yoon Kwang Hun lightly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern. A foundation doesn\u2019t need to scout talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? What does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSocial activists look for places where they can act on their ideals. If their ideals are different, they don\u2019t move even for money. If they move with money, they are already salarymen and not activists. We don\u2019t need salarymen. If our foundation\u2019s ideals are high, the talent will automatically come to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The relaxed cafe owner did not show in this Yoon Kwang Hun, full of confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s push back organizing the board. We don\u2019t even know if rich people who are synchronized with our intents will demand director titles once the foundation is formally launched. Let\u2019s leave the positions empty for them and wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yoon, it looks like you\u2019re not going to move in the way I talked about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to move exactly the way you talked about. I\u2019m not going to burden Jun, and the foundation needs to use its own power to create business. I\u2019m going to push that to the limit, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does the limit mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoney always needs to be lacking for the business started. That way, we\u2019ll do our best to raise the necessary funding and the staff will make more effort to save on expenses. A rich life makes everyone lazy. And laziness will bring the foundation to collapse.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern\u2019s jaw dropped. He did not know that he would ever hear this lazy man say such a thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich is the real you? Cafe owner? Or the foundation chairman who\u2019s saying all of this incredible stuff right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs any person just one thing? They\u2019re both the same person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun drank the rest of his wine and smiled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

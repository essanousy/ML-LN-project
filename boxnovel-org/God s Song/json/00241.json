He occasionally sniggered as he watched Alvin Lee on talk shows, but all he thought about was Inferno.</p><br/><p>While he worked on revisions, he had a vague idea of why there were no traces of modifications from Mozart in the score. It is not difficult to write the song that fills his head in one go. And even if the song that was written like that is flawed, it was already a completed score. Everything needs to be reconfigured in order to fix one drawback.</p><br/><p>This is his first attempt at revisions, and it is incomparably harder than writing a new song. He still had not finished the 1st part after an entire month, and his head was full of complicated thoughts.</p><br/><p>When he had thrown his pen multiple times and progress was crawling forward, an unexpected person came looking for Jun.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, did you not get a call? The edited movie is being sent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Louis O\u2019Connell scratched his head when he saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no one told me. I thought it would come by mail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that. We need to watch it together so I can tell you my thoughts as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louis O\u2019Connell had a bottle of wine and a blu-ray title in his hands and was fittingly drunk for a director in the last stage of work.</p><br/><p>The two of them sipped wine and started watching the movie together.</p><br/><p>When the opening title came on the screen, Louis O\u2019Connell held the remote control in his hand and started explaining the movie by taking turns pressing the pause and play buttons.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is where the music needs to start coming out. The overall tone is gray, right? It starts out a bit dismally.\u201d</p><br/><p>The movie is called a horror thriller, but it is more like a detective story. A fierce battle of wits among the characters with money and personal history entangled to pave a double plot with murder, that brings a fight against the audience through intelligence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe music here will be lyrical, the 1st theme song\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk wanted to stop the director\u2019s incessant chattering.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about the music, and just tell me about the emotion that you wanted to convey in each scene. What do you think about talking about revisions to make after I make all of the music?\u201d</p><br/><p>They got through the movie quickly once the director\u2019s thoughts were not included. It ended without ending credits.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to add in an 8 minute ending credit. Then the entire running time will be about 126 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo 2 main theme songs can come on for the ending credits?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took the remote control from the director\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch it again. This time, I\u2019ll watch it straight through.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Jun Hyuk\u2019s warning not to talk, the two of them rewatched the movie, focusing without saying a word. When the movie was over, Jun Hyuk spoke up,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all done. I\u2019ll give you the score tomorrow, so prepare the orchestra as 2 parts. Guitar, bass\u2026 Oh, I\u2019ll record the rest, so all you have to do is prepare the orchestra.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk drank the rest of the wine in his glass on the table. He felt much better because he will be able to rest his head from his complicated thoughts on Inferno.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to record in New York if possible\u2026 If not, I guess I\u2019ll have to go to LA?\u201d</p><br/><p>Louis O\u2019Connell gulped and spoke clearly,</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean you just finished creating all of the music? Is that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Excluding the parts where you don\u2019t need music, it will come out to 98 minutes. You can listen to the theme songs for the ending credits and decide if you want to use them as soundtracks for the movie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louis O\u2019Connell\u2019s face went back and forth between surprise and amusement. Keeping the quality of the music as a second thought, he has just met the world\u2019s best music director if evaluating him on speed alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be better to record in LA. I will go back immediately and prepare the studio.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll send you the score tomorrow. Oh right. Please have the orchestra become well-acquainted with the score. I\u2019ll go to LA in 3 days, prepare so that we can record right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louis O\u2019Connell came to New York, watched his movie twice, and went back to LA. He had planned to discuss the music with Jun Hyuk as the music director for at least 2 or 3 days, but they had finished it within half a day.</p><br/><p>As soon as the film production staff and Louis O\u2019Connell received the heap of scores that Jun Hyuk sent via e-mail, they ran to the LA Pops Orchestra. Louis O\u2019Connell does not know how to read music and the curiosity over Jun Hyuk\u2019s music was driving him mad.</p><br/><p>The art director of the LA Pops Orchestra stared at the score for a long time. His only question told Louis O\u2019Connell what the standard of the music was really like.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich of these 16 songs is the main theme song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>The art director spread the scores out and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. These 16 scores are surely theme music. It is written from No. 1 Theme to No. 16. The other 60 are imitative music.\u201d</p><br/><p>The official name of normal theme songs is program music. This program music is released as a single album with soundtracks. It is configured with the songs with the emotions that the major characters and director think symbolize the subject.</p><br/><p>Imitative music is not in the form of completed music, but is used as background music in every scene. Modern commercial movies are made up of 130 to 150 scenes, and music is needed in at least 100 scenes.</p><br/><p>Louis O\u2019Connell could not understand the art director\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it definitely No. 1?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. This is just the series number. I\u2019m saying this because there\u2019s no way to distinguish which are superior and inferior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that they\u2019re all good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Are you really saying that he created this much of such great music in just 1 day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director O\u2019Connell is a living witness to something unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there was a reason why everyone is so crazed over Maestro Jun. It\u2019s not like this is Mozart\u2026 You said he\u2019s coming the day after tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>The art director of the LA Pops Orchestra felt slight excitement. He is eager to meet the living Mozart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He requested that the orchestra know the score completely by then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Of course we\u2019ll be completely prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louis O\u2019Connell\u2019s expression however, was not just bright.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it does bother me a bit that the music is very good. Won\u2019t it stand out too much\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so as well. The music could overwhelm the film in some aspects\u2026 Oh, don\u2019t misunderstand me. I\u2019m not deprecating the movie. It\u2019s just that the songs\u2019 perfection is incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>This kind of opinion means that Director O\u2019Connell\u2019s worries are not severe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than having plain music. Let\u2019s think about it positively.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It felt like California\u2019s warm weather was helping melt Jun Hyuk\u2019s uncomfortable heart a little.Tara had been on vacation when she got a call from Jun Hyuk and quickly flew to LA.</p><br/><p>When she met Jun Hyuk in the LA airport, he looked different from the way he had a month ago. His always smiling face was gone and he was now expressionless, only giving her a formal welcome.</p><br/><p>This is not very different from the way he looked right after the New York Philharmonic\u2019s concert.</p><br/><p>Even inside the car from the airport to the studio, Jun Hyuk looked out the window and barely opened his mouth. The car went through LA in an awkward silence. Director O\u2019Connell, film production executives, and the orchestra members were all waiting for Jun Hyuk in a large recording studio.</p><br/><p>After making introductions, they were going to chat over tea, but Jun Hyuk shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a fairly large workload. It might take a few days, so let\u2019s hurry up and start.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the opportunity to cautiously check while comfortably drinking coffee disappeared, Louis O\u2019Connell looked impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Maestro. The theme song is too good. Do you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk frowned slightly and cut Director O\u2019Connell off.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector. I know what you\u2019re worrying about. But didn\u2019t you agree as well? Film music needs to be good to listen to separately, without being prominent when combined with film and supporting it. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis music does not stand out at all when combined with the film. Whew \u2013 I don\u2019t understand. Why do we have to waste time talking about this? I keep what I promise. Listen to the music once it\u2019s added to the film and if you don\u2019t like it, tell me. I\u2019ll make it again whether it\u2019s 100 or 1000 times.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was not yelling in rage, but anyone could tell that he is holding back his irritation. Tara was most surprised by this behavior. Until now, she has never seen Jun Hyuk reveal his uncomfortable thoughts externally.</p><br/><p>She had felt that Jun Hyuk had changed a little when she saw him at the airport, but this moment is when she is reaching certainty.</p><br/><p>Tara fell out of her thoughts at Jun Hyuk\u2019s following request.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen everyone except the orchestra, please leave the recording booth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone left the booth as though being chased out, and the performers looked at Jun Hyuk with expressions full of tension.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

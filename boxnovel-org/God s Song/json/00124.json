But at least you guys get your dose! :P]</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin looked at an elated Jun Hyuk and laughed lightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat business?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course a record business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I have to release your record? Did you think that if a newbie like you came to me with music, I would release an record for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk showed surprise at Alex Zakin\u2019s sharp words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a definite thing that you release a record if you like the music? I\u2019m positive it looked like you were engrossed in the music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReal business is releasing music that sells, not good music. And\u2026 someone like me can do as I feel. No matter how good your music is, there is enough good music that I can just throw your music in the garbage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s perplexed face and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha ha. But this would be a waste to throw away. And one more thing. Good music sells of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk relaxed at Alex Zakin\u2019s laughter. He had been teased. Like a newbie.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here, Jun. Can I say one thing? It could be a word of caution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put your feet in business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? What does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just do music. And find a real business partner who can sell your music for the highest price. There\u2019s no reason to act like an adult when you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><br/><p>There is a high chance that a person who tries to do business with an immature youth is a swindler posing as an adult. On that thought, Alex Zakin is a real adult.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know business either. I\u2019m just a producer. An ear that selects good music. An eye that finds good musicians. And the ability to bring out the best sound from artists. That\u2019s all I have. Business? The capable people at this company do that. All you and I have to do is talk about music. Let\u2019s leave the business to the experts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk only looked at Alex Zakin for a moment without speaking. He felt again that there are a lot of good adults in this world. No, it could be that becoming a good person meant becoming an adult.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we start talking about music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin\u2019s mood lifted when he saw that Jun Hyuk\u2019s face became brighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I think you understood me clearly. Anyway\u2026 there aren\u2019t any lyrics?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no lyrics yet. I don\u2019t speak English well enough to write lyrics. They can write the lyrics themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are the stars of these 10 songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have an idea of who they are since you listened to the songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin recalled the people he had thought of every time he listened to a song.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we change it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Do you mean you\u2019ll change the musician I had in mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex scratched his head and explained the circumstances.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s tribute targets are bands that debuted with LA Sound and led rock and roll in the 80s. The 80s was the zenith of the recording industry with a worldwide boom as its base.</p><br/><p>One hit song earned them enough money to buy a private plane. It was normal to live carelessly in a Beverly Hills mansion with dozens of dream cars on display in the garage, calling pin-up girls every day. Rock of that period was a symbol of decadence and extravagance.</p><br/><p>The leader of this period, guitarist Randy Rhoads was in the band Quiet Riot. This band\u2019s vocalist, Kevin DuBrown put their daily life into words,</p><br/><p>\u201cPop stars enjoy tennis on the weekends and drink beers as they hang out with beauties in bikinis. We hire whores and spend the entire weekend naked with sex and drugs. This is the difference between pop and rock.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most rock stars who spent their daily lives with alcohol, women, and drugs are now in a state beyond recovery.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. That is a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you like to produce these 10 songs yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the greatest reason for this work was to get to meet the stars I like\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It was selfish. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex was able to see the teenager in Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity, but the stars you like are the people 30 years ago, not the people now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019ll be the case. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk shrugged and brushed it off. He did not want to see the stars he liked in ruin either. He would just remember their fresh images on the album covers.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince your plan is ruined, what do you think about leaving the cooking to me? I\u2019ll find the artists who are most fitting for these songs instead. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do that cooking after I find a great business partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou learn fast. Good. I\u2019ll just start preparations. Hurry up and find your partner. I\u2019ve come across music that excites me for the first time in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cDid those kids go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I told them not to go out to try and meet girls and rest to be in good condition tomorrow. I let them know we\u2019re going to start recording tomorrow at 1 in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk\u2019s party left, Ili Gotez joined the staff meeting that Alex suddenly called.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. First, listen to this. There are 10 songs, so let\u2019s start the meeting after you listen to all of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin placed a CD player on the center of the table in the conference room. He put in the CD Jun Hyuk had given him, pressed play, and sat back in his chair to enjoy the music.</p><br/><p>The producers and composers gathered in the conference room did not react very differently from Alex. Music that is completely different from the trends these days. To look at it one way, they seemed to be reproducing the glory of the past, melting the magnificent performance of each part with each song\u2019s diverse themes.</p><br/><p>It was to the point where they thought that it was not even from the 80s, but from mid to late 70s, the age of the rock renaissance. The young staff were surprised by the ever-changing configurations of the songs, and the older people looked as though they were lost in nostalgia.</p><br/><p>After more than 40 minutes passed and the music ended, Alex Zakin laughed and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Reflections?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid that Korean boy bring this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin nodded to surprised Ili\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIli. That Korean boy you brought is a big shot who easily jumps over our expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid that kid come so he could show you this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty much. It seems he likes our company\u2019s records.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex spoke with a satisfied look.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what are your thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Alex Zakin spoke, the conference room became noisy. There was the question of whether it would appeal to the masses though the musicality is outstanding. There was also the contradictory stance that with such outstanding musicality, the masses would not be able to help but like it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say we put all 10 of these songs in one album. Don\u2019t you want it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The noisy conference room became quiet at Ili Gotez\u2019s input.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? I even want to buy this original with the piano.\u201d</p><br/><p>The result of the meeting came out with Alex\u2019s words. He has the Midas touch that creates mega hits. He wants to create an album with all 10 songs, not just choose one out of the 10 to work with.</p><br/><p>There would not be a song that tops the Billboard singles chart, but it meant that it has the potential to reach the top of the albums chart.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you sign a contract for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I decided to wait until Jun finds a proper representative. In that time, we need to find the owners of this music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili had the best expression in the conference room. There was a reward for having endured the cold in New York. A golden calf had walked in on its own.</p><br/><p>\u201cIli, you take over Coline\u2019s recording tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Isn\u2019t the arranging already all done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yea it was. I heard everything in the studio earlier and there was nothing to touch with the songs. I think we can just get out the sound perfectly. But what about the Korean boy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think we need to give him a small gift when he brought music like this to us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff in the conference room just stared blankly at their laughing boss.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As Jang Jun Hyuk walked in, all eyes turned to him. The female candidates\u2019 wonder and male candidates\u2019 jealousy could all be felt at once.</p><br/><p>The attention paid to Jun Hyuk only lasted a moment, and everyone went back to practicing for the audition.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk plopped down on an empty chair and started tuning his acoustic guitar. Once he was finished tuning the guitar, he had nothing left to do. Naturally, the sounds nearby came into his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with that bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell by looking at him? Some entertainment agency sent him. He must be a member of some idol group preparing to debut. They just sent out the best looking kid to gain attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk heard the two teenagers complaining because of the song they had just been singing.</p><br/><p>It seemed like a self-written song. Jun Hyuk heard the rap for the first time and because the beat was alive, his ears had tuned to it.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put a finger on his guitar, and started playing the rap he just heard very quietly. No one paid him any attention because it was a simple rhythm, but the two boys reacted differently.</p><br/><p>They were astonished that this annoying kid was playing their original song on his guitar.</p><br/><p>The simple melody and rhythm went on for about 2 minutes and when they could no longer hear it, the two boys\u2019 expressions changed from surprise to embarrassment. It had clearly sounded like their song, but the second half of the song was completely different.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy chance, is the song you just played on the guitar our song?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two approached Jun Hyuk to check and he nodded nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seemed a little different\u2026 was it not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this better? I changed it a little because it sounded a bit flat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. You\u2019re right. It sounded way better\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk chuckled at the two boys stuttering in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we ask you to play that again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two rappers asked cautiously and Jun Hyuk held his guitar again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe beat is too fast. I lowered the BPM to 130, so try to match that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk played the guitar with a percussion rhythm and the two rappers matched it, murmuring.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk stopped playing all of a sudden and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much time, so just do it as if this were the real evaluation.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the music started again, the two boys rapped freely. After repeating it two, then three times, they fully memorized the beat and could not stop smiling at Jun Hyuk, forgetting that they had been complaining about him.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me\u2026 Would we be able to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After the two rappers learned the beat Jun Hyuk altered for them, they had trouble speaking and hesitated. Jun Hyuk saw this and smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. If you like this, you can use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>They bowed to Jun Hyuk and hurried off.</p><br/><p>The person who was most surprised was not the rapper, but the VJ in charge of Jun Hyuk. The general producer had given him a special order to stick to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>He took his camera and ran to Producer Kim Ki Sik.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, Producer. Will you take a look at this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim saw the tape and moaned with delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! This kid is a total catch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? This is\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s no joke on the guitar. That rhythm\u2026 You\u2019re saying he heard those rappers practicing for a moment and made this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I couldn\u2019t even really hear those rappers practicing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The regret he felt when he saw the guitar instead of the piano had already disappeared. He only just remembered Jun Hyuk\u2019s improvisation skill on the piano as it had been shrouded by his handsome face. This boy might be beyond his imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you see something good like this while you\u2019re filming, come show me right away as you did now. We need to get interviews.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik ran to the judges\u2019 waiting room with the videos of Jun Hyuk playing the piano at the cafe and the clip he just saw. Lee Sung Chul (who was recognized as the best vocalist in Korea, a former girl group member (who had be a popularity zenith about 10 years ago), and a successful composer (who would not be recognized by the average person) were chatting in the waiting room.</p><br/><p>Immediately after they watched the tape that Producer Kim showed them, the composer snapped his fingers and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe learned classical music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClassical?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you can tell by his hands. All 10 fingers are stuck to the keyboard. This is difficult without training. He has for sure received lessons to fix his bad habits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim handed over a couple sheets of paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is this kid\u2019s story. He\u2019s only 17 years old and it\u2019s as though he\u2019s filmed a full-blown soap opera.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul looked over Jun Hyuk\u2019s whole story and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why this song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, he can\u2019t sing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul threw the paper he was holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s the end. What is he going to do without singing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we were just thinking of taking him to Star Week. And from the guitar he brought with him, it seems like he might be thinking of singing an easy song\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? You\u2019re asking us to give him leeway?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike the disdainful Lee Sung Chul, the composer showed interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable talent if he could improvise this rap after hearing it from afar\u2026 Why did this kid come out on this program? If he just studies for a few more years, he could become one of the best composers or arrangers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be a waste to hide this face in a studio. He would be able to debut as an idol singer right away with just a little preparation. Add the piano to that, and he\u2019s all set to go out on professional broadcasts. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s what he\u2019s going after?\u201d</p><br/><p>With the female singer\u2019s driving words, they settled the preliminaries.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

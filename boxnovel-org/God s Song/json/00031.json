Where are you?</p><br/><p>The familiar voice on the phone was that of the youngest writer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost at Sangam-dong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Bus? Subway?</p><br/><p>\u201cBus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Then get off at the Sangam-dong Digital Media City stop and wait there. I\u2019m going to pick you up.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk got off at the stop and looked around. He had wandered the downtown area lined with skyscrapers before, but this was the first time he had come here with somewhere to go. It was also the first time he had done something after making plans with another person. He had not known that this exciting and stirring feeling would be so great.</p><br/><p>\u201cJang Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he turned his head to see who had called his name, he saw the young writer waving to him from a car.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile, hasn\u2019t it? This is it for your bags?\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke as she looked around the backpack Jun Hyuk was wearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? What bags?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be here for a week. You didn\u2019t bring your clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought my socks and underwear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu hu. Good. You\u2019ll have to change your clothes anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young writer discussed things Jun Hyuk did not know about and drove the car into MV channel\u2019s building parking lot. She took Jun Hyuk to a personal waiting room fit for a famous singer instead of the participants\u2019 waiting room.</p><br/><p>There were already a few people waiting in the room and a rack full of clothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, he might as well be a model. A treasure like this walked in on his own? MV got really lucky. How tall is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s 186 cm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c186cm and his looks would make Jang Dong Gun and Won Bin cower. He\u2019ll look amazing on camera. Our Director really has an eye for these kinds of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Do you think you\u2019ll have clothes he\u2019ll look good in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the mannequin kills, whatever we hang on him will be fashionable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Excluding Jun Hyuk who stood there blankly, everyone fussed and carefully examined him. It was only then that the young writer started to explain the current situation to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. These people are here because of the clothing sponsorship. It\u2019s an extremely rare situation, but you\u2019re a special case. Cooperate with us on this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young writer addressed the people there for the clothing sponsorship again,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe concept is chic, rebel. Please dress him accordingly since his target will most likely be teenagers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk finally understood what was going on. It was the apparel sponsorship that Yoon Kwang Hun had told him about. It meant that they were going to give him clothes.</p><br/><p>He had to wear a t-shirt with a big XOR logo on it with tight jeans. There was even a long and thin chain hanging from the pants.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked at himself in the mirror and smiled slightly. The young writer thought that he was smiling because he liked what he saw in his reflection and laughed as she spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? You like it? Is it okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I like the chain. My boss really doesn\u2019t like these types of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOlder people usually don\u2019t. Also pick out the clothes you like from this hanger. They\u2019ll be the clothing you wear for the next week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I can pick what I want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s a sponsorship. When the shooting ends, it\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had the thought that he had done well to participate in the auditions for the first time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

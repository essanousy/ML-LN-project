Everyone listen well to see who your partner will be.\u201d</p><br/><p>The partners were revealed one by one and the luckiest in the 3rd round team selection was not one person, but four.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe next is the only band that passed the 2nd round, \u2018Steel Blade\u2019 and their partner will be\u2026 Jang Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Steel Blade members did not show it, but they were overjoyed that they had gotten one step closer to the top 10. What luck!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll reveal the mission song. It\u2019s Jewelry\u2019s Super Star.\u201d</p><br/><p>The song released in 2005 was the first that got Jewelry 1st place. It made the other participants jealous. It was established that it was advantageous to have a fun song.</p><br/><p>Once all of the partners and mission songs were revealed, everyone hid their claws and started to greet their partners.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m the vocal, Han Ki Su. Oh, don\u2019t punch me because I\u2019m not using formal speech with you. You can use informal speech too. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was uncomfortable with the band member who was acting more friendly than was necessary.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut do you know this song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mission song? Yeah. You don\u2019t know it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have CDs of idol songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s hear the song first. We\u2019ve heard it, but we don\u2019t really remember it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone listened to the MP3 player. After they listened to the whole song, the members of Steel Blade sighed in relief. It did not seem like there would be any problem changing the song into band music because the song itself was very light.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? We got lucky. It won\u2019t be hard to change it to metal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019re a producing genius. Do you have any ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>The judges\u2019 evaluation from the 5-person mission had become a hot topic between the contestants. A producing genius worthy of the highest praise. Jun Hyuk who made great music without exposing himself could make this into a heavy metal song.</p><br/><p>The band leader who was also the vocal had high expectations, but Jun Hyuk made all of those expectations come crashing down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo as you please since we\u2019ll be dropped anyway. I\u2019ll go along with whatever you want to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go to the top 10 anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s words that came from out of the blue hit his head hard, \u201cIt can\u2019t be. Do you know something? Is it already decided? Already?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know that but you guys aren\u2019t that good. You just fit in a band to broaden the assortment. There\u2019s no way you don\u2019t know you guys aren\u2019t good, is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had not anticipated that this young kid would be saying that they would be eliminated because of a shortage of talent. Even the judges had given them compliments on the original song they presented in the area preliminaries. In round 1 and 2, they had received the evaluation that they were a band with feeling.</p><br/><p>But he is saying that their skill is poor?</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk kept speaking in a sarcastic tone without paying attention to the members shaking in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sir on the drums, say something. Don\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The vocal, Han Ki Su spoke to Jun Hyuk when he suddenly sought agreement from the dummer,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right? We\u2019re not that good? Let\u2019s hear it then. You speak as the genius producer. What\u2019s so bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you force the high notes and barely hit them, the listeners are the ones who are uncomfortable. A vocalist is someone who can hit the high notes easily. \u2018Soot\u2019 catches on to it. Soot! A person who uses the voice instrument freely and well. That\u2019s what we call a vocalist but you have a hard time with the high notes and your voice itself is lacking strength\u2026 It\u2019s like you\u2019re just imitating a rock band.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! It just sounds like that because my voice is thin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Being thick and thin is an issue of tone. That has nothing to do with strength. Not all metal band vocals are Ronnie James Dio. There\u2019s Klaus Meine too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ki Su\u2019s face felt heated as the weaknesses he was aware of were being bothered.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Say that\u2019s true for me. Then the guitar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuitars aren\u2019t there just to play do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do. It\u2019s about expressiveness. Ah, you asshole.\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone was confused by the swearing that had come out of nowhere, Jun Hyuk was looking at the guitarist.</p><br/><p>\u201cExpress this with the guitar. \u2018Ah, you asshole.\u2019 Or um\u2026 \u2018Please excuse me this one time.\u2019 Something like that is okay too. Scale, technique\u2026 these things aren\u2019t important, but you don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk went over each member one by one as though he were a judge.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you play the bass all day with one beat? Without a metronome? If you can\u2019t do that, you haven\u2019t practiced enough. Or you can\u2019t keep a beat.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had not heard such severe criticism since they started performing in Hongdae. This assessment was the same as saying that they were beginners.</p><br/><p>They thought that he was going to tear the drummer apart next, but he did not.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou asked me for an idea on the arrangement, right? I already finished the edit. It\u2019s just that you guys probably won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had only heard it once. After that, he had been evaluating the band members\u2019 skills. When is he saying he finished arranging the song?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the words that he finished the arrangement, their curiosity overcame their indignation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrum instrumental. The drum is the main. Everyone else is slight and the vocal can be taken out completely. The best thing this band can do is to support the drum.\u201d</p><br/><p>The VJ marking Jun Hyuk had a vague idea of the music he was trying to pursue. This arrogant young genius only thought about music. He only focused on finding the best of any song. It was certain that he never had the intentions of becoming a star.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk does not care about things like hitting high notes as the public likes or familiarity that is easy to listen to. He only thinks about the music.</p><br/><p>Though it is an old song, it is still by a girl group. He wants to change that into a drum instrumental?</p><br/><p>When the drummer heard the words drum instrumental, he raised his hand in surprise,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. What do you mean a drum instrumental? It\u2019ll never work out. Let\u2019s just go with the usual rock. It\u2019s easy to change this song to a rock version.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk ruined the cold atmosphere that the drummer was trying to ease again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy. Now I know. Sir, you guys are in this state now because you keep giving in. The person with the most talent should have dragged everyone along. The vocal and guitarist don\u2019t know that they\u2019re not that good because you cover for their singing and guitar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eventually, the band leader and vocal left the practice room and the guitarist and bassist followed him to calm him down.</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik checked what the VJ had filmed since they were in a state where all practice was suspended, and he could not stop laughing. Jang Jun Hyuk said and acted in ways that always made news.</p><br/><p>The discord between Jang Jun Hyuk and the other participants would undoubtedly become the best in increasing tension on the program.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

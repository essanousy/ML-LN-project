The fiend who has made you all suffer through nightmares. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Patrick Quinn\u2019s playful introduction, Jun Hyuk bowed his head.</p><br/><p>It did not feel like the orchestra members were completely welcoming Jun Hyuk\u2019s presence. It is not because he is young. It is not rare for them to have visiting conductors in their twenties.</p><br/><p>Their expressions are a mix of anticipation and concern. They already know the personality of the song well. Opening the door to another type of music is worthy of receiving rave reviews. However, they seemed to already be thinking that playing the song or holding a concert is impossible. If it had been a song that was possible to play by having the composer show up, they would have put it in the concert repertoire already.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took in these looks and greeted each member.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Matthew Price, the best violinist and our bandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matthew Price took Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand and greeted him in a friendly manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Jun. Hopefully, you\u2019ll be able to take us out of this nightmare? Or are you going to completely push us into hell? Ho ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matthew Price is in his fifties with sparse white hair. Though he is not selected as a top class violinist, he is a performer who could stand on any stage as a soloist.</p><br/><p>He joked to Jun Hyuk, but more than half of it was sincere.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Isn\u2019t it just a sound? My thoughts are that you shouldn\u2019t put too much meaning to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Matthew Price did not show a particular reaction to Jun Hyuk\u2019s response. He could guess how Jun Hyuk thinks of his own music when he said, \u2018just a sound\u2019.</p><br/><p>When his first meeting with the orchestra was over, Tara approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro, let\u2019s end your meeting here since they\u2019re in the middle of rehearsal. There is another person waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk realized that they were in the middle of rehearsal.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Quinn, I interfered. Then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s fine. Anyway, let\u2019s meet in the evening again to catch up. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Maestro.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was led by Tara again to leave. Tara led him to a well presented office that did not look flashy or cheap.</p><br/><p>There is a nameplate for Board Chairman Mark Boff on the door.</p><br/><p>Board Chairman Mark Boff has been on the Board of Directors for 20 years, and he is the person who made the Boston Philharmonic into the pride of the Northeast after rival New York Philharmonic started slowing down in the 1980s. Even though he is about to be 70, he still looks healthy as he is a fan of exercise.</p><br/><p>He has a close relationship with New England Conservatory (NEC) In particular, and has made tremendous investments in music education making it easy for him to recruit high level musicians.</p><br/><p>He is one of the people who frequents the temporary orchestra \u2018Boston Pops Orchestra,\u2019 consisting of many of the orchestra members in the off-season. They do not perform heavy symphonies, but rather arrangements of music like light classic props, rock, and jazz. They also brought in a good amount of profit by participating in film music.</p><br/><p>It is not an exaggeration to say that he is the actual head of the Boston Philharmonic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Jun, we finally meet. Welcome. I heard you overturned the world and then went traveling by yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mark Boff, who looked too healthy to be 70, lightly embraced Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Chairman. Please don\u2019t use the title Maestro. Just call me Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk felt extremely awkward with everyone calling him Maestro.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026.. Maestro Jun. You\u2019ll need to start getting used to it. Starting today, more people are going to call you Maestro than they call you by your name. Until you retire I mean. And don\u2019t call me Chairman. Just call me Mark.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mark Boff asked Jun Hyuk about Salzburg and his travels, and then brought up the most important question in regards as to why he brought him here.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Do you think it\u2019ll be possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a question that Jun Hyuk could figure out without an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have nothing to tell you since it isn\u2019t something that I\u2019ve tried before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost conductors in the world have made attempts at least once, but it\u2019s a bit funny for the composer to be keeping his hands off of it. Goodness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mark Boff looked at him with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope your stay in Boston will be a comfortable one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk brought up the one condition that he had.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I am to be comfortable, I wish you wouldn\u2019t make it known that I\u2019ve come to Boston. I don\u2019t really like to have the press and reporters around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to get used to as well. Becoming famous means losing that much privacy. You can think of it as an exchange. And it\u2019s already a situation where I can\u2019t do that favor for you. Articles on the concert are going out tomorrow morning. We already sent out the press release. The news of your recruitment will also be going up on our website homepage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mark Boff shook his head indicating that there is no chance. It is also a piece of advice that it is something he cannot do anything about as long as he has stepped out into the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the reporters will come swarming to the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t go up to your room, but they\u2019ll be camping out in the lobby. What can you do but put up with it? Thinking that you\u2019ll have concerts and albums but not have your privacy infringed upon is only a dream for musicians. It\u2019s impossible. Just ignore it. Tara will take care of handling the reporters. Don\u2019t worry since she\u2019s a veteran.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the hotel and get a lot of rest until tonight. You\u2019re going to have to have dinner with the Board members.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though it is the first time he is hearing about this dinner, Jun Hyuk did not say anything. It is just a step in getting used to this world. He needs to accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara, take him to the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The suite on the 23rd floor of the Plaza Hotel is separated into a living room and bedroom. The living room looked full because it holds a grand piano. It is not a royal suite that goes for tens of thousands of dollars a night, but it is plenty large for a guest room that he will be using alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Do you like it? If you find anything uncomfortable, I can look into another room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is plenty. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll come to get you for dinner at 6:30. If you need anything, let me know at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tara closed the door and left, Jun Hyuk threw his body on the bed and could only sigh at the thought that this stiff lifestyle would continue.</p><br/><p>He needs to make calls first. Since the press release would be going out tomorrow, he needs to let everyone know because they see the articles and make a fuss. He will need to start with his lawyer, who may have already received a contract in the mail.</p><br/><p>\u201cLawyer Lim. It\u2019s me, Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodness, Jun Hyuk. Where are you? Are you still traveling in Europe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m in Boston right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoston? Why? You\u2019re traveling America instead of Europe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I became the visiting conductor of the Boston Philharmonic. The people here said\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Visiting conductor of Boston? Goodness! You made such a fuss just 2 months ago and now conducting? Who are you?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

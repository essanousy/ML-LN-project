It\u2019s during the break. I need to practice all break.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had become more free from last year and had been thinking of traveling during the summer break. Amelia would need to go on tour again and he could not just follow her around. He was thinking of going to Canada, Danny\u2019s hometown, by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Chaikovsky Competition is in June. When that\u2019s over, the runner-ups tour Europe. Russia in June, July and August in Europe. But there\u2019s a performance at the Salzburg Summer Festival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia, are you really going out for the competition? I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t need to go out for it with your talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 There\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I receive financial support from the government, but an Argentinian enterprise gives major support too. They\u2019re asking me to pay more attention to the competition this year. I can\u2019t ignore that request.\u201d</p><br/><p>In supporting a young artists, there is nothing better than having a runner-up or winner in a competition. It is the same as when a company that is backing a golfer hopes he will win in a major competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying we should meet in Salzburg?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s spend even a few days together in Europe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHang on. Didn\u2019t you just say runner-ups? Only the runner-ups go on tour?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You don\u2019t think I can be a runner-up? My goal is to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk pretended not to see Amelia get worked up and spoke to Danny,</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny, you too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, you said it yourself. If I can play the violin song you wrote, there\u2019s no problem for me to become a runner-up in a competition. No?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny was full of confidence that becoming a runner-up would not be an issue. He had seen the Long-Thibaud last year. He knew the skills of violinists who were currently frequenting competitions.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk wavered at Amelia\u2019s last words,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, there are a lot of Mozart\u2019s handwritten scores at the Salzburg Mozart Museum. Don\u2019t you want to see them for yourself? Mozart\u2019s scores?\u201d</p><br/><p>Salzburg. Mozart\u2019s hometown. Jun Hyuk wanted to see Mozart\u2019s handwritten scores. He even had the thought that he might be able to discover a hidden intent in the scores.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go to Salzburg. Even if I don\u2019t get picked during the audition, I can just go for a vacation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny snorted at Jun Hyuk\u2019s doubt,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you joking? Is there a reason you won\u2019t get chosen when you\u2019re the future conductor of the New York Philharmonic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because the repertoire is Mozart\u2019s opera, there were only four people trying out to be conductor. Only Jun Hyuk participated from CH, two were from Juilliard and one from Eastman. The students in Clayton\u2019s conducting major dropped out early on when they heard that Jun Hyuk would be auditioning.</p><br/><p>Professor Hirani sighed in relief as soon as he saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s name on the list of candidates.</p><br/><p>\u2018Amelia did well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, what\u2019s up? You\u2019re showing interest in an event like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s Mozart\u2019s hometown. I would like to go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. It\u2019s basically a holy land for musicians.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Hirani was more thankful to Amelia who did him a favor than he was to Mozart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. And I heard that there are handwritten scores at the Mozart Museum. I would like to see those.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Mozart\u2019s handwritten scores?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, professor. Why are you surprised\u2026 Could it be that they just store them and don\u2019t reveal them to the public?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 They\u2019ll probably reveal them. Even if they don\u2019t show them to the public, it should be possible if we ask the officials there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Hirani realized that Amelia had seduced Jun Hyuk with Mozart\u2019s handwritten scores.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whew \u2013 Well\u2026 Since it\u2019s true that the handwritten scores are there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of Mozart\u2019s scores are stored in world famous museums. Of those, the majority are at the New York Metropolitan Museum near the school. Of course they are not on display to the public, but they would be able to see it if the school made the request.</p><br/><p>Salzburg, Mozart\u2019s birthplace, only has a few scores that he wrote when he was 5 years old.</p><br/><p>Professor Hirani felt like he would start laughing when he thought of how Jun Hyuk might react upon seeing Mozart\u2019s handwritten scores.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Anyway, do well with the audition and I hope you become the conductor. An opera isn\u2019t a common opportunity because it\u2019s expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the Salzburg Summer Festival committee agreed to cover a lot of the costs. They would lend them the set necessary for an opera and Mozarteum University promised their students for the extras. Mozarteum University was founded in 1841 and has 400 prestigious professors. It is also the alma mater of Berlin Philharmonic great, Herbert von Karajan.</p><br/><p>The audition song to select the conductor was Mozart\u2019s Symphony No. 4 in G Minor, the 1st part of K550.</p><br/><p>After the four candidates rehearsed for one day, they would audition the next. During the 8 days of the audition, the person who would take the baton became the subject of interest of all students in the three schools.</p><br/><p>The 1st part is just 7 minutes, but there is an advantage to taking a later turn in the audition. As the conductor changes, the orchestra members get more practice and become used to the song.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was 2nd to audition and he met eyes with the members, exchanged formalities with the concertmaster, and stood on the podium.</p><br/><p>Without saying anything, he picked up the baton to indicate that he would start the performance instead.</p><br/><p>When there was not a conductor introduction or words regarding the song, the concertmaster stood up and approached Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. Don\u2019t you need to tell us how you\u2019ll be performing? We\u2019d like to hear your interpretation of this song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, let\u2019s hear it. Aren\u2019t we just practicing today anyway? And since this song is so famous and the members practiced this so much, I thought they\u2019d be able to perform this even without a score. I can start right away, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>This symphony does not have the trumpet or timpani. Jun Hyuk started conducting with an orchestra of 57 people.</p><br/><p>Conducting that is neither explosive nor grand. Jun Hyuk kept conducting calmly like a metronome at a 4/4 beat. When the boring 7 minute performance ended, all of the members looked at Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put the baton down, scratched his head a few times, and said something so outrageous it was a wonder that the members did not throw their instruments at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, let\u2019s reduce the number. There\u2019s no reason to have so many people. Violin. You, you, 2 people. You on the viola\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>As Jun Hyuk called each performer one by one, his face looked full of queries.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcept for the 19 people I called, everyone else please leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk finished speaking, Clayton students took their instruments and left without a word. The rest could not do that. The concertmaster on the 1st violin bolted up and yelled,</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here. What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

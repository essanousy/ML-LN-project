Happy Wednesday! Hump DAAAY]</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. Sir?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, Jun Hyuk. What\u2019s up? You\u2019re calling twice in one week?</p><br/><p>\u201c Well\u2026 Something bothersome happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? What happened? Was there an accident? Did you beat someone up?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. Am I some hoodlum? To hit someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then?</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get in an accident. I unexpectedly came across a way to make some money.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? I sent this kid to study\u2026 I left you there because you said you wanted to study but what? Money?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I said unexpected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk quickly explained the situation in order to avoid Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s nagging. He even added in that Coline the cellist is his best friend.</p><br/><p>Most middle-aged Korean men nod their heads if they say it was for a friend.</p><br/><p>Really? Then there\u2019s nothing you can do.</p><br/><p>It worked. Is it because friends disappear one by one from middle aged Koreans? They go flying when it comes to friends.</p><br/><p>I think Lawyer Baek would be better for that than I am. He said he has something to tell you anyway. Hang up and wait. I\u2019ll tell him to call you right away.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hung up the phone and waited for a moment before it rang again.</p><br/><p>Is this Jun Hyuk?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Lawyer Baek.\u201d</p><br/><p>This kid is still calling me Lawyer Baek. I told you to call me uncle. Really!</p><br/><p>Lawyer Baek Seung Ho is very different from Yoon Kwang Hun. Yoon Kwang Hun is not affectionate, but Baek Seung Ho does not hesitate to express his friendliness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, right.\u201d</p><br/><p>You haven\u2019t heard the news, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><br/><p>Your album. It\u2019s doing pretty well in Japan. You didn\u2019t know, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cJapan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yeah. It\u2019s sold over 120 million right now. It\u2019ll sell better than it did in Korea. And it\u2019s standing proudly at 3rd place on the chart. You\u2019ll become rich soon. Ha ha.</p><br/><p>\u201c3rd place on the chart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, not Oricon or Orion or whatever it is, but a Japanese Indie Music Chart.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had not known that his album was being sold in Japan.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re not long from becoming a Hallyu star. You don\u2019t have a picture but if you did, it would be all over Myeondong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho did not give Jun Hyuk a chance to speak and kept talking,</p><br/><p>I know you\u2019re not coming back to Korea because of your studies, but can you make about a week of time?</p><br/><p>\u201cA week?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yeah. Let\u2019s meet in Japan. It seems Japanese partners have gotten in contact multiple times, but Mr. Jo Hyung Joong and Mr. Yoon Jung Su turned them all down saying that you\u2019re studying.</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho\u2019s proposal became tempting when he recalled the familiar faces one by one.</p><br/><p>They say it\u2019s a huge deal for these kinds of sales without ever having a promotion by the star of the record. Apparently it\u2019ll be different again if we pour oil on this while it\u2019s going out well. And\u2026 you can see Kwang Hun. Isn\u2019t a week okay?</p><br/><p>He wanted to go to Japan to see Yoon Kwang Hun, not to promote his album. He even thought that Baek Seung Ho had prepared this event to give him and Yoon Kwang Hun time to spend together.</p><br/><p>And the most important thing. All expenses will be paid for on the Japanese side. What do you think?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like getting a tour of Japan for free. Of course I have to go. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Okay. Then wait while I check on the schedule. I\u2019ll let you know when we can go. Then I\u2019ll see you in Japan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. I said I had something to ask you. He didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, right. He said something about a friend. What is it?</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk explained his situation, Baek Seung Ho started by bursting out in laughter.</p><br/><p>Ha ha ha. When you take a part-time job, it\u2019s at a different level. Can\u2019t you do something more common? Like delivering pizza?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. I have to meet them soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright. In those situations, you only say one thing. You\u2019ll look over it and get back to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>They\u2019ll make a proposal, whether it\u2019s orally or in a contract. Then tell them that you\u2019ll take a look at it and get back to them as quickly as you can. As soon as possible. Okay?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what if they ask me how much first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listen carefully. The first person to give a number in a negotiation is the one who loses. You know what you do well. If you don\u2019t like it, tell them to forget it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if they really stop it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then you don\u2019t do it. It becomes an excuse you can give your friend too. How can you help him when the negotiations didn\u2019t work out?</p><br/><p>Oh! There was a convenient way to do it. Jun Hyuk even thought that all the smart people in the world must be lawyers.</p><br/><p>And Americans forget everything once a contract is signed no matter how much you fight during negotiations. They just think of it as a part of work. Just push it forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you, Lawyer Baek.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey! I told you to call me uncle\u2026</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk hung up the phone. It was too soppy to call him uncle.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Jun Hyuk that Ili met in the 1st floor lobby of the school lightly exceeded his expectations. A bookworm in the library with a sparking talent in the recording studio. Jun Hyuk\u2019s image is far from these kinds of people.</p><br/><p>Normally when musicians meet a person from a large record label, they are bound to be a little taken aback. But Jun Hyuk did not shrink back. His confident expression, the hand he put forward for a handshake.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll need to pay according to our company\u2019s manual? This is the general contract. I already printed it. Take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili seemed to be a bit angry as he got to the point and handed the contract over. Jun Hyuk thought that it was because a rookie was bringing money up first, but Ili thought it definite that they start with a contract. He was just frustrated and annoyed that everything was moving so slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201c$5,000 per song in the case of a newbie producer. It\u2019s $55,000 since there are 5 songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll look over it and let you know as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Look over it? Forget it if you\u2019re thinking of trying to make a deal. This is already decided. And there aren\u2019t very many companies that are as generous as we are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can just leave it if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m just here because of Coline. Use a different producer if you can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m sure you have a lot of producers since it\u2019s a large company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ili grabbed his hair with one hand and waved with his other, motioning for him to go. It is not his job to go through such negotiations. If the price is not right, they can just not go through with it.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took the contract and went back to his dorm. Coline followed him, looking teary.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, how much do you want? I\u2019ll earn the difference and give it to you. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoney? No. Honestly, I was surprised too. It\u2019s $55,000 for just 5 songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline could not come to him senses as he saw Jun Hyuk laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Then why didn\u2019t you okay it on the spot? Are you doing this because you want to see me go crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, Coline. Trust me. This is how adults make deals. I\u2019m a professional who even released an album in Korea. You tell the LA producer tomorrow that I\u2019ll sign the contract. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline finally relaxed when he heard Jun Hyuk\u2019s arrogant laugh. He had just grabbed the handle of the door to success.</p><br/><p>Coline threw his now weak body on Jun Hyuk\u2019s bed when his phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Gotez. I was about to call\u2026 Excuse me? Airline ticket? Okay. I understand. Please wait one moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline blocked the phone with his hand and whispered,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, Ili is calling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? He\u2019s so impatient. How many minutes have passed\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. He said he\u2019ll take care of all of our airline tickets. Something about hating New York because it\u2019s cold? He said he needs an answer right away because he\u2019s personally taking care of the expenses. If you reject this, he\u2019s going back alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled brightly and stuck his hand out to Coline.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline\u2019s face also became bright and he high fived Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand with strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Gotez, Jun is signing the contract right now. Thank you for being considerate.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the call ended, Coline jumped on Jun Hyuk\u2019s bed and cheered. Jun Hyuk spoke while looking at Coline,</p><br/><p>\u201cStop playing around and get down. There\u2019s a lot to do now. It isn\u2019t a time to play around like a kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I got too excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took a guitar case out from underneath his bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean where? Your practice studio. Tell your members to hurry up and come too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy the studio all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline could not figure out what Jun Hyuk was trying to do. He remembered the promise he made. The promise that he would do as he was told so that Jun Hyuk would not have to explain everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking because you don\u2019t know? We have to hurry up and modify the songs to practice them. You want to get to LA and practice what I arranged? You have to record once you get there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll arrange it now? There are 5 songs. When are you going to do all of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid. You still don\u2019t know me. Hey! An hour is enough for 5 songs. Let\u2019s hurry up and go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline stuck out his tongue as he followed Jun Hyuk who was already leaving the room.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had his guitar on his back and was walking the cold New York streets with Coline.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to tell you last time, but I have to tell you something.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m thinking of selling the song he played today, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the southern Kyeonggi Province preliminaries ended, the production crew had the intuition that Jun Hyuk\u2019s music would make history. They first needed to make sure they were on contract if they wanted to get the money from the sales.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, you know today\u2019s judge Cho Eun Young, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe wanted to release a remake single.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Why suddenly a song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seemed she had tact and intuition. She just wants to get noticed along with Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill Jung Tae Chun permit a remake of his song? It\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s lived in seclusion. He won\u2019t be up for a former girl group member turned fashionista or whatever she is singing his song. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCho Eun Young knows that too. She\u2019s asking us to make it happen in exchange for all of the profits made from the song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeke. She\u2019s thinking she can get a permanent spot on some variety show if she can just make this song popular. Demand at events will increase too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She\u2019s really clever in that area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to do anyway, let\u2019s rush it a bit. Let\u2019s arrange a meeting with the legal team first\u2026 Tell them to make sure they get Jun Hyuk to sign the contract.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

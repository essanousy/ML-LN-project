He was able to watch the competition comfortably.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk could not miss the performances of the 3 welcome faces he saw in the list of participants. The person he had the most anticipation for was Laura Goldberg.</p><br/><p>He hoped that she would win in the best conditions no matter what song she sings. She needs to sing the soprano part of the Choral Concerto. He had written the song while thinking of her voice.</p><br/><p>Laura Goldberg\u2019s assigned song was 17th century French composer Charpentier\u2019s Motet. The start and end are difficult in skill, there is a lot of treble while the middle is lyrical, and there is a warm feeling so it is not an easy song in terms of vocals.</p><br/><p>If she can handle it perfectly, winning is not a problem. He has a feeling that Laura will win easily.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk listened to Laura sing and looked puzzled. She is in no way at this level. He even thought that it could be strategy. The strategy of getting through the assigned song with ease and showing as much skill as is desired in the song of choice is obsolete though it always works.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk broke out a smile as soon as he saw the song she had chosen. Even though it is an obvious strategy, this song is enough to make it work.</p><br/><p>The song she chose is so unconventional it made the judges create a fuss. It is contemporary music great Gyorgy Ligeti\u2019s \u2018Mysteries of the Macabre\u2019.</p><br/><p>It is not a song that can be handled just by being able to sing well. The changes are so severe that even the audience that is sitting still cannot get themselves together.</p><br/><p>It has a difficulty that demands the so-called \u2018ultrasonic range of dolphins\u2019 and incredible acting.</p><br/><p>However, Laura Goldberg overwhelmed them like a fountain shooting water high and then falling low. The only mistake she made was that the key was slightly rough where it was to be graceful. She brought about surprise with nearly perfect treble technique, strong focus, and committed acting.</p><br/><p>With the audience\u2019s standing ovation that lasted for over 10 minutes, they could foresee her win.</p><br/><p>As soon as her performance ended, Jun Hyuk left the theater. In the 2 years he had not seen her, Laura Goldberg had become a complete soprano. When he thought of the stage he would have with her, his heart beat faster. He regretted not extending the soprano part of Choral Concerto more.</p><br/><p>The first winner of the Queen Elisabeth Competition appeared. As predicted, it was Laura Goldberg of the vocal section.</p><br/><p>The judges\u2019 evaluations that she has \u2018a strong personality and excellent tone with huge potential and clear professionalism\u2019 and reports in the press of her \u2018crystal clear voice that crosses between several octaves with ease, excellent expression, solid acting\u2019 let everyone know that a new prima donna had appeared.</p><br/><p>The 6 winners including Laura Goldberg found out something new during the competition committee\u2019s feast. That they had been specially requested for the piano and violin final performances.</p><br/><p>None of them were willing to turn down the request in such a happy moment. Everyone readily accepted. Their curiosity for the song grew as they wondered what it was that it required vocals.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk confirmed the finalists and arranged a dinner to congratulate Danny and Han Ye Ji. Including Professor Jeon Hye Jin, the 3 people were shocked at Jun Hyuk\u2019s surprise appearance and looked to be disconcerted, but 2 of them could guess why Jun Hyuk is here. Danny was the only one who continued to look befuddled.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, why on earth are you here? You even rented out a house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Ji, don\u2019t you think he\u2019s a bit daft? Why else would Jun Hyuk be in Brussels?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin laughed as she spoke in Korean, and Han Ye Ji spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think the final song is Mr. Jang\u2019s? I haven\u2019t heard once that Mr. Guggenheim\u2019s \u2018World of Europe\u2019 is the winning song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, is that true? Your song won?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laughed and nodded. Danny continued to look blank. Professor Jeon only looked at Danny pathetically.</p><br/><p>Contrary to his blank expression, Danny had performed incredibly and had become a finalist easily.</p><br/><p>\u2018A performance that provides the experience of pure musical bliss and freedom\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A violinist who expressed an abstract feeling as if there are many layers of paint and it is impossible to know what is inside\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018An impressive performer with excellent fingering virtuosity.\u2019</p><br/><p>Danny received high praises like this in the press and is closest to being the winner, but he has now forgotten his happiness and is blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, congratulations Danny. Ms. Ye Ji, you too. Let\u2019s eat while we talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny and Han Ye Ji had spent 9 days locked up to prepare for the competition, so they started salivating when they saw the delicious food that the maid and her friends had made.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to let you know beforehand since they\u2019ll be announcing it from the competition\u2019s end tomorrow. So you don\u2019t get surprised for nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe really would have been shocked if we found out through the release tomorrow. But how did you think of submitting to the competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon never thought that Jun Hyuk would submit his work to a competition. He is not at a level to compete with other youths, and it certainly does not fit Jun Hyuk\u2019s personality.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not tell them that the start to Choral Concerto was Han Ye Ji\u2019s piano. He thought that it could create unnecessary misunderstandings.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Isaac Stern suggested it. He said that competitions are hard to experience unless you are young.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut for you, Mr. Jun, to submit to a competition is still\u2026 What are normal people like us supposed to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji swallowed the food in her mouth and smiled. Although they were speaking in Korean, it was evident from Han Ye Ji\u2019s expression that it is not a serious matter, but Danny still had a hard face as he ate. Jun Hyuk looked over Danny\u2019s expression and spoke carefully,</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny. Are you mad because I didn\u2019t tell you that I entered the competition before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, sorry. No. Why would I be? I know what the competition rules are like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s with your expression? You\u2019re a strong candidate to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny put his fork down and looked at Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, I\u2019m not supposed to ask questions like this but tell me one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s fine, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour song that won. Is it a piece like Inferno? Really hard contemporary music?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I bought the Inferno album and listened to it\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t even listen to 3 minutes and stopped. And that was just once. I couldn\u2019t even think to listen to it again. If the winning song is like that\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny\u2019s face was full of concern. Professor Jeon and Han Ye Ji were holding their breaths and listening to their conversation. It was not just Danny. Han Ye Ji had not been able to listen to more than a few minutes of Inferno either. Danny\u2019s worrying is not groundless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Is that why you\u2019re like that? Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s completely different. It\u2019s thoroughly in classical style.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Whew \u2013 What a relief. Okay. That\u2019s all I need to know. No need to say more. I don\u2019t want to create any unnecessary misunderstandings. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny discarded his worries and started eating again with a bright expression. Han Ye Ji\u2019s face had also brightened. If it is a classical song, there is no need to worry beforehand.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. I heard that the finals are going to be conducted in a more complicated way. Is that because of your song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. There is that, but it\u2019ll also be because the committee wants a more exciting competition. But Ms. Ye Ji will have great results. You definitely stood out from the 6 finalists.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk briefly told Danny what they were saying. He did not want Danny to have any unnecessary misunderstandings. Danny stopped eating to give Han Ye Ji a thumbs up to acknowledge her piano.</p><br/><p>After their small talk about the competition, the 3 people were going back to the hotel when Jun Hyuk let something slip for 2 of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMemorize the score completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were confused by Jun Hyuk\u2019s sudden words for a moment, but they quickly realized that he was giving them a tip.</p><br/><p>Danny hugged Jun Hyuk to express this thanks and Han Ye Ji bowed to him lightly. Now, everything is up to their own efforts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s a waste?</p><br/><p>\u201cA large portion of what Jun makes goes to other companies. Where do you think they\u2019ll spend the money they\u2019re making because of Jun? It\u2019ll become money thrown away for the whims of executives of music production companies and distributors.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern lit a cigar and started to talk about his vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to spend that tremendous amount of money in Jun\u2019s name? He could do anything. He could help third world countries, fund the development of music. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to donate a piano to every elementary school classroom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you thought of a foundation. It\u2019s an incredible idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know, but the people joining this endeavor all have great characters. They will run the foundation with integrity and always think of something better.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern looked at Yoon Kwang Hun with his cigar in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern. Jun\u2019s money isn\u2019t something that I get involved in. You can discuss this idea with Jun and decide with him. It isn\u2019t something to get permission from me for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun spoke plainly because he thought that President Stern was still under the impression that everything regarding Jun Hyuk needed to go through him. He is no longer Jun Hyuk\u2019s guardian. And Jun Hyuk is not a child.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Well well. You misunderstood me.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern blinked in confusion for a while because laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to get your permission. As you said, it\u2019s something that I can proceed with after talking to Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you showing me this plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to ask a big favor of you. Will you become the Chairman of the Jun &amp; Stern Foundation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chairman? The foundation\u2019s representative? His surprise upon seeing President Stern early in the morning had been nothing. Yoon Kwang Hun forgot that he was even holding a cigarette, and froze. What is this out of the blue?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how I think about it, no one is more appropriate than you, Mr. Yoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern. What are you talking about? I\u2019m just someone who\u2019s retired, enjoying coffee, wine, and music in this small cafe. But take on a foundation that will be moving billions of dollars? I can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was so surprised that he put his cigarette out in his coffee as he waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean common? You\u2019re too modest. I know about your experience in Wall Street and Korea well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all in the past. I\u2019m not like that now.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, President Stern\u2019s expression did not change in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you listen to what I have to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>He lit his cigar again and spoke slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe foundation\u2019s chairman needs to meet 3 conditions. First, not being greedy for money and being frugal. What I mean by greed here is that the person can\u2019t be interested in money at all. The person can\u2019t become greedy when there are billions on the line.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is a prerequisite that he needs to consider. Yoon Kwang Hun nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, having the ability and intuition to understand all movement just by looking at numbers on a document. We need to see it clearly if companies involved with the foundation are playing around with money. People in the entertainment industry are used to luxury and pleasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern let out a long puff of cigar smoke and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are people who think of parties full of models, singers, and entertainers all the time. They think of all of that as required expenses. It is something we need to tolerate to a point, but we need to be completely aware of the extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern, America is full of human resources. Won\u2019t there be someone who meets those conditions? You\u2019re thinking about this the wrong way because of the relationship between Jun and myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. There are a lot of human resources. People with the right philosophy and mind of sacrifice. And it\u2019d be possible to find a ton of people who are good at administration who are good with numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s settled. There\u2019s no reason that it has to be me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun sighed in relief, but President Stern was still laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is that no one meets the 3rd and last condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A 3rd condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of great people out there as you said, but no matter who we bring, they will think more of the foundation. How can we spend money in a place with more value? What method do we need to use when using money? Lastly, how can we grow the foundation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that inevitable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s something to think about before that. It\u2019s that we need to think of Jun before all of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun closed his eyes. He finally realized the reason why President Stern is trying to make him the chairman.</p><br/><p>The foundation must not come before Jun Hyuk. If the foundation comes first, an endless amount of money is needed. Not just the money made from companies affiliated with the foundation, but it is normal to get external contributions.</p><br/><p>The best way to get donations is to put Jun Hyuk forward. It could become endlessly bothersome. Jun Hyuk is the foundation\u2019s owner, but the chairman who is in charge of operations could think of Jun Hyuk as an affiliate company.</p><br/><p>This is President Stern\u2019s concern.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun opened his eyes and spoke cautiously,</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern, you\u2019re the person most suitable for the chairman position. It\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doesn\u2019t he meet all of these prerequisites? Furthermore, didn\u2019t he invest Stern Corporation stocks and a huge amount of money? There is no better match.</p><br/><p>However, President Stern looked at Yoon Kwang Hun in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yoon, look at me. I\u2019m an old man, already over 80. It wouldn\u2019t be weird if I died now. Going out to do something would be silly.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern looked all over his body. His wrinkled hands, his white hair. He is an old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t accept, I\u2019m not going to establish the foundation at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be better. It\u2019s the choice of company officials if they want to waste the money they made through Jun by playing around with models. Not everyone needs to be moral. I don\u2019t have the right to pass judgement on other people\u2019s actions. Let\u2019s end this discussion here.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern\u2019s smile grew when he saw how decisive Yoon Kwang Hun was. He really had picked the right person. Yoon Kwang Hun does not care about anything. Billions of dollars is just a number to him, and he will remain indifferent to that money. He became more entrenched in his thought that there will be no better person for the job.</p><br/><p>President Stern took out a few documents from the manila envelope. It is the contract for Jun Hyuk and Stern Corporation\u2019s management.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know, but the termination date for the contract was left blank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s an incredibly reckless and free condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is reckless. It seems like a blank termination date is an advantage for the artist\u2019s side, but it can be used in the reverse as well. I\u2019m writing in a date to release the burden. If you don\u2019t accept, that date will become today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun laughed in disbelief. This old man is really something!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredible. I wavered. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t all. There\u2019s more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe decisive hit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019ll become the KO punch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun looked at another document that President Stern handed over, and was surprised for the 3rd time today. Then, he lit a cigarette without saying anything.</p><br/><p>While Yoon Kwang Hun smoked, President Stern looked elated.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I\u2019ve won. With a KO.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun put his cigarette out, let out a long sigh, and looked at President Stern.</p><br/><p>\u201cA small apartment in New York. You have to put an audio system of the highest quality in that apartment. Oh right. I can expense my costs for moving on the foundation, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After the orchestra members gathered in the studio to practice everyday for about 1 month, their first result was revealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will begin recording for the opera \u2018Godfather\u2019 tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The orchestra members gulped. Will all of the members get to participate together? Or will there be people eliminated?</p><br/><p>This moment was more tense than when they had auditioned a month ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a pity, but there is a fair amount of people who do not meet my standards. And I matched these standards to those of other orchestras. The people who participate in the recording must keep in mind as well that they can be taken out at any time during the recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>This means that in the end, he only selected a section of them. The members all looked disheartened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe list for participants is hanging outside. And the recording period is 3 days. The people who will not be recording should practice individually for the 3 days. It is not a break.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked over the orchestra and said something even more shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond clarinet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Maestro.\u201d</p><br/><p>The clarinet player had his instrument in his hand and was startled when Jun Hyuk called on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fired starting today. The office will give you more detailed information. You worked hard until now.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

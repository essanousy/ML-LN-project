What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould\u2026 should I go out on that show?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What show?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe audition program. \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you go on that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I heard, the prize money is $500,000?\u201d</p><br/><p>Did he want the $500,000 prize money? Jun Hyuk had not revealed any concerns regarding money so far. It seemed like he had only been thinking of music, but had he been hiding it all this time?</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun was slightly taken aback by this unfamiliar aspect of Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that show picks singers. You need to sing\u2026 Do you sing well? To think about it, I\u2019ve never heard you sing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to sing. The piano or guitar is enough, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout singing? I\u2019m pretty sure that won\u2019t do. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez. You still don\u2019t know me? You know how these ladies wet themselves over my piano performances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid. Talking like that again\u2026 Didn\u2019t I tell you to watch the way you speak? People care a lot about manners in the classical world. You can\u2019t reach the top anyway. Didn\u2019t you hear those women earlier? They\u2019re only putting you on the air until they reach the top 10. The prize money goes to the person in 1st place.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the words that only the 1st place winner receives prize money, Jun Hyuk stopped talking. Yoon Kwang Hun started to wonder about Jun Hyuk\u2019s intentions. It seemed that to this day, he had only looked at Jun Hyuk through his musical talent. Only now 17 years old, it was an age to have a lot of interest in stars and celebrities, but he had forgotten because of the music.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. What do you think? Do you want to become an idol singer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m okay with anything as long as I can make music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll make it so that you can dedicate yourself to music in the best environment. Just wait a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? No, it\u2019s okay. I think that this right now is the best environment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk wavered for a moment and started to say what had been on his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou changed the piano, drum set, electric guitar, everything to the best for me. Haven\u2019t you spent more than $100,000?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? No, that\u2019s not it. What money do I have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know hangul and english now. I looked it all up. Everything. It was all really expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Are you trying to go on the audition show to make back the money for the instruments?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that and\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>From the way his words trailed off, it was evident that he wanted to give the audition a try. He must have wanted to see how he was compared to other people\u2019s music and talent. Yoon Kwang Hun also thought that it would not be a bad idea for Jun Hyuk to meet children with musical talents that differed from his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen watch the last season. If you still want to go on it after you watch it, go. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was something that Jun Hyuk did not know. An orphan abandoned by his parents as soon as he was born. A pitiful child who had lived on the streets since the age of 5 and who had suffered all types of jarring experiences. Also as attractive as an actor and possessing innate musicality.</p><br/><p>The broadcasting station and public would not pay attention to Jun Hyuk\u2019s music, but concentrate more on his intriguing story.</p><br/><p>It was worrisome that this might hurt him.</p><br/><p>What will happen to Jun Hyuk now?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He woke up to this incredible sound.</p><br/><p>A bout of passing showers came down as if it had been planned. The sounds of the trot tune and the raindrops on the car roof drew Jun Hyuk out of the car.</p><br/><p>Trot\u2019s bumping rhythm laid out the basic bass and the raindrops pounding the car hood were the elaborate music on top.</p><br/><p>It was as if there were dozens of instruments playing at the same time in the parking lot of this highway rest area. Jun Hyuk was able to differentiate between the distinct sounds each raindrop made on every different type of car hood.</p><br/><p>Drunk with the elaborate sound that the raindrops and cars made, Jun Hyuk ran around the parking lot forgetting that his clothes were wet. It was in the crisp chords, he heard a fine, thin treble. The sound came from a kitten that had found shelter from the rain under a car.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk bent down and reached out his arm to get the kitten out and the scared kitten ran out into the rain.</p><br/><p>Within moments, the rain-soaked parking lot had become a playground for hide-and-seek. Jun Hyuk chased the kitten laughing gleefully, and while his adoptive parents yelled for him, the shouts didn\u2019t carry far due to the sound of the music of the rain.</p><br/><p>The byway next to the rest area building was the passage the employees used to commute to and from work. Jun Hyuk followed the kitten out of the rest area through this byway.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s adoptive parents had no idea that this had happened and lost their first child born from the heart within a day while the rest area speakers blasted the message that they were looking for Jun Hyuk.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

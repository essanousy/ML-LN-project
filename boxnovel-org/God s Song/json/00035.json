Yoon Jung Su\u2019s expression became awkward.</p><br/><p>The team members\u2019 looked at Jun Hyuk who nodded lightly at them as a signal. The song started with his first guitar stroke and 4 minutes passed.</p><br/><p>Everyone on the team had a look of reassurance on their faces that they had finished without making any mistakes and the four judges wore strange expressions. The judges had without a doubt listened to the song with awe and admiration, but their expressions had completely changed once it ended.</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul was the first to grab the mic and he opened his mouth slowly,</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 It was good. This, well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Delaying the evaluation, he coughed a few times in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe song is very good. Everyone sang well\u2026 The other teams split up the song but this team was unique and not one person stopped singing. They put in a chord when it wasn\u2019t their part\u2026 ah\u2026 The only one who didn\u2019t sing is the person on guitar, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes settled on Jun Hyuk, but he just blinked back at Lee Sung Chul. Producer Kim who had been monitoring the close-up of Jun Hyuk\u2019s face began to laugh again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. That kid\u2019s face is as though he doesn\u2019t even care about the judges.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the staff room nodded their heads. This was the first time in five seasons that they had seen anyone so arrogant without any sign of tension.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 And the rap was also really good. The feelings of the man who is the object of the one-sided love that was not in the original song. It was also very funny how you expressed that very indifferently\u2026 Who wrote that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we wrote it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two rappers could not hide their happiness from Lee Sung Chul\u2019s compliment. However, they had to hide the traces of their laughter because of the following evaluation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYet\u2026 It was generally good, but you all made a big mistake. Yoon Jung Su will probably be the one to tell you what that mistake was. I heard the song well.\u201d</p><br/><p>A mistake? The music and singing were perfect. Did Lee Sung Chul not say that himself? Everyone swallowed and gave Yoon Jung Su their attention.</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su held the mic and smiled at Lee Sung Chul.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you decided to avoid saying the invectives this season? Why do I have to say the bad things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to get some of the abuse online. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su fixed his mic and his mood became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 you heard enough compliments, but I\u2019ll say it again. The song was really good. At this rate, it could go on a concert stage immediately and there wouldn\u2019t be any problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team members became excited again. They might be able to achieve a dream-like whole team pass.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was absolutely perfect as not one person showed where their disadvantages lied, and the chords were inserted exquisitely so that not one person stood out more than another. However\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone swallowed. It seemed like the real assessment was going to start now.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.. However, that also means that there wasn\u2019t anyone who was special. There wasn\u2019t anyone that we as the judges were drawn to. To say it another way, should I say it was like food made with ordinary ingredients? It was very tasty, but we couldn\u2019t find the ingredients and we couldn\u2019t tell what the sauce was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su finished his assessment as the disappointed participants looked on,</p><br/><p>\u201cA good performance is the basic. That basic was executed perfectly, but there wasn\u2019t anything special. Can I say that everyone was just passable? It felt like that. You worked hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third person to get the mic was the person who had newly joined the judges, Lee Eun Jin,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you said so many good things that I have nothing to add. Saying that you\u2019re passable means that you were short of talent. If you have a weapon, you can\u2019t hide it even if you try. It comes out while you\u2019re singing. But there wasn\u2019t anyone on stage whose weapon showed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Eun Jin\u2019s evaluation continued after a moment of sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is someone who does need to receive an excellent evaluation, isn\u2019t there? I\u2019m sure you all know who it is. The chef who made admirable food with ordinary ingredients. That person needs to get good ratings for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team members\u2019 eyes naturally shifted to Jun Hyuk and Lee Eun Jin smiled,</p><br/><p>\u201cI see you are all telling us who that chef is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim who was watching the evaluation with the most tension put down his worries. He was nervous because there had not been one word said about Jun Hyuk, but Lee Eun Jin who he had thought would be the most biting had moved the way he wanted her to. This was the signal that Lee Eun Jin was sending to Producer Kim Ki Sik.</p><br/><p>She was saying that she would cooperate with Producer Kim Ki Sik and help him and not to forget it. She had done Producer Kim Ki Sik a favor and he would have to repay the debt at some time.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Lee Eun Jin\u2019s judgment, the viewers would not be able to raise issues even if Jun Hyuk went on to the next stage. The chef who made great food with mundane ingredients. This was enough.</p><br/><p>The last person to get the mic was Song Jin Young of JYS and she wrapped it up with an intense assessment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a program that discovers stars through competition. You are all forgetting that. A song that\u2019s like acapella? It\u2019s nice to listen to. This is a boxing ring, not an afterschool club.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the cameras focused on the judges. As the cameras were catching the judges share their thoughts and opinions, Lee Sung Chul took the mic,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people who passed this round are\u2026 the two rappers and Jang Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two rappers could not hide their excitement and Jun Hyuk remained in the same state. The girl would had been eliminated had tears in her eyes and the boy who had joined the team late was scowling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rappers showed talent in their fun rap and Jang Jun Hyuk showed great capability as a producer. However, you\u2019ll have to keep in mind that this program is about discovering stars and not producers. You\u2019ll have to show yourself as more than a producer and as a musician on the next stage, or it\u2019ll be difficult to advance any further. That is all.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They have to judge the scores with only the submission numbers written on them and the office as a list of the submission numbers with the names of the corresponding students. Once the judging is over and a song is chosen, they let the professors know who the composer is.</p><br/><p>The table in the conference room was covered in envelopes holding scores. The professors open the envelopes and after looking at each score, assign scores. By adding all of the scores, they debate over the song with the most points.</p><br/><p>Is it a song that is worthy of having a famous conductor orchestrate it?</p><br/><p>If it does not meet that absolute criterion, the system left the repertoire to the conductor.</p><br/><p>The professors write affectionate advice on the songs that are not chosen and return them to the students.</p><br/><p>Day of judging. There are dozens of scores stacked on the center of the table. However, all of the professors\u2019 hands were reaching for one envelope because of its thickness. It is at least three times as thick as the other envelopes.</p><br/><p>As their hands bumped, they all laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t this look to be at least 30 minutes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems to be. Most of these are a little over 10 minutes\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Hirani, you should take a look at it first. We\u2019ll look at the thin ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Hirani nodded to the professors, opened the envelope, and started to look through the score.</p><br/><p>After about 10 minutes passed, Professor Hirani bolted up from his chair.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 You should take a look at this song first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this one first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Over 10 professors started passing the score around. A piano concerto configured entirely in 4 parts. The title read Piano Concerto No. 7.</p><br/><p>All of the professors looking at the score thought that they were going to go crazy. A song that makes the listener frustrated. The music did not explode refreshingly and was endlessly teasing. The sweet melody did not last until the end, but was continued instead with a gentle flow. This gentle mood did not last either and became cold.</p><br/><p>A normal piano concerto has a intense first part, a relaxing lyrical 2nd part, a short tango in the 3rd, and a rondo in the 4th. Rondo is a format where a principal theme with several contrasting themes. The tempo is much faster than the 1st part and the period of the theme is short.</p><br/><p>This song on the other hand has an entirely different configuration. It teases them until the 3rd part. When the 3rd part is ending, they are about to get angry. As soon as they enter the 4th part, the melody that had been teasing them starts exploding all at once. As if making up for the 22 minutes they endured the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd parts, the 4th part shows tremendous power for about 11 minutes and lets them feel the greatest catharsis.</p><br/><p>The songs that the other students submitted are closer to contemporary music, but this song has a traditional classical feel to it. If someone who did not know listened to it, they would say that they had discovered an unreleased song by Haydn or Brahms.</p><br/><p>While the professors repeatedly looked over the score, 2 hours quickly went by.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere there. Since we can\u2019t end today with the evaluation of just one song, let\u2019s review the other pieces as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>They would of course need to look at the other students\u2019 submissions, but the professors looked as though their decisions had already been made.</p><br/><p>They finished scoring as it dimmed outside. The judges chose the top three scores and went into a debate over the two songs tied 1st place and a song in 3rd place by a 3 point difference.</p><br/><p>The judges began discussing the shortcomings of the 3rd place song with its score in the center of the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit lacking for an orchestral arrangement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It would have been better if they had made it more simple\u2026 It\u2019s more fitting for a string quartet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s select a quartet team and open a separate performance with this. And counsel this person on arranging it to fit a quartet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s time to choose between these two songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, they had thought that the piano concerto would place in 1st with an overwhelming amount of points. But before the impression of this song could disappear, another piece had jumped out at them.</p><br/><p>It is a song where three sopranos have to make sounds as if they are three instruments. It did not deliver its message through lyrics. All it demanded was a single \u2018ah ah\u2019 sound. An experimental music that uses the soprano as an instrument.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it hard to decide which is superior and which is inferior?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree. It\u2019s a situation where we need to choose between Haydn and Schoenberg.\u201d</p><br/><p>The professors did not looks as if they dreaded the situation of having to choose the better of the two pieces. They were all smiling with joy that two amazing songs could emerge at the same time. They were happy that the students\u2019 workmanship was being upgraded every year.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think of doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Hirani was being ambitious because he thought it a waste to choose just one song.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave the two songs as tied in 1st place and ask Maestro Bruno Kazel to perform both. I think he\u2019ll accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what if he says that he\u2019ll only do one due to circumstances?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll ask him to do the piano concerto since it fully uses the orchestra. We can ask the composer of the other song to command it himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a good idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that, don\u2019t we need to think of the pianist?\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone was in happy contemplation, one professor spoke with a serious expression. That is when everyone else remembered something they had been forgetting.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 The pianist\u2026 It\u2019ll be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. Is there a student who can play the piano like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a big problem. It\u2019ll only be possible for a veteran pianist who has been performing for a long time to have such deterrence\u2026 Who among those young students could\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think there might be someone among the kids that went out for the Long Thibaud Competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Professor Hirani shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be hard. The winning student will have to start preparing for a world tour right away, and a losing student\u2026 They won\u2019t want to come out in a regular performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>They did not know which student had written this song but he or she was throwing a lot of interesting issues at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell this isn\u2019t the time for this now. Let\u2019s check first.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the professors picked up the conference room phone and made a call out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we have made our decision. It is number 9 and 14.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the employee at reception told him who wrote the two songs, the professor holding the receiver widened his eyes and asked again,</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Are you sure? Okay\u2026 okay. I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>The professor put the phone down and had a strange expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber 9 is Alexander Dubchek. And they said number 14 is by Jun Hyuk Jang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy Jang, do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That Jang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I thought that a song like this had been in preparation for at least half a year\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it could be a song he made before he enrolled?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Hirani remembered what Jun Hyuk said last week.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Thinking about what Jun Hyuk said, he started preparing this song a week ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had easily created a 30 minute piano concerto within a week. A concerto including a piano with such maturity. When the professors thought about the scores they had seen in Jun Hyuk\u2019s application, they realized why they had brought him into the school. It had to be because of these kinds of things.</p><br/><p>Randall Poster, professor of the piano, snapped his finger and burst out in laughter,</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then there\u2019s no reason to worry about the pianist anymore. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha. I guess that\u2019s how it works out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Hirani also realized why Professor Poster was laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to choose another pianist. Jun is saying that he\u2019ll play it himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was relieved at Randall and Hirani\u2019s words. One of their worries had been resolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the 2nd song is Alexander Dubchek.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Alexander Dubchek an oboe major?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. And he\u2019s graduating next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe youngest freshman and oldest senior\u2026 And it feels like their pieces were switched\u2026 It\u2019ll be really fun this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this song is dependent on the abilities of the conductor, there\u2019s no need to worry. And it seems there won\u2019t be any issue with the 3 sopranos\u2026 I believe the students will be able to handle this much with ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we meet with the two?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

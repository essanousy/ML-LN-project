There won\u2019t be any reason for us to get in your way while you perform. You bump into the camera more as you pay more attention to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk listened to the cameraman\u2019s friendly explanation as he went into sound check with the other 2 musicians. A lot of people were already gathered below the stage, holding up their phones and recording the musicians they love.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here! Jun! Jun! Hey, Maestro! Do you remember me? I gave you a beer yesterday.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re the person I watched the Santana performance with yesterday, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone was yelling from the bottom of the audience at the guard line as security held him back. Jun Hyuk turned at mention of a beer and saw the young man who had given him a beer yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. I\u2019ve gotten caught. Thanks for the beer yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man frowned once Jun Hyuk confirmed for him who he is. It is a pity that he lost the chance to get a signature and take a picture together.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk put his guitar down and took off the t-shirt he was wearing. He signed his name in big letters on the shirt and gave it to a security guard below, saying,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a lot, but it\u2019s for the beer. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s okay because it\u2019s not an expensive shirt.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man took the shirt from Jun Hyuk and howled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd look closely. I\u2019m not that skinny.\u201d</p><br/><p>He flexed his bare body, but the man just laughed at him. The young man who got Jun Hyuk\u2019s shirt, took his shirt off and threw it to Jun Hyuk. Jun Hyuk saw the man\u2019s body and quickly put the shirt on. He had just confirmed that he is skinny again.</p><br/><p>After laughing for a while, he went into rehearsal for 3 songs. They practiced enough and jazz does not always follow the flow of rehearsals, so it was fine to do just 3 songs.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk returned backstage and drank the water that Tara handed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. You look really comfortable today. You feel really different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to enjoy the festival. Today\u2019s goal is to make people have fun, not to present completed music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke was listening to Tara and Jun Hyuk\u2019s conversation when he laughed as he spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really nervous, but you\u2019re really relaxed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStanley, why are you nervous? You\u2019ve done a lot of performances like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Well\u2026 I\u2019m always nervous when faced with a stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke was taken aback and gave an evasive answer. When his face even flushed a little, Jun Hyuk had a strange thought.</p><br/><p>Is he worrying that he might bring out improv that they had not practiced during rehearsals?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are starting in 10 minutes. Everyone, please get ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not continue his thoughts because of the staff member\u2019s loud voice. The 3 performers waved their hands as they walked out on stage.</p><br/><p>When they walked out, loud cheering shook the stage. Stage 1 is the biggest stage, so it had the largest number of spectators. It seemed that there were easily over 20,000 people standing so close together.</p><br/><p>His hand trembled as he looked down at the endless amount of people rippling in a crowd. It was a different experience to feel the pressure of a tremendous number of people through his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Incredible, huh? You\u2019ll automatically relax once you start playing.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Carlton laughed as he patted Jun Hyuk\u2019s shoulder and walked by. Then Stanley Clarke came.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first song is a gift from us, so we hope you like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke turned away without even listening to Jun Hyuk, and the bass guitar started ringing without any signal. It is a rhythm he never heard during rehearsals. What song are they going to play?</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had no choice but to put his hand on his guitar and wait for a signal.</p><br/><p>But as soon as he heard Lee Carlton\u2019s guitar, he was taken aback and his eyes grew wide.</p><br/><p>His guitar melody is one that Jun Hyuk is very familiar with \u2013 his own song. The first song \u201cAh\u201d of \u201cA, E, I, O, U\u201d is flowing out of the large speakers, filling the large venue.</p><br/><p>The rhythm and speed was a little different and with Stanley Clarke\u2019s bass, it became a complete guitar song and hit Jun Hyuk\u2019s ears. A short while later, a light snare drum and high hat cymbal joined and it became jazz.</p><br/><p>That is when Jun Hyuk laughed, loosened his fingers, and enjoyed the amazing gift of his music.</p><br/><p>The audience was surprised because it is overly elegant for jazz performance, but everyone\u2019s shoulders started moving once the drum\u2019s light rhythm came in.</p><br/><p>When did they arrange and practice this song? When Jun Hyuk imagined the two elderly gentlemen sleeping less and practicing in secret in order to surprise him, he found it funny and touching. He could also understand why Stanley Clarke had been nervous backstage.</p><br/><p>Their arrangement was great. The light rhythm, appropriate tempo, and dramatic melody brought the audience\u2019s spirits up. He could dimly hear the sound of Stanley and Lee giggling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many days did you practice this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you like it? We had a pretty rough time of arranging this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do the evaluation after the performance. Tens of thousands of fans are waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laughed at Lee Carlton and then started picking out the melody of the first song on his guitar. The first verse of \u2018Room 335\u2019 came out through the large amps, but the roaring sound of the audience cheering swallowed the sound of Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar.</p><br/><p>Once they performed Lee Carlton\u2019s famous Room 335 and Early A.M. Attitude, 20 minutes had quickly gone by. They continued with varying music, keeping the time as they had promised and practiced.</p><br/><p>While Lee Carlton showed an overall tight performance, Jun Hyuk showed the effect of contrast with a very fast and passionate performance. Stanley Clarke\u2019s bass fingering, which at times feels cold, worked like a gear with the drums without a single error.</p><br/><p>Lee Carlton\u2019s solo in the typical ballad style brought a cool feeling and Jun Hyuk\u2019s languid and lazy guitar melody made small veins quiver.</p><br/><p>The next song was lively to break people out of their relaxed states. The dull and dark atmosphere characteristic of jazz was nowhere to be found. With the two guitarists\u2019 jumping melody and the bass\u2019 heavy and cold rhythm. The drums even show a sturdy configuration without any mistakes.</p><br/><p>When Lee Carlton started to repeat the rock music\u2019s guitar riff he likes to use, Jun Hyuk started a melody that led with a long breath. If Lee Carlton showed masculinity with precise and strong intervals, Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar was bringing out a sad melody like Laura\u2019s aria.</p><br/><p>White, black, and Asian. Entirely different emotions flowed through the 3 people\u2019s DNA, but it is true that there is no race or ethnicity in music. The different emotions of the 3 people fused well through music and brought out the best chemical reaction. That surprising result brought in more people of Fairgrounds. As the performance went on, people kept gathering to Stage 1.</p><br/><p>Countless spectators were in a frenzy over the one power penetrating the entire performance. 2 guitars and 1 bass play in breathtaking ad lib as through fighting each other, and that melody is the essence of jazz and the power that made the people\u2019s blood boil.</p><br/><p>A single jazz album. And that was with the piano and not the guitar. Jun Hyuk disappeared into the classical world with a symphony after that, but this performance showed his abilities as a guitarist.</p><br/><p>With this, it was a precious moment for jazz manias to have discovered another outstanding guitarist.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cToday was comparatively okay, right? I didn\u2019t even do anything ungainly like being narcissistic and getting lost in my own music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk changed out of his sweat-drenched shirt backstage and was satisfied with his moderated performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s show was good. The performance was amazing, too. But it was music with a lot of regrets. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke spoke to Lee Carlton and not Jun Hyuk, who is satisfied with the show.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have a fresh memory of my first time performing with Jun, so of course I\u2019m left with a lot of regrets. If it hadn\u2019t been a stage where we had to show a variety of songs, I really would have performed however I wanted to.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the managers packed up the instruments, the 2 men smoked cigarettes and discussed their regrets regarding the music. Jun Hyuk watched them and put down the water he was drinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we have a festival of our own? It\u2019ll be cozy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the studio and play however we want to like we did last time. Without restrictions on time or song configuration. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 men\u2019s eyes sparked at Jun Hyuk\u2019s proposal. They each rushed their managers. The managers quickly packed the guitars and ran to get the cars ready.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. I\u2019m going to stop by the studio first, so you go rest at the hotel. I\u2019ll call you when we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll finish up preparations to go back to New York tomorrow, so have fun.\u201d When Jun Hyuk got into Lee Carlton\u2019s car, Lee Carlton took his cellphone out.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen, so I\u2019m going to record everything. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course. I want to keep the time I spend with the two of you as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Carlton called the studio on his phone. He told them to set everything up perfectly to record multiple times.</p><br/><p>The 3 people arrived at the studio and were more excited as they set up their guitars and amps than they had been during the show. This is a secret show that they are doing for themselves and not for others.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was incredible when you performed my song during the show. I can\u2019t forget it so\u2026 what do you think about trying that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you by chance hear the rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We heard all of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 men sent the okay signal with their fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll start with those 5 songs as the theme. Come in when you feel it\u2019s right. I\u2019ll mix all 5 of the songs, so let\u2019s run with it all we want.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 greats saw that Jun Hyuk was excited like a child and were nervous at the words that they can run with it. They first worried if they could keep up with him if he went along as he pleased.</p><br/><p>Lee Carlton turned and spoke to the sound engineer,</p><br/><p>\u201cJimmy. Press the record button now and go rest. Don\u2019t come back into the studio until I contact you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the engineer left, the 3 people started bringing out music to the drummer\u2019s signal.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk finally came out of the studio after almost 3 hours. Tara had been waiting for his call and had to start by giving his hands an ice massage when he got in the limousine. He kept blowing his fingertips as though he had gotten injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. Do you know how old those two men are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Aren\u2019t they both over 60?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have 130 years between the two of them. But we only took 1 break in 3 hours. And that was because of me.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve played the guitar, so I felt like my fingers were going to rip.</p><br/><p>For old men who drink a lot, their stamina is no joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you really not take a break for 3 hours? Just once?\u201d</p><br/><p>3 hours is like an opera. Forget the music, that time needs to be supported by stamina.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I honestly think it was because of me. My fingertips still tingle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was the session? Was it okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took off the towel wrapped around his hands and put his thumbs up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell the company that those two men are thinking of releasing an album no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara counted off on her fingers,</p><br/><p>\u201cNew York Philharmonic performance, Laura\u2019s album, the session you just did, and the Seoul performance. How many is that? Aren\u2019t you overdoing it this year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will probably be 1 more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean another one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something. You can expect something good.\u201d Jun Hyuk smiled secretively at Tara.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The only face he knew amongst the judges was that of Lee Sung Chul.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi Jang Jun Hyuk. It says here that you\u2019re 17 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 It says that you\u2019re an orphan in your introduction\u2026 and that you\u2019ve never attended school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female singer took over Lee Sung Chul\u2019s questioning,</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re living in an institution now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I work and live at a cafe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCafe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s a cafe in Misari.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female singer already looked ready to spill tears with a pitiful expression and only needed to hear a bit more of this sad story to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt says here that you wandered the streets after you got lost at age 5\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk stared blankly at the female singer. She continued to speak because she thought that they had not understood each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell us how you lived while on the streets\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The camera had already closed in on Jun Hyuk\u2019s face and the mic had been lowered to catch his wretched and sad childhood story.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a place where we\u2019re judged by our music? Why are you asking me about my past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room froze. The three judges and the production crew could only blink while the audition contestants sat with their jaws dropped.</p><br/><p>All of their expressions were saying the same thing.</p><br/><p>How could he be so daring in front of the judges?</p><br/><p>Only the producer in charge of the program balled up his fists.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right. This is it. This is what we need. Something new. Fresh. Spunky!\u2019</p><br/><p>There had been no need to request a chic personality from him. He was naturally chic, though he was not sure if it was due to his looks, music, or rough childhood.</p><br/><p>Unlike the other children who suffered under the pressure, he had made everyone nervous within 5 minutes.</p><br/><p>The female singer was speechless at Jun Hyuk\u2019s bold retort and so veteran Lee Sung Chul took the mic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, music is everything. I am expecting your talent to be as great as you are bold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother, drag it out a big longer.</p><br/><p>The producer\u2019s desperate request came through the earphones, but Lee Sung Chul ignored it entirely. He had seen countless children who mistakenly believed that they had a great talent. He thought that things like this kids\u2019 attractive looks, advanced piano skill, and mediocre arranging skills had made him arrogant.</p><br/><p>It was necessary to judge these types of kids ruthlessly so that they would look back at themselves and try harder. Though of course there were many kids who could not even do that.</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul readied himself to give criticism and invective.</p><br/><p>\u201cJudging by the guitar you brought, it seems like you\u2019ll be singing a folk song\u2026 Okay, what song did you prepare?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Tae Chun\u2019s \u2018Poet\u2019s Town\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the name Jung Tae Joon, the 3 judges and the young contestants watching the waiting room monitor began to murmur.</p><br/><p>\u201cJung Tae Chun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Jung Tae Chun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even in the studio, there were not very many people who remembered Jung Tae Chun. Lee Sung Chul and the composer were the only people to remember Jung Tae Joon\u2019s lyricism that had stirred up the 70s.</p><br/><p>Producer Kim pushed the staff urgently,</p><br/><p>\u201cLook it up quickly. What year is this song from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was released in 1978.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the staff searched the song\u2019s history on the internet, the producer quickly spoke into the mic,</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, it\u2019s from 1978.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul who had heard the information via the earphone needed to provide lip service to the viewers.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it 1978 for Jung Tae Chun\u2019s \u2018Poet\u2019s Town\u2019? I think it was released around then\u2026 A teenager singing a song that\u2019s almost 40 years old? Wow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The composer continued with Lee Sung Chul\u2019s light banter,</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you be able to capture the emotion of a song that was created more than 20 years before you were born and is 10 years before your generation? We look forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk started playing the guitar after placing it on his lap and breathing in gently.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions were full of expectation as the soft guitar prelude came out. Could this teenager remake this song that only their parents\u2019 generation could know? How would he express Jung Tae Chun\u2019s heavy tone of longing? This kid\u2019s voice did not have the suited huskiness to it yet.</p><br/><p>However, everyone\u2019s expectations collapsed.</p><br/><p>As the 10-second prelude ended, the suspense-filled judges became bemused. Instead of singing the lyrics \u2018Open the window hm \u2013 and look out,\u2019 his 10 fingers started dancing smoothly on the guitar strings.</p><br/><p>For the 4 minutes following, there was no voice to be heard and only the melody of the acoustic guitar. When the last of the steady fingering came to an end, the only sound in the studio was the rustling of Jun Hyuk placing his guitar back in its case.</p><br/><p>While the three judges sat blankly unable to speak, the producer could be heard shouting urgently through the earphones,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing? You have to talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>The first person to speak was the female singer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there someone on the internet who plays the guitar similarly? Jung Sung Hwa? It sounded to be at that level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said that we\u2019re very different.\u201d</p><br/><p>The singer could not speak, baffled by Jun Hyuk\u2019s snappy replies, and the composer took the mic,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the finger style, but you put in a lot of sliding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also get a much rougher sense\u2026 I think it would have been better to play this on an electric guitar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk formed a small smile as though he appreciated that there was a person who could hear properly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst off, the guitar technique is top level. Most teenagers concentrate on playing the faster components, but Jun Hyuk focused on saving the sentiment of the music. We could say that you were gifted as a guitarist. It was a good performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul was the last to speak after the composer\u2019s commentary ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerforming an instrumental is taking a great risk. You are starting with a limitation by forfeiting the delivery provided by lyrics and relying solely on the sound of the instrument. Why did you choose to do an instrumental when it\u2019s such a disadvantage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I handle the guitar much better than my voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you play the guitar better than you sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBasically.\u2019</p><br/><p>The producer discovered the smile that had momentarily appeared on the monitor.</p><br/><p>\u2018That kid. He\u2019s being cocky. To the judges and the evaluation.\u2019</p><br/><p>He pressed the switch on the mic and yelled,</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, push him more. We need to get a full idea of how cheeky he can be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that you can\u2019t sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA classic guitarist can perform for an hour merely with a guitar, but there is no vocalist who can sing for an hour without accompanying music. There needs to be a piano playing at the bare minimum because the human voice is an imperfect instrument.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul, who had proudly been lauded as the best vocalist throughout his entire life, was left speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cJohn Lennon\u2019s music can be considered masterpieces, but John Lennon doesn\u2019t sing so well that he gives people goosebumps, does he?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had never heard of such insolence. How could a teenager like this pass judgment on John Lennon?</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul however showed a completely different reaction to Jun Hyuk\u2019s assessment of John Lennon because they were the exact words that he had said on air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Anyone who wants to make music needs to have his own set of standards. I would like to hear another guitar performance from you, except on the premise that you play in a wholly different style. What do you think? If you pass this round, can you show us a completely different performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can play the \u2018Poet\u2019s Town I just played in a different style right now. Do you want to hear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Lee, let\u2019s stop for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul asked to stop recording at Jun Hyuk\u2019s provocative actions. The monitor that the contestants were watching as well as the mic were turned off.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow. That bastard is trouble, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Arrogance to that extent is an illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik who had been watching the stunned contestants outside came running in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s hear it. Let\u2019s see how good you are. Go ahead and play it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Lee Sung Chul\u2019s order, Jun Hyuk pulled out his guitar and started playing again.</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul and the other judges, the producer and staff did not realize that 30 minutes had passed until after they had heard eight different versions of \u2018Poet\u2019s Town\u2019.</p><br/><p>The composer was the most astonished. He did not have the confidence to create eight completely different versions of a song even if he were given a month\u2019s time.</p><br/><p>This child however, accomplished this difficult task impromptu. Moreover, without modifying once. Even if he had anticipated this situation and come prepared, each song was impressive.</p><br/><p>Lee Sung Chul wanted to work with Jun Hyuk as an arranger for his next album, the composer wanted to see his ability to create music, and Producer Kim had the feeling that he had caught the biggest fish of the season.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk found them inadequate as they were showing such excitement and surprise over such a simple and easy feat.</p><br/><p>What is going on?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

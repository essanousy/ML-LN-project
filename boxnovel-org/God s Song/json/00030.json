They had to check the dormitory that hundreds of Star Week finalists would be using for about a week and they had to make sure the judges\u2019 schedules had not changed. On top of that, they had to go for days without sleep to secure copyrights to all of the songs that the finalists would sing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe list is all set, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We picked the 110 main contestants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are the people who will go into the top 10?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are about 17 candidates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIncluding Jun Hyuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, excluding Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, but can Jun Hyuk really not sing? When you look at people with musicality, don\u2019t they have the rudimentary at the least? He has a good voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik looked at the young writer as if checking, no as if complaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cI checked numerous times, but he won\u2019t sing. I asked him to sing just one verse but he won\u2019t budge.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not the young writer\u2019s fault that Jun Hyuk would not sing, but she shook her head back and forth as if she were trying to avoid responsibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be the best if he would just sing a little. It\u2019d be over if he kept playing the piano until the finals and burst out singing during the live performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the picture that all production staff members in the conference room dreamt of. What if he kept acting like he would sing, then not back and forth, building up the suspense until the 1st live performance where he belts out all the high notes in a song like \u2018She\u2019s Gone\u2019?</p><br/><p>How high the real-time viewer ratings would soar\u2026 It was a sweet imagination.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

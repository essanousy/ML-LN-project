He was scared to pick up the phone. Could it be a reporter? The caller ID said that it was Baek Seung Ho.</p><br/><p>When he slid to accept the call, there was a sound so loud he thought the phone was on speaker mode,</p><br/><p>\u2013 What are you doing that you don\u2019t pick up your phone! Do you know how many times I called you since yesterday!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Yesterday? What time is it right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Good job. You\u2019re just at peace. I stayed up all night.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun opened the motel room\u2019s thick curtains and the bright sunlight spilled into the room.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Did you pass out drinking? Oy. It\u2019s a mystery as to how you were a fund manager with such a fragile mentality.</p><br/><p>As Yoon Kwang Hun drank a glass of water to quench his dry throat, he came to his senses,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you call a lot yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Look at your call log. Anyway, congratulations. I\u2019ll have to buy you a drink later. You\u2019ve hit 1st place in real-time searches. Ha ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>He almost teared up. He was not yet a nuisance to Baek Seung Ho. There was still a person who was willing to help him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was in 3rd place before, now I\u2019m 1st?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Congratulations, you\u2019re a famous person. No, are you a celebrity?</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking nonsense. What do I have to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Let\u2019s check one thing first. Why did you keep Jang Jun Hyuk? You\u2019re not one to use an orphan just to save on employee wages. What\u2019s your reason?</p><br/><p>\u201cI did it for humanity. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 What gibberish is this? Are you still drunk?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! If it were you, would you take on the 21st century Mozart to serve in the hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 21st century Mozart?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Jun Hyuk is a real genius. He\u2019s a kid who\u2019s received a gift that God gives every 100 years. You\u2026 you don\u2019t trust my judgment? You know I have an ear for music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Music was another reason why Baek Seung Ho and Yoon Kwang Hun had gotten close. They were both music enthusiasts regardless of the genre whether it was classic, rock, blues, jazz, et cetera. But Mozart? He was exaggerating.</p><br/><p>Whenever we call a helpline, the waiting melody is always Mozart\u2019s \u2018Eine kleine Nachtmusik\u2019. 80% of the world\u2019s helpline melodies were Mozart, 10% was Vivaldi, and the last 10% was pop music with royalties to pay.</p><br/><p>Hotel lobbies, lounges, and elevators all over the world greeted their clients with Mozart. If Mozart were to receive royalties, he would make the amount to buy his country Austria every year, and his handwritten scores would be worth over $200,000 each.</p><br/><p>Mozart shared the title of genius with Einstein. How could he compare Jun Hyuk to a person like that\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2013 Well\u2026 Let\u2019s say that\u2019s true. Why did he go out on that audition program? If he\u2019s Mozart, he needs to go to New York or Vienna. Why Sangam-dong?</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I sent him to be around kids his age and it seemed like he wanted to go out too. He wanted to show his music, so I sent him to get some experience. Who knew it would turn out like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho seemed to be organizing his thoughts. He did not speak for a while.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Do you want to leave this to the discretion of our company? I\u2019ll ruin these assholes for you.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t have money. How can I work with one of the top two law firms in the country? I called to get your opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Would I take money from you? After I got your call, I had our investigators look into it a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a reason why Baek Seung Ho had not called yesterday. After looking at the articles on the portal site, he had even enlisted investigators to determine the circumstances before and after the incident. He had called once he had the reassurance and made up his mind.</p><br/><p>He had forgotten. Yoon Kwang had allocated all of his work to Baek Seung Ho because he had liked this kind of work ethic.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Of course. You think I was playing all day? Anyway, it seems Jun Hyuk really is a treasure as you say. They\u2019re playing with the press on the internet. It\u2019s a scheme to discredit your guardianship over Jun Hyuk so an agency can take him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fuck. I knew they would do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 You should have kept your treasure hidden. What were you thinking sending him out into the world? It\u2019s full of thieves.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop. I\u2019m full of regrets as it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 These days, the entertainment industry makes a lot of money from this Hallyu thing. And Jun Hyuk\u2019s really good looking. If he really is a music genius as you say, he\u2019s a golden egg.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen will you take care of it for me? You deal with the money issue as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Let me just ask one thing before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Are you trying to raise him yourself? Like making a management agency?</p><br/><p>That was greed. It was an era where talent directly became money. If that talent was in the entertainment industry, it was enough to make anyone greedy.</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho thought that Yoon Kwang Hun might be trying to reclaim the glory of his past through Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s unexpected reply invalidated Baek Seung Ho\u2019s guess,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was thinking of sending him to America or Europe by next year. I was just going to take responsibility up to there. His talent isn\u2019t something anyone can raise or whatnot. If you just throw him into bigger waters, the big fish around him with automatically gather to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a silence again. Baek Seung Ho\u2019s voice came out low after the silence,</p><br/><p>\u2013 You\u2026 really put your heart into it. You don\u2019t have any selfish intentions for this. I\u2019m seeing you in a different light.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this kid! What are you talking about all of a sudden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Okay. I\u2019ll take care of this, you just disappear for a bit. Even if the talk gets worse, don\u2019t pay attention to it for the time being.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun fully understood what Baek Seung Ho was saying.</p><br/><p>He meant that he was going to wait until the editors had completely ruined Yoon Kwang Hun. Once they had ripped Yoon Kwang Hun apart and made him nothing more than a rag, he was going to sue them for an enormous amount. He was going to empty the pockets of the editors responsible.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Oh right, I\u2019m in Hyeyiri right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Okay. Oh, and once people get a hold of your identity, you\u2019ll be getting a ton of texts and calls abusing you. Don\u2019t turn your phone off because you\u2019re angry. I\u2019ll send one of our employees right now. Until our employee gets there, pick up all your calls and record everything. Don\u2019t say a word in response and just record it. The employee is going to bring a cellphone and a warrant, so sign the warrant and use that phone if you need to call. Give your cellphone to the employee. We\u2019ll handle it.</p><br/><p>Threatening texts and calls were going to be converted into money. They were about to see the real face of a vicious lawyer.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Text me the address of where you\u2019re at now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. And Seung Ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Yea.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful not to hurt Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Oy. You worry too much. Is Jun Hyuk your son? Rest for a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 No problem. It\u2019ll be over in three weeks at the most. Hyeyiri\u2019s nice. Read a bit, go for walks, and rest. Don\u2019t drink.</p><br/><p>Once he hung up, his mind was at rest. All he had to do now was wait. Yoon Kwang Hun passed out on the bed again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

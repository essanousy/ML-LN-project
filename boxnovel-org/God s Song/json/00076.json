He is a great producer who had created multiple musicians with individuality, who showed their own colors. He is also a famous bassist who played in two of Korea\u2019s representative rock bands.</p><br/><p>He had initially turned down the opportunity to produce for the show, but suddenly changed his mind when he saw Jun Hyuk on broadcast. Kim Jong Suk wanted to participate no matter what and went to the broadcast station himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s all already decided. We can\u2019t change the producer now. We\u2019ve even written up all of the contracts\u2026 Ugh! How good would it have been if you had agreed to do this in the first place? Why are you being like this now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik was upset with Kim Jong Suk who was now coming in and demanding Jun Hyuk when he had turned down their offer in the beginning. However, Kim Jong Suk insisted stubbornly,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s this motivation now that I see Jun Hyuk. I have to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you by chance get approached by an agency? To connect them with Jun Hyuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Have you ever seen me meet with those guys? You know I don\u2019t even produce music for idol groups.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk, who was from a rock band, only worked with musicians who did not even make TV appearances often. Most of his producing was for debut albums of underground musicians.</p><br/><p>If Kim Jong Suk agreed to produce for someone in the underground world, it meant that they were already halfway to success. It at least meant that they would not completely fail, and that their musicality had been recognized.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, if Kim Jong Suk refused to produce, it was a sober assessment that they should give up music to go another path.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim. I\u2019m not trying to take the job from a junior who has already finalized their contract. Just give me Jun Hyuk. You have the third mission, right? I\u2019ll take responsibility for that one. I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t even need money. I\u2019ll do it for free. A donation of talent? Something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are your intentions?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was not a person to be so rashly persistent. There had to be a reason why he was so insistent.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim. I\u2019ll make Jun Hyuk sing on stage. It\u2019s still a no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik was not sure if he had heard correctly for a moment. He would make Jun Hyuk sing?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you just say that you would make him sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m doing this because I want to hear him sing. The tone of his voice isn\u2019t bad. And I think I can guess why he isn\u2019t singing\u2026 Leave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll really make him sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk\u2019s voice grew louder at Producer Kim\u2019s sudden interest,</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead, I heard that the 3rd mission theme is idol group songs, but change that. Do that in the 4th round. I heard the 3rd round is his last anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can make Jun Hyuk sing\u2026 And if he sings well, he could push to the win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little\u2026 I can\u2019t promise that he\u2019ll sing well. But I\u2019ll make sure he sings. So what do you want to do? Will you leave him to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that\u2026 how are you going to make him sing? If I think what you\u2019re thinking is possible, we\u2019ll do as you say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to trust his sensibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSensibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he was born with a talent in music, it is definite that he is rich in sensibility. Kim Jong Suk ensured Producer Kim Ki Sik that Jun Hyuk would sing if his emotions were stimulated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got some information from Hyung Joong and Jung Su. Right now, that kid is just an architect who\u2019s remodeling other people\u2019s songs. He\u2019s readily pulling everything apart and putting it back together according to a blueprint.\u201d</p><br/><p>Until now, Jun Hyuk had been focused on using the ingredients he was given to create the best music. There was no choice but to use other people\u2019s songs because it is a broadcast, but he never showed his own story.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid has never expressed himself. According to Hyung Joong, he has mountains of compositions at home, but I can guarantee that he doesn\u2019t express himself in any of those.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen normal guys like us make music, we use our emotions, feelings, and thoughts because we have nowhere else to get the music from. With someone like Jun Hyuk, he can make music with even the slightest external stimulation. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll make music even by listening to the sound of a subway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk like you know Jun Hyuk really well when you\u2019ve never met him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik looked at Kim Jong Suk who was speaking more and more nonsense as if he could not believe him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve met a lot of similar geniuses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk worked with underground young and witty musicians who made music with their own color. There was even a person who saw two cockroaches in a basement practice room and said that they looked like a couple playing \u2018catch me if you can\u2019 on the beach. Though they are not as outstanding as Jun Hyuk, the underground is full of people who have their own talents.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the conclusion? What method will it take to make Jun Hyuk sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to make Jun Hyuk face himself. Then he\u2019ll want to \u2018speak\u2019 since there are things that are hard to express with just a melody.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the world is Jun Hyuk\u2019s hidden appearance that you\u2019re being like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking because you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik thought for a moment and opened his eyes widely,</p><br/><p>\u201cSurely?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. What else could there be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Ki Sik put his life on the line for viewer ratings and did all sorts of things, but he just realized that artists do even more than that to create one piece of work.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous. If you rub his wounds, we don\u2019t know what that brat will do. We\u2019re dead if he gives everything up and runs away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk looked at Producer Kim Ki Sik pathetically,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re just a producer for a music program. He won\u2019t run away. What musician would run away when he\u2019s found the best subject matter for music?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This is Hwang Suk Min.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Oh wow, Teacher Hwang. It\u2019s been a while. How have you been?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty much the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 I guess there\u2019s something going on? What is it? Did you want to get a drink? You\u2019re calling this old woman out of the blue.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I might have to cram for an exam. Let\u2019s do drinks next time. I called you because I think I found a gem and I wanted to see what you thought of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Gem? A pianist?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s 17 years old, but he\u2019s only been playing the piano for 2 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 17? Then he started at 15\u2026 That\u2019s very late.</p><br/><p>\u201cDue to that, he isn\u2019t bound to standards and is very free. No, rather than free, should I say he\u2019s wild? Anyway, he\u2019s really something.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not think that Jun Hyuk was free, but it was difficult to pinpoint a way to describe him.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Is that so? But do I really have to see him? If you say he\u2019s a gem, he\u2019s a gem.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 something that bothers me but I don\u2019t know what it is. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a flaw or his color.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 I see. Bring him over sometime. Let\u2019s see him together.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, teacher. Then.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Hwang Suk Min hung up, Jo Hyung Joong who had been next to him opened his mouth slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Who were you just talking to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it was Professor Jeon Hye Jin. You know her, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJeon Hye Jin? The pianist Professor Jeon Hye Jin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At 24, she came in 3rd place in the Long Thibaud Competition (biennial piano and violin competition in Paris) and started to tour the world. She did not have the skill to be called on by world-famous symphonies like Vienna, New York, and Berlin, but she was successful enough to hold piano recitals with orchestras of high standards in each city.</p><br/><p>When she returned to Korea after living abroad for about 10 years, she was scouted by many universities as the first person to go up in the Long Thibaud Competition. She is now serving as a professor at the Music Conservatory, a Korean educational institution.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you talking about Jun Hyuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a problem with Jun Hyuk\u2019s piano?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s an amazing skill. It\u2019s almost impossible for someone to reach this level with self-education\u2026 but if he had received formal education, he would have been an outstanding pianist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something that bothers me, but I can\u2019t pinpoint what it is. And if Professor Jeon Hye Jin is interested, it could be a great opportunity for Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hwang Suk Min\u2019s real objective was to see if Jun Hyuk had the talent to stand on major, international stages with other geniuses instead of being wasted on a TV show like this.</p><br/><p>Two days after Jun Hyuk and the orchestra finished rehearsing, a bus was taking the final 12 participants to the Sangam-dong broadcast station in Seoul.</p><br/><p>There were still more than 12 hours left before the live broadcast, but backstage was noisier than a marketplace, and there were staff members moving busily everywhere. The 12 participants who were standing amidst all of this awkwardly were not the protagonists of the stage, but just props.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone listen up. You have to be alert today. Don\u2019t run around. If you need something, tell your manager. These 3 people here are managers for the day. They\u2019ll take care of everything you need.\u201d</p><br/><p>The participants memorized the faces of the three strongly built men.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in asking other people for what you need. Even if they say okay, it\u2019s not their job\u2026 so they\u2019re just answering out of courtesy. You have to make your requests to these 3 people. Keep that in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production team was so busy inspecting the 11 participants excluding Jun Hyuk for the sound, light, stage equipment, et cetera that they did not know how time was flying.</p><br/><p>After finishing his rehearsal, Kwak Hye Sung came backstage and sat down blankly, looking wearier than everyone else. After watching his opponents\u2019 rehearsals, he could not shake the feeling that he would be one of the two eliminations today.</p><br/><p>He could see it in the expressions of the staff after he was done singing. He had seen that they looked bored without any emotion, surprise, or admiration.</p><br/><p>His stage looked like it was included to fill the time. No one showed anticipation for his performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry shouting boldly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you Jun Hyuk. I heard you\u2019re not rehearsing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. We did our rehearsal the day before yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung took the water bottle that Jun Hyuk handed to him and thought of what he just said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 shout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you before? I told you to use the technique you used in vocal training to bring change to the song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t have the confidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you going to do? Are you going to sing in this dejected state without confidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kwak Hye Sung seemed to be so removed that he did not even want to respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of time left. Don\u2019t we start at 10 at night? That\u2019s enough time to practice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can you help me a little? You don\u2019t have rehearsals anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can I help with? You\u2019re just doing what you know how to do. You can just do it. You\u2019re a lot more apprehensive than you seem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk left Kwak Hye Sung\u2019s side after he spoke.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cYou handed over the judge and MC scripts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about the list of eliminations?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI handed them over. Nam Seung Hee and Kwak Hye Sung, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Also, how is Son Jin Young\u2019s expression?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe seems a little upset. I think he was expecting her to go on air at least twice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be strict from now on. We have to eliminate them in order, since we don\u2019t know if a dark horse might appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik was reviewing the cue sheet one more time before the live broadcast that was approaching in an hour. The players in today\u2019s 1 and a half hour live broadcast would be the 12 participants, the MC, judges, and audience. Producer Kim Ki Sik is the maestro conducting all of these people.</p><br/><p>Before MC Moon Kyung Min who was in charge of proceedings went on stage, he paced backstage while peeking at the audience to relieve his anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? It\u2019s too unilateral.\u201d</p><br/><p>MC Moon Kyung Min was scolding the staff taking care of him. That was how worried he was regarding the audience\u2019s excessive bias.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going crazy too. We chose the audience by area and age but\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have to reduce the placards and signs? They\u2019re all Jang Jun Hyuk. You\u2019re going to put this out on air?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, the staff is going around the entire audience switching them appropriately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about anything else, but it\u2019s a huge problem if the other kids\u2019 performances finish and there isn\u2019t a reaction. Practice that with them. It\u2019s a contest with 12 people, not Jang Jun Hyuk\u2019s fan meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clear that unless it was a family member or friend of the 11 participants, everyone in the audience was there for Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>After 2 hours of waiting, the audience complaints began to trickle down. Then, an announcement came out and the stage lights began to dance. The 1st live stage had started.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

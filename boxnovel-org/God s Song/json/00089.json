For the past week, something shocking happened. An instrumental topped a pop music chart for the first time in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tremendous applause exploded from the crowd. They were congratulating the win of the person they were rooting for.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It was Shin Hae Chul\u2019s \u2018From the Sun to the Boy\u2019 that Jang Jun Hyuk performed. Jun Hyuk personally arranged a space rock song into a magnificent classical to sweep the charts. It was a moment for him to enter as a new music powerhouse. It became a hot topic when it was revealed that he had arranged all of the parts for the orchestra as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued speaking after looking at the crowd\u2019s reaction,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo give you a hint, Jun Hyuk will not be singing today either. The surprising stage he will show is another point to watch for. And how far will Jun Hyuk be able to advance without singing?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were able to see Moon Kyung Min\u2019s hint right away. The first stage was Jun Hyuk\u2019s.</p><br/><p>The stage was lit brightly with the atmosphere of a club, and six back dancers entered. However, Jun Hyuk stood in the middle of the stage and instead of moving wildly like a DJ, focused calmly on his performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we at least had the back dancers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant producer spoke with a mix of self-chastisement. Producer Kim Ki Sik smirked as he watched the screen,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim had prevented the music director and production team from trying to direct Jun Hyuk\u2019s performance during the rehearsal.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk would be out after the 3rd round. Now, they needed to start putting out a card that would replace Jun Hyuk. This was why they had made Jun Hyuk go first. It was hard to remember the first performance after all 10 people had gone.</p><br/><p>The audience reaction was also as expected. The youths could not help but be taken aback. They wanted to enjoy the fun music they were hearing, but the stage they were looking at was calm. The imbalance between sight and hearing made it so that they could not move.</p><br/><p>\u201cJudges, please match the scores to low 80s.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the evaluation ended, MC Moon Kyung Min spoke again,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk who received the best score in the round last week was unable to receive a high score this time. It\u2019s a situation we could not predict. I think this is the zest in a competition that is shown in a live broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jessica, who was Producer Kim Ki Sik\u2019s new card, showed again that she was a strong candidate to win. Similarly Jang Na Rae, who was being pushed forward as a dark horse, went last and gave a performance that did not fall behind the quality of the recording she had done of Yoon Jung Su\u2019s ballad.</p><br/><p>As the judges gave high praises, the audience cheered. Tomorrow, there would be articles pitting the newly discovered Jang Na Rae against Jessica who is closest to the crown. Jun Hyuk could not even be mentioned. It is much easier for the public to forget someone than it is to keep thinking of them on their own.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cThe arrangement hasn\u2019t come out yet? I guess this mission song is hard. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not put his classic guitar down even when Kim Jong Suk said that it would be okay to go with a piano instrumental if he thought that he could not do it. He thought that if he were to play this song on the piano, it would be no different from the accompaniment in Lee So Ra\u2019s song.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to express Lee So Ra\u2019s emotions without \u2018speech\u2019. Lee So Ra\u2026 is really an impressive vocalist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s probably hard to express \u2018that day\u2019 and not Lee So Ra.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk did not think that he would be of any help to Jun Hyuk even if he spoke more. He confessed the last feeling that he had,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you catch on to the fact that I\u2019m trying to force you to sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I thought so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one reason why I tried to get you to sing. I\u2019m not expecting Mozart\u2019s Figaro\u2019s Wedding from you, but hoping for an oldie like John Lennon\u2019s Imagine.\u201d</p><br/><p>He meant for Jun Hyuk to consider pop music as well and not just classical.</p><br/><p>\u201cPop music has a shorter history than classical does. Mozart\u2019s music has been played for 250 years, but is there something that says the Beatles\u2019 music won\u2019t do the same? It\u2019s already been 50 years since \u2018Yesterday\u2019 came out. But doesn\u2019t it still get a lot of love? I can bet it\u2019ll still be popular 200 years later. When it\u2019s only 2 minutes long.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason why a 2 minute song with a simple melody was able to bring such emotion was Paul McCartney\u2019s voice and lyrics.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have amazing vocals. John Lennon isn\u2019t an amazing singer. Look at Bob Dylan who is called a bard. He just throws the lyrics.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk had given other participants help on the program, he had not paid attention to the lyrics. All he had done was help find the best way for them to express with the voice that they had.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to see the emotion of a singer rather than the technical aspects of producing, composing, and directing. I wish you would try feeling that emotion while singing. That way, an oldie will come out. If you sing this with sincerity, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk\u2019s slow and concise tone indicated that he would no longer interfere.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. This is my last piece of advice. Play the accompaniment on the guitar. Calmly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try to sing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You think I can\u2019t sing? I\u2019ve been making a living off of music for over 30 years. I bet I\u2019m better than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk saw Kim Jong Suk laugh, and calmly played the guitar while Kim Jong Suk delivered the lyrics.</p><br/><p>When the song ended, Kim Jong Suk took the guitar from Jun Hyuk\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, I\u2019ll play the accompaniment, you try singing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong? Just think of it as if you\u2019re at karaoke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk sang quietly to Kim Jong Suk\u2019s guitar. When the song ended, he must have seen how Kim Jong Suk felt on his face because he turned bright red. He had not sung well, showing how uncomfortable and unconfident he felt.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just singing to show me. Singing for others to hear are professional singers. You\u2019re singing for the first time today. Don\u2019t think about showing it to me, but show it to yourself. Let other people hear it when you do the broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk pat Jun Hyuk\u2019s shoulder and left. Talking about it any more would be unnecessary nagging. He felt relieved, but also sorry to Producer Kim Ki Sik.</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer Kim, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Oh, teacher. Is it going well?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He might sing. I heard Jun Hyuk sing just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Is\u2026 that for real?</p><br/><p>It was a voice of disbelief, and he could feel the great anticipation. Kim Jong Suk replied cautiously,</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 His singing isn\u2019t very good. Don\u2019t expect too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 \u2026.. I see. There\u2019s nothing we can do. You worked hard.</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Suk had thought that Producer Kim would make a fuss, but when he heard how resigned he was, he could guess that the future rounds had already been decided.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After hanging up the phone, Kim Ki Sik yelled out,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Production team gather. It\u2019s an emergency meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production team that had gathered in the conference room was curious as to what had happened, but they did not speak when they saw Kim Ki Sik\u2019s stern face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone needs to listen to me and come back with an answer within 30 minutes. If not, you\u2019re all dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>What could it be that he\u2019s starting with a threat?</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk just sang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production team had not expected these words to come from Kim Ki Sik and waited for the next.</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently it\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just average.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was disappointed. It seems there would be no surprise or reversal.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell I guess he seems more human. If he could sing well with that face and that talent, he would really be a mistake from God. I\u2019m starting to feel affection for him now that I know there\u2019s something he can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Assistant Producer Pil Jae could not hide his sinking feeling and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking nonsense and think about it. What do you think we should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk\u2019s singing is a total mess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you. It\u2019s at an average level. Why do you have so many questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>If Jun Hyuk\u2019s singing had been a hidden treasure, they would have found some way to advance him to the win. But they had lost control of the situation and Jun Hyuk himself did not have the will to keep going. The result was decided.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, let\u2019s go with the singing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said it\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we go with an instrumental, what could be different? Jun Hyuk\u2019s performance can\u2019t become a hot topic anymore. You saw how bad his 2nd round EDM track sales are? When Jang Na Rae was in 1st place, Jun Hyuk was above 50.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a difference between a song and electronic. The consumer is different. More than a best seller at clubs, it\u2019ll go as a steady.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not only that. It would be sold to various entertainment programs and CFs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Jun Hyuk done with the 3rd round? And we got a lot of track sales from the Star Week songs he did in the preliminaries. Not to mention the 1st round orchestra.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what are you trying to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cViewer ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were only two objectives for an audition program. Track sales and viewer ratings.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s finally singing in the 3rd round. With this, we don\u2019t have to worry about viewer ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does it matter if he can\u2019t sing? I would actually be happier if he was tone deaf. That\u2019s an incredible reversal. I\u2019m sure he would gain even more popularity.\u201d</p><br/><p>The production team were agreement as if there was nothing left to contemplate.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s go with the viewer ratings. Send out the press release. Don\u2019t be obvious, just let it slip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. There\u2019s a rumor in the broadcasting station that Jun Hyuk might sing. You mean at this rate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this, Jun Hyuk\u2019s 3rd round elimination was decided. Jun Hyuk\u2019s musicality was a waste, but an audition program does not exist to protect the dignity of music. It is a commercial show. They needed to be true to their field.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

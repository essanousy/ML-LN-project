He asked who they would be meeting with while in the car, but Stern had not explained in detail, saying that he would know once they met.</p><br/><p>Though it is lunch time, there was only one person at a table in the restaurant, waiting for Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh, Maestro. It\u2019s an honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sergio Castellitto introduced himself as a Wall Street investor and looked to be an old man over 70.</p><br/><p>He held Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand for a while and did not look like he would let go, so President Stern sat him down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSergio. Let\u2019s eat first. We can talk while we eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sergio Castellitto sent a signal to the kitchen and the chef nodded before starting to cook.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis restaurant\u2019s T-bone steak is as good as that of a Michelin 3-star restaurant. Only people who know of this place come and go quietly. They aren\u2019t usually open at lunch time, but I asked them to open it up specially so that we could have some quiet time to ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took a bite of juicy meat. As Castellitto said, this is a place that cooks its meat very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI own a very small company and make some money. Then, I saw your show with the New York Philharmonic and became a huge fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sergio Castellitto pushed away a plate that he had finished clean, and spoke quietly,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the day I heard music that takes on Beethoven, there is just one thought in my head. That\u2019s why I asked Isaac to let me meet you in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Castellitto. Then will you tell me what that thought is? I can\u2019t ignore it when you\u2019ve allowed me to taste steak this great.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elderly Italian man\u2019s face brightened so much to Jun Hyuk\u2019s response that his smile made the wrinkles on his face straightened out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was hoping you would become our Italy\u2019s Verdi or Puccini rather than Beethoven.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern and Jun Hyuk understood the small Italian man\u2019s words at once.</p><br/><p>Giuseppe Verdi, who composed over 30 operas in his lifetime, and Giacomo Puccini, the best Italian composer after Verdi who rose to international fame.</p><br/><p>Puccini was born in Lucca in Tuscany, the land of wine and music, into a parish that handled the music for Lucca over 150 years. He was an organ runner in a cathedral from a young age, and a genius who took the pipe out of the organ to sell in exchange for cigarettes, performing with a different chord to hide the missing pipe.</p><br/><p>He decided to become an opera composer after watching Verdi\u2019s opera, \u2018Aida\u2019 when he was young.</p><br/><p>Verdi had a great influence on Italy\u2019s independence movement, and is the musician who the people love most.</p><br/><p>The song in the 3rd act of his opera, \u2018Nabucco,\u2019 expresses the oppression that the Israelites suffered from Babylon. The Italians moaning under the yoke of Austria thought that this song of the Hebrew slaves was expressing their feelings.</p><br/><p>Verdi\u2019s song spoke for the Italian people, and Verdi\u2019s name became the code of revolution. Viva! Verdi!</p><br/><p>It is because the first letters of the name of the leader of the movement to unify the government, General Vittorio Emanuele Re D\u2019Italia, become VERDI. was called the unofficial national anthem at the time of the independence movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you asking me to write an opera?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But I\u2019m not talking about a frivolous opera like Mozart\u2019s. Resurrect the traditional Italian opera.\u201d</p><br/><p>A descendant of Rome to his bones, this old man does not hide the fact that he does not like Mozart\u2019s operas which were created in the German language.</p><br/><p>\u201cTraditional Italian\u2026 Then Italian for the language as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sergio Castellitto drank coffee as he watched Jun Hyuk\u2019s reaction. Jun Hyuk is already showing a great deal of interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already shared my thoughts with my friends in Italy, and they also sent their ardent support. As a result, we gathered $70 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? $70 million?\u201d</p><br/><p>$70 million for an opera? Jun Hyuk nearly spilled his coffee.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave everything up to you, Maestro. I believe that you have the capability to reality mine and my friends\u2019 dream. And of course we\u2019re thinking of having the premiere in Milan\u2019s opera sanctuary \u2018Teatro Alla Scala\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old Italian man\u2019s face is full of pride. Italians think of the opera as the mainstream of classical music. There is basis for their pride since classical music\u2019s representative format, the symphony, was originally the opera\u2019s overture.</p><br/><p>\u201cInstead, there is a condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes shined as he listened to the old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cLove, betrayal, revenge, death. Please include these in the opera. I ask that you don\u2019t create it based on a light and fun scenario that is reflective of the times. You must bring out the tragic beauty of love, betrayal, revenge, and death in order for it to be a true Italian opera.\u201d</p><br/><p>A giant opera worth $70 million. He can make it any way he wants to and he can cast the best vocals in the world. Jun Hyuk has never even attempted to write an opera before. An opera is a play because a script is necessary. Writing is not an area that Jun Hyuk had in mind.</p><br/><p>Sergio Castellitto watched Jun Hyuk as he was lost in thought, and spoke up cautiously,</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you\u2019ll be touring soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It starts next month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI could be overstepping my boundaries, but I wish you wouldn\u2019t waste your abilities in such affairs. I do think that it is good to create great pop music, but there are a lot of musicians who can take your place in performing. I ask that you put all of your heart into creating music that will shine for 100, 200 years like Verdi\u2019s opera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Castellitto, I understand what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s difficult to say anything at the moment\u2026 Will you give me some time to think it over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We are ready to wait for as long as it takes. But an old man like me doesn\u2019t know how long I have left to live. Please allow me to see the performance before I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man held Jun Hyuk\u2019s hand tightly again with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t it an interesting proposal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is. An opera\u2026 I didn\u2019t even imagine it. Isaac, did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. We have known each other for a long time now\u2026 He just asked me to let him meet you because he\u2019s a fan. That was it.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the car back to President Stern\u2019s house, he kept watching Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill there be a good story if you were to write an opera? I kept thinking about that while we were eating. Love, betrayal, revenge. There aren\u2019t stories like that these days. Even the slightly immature Italian tragic beauty? It would have been better if he brought a good scenario to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern shook his head negatively, and Jun Hyuk smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. There was something I thought of as soon as he said traditional Italian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What work is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather? Oh my God!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was something that had not once crossed President Stern\u2019s mind. Is it not one of the top masterpieces in the world, encompassing crime, family, and drama of the times? It is the first movie where all the 3 parts of the series were nominated for Academy Awards. It is a piece that would become news just by being called the modern classic Godfather.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it good material? Family, revenge, success, death. There\u2019s even a bit of love. Italians like family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe material is good, but isn\u2019t the story too vast?\u201d</p><br/><p>The time in the 3-part series Godfather is chronologically over 90 years. It is ambiguous where to begin and end.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to mix Godfather part 1 and 2. If you think of Vito Corleone as the main character, the story can have young Vito Corleone, from Robert De Niro as the Godfather in his last years and Marlon Brando\u2019s lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk showed a bit of fervor and discussed the opera\u2019s configuration.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can reduce the role of the son, Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. If there isn\u2019t a time limit, it can have the story of 2 generations.\u201d</p><br/><p>The character in all 3 parts of the series is the younger of the 2 sons, but Marlon Brando\u2019s charismatic image is most deeply embedded in people\u2019s memories. President Stern looked at Jun Hyuk and thought of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t already started it, have you? In your head?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. The real scenario needs to come out first for an opera.\u201d</p><br/><p>He waved his hand, but he was already thinking of how he could use the movie\u2019s main theme song.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, tell me honestly. Do you really have thoughts of taking this on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re willing to invest the whole of the production costs, so there\u2019s no reason not to do it. It is a bit funny to think of writing an opera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with an opera?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the opera is disappearing now. There is a great alternative in musicals, so why do operas? It\u2019s a bit laughable to use a huge sum of $70 million to satisfy the hobbies of rich old Italians. Or\u2026 is it because they\u2019re Italian people?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a momentary look of disbelief, but he did not seem to mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you think of the time it\u2019ll take to prepare the scenario, won\u2019t it be right when the tour is over? The original novel and movie are already out, but it\u2019ll take around 1 year since there are a lot of limits to operas.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it. I invested $15 million to give him a reason to drop out of the tour\u2026..\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

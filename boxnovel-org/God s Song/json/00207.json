Isn\u2019t this a waste of space? The apartment is too big.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun yelled as soon as they opened the door to Jun Hyuk\u2019s New York apartment. Even the apartment he lived in when he was at his peak was just a small one-bedroom compared to this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I think too. President Stern brings a ton of people to throw a party sometimes. There\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cParties? What parties? Are they like the parties we see in movies?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun gulped as his eyes trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just imagined something weird, didn\u2019t you? Playboy cover girls\u2026 Huh? Ke ke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t Hollywood. A lot of women do come, but they aren\u2019t models. Most of them are industry people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk pushed a Yoon Kwang Hun full of disappointment into an empty room.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, rest. We have to go out for dinner. We might be meeting Maestro Dimitri Carras of the New York Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ll have to take comfort in that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun threw his bag on the ground and was about to go to sleep when his phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Stern.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Mr. Yoon. I didn\u2019t intrude when you were about to rest, did I?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. It\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Then will you contact Korea for me? If there\u2019s a paper or station that wants to interview Jun Hyuk, tell them to call us at Stern Corporation. I\u2019ll text you the contact information for the manager. And we\u2019re thinking of holding the interview in about a week.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll tell Jun that as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun hung up the phone and remembered what Jun Hyuk had said. Though he is over 70 years old, he is a lively old man who never rests.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh fuck. Are you guys crazy! I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><br/><p>K broadcast newsroom culture reporter Kim Jong Man looked at his mail and cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. What is it that you\u2019re cursing this early in the morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cManager Park, I got an e-mail from Jang Jun Hyuk\u2019s management agency. I\u2019m speechless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You got an e-mail? What did they say? When will he do the interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Park ran to reporter Kim Jong Man\u2019s desk to read the e-mail on his monitor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe date is a week later. Apparently, they\u2019re holding a joint press conference at the Hudson Hotel in New York. They\u2019re only taking the Korean press by broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Park did not finish reading the e-mail and tapped the back of Kim Jong Man\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Are you joking? What joint press conference? I told you to go get an exclusive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to the rest. The joint press conference is 20 minutes. Pictures are allowed. Recording is also allowed. They said no recording with a camera.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter Kim Jong Man rubbed the back of his head and talked about the rest of the e-mail.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the exclusive interview? There isn\u2019t one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is. The presidential suite of the Hudson Hotel. Camera recording is okay and 40 minutes. No questions about when he used to wander as a orphan. The interviewer needs to be someone who knows classical well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s done. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re telling us to pay for the exclusive interview. $20,000.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? $20,000?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 How many stations do you think there are that want to record an interview with Jun Hyuk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Park was surprised at the $20,000 amount for a moment, but he immediately started thinking about the competitors.</p><br/><p>\u201c3 national broadcasting stations. The small cable channels won\u2019t be trying to spend money to get an interview when they barely have any money\u2026 The big 3 cable channels. There will be about 6.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the culture news reporters counted them off on his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. Send a response. $150,000 for 1 hour. Ask for an exclusive for our station.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Sir! $150,000?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk too much. Just do as I say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter Kim Jong Man needed to rub the back of his head again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would Jun Hyuk do an interview for free? To promote his performance with the New York Philharmonic? How many people in Korea do you think will go to see him conduct?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Park spoke to all of the reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that Hollywood stars get paid when they\u2019re not promoting movies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t it still a bit too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter Kim Jong Man was still complaining and murmured carefully just in case Manager Park\u2019s hand came flying again.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo much? This guy here is too uptight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Sir, what does that mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Are you jealous that he does an hour-long interview and gets paid over $100,000? Why does how much he makes get you angry? It\u2019s the company\u2019s money. How much do you think we\u2019ll make after paying $150,000? They\u2019re saying he\u2019s the 21st century Beethoven! It\u2019s an exclusive interview with Beethoven. There are going to be tons of advertisements. Think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Park yelled at the culture news reporters again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys listen up too. Unless otherwise indicated, you\u2019re all dead if you say anything bad about Jang Jun Hyuk. You know how the nation is feeling about him right now, right? He\u2019s the first kid to be treated as a hero since skater Kim Yu Na. If you leave any marks on him, we\u2019ll be ground to dust. Keep that in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Jong Man needed to hide his sulking and write the e-mail again, and Manager Park ran to the department office to get approval for spending.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Are you crazy? $150,000? You asshole. My salary is only half of that. You want to use all of that in 1 hour? You\u2019re going crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Manager Park said the dollar amount, the culture newsroom Director started out by cursing at him. It is a relief that he did not throw anything at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, trust me. I\u2019m telling you this is jackpot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know that? But $150,000 is too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducing a 1-hour drama costs a minimum of $400,000. Do you know how much the fee for an MC of a variety program is? Jun Hyuk is the 21st century Beethoven. And it\u2019s an exclusive interview for 1 hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Park insisted that $150,000 is not that much money by comparing it to the fees of other big shows.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we a drama program? The entertainment station? This is the newsroom. The culture news on top of that. You say something like that when you know how much our cover fees are?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director was about to chase Manager Park out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, and get 40 minutes for $20,000. I\u2019m giving you that $20,000 after a lot of thought too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m saying we should hand this over to the entertainment station.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Entertainment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The entertainment station has a big budget, so they can handle $150,000. Can\u2019t we just use their material? Press time will only be 2 or 3 minutes at most anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>There is likelihood if it is the entertainment station. The Director\u2019s voice came down a few notches.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you said no entertainment? No tearful hardship stories, no gossip news. I thought you only have to talk about music? Are you going to do an entertainment segment with a documentary on classical music?\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not mention it, but the Director had another concern. He wondered if the entertainment station has an MC who could handle a the depth of an interview with a composer who tossed Beethoven a challenge and succeeded, and is a maestro conducting for the New York Philharmonic.</p><br/><p>But Manager Park already looked confident.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a suitable MC. He can easily talk about music alone for an hour and he\u2019s entertaining. Lastly, we have the best weapon. He\u2019s close with Jang Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Close? Does Jang Jun Hyuk have close people in Korea\u2026 Oh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he. What do you think? Isn\u2019t someone like Yoon Jung Su great?\u201d</p><br/><p>The culture Director threw the pen he was holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. You should have said that in the first place. Hurry up and get Yoon Jung Su on board before someone else gets him. I\u2019ll contact the entertainment station.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su is plenty. The 1-hour interview could be used in different segments: entertainment, newsroom, and even cultural education. $150,000 was starting to look smaller.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun prepared a New York Philharmonic CD to get Dimitri Carras\u2019 signature, and was excited to attend dinner.</p><br/><p>He became silent after getting a signature and picture, while President Stern and Maestro Carras discussed their schedule.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe New York Philharmonic committee wants 2 performances. Once in Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center\u2019s private concert hall, and once outside in Damrosch Park.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was going to do both performances outside if it weren\u2019t for the album recording since the capacity is almost doubled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damrosch Park is one of Lincoln Center\u2019s venues, and is 2.4 acre outdoor theater. It is the main stage of New York Fashion Week, that opens twice a year, and the place of the Midsummer Night Swing Festival (June 27 \u2013 July 16) with dancing and music.</p><br/><p>Maestro Carras was looking at a calendar in his pocket book and checking dates.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, how many days do you think rehearsals will take? The choral symphony won\u2019t be hard to get together because it\u2019s a regular in the New York Philharmonic\u2019s repertoire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s the New York Philharmonic. Won\u2019t 1 week be enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? I already started rehearsals once I received your score. We should be able to put it on stage after 2 weeks. Since Danny the violinist already performed, there won\u2019t be any problems there.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Stern was reluctant after hearing that the performance would be ready after 1 month.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we won\u2019t be able to hold the performance until 2 months pass since there are issues of promotions and album recording. We haven\u2019t even decided on a record label yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no harm in having plenty of time. Isaac, you and the committee can take care of that issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitri Carras looked at Jun Hyuk again and became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything else is okay, but I haven\u2019t heard your response yet. What do you think? You have no intention of playing the piano?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Is there really a need for me to play the piano? Aren\u2019t there a lot of amazing pianists? They would come swarming with just a phone call from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was still dawdling, but Dimitri Carras had been set on him as a pianist for a long time now. Unless there is an unavoidable circumstance such as if he broke his finger, he wants to put Jun Hyuk on stage no matter what.</p><br/><p>Beethoven played the piano while he conducted\u2026 He did not want to miss out on listening to the composer\u2019s piano.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you turning it down? I want to perform with the composer\u2019s piano. It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t play the piano or anything. Is there a reason to keep that incredible talent hidden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding it. I just want to hear how you interpret it. I\u2019m scared that if I play, there\u2019ll be a different color to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour thinking is opposite to mine. I want to perform with a piano and violin on equal footing. I want to hold a performance that is lively and rough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dimitri Carras showed a lot of confidence. The soloists\u2019 and conductor\u2019s interpretation might be different, but he trusts that the New York Philharmonic will be capable of a great ensemble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we try it out? We have a full 2 months to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s consent is more welcome to Yoon Kwang Hun than it is to anyone else. He cannot even remember when he last heard him play. And this is a concert with the New York Philharmonic.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! We get to see Jun as a pianist in Avery Fisher Hall? I\u2019m really anticipating it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsaac. And Maestro Carras. You can\u2019t say that the performance was ruined because of me. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isaac Stern recalled when he first met Jun Hyuk. He had played the piano for Laura Goldberg to sing to at Clayton-Hoffman School of Music\u2019s support association.</p><br/><p>A piano that erased himself and highlighted the singing. As soon as Isaac Stern heard that piano, he no longer heard the singing. Once he looked into Jun Hyuk later, he kept hearing that he is a genius composer.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Hyuk remains an excellent pianist in Isaac Stern\u2019s mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The music rights or advertisements that will arise\u2026 Anyway, you have to sign a contract like this to be able to continue going out on the program.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. You know those types of things well. You always brag that you were good in school\u2026 Didn\u2019t you say that you graduated from the best university in Korea and went to a really famous college in America too?</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk gave him a look full of suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you knew it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying I knew it. He he. Does it make sense that someone who was doing so well is now selling coffee in a cafe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! This kid. You want to see my diploma? There were a lot of waves in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh sure. Then you can handle the contract or whatever it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a separate problem. It\u2019s a legal issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLegal?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You and I are technically strangers. You need a guardian since you\u2019re still a minor\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Weren\u2019t you my guardian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to have that recognized by the country. That would be a legal guardian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we can just do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk carefully looked at Yoon Kwang Hun.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, there are two ways for me to become your legal guardian. One is to adopt you and become your father and the other is to just be your legal representative and custodian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut sir\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to everything I have to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun stopped Jun Hyuk with his hand as if he knew what he was going to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA legal custodian\u2019s rights as a guardian disappear automatically once you become an adult. After that, you would decide everything on your own. I am satisfied with being your legal custodian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He had thought for sure that Yoon Kwang Hun had thought of him as someone like his child, but now he was saying legal custodian. Jun Hyuk\u2019s face was full of disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruthfully, I think of you as my son but a father\u2026 it\u2019s a parent\u2019s duty to provide care from birth until adulthood. I didn\u2019t do this. If I were to act selfish, I would adopt you as my son, but I don\u2019t qualify.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir. You\u2019re the one adult adult who gave me a meal without expecting something in return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes flushed with tears as he felt Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s sincerity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this is getting depressing. Let\u2019s stop talking about it. Just know that I\u2019ll become your legal custodian. I was going to do that this year anyway. You need to make an ID card since you\u2019re 17 years old.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

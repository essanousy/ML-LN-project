Internet cafes, comic book cafes, or saunas. But if he\u2019s as dirty as you say he was, he probably wouldn\u2019t go to the sauna. Those kinds of kids also hang around the area with the prep schools. That way, they can mug middle school or elementary school students.\u201d</p><br/><p>All he had to go on was information from his young employee. Yoon Kwang Hun took his employee\u2019s word and walked around the prep school area.</p><br/><p>After wandering the area for a few days, he heard girls cry out in the direction of the main street. Teenagers were running from where the screaming had sounded.</p><br/><p>He spied the long hair of a boy running away. Yoon Kwang Hun was sure that it was Jun Hyuk and ran after him.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up kid. You didn\u2019t even get hurt that badly. Are you making a big deal out of a few scratches on your back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, mister.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk opened his eyes, he found himself lying in an unfamiliar room. He was disorientated at first, but quickly recalled yesterday\u2019s events.</p><br/><p>He remembered Yoon Kwang Hun yelling at the kids beating him to stop, but they both ended up getting hit. If it can be considered fortunate, it was fortunate that the beating did not last long because an adult had interfered.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you break a bone at your age, if you eat well\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun quickly stopped. Wasn\u2019t he like a stray cat, unable to eat properly? He couldn\u2019t talk about food to a child like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, sleep a bit more. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was closing the door to the tiny room, he stopped and left it wide open instead. Music accented with a compelling yet rough voice spilled through the door like sunshine coming through a window.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to the music carefully. Listen to how long it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLynyrd Skynyrd. This is probably the first time you\u2019re hearing it.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

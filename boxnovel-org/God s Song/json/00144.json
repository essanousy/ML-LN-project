It is a chartered plane where they did not have to be careful of other passengers.</p><br/><p>The conservatory deans were pleased with the results from support that were beyond their expectations. One party attendant in particular delightfully lent his private plane to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaura\u2019s song must have been really great. This kind of situation is a first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. I heard that President Stern gave a check for $500,000 at the party as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he thinking of scouting Laura? He might be since he\u2019s lending out his private plane like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The professors seemed to be excited by the results beyond their expectations and the overwhelming interest in Laura.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019ll scout her. He\u2019ll keep an eye on this Salzburg performance. If he confirms that she can overcome the pressure of the stage, he\u2019ll hand over a contract right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStern Corporation is really quick with discovering rookies. Well\u2026 I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why a third of classical greats use it as their management.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk heard what the professors were saying in passing and did not think the name Stern strange, but he did not remember who it was.</p><br/><p>Due to the private plane, they arrived in Salzburg without stopping in Vienna. Jun Hyuk went to the hotel he had reserved on the day that he decided to participate in the conductor auditions. The school reserved a hotel for the students, but Jun Hyuk wanted to stay on Getreidegasse street where Mozart\u2019s footprints lay.</p><br/><p>Goldener Hirsch Hotel was built as a motel in the 15th century. It has been preserved well for about 600 years. It was reborn as a hotel through much remodeling, and it is still one of the most beloved hotels in Salzburg.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk organized his luggage in the hotel and went out onto Getreidegasse street to enjoy the free time he was given until the next day.</p><br/><p>The street was full of tourists because of the summer festival, but the Mozart goods outnumbering those tourists caught his eye more. Chocolate was a definite, but there were even irrelevant items like empty water bottles with Mozart\u2019s portrait on them.</p><br/><p>The first place that Jun Hyuk headed is Mozart\u2019s birthplace.</p><br/><p>Mozart\u2019s long baptismal name \u2018Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart\u2019 on it was impressive. Amadeus amadera means \u2018God loves\u2019 in French. It is said that Mozart stuck it on himself.</p><br/><p>Countless items from Mozart\u2019s childhood are on display in his birthplace on Getreidegasse street. Among them are even Mozart\u2019s first clavichord (antecedent to the piano) and violin.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Hyuk did not see the handwritten scores that he had so wanted to see anywhere. He asked the museum curator where he needs to go in order to see the handwritten scores.</p><br/><p>The curator smiled brightly and started explaining amicably in fluent English.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, go to the airport. At the airport, you get a ticket to London, Paris, or New York. You can see them if you go to London\u2019s British Museum, Paris\u2019 Louvre, or New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Then you\u2019re saying that they\u2019re not here right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe do have a few scores from his childhood, but they have not been conserved very well so they are being restored. It has been a few years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn\u2026.. I was fooled.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>They did not stop practicing in Salzburg either. The scale is a lot larger because they were joined by the Mozarteum students and Professor Roger Neill\u2019s final inspections would go on until the day before the performance.</p><br/><p>About a week after arriving in Salzburg, Danny came to the hotel.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Danny found Jun Hyuk, he leapt and hugged Jun Hyuk to start dancing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw, right? I got in 3rd place. It\u2019s all thanks to you. It\u2019s a debt I can never repay. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations. All 6 runner-ups are at similar levels. The condition of that day is the problem. You did well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. You got Amelia\u2019s text?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. She said she\u2019s stopping in Prague for a performance before coming here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you. Even for a South American girl, I\u2019ve never seen such a fiery person like her. Her manager fit in another performance per a sponsor\u2019s request\u2026 There\u2019s no Queen of the Night like her. She made a huge fuss that she needs to get to Salzburg immediately\u2026.. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny\u2019s tone was of serious worry, not in jest.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a tame cat in front of me. She\u2019s only a tiger in front of others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny stared at Jun Hyuk in disbelief and Jun Hyuk\u2019s face turned red.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say that\u2019s true. Whew.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny pat Jun Hyuk on the shoulder as he let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. What\u2019s your itinerary like?\u201d</p><br/><p>The European tour for the over 20 runner-ups for each part in the competition needs to be over for them to return to America.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to perform 3 times while here for the festival, and then I have to go to Vienna. After that, it\u2019s all over once we tour Eastern Europe until August. How about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over once we perform in 10 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I guess you\u2019ll join us after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to not go, will I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny smirked. Jun Hyuk will also know well that he has no choice but to go. Danny pat Jun Hyuk\u2019s shoulder again.</p><br/><p>Danny went back to the dormitories for the runner-ups, and Jun Hyuk went to a cafe. It is a place called \u2018Tomaselli\u2019 that has been in business since the 1700s. It is said that Mozart also enjoyed going here, but Jun Hyuk did not believe these rumors anymore. All of the stores on Getreidegasse street say that Mozart was a regular there.</p><br/><p>\u201cJang Jun Hyuk!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was walking along the street when he was certain that he had heard his name in Korean. He turned and someone ran into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor. I\u2026 Hang on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk managed to pry Professor Jeon Hye Jin off of his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis punk. You should have called. What are you so busy with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. The thing is\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. That\u2019s that, but what are you doing here? Are you here to perform?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin was genuinely pleased with this unexpected encounter and could not stop smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s for a program called New York conservatory weekly. But why are you here, Professor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKid. I\u2019m a known pianist of Korea. I\u2019m invited every year. You underestimate me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh of course not. It\u2019s just so sudden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin took the hand of a tall girl standing next to her and brought her close.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. Say hi. This is my student. Ah, she\u2019s also performing this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. I\u2019m Han Ye Ji.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, hello. I\u2019m Jang Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid is a rising pianist in Korea right now. She won in the Spain Maria Canals Competition. She was really close in the Tchaikovsky Competition too. She\u2019s a 6th place runner-up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh I see. Congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk greeted her, Han Ye Ji hid her surprise and held her hand out for a handshake.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. But I had no idea that you would be that Jang Jun Hyuk. I just realized.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji\u2019s eyes grew larger from the first time she saw Jun Hyuk in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would be that Jang Jun Hyuk who appeared on that audition program. And\u2026 this is actually the 2nd time we\u2019re meeting, but I guess you don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>It is the first time Jun Hyuk is seeing her face no matter how he tries to rack through his memory. He is certain that he has never met a young Korean pianist.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Professor Jeon Hye Jin clapped her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. It\u2019s the 2nd time. Ha ha. What fate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not know what they were talking about, and just looked back and forth at their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. Do you remember? The first day I met you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you remember that a student pointed out the specialty in your piano playing at once?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I remember. She said that it was as if several people were playing instead of one. I was surprised too. Is this\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Ye Ji was that student. I started teaching her properly from then. I basically found a hidden pearl thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

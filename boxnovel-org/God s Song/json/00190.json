Welcome to BOZAR.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk and Tara arrived at the grand theater of BOZAR, an employee escorted them to the competition committee office. Once they exchanged greetings with the committee chairman and members and came out, Tara was laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of those people. This is\u2026 They look like they\u2019ve hit jackpot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJackpot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s hard to maintain a competition without sponsors. Something like Queen Elisabeth has a lot of sponsors, but they\u2019ll be tight on funds. But this time, they have you, the hot topic these days. Europe\u2019s cable channels, internet broadcasting. They\u2019ll have more sponsors coming in. They\u2019ll be free from funding constraints.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s money wherever you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Chicago Ballet Company was dismissed because it couldn\u2019t come up with $200,000. Even though the top ballerina\u2019s salary was $1 million. When that ballet company went under, the top ballerina went to a ballet company in L.A. for a salary of $500,000. Classical music is suffering from the ails of organizations going under while stars become richer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk listened to Tara and hurried to meet the head leading the Belgium National Orchestra.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome, Maestro Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Maestro Boulez.\u201d</p><br/><p>Contrary to Tara\u2019s worries, Pierre Boulez welcomed him with sincerity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI regretted not having been able to see you in Salzburg due to conflicting schedules, but it\u2019s an honor to get to meet you like this. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m more\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of things I want to ask you, but let\u2019s talk over time. Shouldn\u2019t we put out the urgent fires first?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was apparent that he was rushing the day, whether it is due to his personality or because the day really is busy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe orchestra has been configured of 112 people. I think this is enough to perform your choral concerto. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk matched up the Belgium National Orchestra\u2019s performance he heard yesterday with the organization of 112 instruments.</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about the BOZAR grand hall, don\u2019t you think it\u2019d be better to reduce it? By taking the sound stability into account.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pierre Boulez\u2019s eyes sparked. Is it because of his experience with the Boston Philharmonic? It is not easy for a rookie to think all the way to the theater\u2019s scale.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think under 100 would be perfect. Aren\u2019t there 2,200 seats in Henry le Boeuf?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the Sejong Center for Performing Arts has over 3,000 seats. Henry le Boeuf however is an old historical building and is \u2154 of the size, though it may have been of a large scale at the time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen inside the theater yet. The ceilings are high. It can easily take up to 112 people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk thought of an appropriate tone when he heard the CD yesterday, but he did not nitpick any further. He did not want to argue over subtle differences.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see. Good. I\u2019m sure you know the sound state of the hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. The choir is currently looking, but they\u2019re thinking of 150 people? What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow your thoughts on that as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pierre Boulez looked at Jun Hyuk for a moment and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exactly as the rumors said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that your ability to bring out the best is outstanding, so you don\u2019t really pay much attention to the details.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m like that because there\u2019s still a lot that I don\u2019t know, rather than having the ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even a disproportionate modesty. Pierre Boulez held back his laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can you tell me your view on the choral concerto?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything is in the score, including my views.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pierre Boulez\u2019s face hardened a bit at Jun Hyuk\u2019s unexpected answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cInterpretation is up to the performer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I take your song apart completely and interpret it in a new way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it another happiness of music to see another interpretation from you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Ha ha. Well, I\u2019ve taken a hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he first heard what Jun Hyuk said, he had thought that he might be competing with him. Once he saw that Jun Hyuk just wanted to see his music with different appearances, he saw Jun Hyuk in a new light in the way he thinks like a great.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. Then I won\u2019t ever look at your rehearsal. Don\u2019t watch mine either. Let\u2019s see how different our interpretations are. Isn\u2019t that part of the fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That is the fun. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with the same score, orchestra, and instruments, there are many cases where the music is entirely different just because the conductors, or performers are different.</p><br/><p>When Impressionist painter Monet was young, he drew a sunset landscape with 3 colleagues. They were given the condition that they need to draw as realistically as possible and drew the same scene, but the 4 completed paintings were completely different.</p><br/><p>Like this, objects are always different with the way different people interpret them. Pierre Boulez\u2019s heart beat when he thought of how the 2 versions of the choral concerto would ring out on the same stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we meet the orchestra first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pierre Boulez rose from his seat and led Jun Hyuk to the theater.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. Don\u2019t be too surprised with the way the orchestra reacts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are quite a few people who hate you. Including me. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk followed Pierre Boulez in puzzlement at this statement that was difficult to understand. When they went through the passage for personnel and entered the stage, the orchestra members jumped up from their seats when they saw Jun Hyuk and the maestro.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have finally met. This is Maestro Jun, who you have all been waiting for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk bowed to the orchestra and they burst out in passionate applause. It is a hearty welcome, far from the hate that Pierre Boulez mentioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? You were expecting a fearsome demon, but this handsome young man has appeared. On top of that, he\u2019s worn a Beethoven mask this time. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Belgium National Orchestra constantly worked hard to succeed in playing Inferno with Pierre Boulez, a devotee to contemporary music. They had thought that it would be possible to perform since the album came out, but they ended up giving up.</p><br/><p>Pierre Boulez had listened to the album and declared that they would be giving up. He admitted that he could not express the dim light of hope, and the orchestra had accepted it as well.</p><br/><p>The hate that Pierre Boulez had talked about is their respect for the wall Jun Hyuk had created that they cannot get over.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t today just to exchange greetings? You\u2019re on Tuesdays and Thursdays?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Then I\u2019ll go back now so I don\u2019t take anymore of your time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Are you really just going to go back? I heard that you showed tremendous magic in Boston.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was uncertain whether or not he was joking, but the orchestra members\u2019 eyes looked like that of cats who are asking for snacks.</p><br/><p>However, snacks are only given in training as rewards. Jun Hyuk laughed as he spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy powers are at their end right now. I\u2019ll recharge today and show you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk left the orchestra behind him and left the theater.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it? Your first meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 Even someone who loves Schoenberg can\u2019t dislike Beethoven. They\u2019re very benevolent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Arnold Schoenberg is the most influential composer of the first half of the 20th century. He is one of the people who put a stop to the major and minor base, and established the 12 tone technique.</p><br/><p>Even those who love Schoenberg\u2019s atonal music will cry from the emotion they feel from listening to Beethoven\u2019s piano sonata.</p><br/><p>Tara let out a sigh of relief. She had worried for no reason. They are also musicians who live for Mozart and Beethoven\u2019s music.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The orchestra members were excited for their first rehearsal for Choral Concerto. It had been a while since they had performed on such a large scale, and it had been a while since they had performed a masterpiece that went over 70 minutes. They need to perform alternating between 2 conductors a song that does not have pauses and is so full that just by looking at the score, they can tell that there is not even space for a needle to fit in. They were also anticipating the comparison between the 2 conductors.</p><br/><p>The conductor of the first rehearsal is the composer, Jun Hyuk. The members all looked to Jun Hyuk standing on the podium. They were anticipating what his first words would be.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the performance ahead of us, just keep 2 things in mind. The first is to completely forget Beethoven\u2019s Choral Symphony. It is a completely different song. If you perform this without being able to shake off the feeling of the Choral Symphony, you won\u2019t even be able to complete the 1st movement.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said that they would not be able to do it, but it is the conductor\u2019s meaning that he would not tolerate it. Jun Hyuk needs to embed in them that just as it cannot be said that a hippopotamus and water buffalo are the same animal just because they have the same weight, the songs are not the same because they have the same length and configuration.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second is the feeling that you must not forget for a second while you perform.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk wanted to explain to the orchestra exactly the feeling he wrote the song with. He thought for a moment because he could not explain it clearly without the words. Then he thought of the moment that any European would understand precisely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about the FIFA World Cup finals. Germany\u2026 no\u2026 Belgium and Brazil met in the finals. The winner is the winner of the World Cup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they are all performers who have gathered on soccer\u2019s continent, Europe, the way they are looking at Jun Hyuk became different. Furthermore, half of them are Belgian. It is a situation that they can understand completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe score is 2:2 until the second half. It is now overtime. Though it doesn\u2019t exist now, let\u2019s say that we are following the golden goal rule. The national players exert their superhuman strength and patience to run the ground. Constant passes, shooting. They are running and running just to score that one goal. The crowd prays earnestly. And 5 minutes later, there\u2019s a goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The orchestra members have already experienced games like this several times, so they could understand it easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe feeling of the crowd that had to watch this anxiously for 5 minutes. I\u2019m sure you understand well? We need to maintain that feeling for 70 minutes. The last verse of the chorus in the 4th movement is the explosive applause that comes from the goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The orchestra murmured. They do not even need to go all the way to the World Cup. How many games of 90 minutes and not 5 minutes had they watched in anxiety?</p><br/><p>The orchestra could understand Jun Hyuk\u2019s direction for conducting.</p><br/><p>\u201c70 minutes of performing felt like it had gone by in 5 minutes. It is a success if it receives this kind of review.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk picked up the baton and the orchestra members looked at their scores, waiting for the signal. The first movement of the baton was the whistle that starts the game. The vehement overtime of the World Cup finals started.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

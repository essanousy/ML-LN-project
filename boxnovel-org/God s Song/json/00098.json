Um Ki Jun did not lose his chance and spoke in passing,</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw some kids interested in contemporary music these days\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Among the students? Could that happen? They\u2019re all pretty similar. How could kids who stumble even with Debussy be interested in contemporary music?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Ju Yong Tae added to one professor\u2019s response pushing off Um Ki Jun\u2019s words lightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cMusic isn\u2019t the object of criticism and theory. It\u2019s a tool for emotion. Contemporary music plays the same role as a discussion, throwing a question. It can be used for research, but it\u2019s unreasonable to treat it as music itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The most old-fashioned Professor Ju dismissed everything with his continuing words,</p><br/><p>\u201cUm. I told you, didn\u2019t I? Don\u2019t look in that direction. We\u2019re overwhelmed just by trying to understand Bach, Beethoven, and Marlowe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, Professor. Of course. My taste isn\u2019t in that direction either. I just thought I heard something like that, so I was wondering if you might have given the students an assignment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kind of assignment would be fitting for a master\u2019s course. Wait a second\u2026 Um, you\u2019re a little suspicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Surely not. The subject of my Ph.D. thesis is Sibelius.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reaction they had expected. Um Ki Jun thought that there would be unnecessary misunderstandings if they kept discussing it, and quickly stopped. He decided it would be faster for Park Jin Kuk to do the search, and quit looking for the composer inside the school.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk went to the recording studio after getting a call from Jo Hyung Joong. The recording studio was reminiscent of a garbage dump when it greeted Jun Hyuk. The stairs going down to the basement had a few empty dishes from Chinese take-out and when he opened the door to go in, the first thing he saw was the sound engineer asleep on the sofa.</p><br/><p>Energy drinks and canned coffees were rolling around near the sofa and throughout the recording studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Jun Hyuk, you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You look\u2026 You look like you haven\u2019t even gone home in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Ah, that\u2019s all of us. We used to do this all the time, but to be honest, it\u2019s been easier these days because people only work on singles. I feel like I\u2019m really working for the first time in a while. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve had to work on 10 songs at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked so tired that his chubby face had become gaunt, but he looked happy. He is creating real music, not the kind that does not even cover the basics unless it was touched up with equipment, with its mechanical effects and a simple hook inserted repetitively.</p><br/><p>In order to receive the evaluation that it is an outstanding album, Jo Hyung Joong did not permit even the smallest mistakes and demanded perfection. Thanks to this, the staff he worked with were becoming zombies.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, listen to this first. It\u2019s the guitar you\u2019ll record. Let\u2019s talk after you listen to all of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took the CD from Jo Hyung Joong and listened to a total of 6 guitar instrumentals through headphones. An acoustic guitar melody rang through his head and he became lost in the music. Jun Hyuk listened to it a few times before taking the headphones off.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher. This guitar\u2026 Who performed it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s killer, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Who did it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Ham Chun Suk. Do you know who he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m hearing the name for the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet. The musical area he works in is a little different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ham Chun Suk.</p><br/><p>The best acoustic guitar session man from 1990 until now.</p><br/><p>When the best singers in the country needed an acoustic guitar, they always went looking for him. They looked for him even when they did not need an acoustic guitar to see if their song might be better with an acoustic guitar. It is common to see his name in albums that sold well in the country.</p><br/><p>It is also a fun fact that this expert in the guitar who sees it as a tool to relay emotion instead of technique, majored in singing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why is 6 songs it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince one song is heavy metal, I\u2019m going to leave it entirely up to you, and I arranged the other 3 songs without the guitar. And you know about the last song. We\u2019re going to end with a piano instrumental.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I see. But\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is there something you don\u2019t like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that of these, there are 2 songs that are so good I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need to play them again. Even if I play them again, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll come out better than this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Only 2 songs? Then you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll modify the other 4 songs? I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re the only person in our country who listened to Teacher Ham Chun Sung\u2019s guitar and said there\u2019s something to fix. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>After laughing for a bit, Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s eyes sparked.</p><br/><p>His name often appears in movies. He is great who gets paid just for listening to music and saying, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t need the guitar. It\u2019s good just like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that he could find something lacking in the guitar of Ham Chun Sung who expresses the beauty in marginals. It is wonderful to see how he develops everyday.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, should we start?\u201d</p><br/><p>The first song Jun Hyuk played in the recording booth was heavy metal. When he got to the middle, the sound engineer shook his head and tried to hit the stop button, but Jo Hyung Joong made a fuss.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Why? What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like the BPM went over 170. We arranged this to 150.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong lightly hit the back of the sound engineer\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being like this when you\u2019ve been doing this for so long? It\u2019s 150.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Isn\u2019t the guitar acting completely on its own? I think 170 is pretty low.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to keep doing this work? Don\u2019t you think you have to change this now? Man, it\u2019s not fast just grand. It\u2019s okay for a lay person to make that mistake, but you\u2019re a professional. How is it okay for you to not be able to tell the difference? And\u2026 you don\u2019t know that kid? He has a metronome embedded in his head.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk came out of the booth, the sound engineer could not look him in the eye and Jo Hyung Joong had a satisfied smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it too hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, no. It\u2019s hard but light. It\u2019s good. Let\u2019s use this the way it is for now\u2026 We can talk about it again if there\u2019s something to change in the completed song.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the following guitar and piano accompaniments were finished, Jo Hyung Joong could see a more matured Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk showed him what was lacking in Ham Chun Suk\u2019s guitar. He picked at the strings slowly, but he kept the flow going without a single disconnected note. It was to the point where he thought it was a waste to use as an accompaniment. This alone is excellent independent music.</p><br/><p>Today is a day full of regret for Jo Hyung Joong. It is the last day is he able to listen to Jun Hyuk\u2019s music alongside him. He did not know how he would hear Jun Hyuk\u2019s music going forward, but it would only be possible through a media like a CD.</p><br/><p>Studying abroad also meant that he was going into the world of classical, farther away from popular music.</p><br/><p>It could be that he is embarking on his own path. There is someone who assessed his Symphony No. 1 as nothing more than noise. However, Jo Hyung Joong was sure that if he received formal education and associated himself with others including the greats, there would be someone who appreciates his music.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, the kids are going to start coming in to sing tomorrow. What do you want to do? Do you want to come and watch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll listen to it once it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I guess there\u2019s no real reason to remember their faces. Their sounds will remain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Jun Hyuk left the recording studio, Jo Hyung Joong began to bother the staff again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even dream about the sauna until Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar is complete.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

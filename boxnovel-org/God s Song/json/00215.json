The first performance was much better. It was touching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you win the conductor no matter how stubborn you remain? And I liked both of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour piano\u2019s changed a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only heard how it was different, right? Look at the whole thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk knew what Yoon Kwang Hun was talking about. He would not have paid attention to the orchestra because of his changed piano.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the whole thing many times before you joined. Anyway, tomorrow\u2019s the rehearsal for choral symphony? Can I go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee it during the performance. It won\u2019t be as good if you see it in advance during rehearsals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was in a cold sweat just thinking about having Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s eyes on the back of his head in rehearsals.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy. Fine. Do well so I\u2019m not disappointed. I like the 2nd part of choral symphony the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun wanted to see Jun Hyuk scolding the New York Philharmonic, but he ended up just imagining it.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. A bit more\u2026 it could be hard to differentiate between elegance and arrogance. So you have to go deeper into it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rehearsal for choral symphony was stagnant because they could not get over the last river. He had adjusted the performances of each orchestra member, but there was something of the subtlest difference that was bothering Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>The members were equally frustrated. They had fully understood and grasped what it was that Jun Hyuk was looking for. There were times when they made mistakes on stage, but they were repeatedly giving perfect performances even though it is just a rehearsal.</p><br/><p>The chorus has not joined yet, but they had performed so well in rehearsals with the vocal soloists that they could say that it was perfect. Though it was not satisfying to the conductor.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk is not greedy. He realized something while recording with Laura Goldberg. Laura is someone who will become the greatest prima donna of this century, but she could not bring out the sound that he wanted. The New York Philharmonic is the best symphony orchestra, but he needs to admit that there is a limit.</p><br/><p>If he does not admit that there is a limit, it just becomes difficult for everyone. Jun Hyuk is learning to compromise with other musicians.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Danny almost clucked his tongue. Maestro Carras does not seem to be a Mediterranean person from Greece who enjoys a relaxed life.</p><br/><p>It is more fitting to think of him as a passive Italian.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, he\u2019s worse than you. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen such a sharp orchestra. Your conducting at the Queen Elisabeth Competition was like it would swallow the audience whole, but what we\u2019re doing now is going to reduce them to ashes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was surprised too. That old man is savage. There was a monster living inside of him. What do you think? Is it feasible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a bit dangerous. I have to do my own performance, but I feel like I\u2019m chasing the orchestra. We can\u2019t collapse like this\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>This is how aggressive Maestro Carras\u2019 conducting is. They have not spoken about their performing together since they exchanged opinions on Jun Hyuk\u2019s first piano performance. He silently leads the orchestra with slight mismatches between the piano, violin, and orchestra that seem to be done on purpose.</p><br/><p>Danny thought that it is a huge relief that he started practicing a month earlier. Furthermore, he is realizing that he is able to follow along with Maestro Carras\u2019 conducting because he is living in Jun Hyuk\u2019s apartment and being coached by the composer while practicing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it during rehearsals. And when you\u2019re done and go back to the apartment, practice again. Then, you won\u2019t be shaky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose advice is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConductor? Composer? Or performer? Who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny\u2019s joking question made Jun Hyuk cluck his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? This is the most basic thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk went into rehearsals everyday \u2013 one day as a conductor, one has as a pianist \u2013 and time went by quickly as he spent his time busily.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When there was only a week left until the performance, Jun Hyuk\u2019s walking to and from work became such a hot topic that it even made news. Nothing strayed from Tara\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>People waited for Jun Hyuk in front of his apartment building every morning and walked with him to Lincoln Center. There were more and more people who came with concert posters or Jun Hyuk\u2019s album to ask for signatures.</p><br/><p>The interesting part was that the people who walked with him everyday even took care of his security.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey there! You got a signature yesterday, too. Think of other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! What outlet are you a reporter for? Why are you blocking the street? There\u2019s only a week left until the concert. Are you going to take responsibility for it if he\u2019s late to rehearsals?\u201d</p><br/><p>People yelling like this enclosed Jun Hyuk to walk with him to Lincoln Center. Jun Hyuk became used to the faces he kept seeing, and expressed his familiarity. And he started getting used to the growing crowds. He realized that fans are not cumbersome, but people who love music or are anticipating his music.</p><br/><p>With the concert date near, there were no empty rooms in New York\u2019s hotels. Beethoven\u2019s name was the best marketing strategy and keyword.</p><br/><p>It overlapped with summer vacation, so other maestros arrived in New York and most students of New York music schools did not go back home for break.</p><br/><p>The New York Philharmonic\u2019s concert had become the highlight of this year\u2019s Midsummer Night Festival.</p><br/><p>The amount of equipment for recording and live broadcasting increased in the concert hall, and they had reached the end of rehearsals.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When there was not much time left until the concert, Yoon Kwang Hun stopped going to watch rehearsals. He knows well that everyone has become sensitive and having someone watch rehearsals would just be a bother.</p><br/><p>While Yoon Kwang Hun was drinking coffee alone in an apartment without Jun Hyuk and Danny, the front door opened with someone entering as though she lived there.</p><br/><p>A black haired woman in jeans and a short sleeve t-shirt was so surprised that her jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Amelia?\u201d</p><br/><p>A beauty with black hair, sharp nose, and big eyes. Yoon Kwang Hun realized that it is the face he saw in pictures from Jun Hyuk and the internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! Mr. Yoon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia had put her big suitcase down in the living room and been surprised to find Yoon Kwang Hun, but remembered talking to Jun Hyuk over the phone. He had told her that Danny would be performing with him and that Yoon Kwang Hun was staying at the apartment until the concert was over.</p><br/><p>Amelia ran to Yoon Kwang Hun without hesitation, embracing him as though seeing an old friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really wanted to meet you, Mr. Yoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I wanted to meet you as well, Amelia. I see you\u2019ve come because of Jun Hyuk\u2019s concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun pulled Amelia\u2019s arms from around his neck, and laughed awkwardly. An old man from Korea is not used to such friendliness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I took off time for about 2 weeks. Of course, I need to see the performance. It\u2019s Jun and the New York Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun sat Amelia on the living room sofa and made coffee in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re really busy even in the off season.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do about it. It\u2019s because of my contract with a sponsor. During season, it\u2019s Asia, Europe, and North America. Off-season, it\u2019s touring South America including my home country Argentina. Fortunately, my contract with the sponsor is over next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia looked bittersweet that her contract would be over.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you\u2019ll sign on with a new sponsor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun gave her the coffee cup and she sipped on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve had a few offers from sponsors in Europe. I\u2019ve released a few albums and the reactions to my performances are still good\u2026 I\u2019m going to make it a condition with the new sponsor that they can\u2019t get involved with my touring schedule, though the money I receive will probably decrease drastically.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of Jun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Even now, we\u2019re seeing each other face-to-face for the first time in a year. I would like to spend some more time with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though they had been apart for a long time, Amelia had made great efforts to maintain her affection for Jun. Yoon Kwang Hun heard from Jun Hyuk that Amelia\u2019s sponsor is one of the top companies in Argentina. The sponsorship would have been immense, but she is giving that up.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun could get a glimpse at how Amelia feels for Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>But what about Jun Hyuk?</p><br/><p>He did not seem to be making much of an effort and he did not show yearning for Amelia. He lives with satisfaction as long as he has music in front of him.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s face was not bright, and Amelia did not miss this.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Did something happen to Jun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia\u2019s face immediately became dark. Jun Hyuk\u2019s erratic phone calls had been bugging her. Amelia looked at Yoon Kwang Hun and asked cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething happen to Jun\u2026? Oh ha ha. Don\u2019t misunderstand. There\u2019s nothing like that. And Jun doesn\u2019t have the personality to chase girls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew. I thought\u2026 I thought maybe.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yoon Kwang Hun saw Amelia brighten up again, he realized that even though she is a star pianist who stands under a spotlight on a stage in front of countless people, she is still just a young girl.</p><br/><p>They talked for a while over coffee. Amelia told him all about how she and Jun Hyuk met because of a harmonica and Bach\u2019s cantata, to the performance at Clayton and their travels every weekend.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you make such a controversial statement at the Tchaikovsky Competition? You didn\u2019t have to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the truth. My piano was upgraded all because of Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun saw that Amelia\u2019s eyes sparkled every time she spoke about Jun Hyuk, and could feel how strong her affection is for him.</p><br/><p>There is something that he had been resolved that he would not tell Amelia even if he were to meet her one day. But seeing her affection for himself, his resolution came crashing down. He thought that this must be how a parent feels.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmelia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld people like me need to use few words. Especially when talking to young people. It\u2019s because we start to give sermons instead of holding a conversation. That\u2019s how people become old.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the type who likes to listen to sermons from old people. It\u2019s okay. You can say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cA young genius is cool and romantic because he shows you things that other people can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Jun, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s cool. I too fell for him when he was 15 and memorized all of Marlowe\u2019s symphony after hearing it once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia remembers the moment she fell for Jun Hyuk as well. The shock and bliss she felt when a skinny Asian boy changed her piano at once. It was the moment when it was just the two of them playing the piano in a practice room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a word omitted before most geniuses. It\u2019s \u2018young\u2019. But Jun is just a person even if he is getting older.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. No one can avoid it, even geniuses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Up to here, Amelia had been expecting the obvious statement to keep their unchanging affection.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think a middle-aged genius will be like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? A middle-aged genius?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you ever imagined it? A genius who is 40 or 50 years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia had never thought about it, but realized that Jun Hyuk\u2019s genius would not change, and only his body would age.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019ve never thought about a 40 year old genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA genius needs to die young to become a legend because it\u2019s tragic but romantic. No one thinks that a middle-aged genius is romantic. No. They don\u2019t call that person a genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do they call him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA madman. Or a monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? A madman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia looked at him with surprise. He is like a father to Jun Hyuk, but she knew that they are not blood-related. But he and Jun Hyuk are the same in how they surprise people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no longer cool or romantic. And since he was a genius since he was young, he will have succeeded beyond wanting more by the time he is middle-aged. That includes wealth, fame, respect, and achievements. He won\u2019t need to have a sense of what others are thinking and feeling\u2026 Everyone will look up to him and be envious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun stopped talking and hesitated again. He now needs to say what he really wants to. He does not know how Amelia will take it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHis nature as a monster that will come out from then on. He\u2019ll try to create music that most people could not even imagine. Why? Because he has everything! All that\u2019s left is what he alone knows, and he\u2019ll jump through hoops to make that music a reality. It\u2019ll be like the old kings of the past who tried to live forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia listened to Yoon Kwang Hun silently. She does not know what he is trying to say yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though that could never happen. It would only be possible if Jun Hyuk had someone who is like a copy of him. Jun Hyuk will probably need 200 clones of himself. He\u2019ll make music beyond what Inferno was and those clones will be necessary to play that music with an orchestra.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia thought that Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s worries were severe, but she could understand. Don\u2019t parents always worry about nothing?</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 Do you want to take a look at this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun took Amelia to the studio inside the house. He turned on Laura Goldberg\u2019s CD and gave Amelia the scores for the 5 songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, listen to this. You\u2019ll be able to understand what I\u2019m saying after listening to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun quietly closed the door and went into the living room alone. He had felt from a long time ago that Jun Hyuk is never satisfied.</p><br/><p>The ecstatic expression he has after completing a song starts to change little by little from the moment the score is put in someone else\u2019s hands. And he is in a hurry to hide his disappointment when the end result comes out. Everyone thought of and accepted that as another aspect of Jun Hyuk\u2019s genius.</p><br/><p>The first time Jun Hyuk revealed his true thoughts is regarding Laura\u2019s aria, that it is 70%.</p><br/><p>If such a great result is 70%, what is the percentage he has been satisfied with until now? It is nerve wrecking just to think about.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun could be sure after Laura\u2019s recording. Jun Hyuk is living without being able to be satisfied with the music in his life.</p><br/><p>After 30 minutes, Amelia opened the door and came out with a flushed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yoon. This\u2026 Is this Jun\u2019s work? With Laura Goldberg singing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. How was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLaura was this amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun wrote it when he had time during the Queen Elisabeth Competition, and the recording was done in a month. Of course, Jun directed it. It\u2019s great, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia\u2019s expression was one of astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun\u2019s works are always beyond expectations, so there\u2019s nothing left to say about that. But Laura\u2019s aria is really\u2026 I now realize why Jun was raving about her. It was a perfect bel canto aria.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s without an accompaniment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. It was hard to believe that it was without an accompaniment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia had still not recovered from the shock. Yoon Kwang Hun needed to say something more surprising to Amelia.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Jun said that Laura\u2019s singing only met 70% of his standards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? 70%?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia seemed more surprised about the 70% than she had been with Laura\u2019s singing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow can you understand what I\u2019m saying? Jun is the type of person who says that this kind of singing is only 70%. He\u2019ll try to fit in with others now, but those complaints are going to stack up and explode one day. That\u2019ll be when he has gained everything but music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia was speechless for a while. She finally understood why Yoon Kwang Hun was saying that Jun Hyuk might become a monster.</p><br/><p>She spoke cautiously to Yoon Kwang Hun,</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell me why you\u2019re telling me this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you to prevent him from becoming a madman, since it might be impossible. But if you love Jun and you are going to continue loving him, I\u2019m asking you to keep loving a Jun who might become a monster. I said that I\u2019m 40 years old, but that time might come faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amelia did not say anything for a while, got up from the sofa, and placed a light kiss on Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I know why Jun is so wise.\u201d</p><br/><p>She sat back down and spoke slowly,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how wacky Jun will become, but I won\u2019t forget what you said today. And I can\u2019t promise that I\u2019ll root for and love him while he\u2019s being called a monster, but I promise that I\u2019ll make the effort to keep loving him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is plenty. Anything beyond that is greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun looked at Amelia\u2019s beautiful face and could not stop thinking that it would be better if Jun Hyuk loved her a little more.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

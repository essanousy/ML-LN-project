Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s studio was in the midst of mastering the track for release.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, you\u2019re here? You had a rough time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile did not disappear from Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s face as he welcomed Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, things like this happen in life. Let it all go if it\u2019s been taken care of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong spoke with a backpack over his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to do this as soon as you get here, but let\u2019s go out. We need to work from another place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo record the 16 instrument orchestra. We don\u2019t have a recording booth large enough to fit 16 people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a booth that fits 16 people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. There are places abroad that are large enough to fit entire orchestras. The studio we\u2019re going to now can fit around 20 people. They usually record movie OSTs there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Orchestral accompaniments are usually recorded once the MIDI operations are completed and each instrument is recorded separately. One violinist played the 1st and 2nd violin. They did not play together to record, but played separately and combined the tracks.</p><br/><p>However, there were times when everyone recorded together in order to express the full emotion. The disadvantage was that as there were more people playing, they needed to keep replaying the piece if anyone made a mistake. Therefore, the cost and time made it common to record by track.</p><br/><p>A recording studio in Gangnam had a booth that looked like a compact concert hall as if showing that it was used for recording tracks in movies. The 16 performers were already tuning their instruments in the studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Jo, let us know whenever there\u2019s something you don\u2019t like. Aren\u2019t we just instruments that are part of this music?\u201d</p><br/><p>The senior violinist who was the Concertmaster exchanged greetings with Jo Hyung Joong with humility. Though their fields were different, Jo Hyung Joong was an overwhelming presence as a producer in popular music. Jo Hyung Joong was not someone to underestimate even in the world of classical.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind. Is there anything for me to touch? I\u2019m sure something like this will be easy for you. And this is Jun Hyuk, the pianist and arranger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Concertmaster was surprised when he heard that Jun Hyuk was the arranger and pianist. This was the person who had made news on broadcast and online this week. He assumed that he would be good on the piano, but did not think that he would be able to arrange music.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this is him. I thought he would be shy because the MIDI file I received was light\u2026 but his image is so different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s image was so different from that of ordinary arrangers who locked themselves in the recording studio and wrestled with the master keyboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good. His looks are good and his music is as good as his looks. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Concertmaster laughed for a bit and took his place to start playing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is going to command?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man just now is going to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a violinist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Since the song is short and simple\u2026 the senior violinist usually takes the lead. There isn\u2019t someone to command.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s face turned dark at Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. This song is easy to lose the timing in without a commander\u2026 I guess they\u2019re really skillful performers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we brought in A class people. They\u2019re performers of Fine Philharmonic. They\u2019re fairly famous. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The performers who had been facing the two people saw the Concertmaster nod lightly to them to send them a signal as he began to move his bow with power.</p><br/><p>When the elaborate stringed instruments started and the introduction ended with 2 verses as though fireworks had gone off, Jun Hyuk got up from his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, let\u2019s go. I think it\u2019ll be better to do the MIDI operations and make the orchestra parts with the equipment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why\u2026 Why do you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong stuttered as he looked up at Jun Hyuk in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can we expect from performers who can\u2019t even read the scores? I don\u2019t need to hear anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The performers who had been watching Jun Hyuk\u2019s actions and words, stopped playing. Their faces were more distorted than the surprised face of Jo Hyung Joong.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Hold on. What did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Concertmaster could not hold back any longer and yelled while the rest of the performers looked on in disbelief. They had never even heard such insulting words from the conductor. The machines are better? They could not read the score?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear me? I said that you can\u2019t even read the score properly. Did you hear me well this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>They could not believe Jun Hyuk who was yelling with a frown. No arranger made a judgment after just two verses no matter how the music did not come out the way they had intended.</p><br/><p>They could not just stand back and watch if he was just copying a maestro he had seen in a movie or drama.</p><br/><p>There were a few performers who had left their seats, and the Concertmaster came storming at Jun Hyuk with his violin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere there, let\u2019s all calm down. Since Jun Hyuk arranged this song, let\u2019s listen to his opinion first. Jun Hyuk, you have to explain carefully. It\u2019s rude if you act like this all of a sudden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong grabbed Jun Hyuk\u2019s wrist and blocked him from the Concertmaster. From the Concertmaster\u2019s stance, it seemed like he might throw his fist. He needed to get out of this troublesome situation. It was social etiquette to respect each other when they were not friendly and had met for the first time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How can you do this so suddenly? What are we going to do about the customers if you cancel when we\u2019ve been advertising with flyers for a month? Customers are already taking their seats!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss. Please be considerate of our circumstances. It\u2019s our first broadcast request in 4 years. We came here urgently because the person who was supposed to go on broadcast canceled last minute as well. How can we miss this opportunity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. Isn\u2019t that a program that doesn\u2019t even get high viewer ratings? And\u2026 how can Kim Jung Soo go on that program at that age? That\u2019s where trot elders in their 60s go to make petty cash. Are you crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot today. Pop singers from the 70s and 80s were also included today. Anyway, please excuse us just this one day. In exchange, we\u2019ll promise two free shows next month. Okay? Let\u2019s hang up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun tried calling Kim Jung Soo\u2019s manager again who had hung up, but only got the answering machine. He nervously put the receiver down and pulled out a cigarette.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many people are here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter standing anxiously next to Yoon Kwang Hun eyed him apprehensively.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t very many tables as it\u2019s still early. Boss, what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can we do! Take down all of the flyers outside and post an apology that today\u2019s performance isn\u2019t happening at the entrance. And you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stand at the entrance and tell the people coming in that today\u2019s show has been pushed to next week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took his anger out on his young employees. The young employees stood with their heads hanging as if they had done something wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and inform the people who have already ordered food and don\u2019t charge them for the food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee left and Yoon Kwang Hun took a drag of his cigarette.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn damn damn, I need to stop doing this crap too. I\u2019m getting too old for this.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

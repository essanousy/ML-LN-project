We need to start working on preparing promotions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew. I trust that you scheduled the least you could.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot the least, but in moderation. Excluding Brussels since it\u2019s a competition, this can be called your debut performance, right? We need to start it in the grandest manner possible and end successfully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk fully understood the management agency\u2019s role until now. The most important thing is to trust each other. All he needs to do is trust Tara and President Stern, and go with them in the direction they lead him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne day for shooting the poster. Clips to insert into a promotional video and the remaining interview. The last interview is with the Korean press.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara stuck a print out of the week\u2019s schedule on the refrigerator so that Jun Hyuk could check it whenever he wanted to.</p><br/><p>The photographer in charge of the poster shoot and director taking over the promotional video smiled brightly as soon as they saw Jun Hyuk. They kept saying \u2018good\u2019 even as they were in the midst of shooting.</p><br/><p>Most conductors are past middle-aged, so they cannot get full shots. It is always hard work because they need to find the angles where they will not shoot their bulging bellies.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk on the other hand, is optimal for shooting a poster with his tall height and lean body. They were able to finish up easily because they could keep shooting without considering the angles too much.</p><br/><p>As America is the magazine heaven, there was a tremendous amount of magazines and media lined up for interviews.</p><br/><p>There were the usual magazines with expertise in classical music like Gramophone, The Classic, Symphone, BBC Music, but also those in various genres like pop music like Guitar World, Billboard, Rolling Stones, Jazz Time. There were also the inevitable press like the New York Times.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, all of the questions were regarding music and anything beyond that was only about his girlfriend Amelia.</p><br/><p>The questions he received most were about his statement on Beethoven and his interpretation of the choral concerto. Rather than compare himself to Beethoven, he made the reporters speechless by delving deeply into Beethoven\u2019s music.</p><br/><p>He pointed out the sounds of each instrument in the melody of a certain verse of a particular opus and part, so the reporters did not have the ability to refute or add to this with questions. This depth of conversation is only possible with another conductor.</p><br/><p>Interviews with pop music magazines were much easier and more comfortable. They did not care about his statement on Beethoven. Their greatest interest was in his plans in the realm of jazz, rock, and the blues.</p><br/><p>There are a lot of fans waiting for Jun Hyuk who had released one jazz album and one heavy metal album before going over to the world of classical.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun woke up early every morning and ran a lap around the park. He carried out his daily routine, recalling his former life in America.</p><br/><p>Once he took a shower and had a light breakfast, he disappeared. Jun Hyuk thought he was touring the city, but knew that could not be right because he had lived in America for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut sir, where do you go everyday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? I didn\u2019t tell you? Lincoln Center.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLincoln Center? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo watch the rehearsals. New York Philharmonic, New York Pops Orchestra, Opera House. I watch their rehearsals in turn everyday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is that because Maestro Carras said you could go anytime? You have to stop after going once or twice. How could you go everyday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey! I\u2019m not that much of a wretch. I\u2019m going as someone with a premium membership.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun saw that Jun Hyuk was surprised, and waved his hand to tell him not to worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the premium membership, you\u2019d have to pay quite a lot of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was a gold member when I was living in America a long time ago. My records were still there, so they renewed that for me. I didn\u2019t pay as much as I did back then of course, but they made me a premium member even though I gave a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most symphony orchestras including Korea\u2019s Seoul Philharmonic provide more services with membership support registration.</p><br/><p>General members are those who have purchased for the regular performance season. Season passes are discounted by as much as 50%. Premium members are those who have paid more than the amount for the regular performance season in donations.</p><br/><p>Premium members have the privilege of going to rehearsals whenever they want to. They can watch from afar in the empty seats or watch from outside the room. Higher members are able to go backstage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what privilege the person who pays the most for the New York Philharmonic gets?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrivilege? There are things like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re going to be amazed when you hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun looked at Jun, who was full of curiosity, and looked as if he were telling a secret.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the New York Philharmonic, you have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to become the top member. That member\u2026 goes on stage for the winter concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Is that true? Does that person watch the performance on stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. If it\u2019s the winter concert, of course it\u2019s Beethoven\u2019s choral symphony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Most are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person becomes someone playing an instrument.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. How can a normal person perform?\u201d</p><br/><p>What kinds of people are the orchestra members? They are professionals who would receive hundreds of dollars per hour of lessons. There is no way that someone would be allowed to stand among these people just by paying a lot of money.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. The person really does go on stage with an instrument. It\u2019s the triangle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The triangle is a very important instrument in the 4th part of the choral symphony. It blends in with the piccolo and that soft sound is superb. It is also an instrument that someone can handle as a runner with enough practice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he. Of course not just anyone does it. They put the sponsor among the top class that they want, on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to try it too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think I could do it. I might die of a heart attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun is waving his hand, but his expression showed that he was already imagining himself holding the triangle.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Korean press and broadcast interview has been decided. 20 minutes joint conference. An exclusive interview for 1 hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1 hour? What do I do for an hour?\u201d</p><br/><p>If there are 3 broadcasts, it is a total of 3 hours. Jun Hyuk\u2019s head hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Instead, it\u2019s just 1 place. There will only be questions on music. There will be bits and pieces of what happened in Salzburg and Brussels, but do it comfortably because there won\u2019t be awkward questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cumbersome is over after this interview tomorrow. Laura Goldberg, who is still in Brussels for gala concerts, will be coming back to New York after 2 or 3 days.</p><br/><p>There is 1 month until rehearsals with the New York Philharmonic start. Thinking of the fun he will have writing music during that time, he could not wait to be done with the interview.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. Since we don\u2019t know Korean, your lawyer Catherine Lim will also be present. She\u2019ll end it right away if something weird comes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about you, Tara?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll be there too. If there\u2019s anything you need while you\u2019re doing the interview, just tell me. And I was going to ask for the questions in advance, but didn\u2019t. You can just interview confidently as you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Jun Hyuk interview, Tara had seen that Jun Hyuk is capable of getting through the questions as long as they are professional. They no longer need to avoid the press.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut who\u2019s the exclusive interview with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cK station.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk had been thinking that the exclusive had been with a music magazine, and frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. There are a lot of cases with Korean broadcasting stations where comedians conduct the interviews.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComedians?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. There are a lot of cases where they aren\u2019t professional and only ask about gossip or overdo it to force laughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s included in the conditions too. The interviewer needs to have knowledge about music. We\u2019ll cut it as soon as it starts looking like a comedy talk show. You don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Tara was reassuring Jun Hyuk, the doorbell rang. When she checked the monitor at the entrance and opened the door, lawyer Lim So Mi came in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Jun Hyuk. It\u2019s been a while for us, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMrs. Lim. How have you been?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lim So Mi seemed to be surprised with the changes in Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou change drastically every year. You\u2019re conducting the New York Philharmonic now? At this rate, you\u2019ll be a standing conductor by next year. Anyway, you\u2019re really impressive. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro Carras is still alive and well. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll stick around for another 10 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Do you have it picked out as your spot in 10 years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lim So Mi laughed as she looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how about Mr. Yoon? He\u2019s not here? We only spoke over the phone and haven\u2019t met before\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s stamping his time card at Lincoln Center.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLincoln Center?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s living for the fun of watching orchestra rehearsals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara was watching them speak for a while in Korean when she spoke up,</p><br/><p>\u201cCatherine. Thank you for helping us like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. This is part of my job too. It\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe interview tomorrow will be conducted in Korean, so we really need for you to be able to react quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at the interview on BBC\u2019s homepage, he\u2019s an expert now. I think he\u2019ll do really well. I\u2019ll just translate for you Tara\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>There is just one thing that the two of them are worried about. Often, there are reporters who throw provocative questions to try to raise emotions and get a scoop. They just have to prevent Jun Hyuk from giving harsh responses.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

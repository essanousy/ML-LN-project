More than that, do well with the recording tomorrow. Alex hasn\u2019t decided on whether or not he\u2019s going to release a record with Violon yet. He\u2019ll decide once he sees what happens tomorrow. Do a good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Aren\u2019t you coming with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIli is going to do the producing himself tomorrow. I can\u2019t tell if he has a lot of expectations for you or if he\u2019s trying to find your shortcomings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Coline\u2019s face became dark as soon as Jun Hyuk said that he would not be producing for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m going to get $25,000. I need to do that much work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to be doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either. I\u2019ll find out once I get there tomorrow. Alex told me to look forward to it, but I can\u2019t even guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone left their instruments at the hotel and went to the Santa Monica beach. They were going to each dinner while looking out at the wide and open sea in order to let go of their tension. It would not do any good to worry, and they need to rest comfortably at least today.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk and his party went to the cafeteria on Santa Monica beach and ate burgers for dinner with beer.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of women who would join them if they offered, but they only ate. Coline\u2019s eyes flit back and forth, and he dragged everyone back to the hotel. They need to get plenty of sleep to be in the best condition.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s first night in LA was tame.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Violon\u2019s recording at 1 in the afternoon started with conducting by Ili Gotez. His image of complaining in New York was gone and he showed the sharp ears he has as a famous producer.</p><br/><p>Stop. Hey, the guitar tone is high! I told you to bring it down a little.</p><br/><p>Hey! Drums. Are you going to break the cymbals? You know how much those cost? You can\u2019t play them a little more gently and lightly?</p><br/><p>Coline. Are you joking with me right now? If it\u2019s hard to play together, record separate tracks. Our engineers are the best at mixing in the world. Of course recording separately would be evidence that you don\u2019t have the skill to be a band?</p><br/><p>Coline and the band members realized how kindly and precisely Jun Hyuk had done their directing. He gave an exact number like 1.3 when matching the tone, and he would demonstrate things like the drum cymbals himself. When the entire sound was off, he even had the subtlety to point out where the issues were by part.</p><br/><p>In the world of professionals however, they need to catch what the producers are asking for on their own. They need to understand what the producers are saying to become professionals at the same level.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk said that they would work on one song a day, five songs over five days, but it was looking like Ili would work on one song over five days.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlex, what am I working on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk entered Alex Zakin\u2019s recording studio. Two sound engineers were sitting in front of the console box, inspecting the equipment.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry directing one song today. This song alone is worth $25,000. Do it well because if you don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to charge claims.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alex Zakin winked and seemed ready to watch a fun show. The fun show appeared when the door opened and a musician entered with cigarette smoke.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk did not recognize the black man in glasses who was shaking hands with Alex Zakin. Foreigners all look similar to him. And it was common for album covers to have irrelevant pictures instead of the performer\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, you don\u2019t recognize him? Say hello. This is Stanley Clarke. Clarke, this is the producer who\u2019s going to kick your ass today. His name is Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>The kind-looking man who Alex Zakin introduced held out a hand, but Jun Hyuk was standing dumbfounded ever since he heard the name Stanley Clarke.</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke, a fusion jazz great who has not stopped his activities from the 70s until now.</p><br/><p>Born in 1951 Philadelphia, he is a bassist known as the starting point for existing electric bass techniques. He learned to play the violin when he was young but he took up the electric bass as he became a high school student. Since his 20s, he began to create his own world of music with the jazz greats.</p><br/><p>His powerful performances are contemporary jazz achievements that made the bass into an instrument of melody instead of rhythm.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked so out of his mind that it seemed he did not believe the reality that he was looking at the real Stanley Clarke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing? I heard Asians are polite\u2026 You\u2019re just looking at the hand this old man\u2019s holding out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man? I can\u2019t forgive that even from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk finally came back to his senses after hearing the two men joke around, and quickly grabbed Stanley Clarke\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, Mr. Clarke. I just couldn\u2019t believe it\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Stanley Clarke could not know it, but he might as well be a teacher to Jun Hyuk. Stanley Clarke, Jaco Pastorius, and Victor Wooten. He had taught himself to play the bass guitar while listening to the music of these three eminent bassists. The music that they recorded 40 years ago lept over time to team a young boy in Korea.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, well. Isn\u2019t this too polite? Just call me Stanley.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk could not hide his excitement and explained that he practiced the bass while listening to Stanley Clarke\u2019s music and that he is basically a teacher to him. When his excitement abated, Stanley Clarke laughed in good spirits.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. I heard you play, and it can\u2019t be compared to me in my teens. You didn\u2019t learn, you referenced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere there. Stop the cheesy compliments and let\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Alex\u2019s words to start working, Stanley Clarke frowned and Jun Hyuk blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what do you mean by work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would it be? Since a musician came to a recording studio, it\u2019ll be recording. You\u2019re directing Stanley\u2019s performance today. Do well because it\u2019s a 6-minute song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Are you saying the song we\u2019re recording today is\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t think you can do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. It\u2019s just how could I do Stanley\u2019s\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk waved the notion away. If he been told to direct Beyonce\u2019s music, he would have been able to accept it with confidence. Stanley Clarke is one of the musicians that Jun Hyuk respects.</p><br/><p>The frowning Stanley Clarke lit a cigarette again and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jun. I already heard the music you recorded. I think your skills will be much better than that of reckless Alex over here.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

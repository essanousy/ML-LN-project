You\u2019re saying a lawyer met Jun Hyuk last night, right? Leave him alone today. Just say he\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik had an ominous thought once he hung u</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll play the rock version first.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Jun Hyuk sat in front of the drums in the recording booth, the producer and composers working with Jo Hyung Joong rubbed their sleepy eyes and started watching.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s music had already aired throughout parts of \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Star\u2019. They had been surprised at the 10 seconds shown of Jun Hyuk on the drums, but this was the kid that Jo Hyung Joong had raved about. Everyone wanted to see how impressive he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, he doesn\u2019t need a metronome?\u201d</p><br/><p>The engineer preparing to record saw that Jun Hyuk did not have an earphone in his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave him. He\u2019ll be able to play one song on beat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong signaled to Jun Hyuk,</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, you can start since everything is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk started to swing the drumsticks with force. Everyone focused on the performance, but it was not the drum they had expected. It was a plain drum, maintaining a very simple beat.</p><br/><p>The only thing unusual about it was that this simple drumming went on for 8 minutes.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk finished his performance and came out of the booth, the sound engineer and Jo Hyung Joong had puzzled expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it too monotonous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Uh\u2026 No. It was really breezy. It\u2019s good. But Jun Hyuk, 8 minutes is too long. It\u2019s a song to perform. No matter how famous the song is, there isn\u2019t an audience willing to hear 8 minutes of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 12 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe whole thing is 12 minutes. In the middle, there are going to be two points without the drums and just the bass and guitar\u2026 I held those places in the middle of the drum.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had not even realized that he held spots in the performance because he kept repeating the same simple rhythm. But 12 minutes?</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, it\u2019s too long anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen listen to the whole thing and shorten it for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk went back into the booth and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bass goes first\u2026 the guitar is second, first, I\u2019ll play them like this twice.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bass and second guitar were also plain. The bass did have a funky rhythm, but there was none of the grandeur shown on the piano.</p><br/><p>The last performance started. The performance beginning in glissando (holding strings down with left string while transferring a sound as if sliding) excited everyone watching.</p><br/><p>It was fast and magnificent. He played so quickly that the right hand picking the guitar was almost invisible, and the left hand was pressing and pulling the stainless steel strings freely as though they were rubber bands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs\u2026 Is he really 17 years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 thought so. How old was he when he first picked up a guitar pick?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had said that the instruments he knew how to play were the guitar, drum, and piano. He started with music 2 years ago. Just from his performance skills, this was impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this is what a performance is. That kid really is impressive. How can he do it in one go without a single mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJo Hyung Joong spoke after seeing the recording studio staff who could not stop admiring Jun Hyuk\u2019s performance,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard that as a perfect performance without any mistakes?</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe made a few mistakes. He\u2019s just passing the minor mistakes. It\u2019s fine as long as it has the effect he wants. That kid\u2019s not an amateur. Amateurs only have the thought that they can\u2019t make mistakes whether they\u2019re singing or playing an instrument.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong shared an episode from his past,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve recorded Kwang Suk before. Listening to this, I\u2019m thinking of Kwang Suk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about Kim Kwang Suk who passed away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. That was when he performed in Daehak-ro everyday. He was recording his new song holding an acoustic guitar and his voice was cracking. We still couldn\u2019t stop the recording. Even that cracking voice made us ecstatic. Music is like that. If it\u2019s full of atmosphere and that atmosphere comes out, it\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s satisfied expression did not go away.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk came out of the booth after completing all of the pieces, Jo Hyung Joong applauded him sincerely. He had been a musician for over 20 years. Though he heard the drum, bass, and guitar parts separately, he already heard them as a complete song in his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you start learning to play instruments? It\u2019s as if you were born holding a guitar pick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been about 2 years. There\u2019s a practice room in the basement of the cafe I work at.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You really practiced for 2 years and you can play like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had confirmed again. Talent ignored the laws of time.</p><br/><p>The sound engineer let Jo Hyung Joong and Jun Hyuk know that the song had been put together,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, the track is complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? That was quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe track lengths were exact, so there wasn\u2019t much work for me to do separately.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he pressed the play button, turbulent metal music filled the recording studio for 12 minutes. The guitar pumped intensely, the drum filled the emptiness, and the bass picked up the melody, creating a perfect harmony.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk spoke when the music was over. Jo Hyung Joong was the first professional Jun Hyuk was working with since he had learned music. He wanted to know what an expert thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, there are no flaws to point out except for one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too long. You have to perform this heavy rock song for various audiences. Heavy metal, an instrumental without lyrics, length of 12 minutes. There aren\u2019t many people willing to accept all three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 Then will you arrange it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? Ha ha ha,\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong laughed cheerfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that because to me, it\u2019s music without any flaws. I must not change it and I don\u2019t have the ability to change it. You have to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I don\u2019t want to take out a single note.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong had more advice to give, but saved his words. Jun Hyuk\u2019s version of Canon was a song that unleashed the desire to show off. He must have had this thought while watching the countless electric guitar versions of Canon on YouTube.</p><br/><p>I play a lot better. If there is someone who has mastered all existing guitar techniques better than I have, come out. It was a performance that gave off this vibe. In this way, it became long for no reason because he needed to show all of the techniques he had.</p><br/><p>However, this useless boasting would automatically disappear if the song was shortened to 4 minutes. They needed to take out all unnecessary parts in order to really get the essence of Pachelbel.</p><br/><p>He pushed a Jun Hyuk, brooding in thought as though already thinking of new arrangement, back into the recording booth,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we hear the version with the three guitars?\u201d</p><br/><p>The version where the violin melody from the original song was changed to guitars was completely different. He recorded the slow bass rhythm and calm acoustic guitar without a drum first. When it was difficult to predict what form the complete song would take, Jo Hyung Joong questioned Jun Hyuk as he prepared to record the last melody,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? I\u2019m setting the guitar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you doing two?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to play them together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTogether? You\u2019re going to play two at the same time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, because the performance is important.\u201d</p><br/><p>It could not be? Jo Hyung Joong thought of one guitarist,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to perform in Stanley Jordan\u2019s method?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stanley Jordan.</p><br/><p>He was an American guitarist who was able to play both the lead and rhythm guitars using both hands in methods like tapping and slapping. He could play the treble and bass at the same time in a twin melody.</p><br/><p>Like Stanley Jordan, Jun Hyuk put one guitar around his shoulders and one on the stand.</p><br/><p>The same melody of 8 bars flowed from the two guitars. This was Canon itself. Canon was a chorus where the the first part was sung followed by the chorus while leaving a certain measure in between. Jun Hyuk imitated the leading melody while playing in a format with successive chords in a temporal flow.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s two hands moved elegantly over the two guitars as though there were two people performing.</p><br/><p>After hearing both versions of Canon, Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s instinct as a producer tingled. He did not know how long Jun Hyuk would survive on the program, but he wanted to put Jun Hyuk\u2019s songs together to make an album.</p><br/><p>He had already created four songs. Finkl\u2019s song NOW in jazz on the piano, the two versions of Canon, and Shin Hae Chul\u2019s From the Sun to the Boy.</p><br/><p>There was no reason to gather only the songs from the broadcast. This was a child who had the talent to continue creating music.</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s phone rang as he was excited with this expectation,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Producer Kim. Why are you calling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Hi. I just wanted to see if the work was going well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s no problem. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Is Jun Hyuk working on the mission song?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a lot to think about because all three songs are good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Excuse me? What do you mean there are three songs?</p><br/><p>He had called to check on Jun Hyuk\u2019s state, but heard something unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk arranged a classic and it\u2019s no joke. I\u2019m wondering which will be better too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 You know\u2026 we can\u2019t change that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a classic without copyrights.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Copyrights aren\u2019t the problem. There\u2019s another problem involved\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez. He\u2019s doing so well on his own. Is it a problem with the contract again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong spoke with a voice full of irritation. It was obvious that the variety show entertainment production executives and the main producer had agreed to share the profits with the agency holding the copyrights.</p><br/><p>\u2013 Don\u2019t say anything to me. I\u2019m just a wage earner. I have to do what the people higher up say.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll do the appointed song, but you have to listen to a favor me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Sure. Tell me what it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cArrange for an orchestra. We don\u2019t need a lot, just 16 people. You can\u2019t do students though. You have to get people beyond that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Why an orchestra all of a sudden? Can\u2019t you work on the MIDI operations?</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk\u2019s piano is really good and the orchestral accompaniment came out nicely. It\u2019s a waste to do as a MIDI operation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Alright. We have to do that much for you. Also\u2026 is Jun Hyuk doing well?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I was careful with him for no reason because you said stuff about him being rogue. He\u2019s a good kid and just does music. Why? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 No, it\u2019s nothing. I was just wondering.</p><br/><p>It seemed everything was still okay. Producer Kim Ki Sik kept praying that they would pass over this without any problems.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyung Joong painstakingly polished the three songs to the point where he would have no problem releasing an album with Jun Hyuk right away. For a week, Jun Hyuk forgot everything and concentrated on creating the best music.</p><br/><p>p the call from the staff on site at the dorm,</p><br/><p>\u2018A lawyer\u2026..\u2019</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk met a lawyer and would not get out of bed. He was positive the cafe owner had hired a lawyer and Jun Hyuk had heard about what was going on outside. He rushed to the dorm in Ilsan without delay.</p><br/><p>When he opened the front door of the dorm, he saw Jun Hyuk laying around the sofa reading a music score. There were cup ramens and canned drinks around the sofa along with the empty dishes and crushed cans that he had already gone through.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay? I heard you\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? No. I said that I wasn\u2019t in the mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk seemed relaxed in comparison to the staff who had been as frantic as if a wooden house had caught on fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Do you feel better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel better now that I\u2019ve fixed my score and changed it a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Could he be okay after finding out that someone like a parent had fallen into trouble? Producer Kim Ki Sik spoke cautiously,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. Yesterday, was there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducer. Can you drop me off at Teacher Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s studio right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? To Jo Hyung Joong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I need to show him the arrangement of the orchestra part I finished for the mission song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO\u2026 Okay. But I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be at the studio this early in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik felt intuitively that he was avoiding it. He was deliberately avoiding what happened yesterday and this morning. He did not want to say what had happened.</p><br/><p>He is not the type to go past something as if nothing had happened. Could it be that he had ulterior motives? Or had he resigned because he knew that he did not have the power to do anything?</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik thought that he did not need to prod Jun Hyuk who did not want to talk about it. There was no need to bother Jun Hyuk yet. They could just monitor his state for a little longer and make him quit the program if they detected anything strange. Fortunately, there was still a lot of time left before the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that he would be at the studio for the time being because of the arrangements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Producer Kim Ki Sik who was lost in his thoughts took Jun Hyuk to Jo Hyung Joong\u2019s studio.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong who had fallen asleep at dawn on the studio sofa looked for coffee before he could even open his eyes properly when Jun Hyuk barged in first thing in the morning, waking him up.</p><br/><p>While Jo Hyung Joong gulped down his coffee, Jun Hyuk handed him a bundle of scores as thick as a textbook.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go to this morning\u2019s schedule? Don\u2019t you need to go to fitness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI played hooky today because this is more important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are there so many scores? I told you to configure it for 16 instruments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is 16. I brought the Symphony No. 1 I told you about too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. Symphony No. 1.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong started to look over the score for \u2018From the Sun to the Boy\u2019 slowly. After looking at the score for over 10 minutes, he sighed in admiration,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew- I\u2019ll have to tell them to give you the fees for the arrangement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to change here, so you have to get the arrangement fees and I\u2019ll just get the recording fees.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 I had been thinking of an elaborate orchestral accompaniment, but you made it very refreshing. It\u2019s an arrangement that clearly indicates that the piano is the main. But\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk fixed his gaze on Jo Hyung Joong who hesitated to speak while waiting to hear what was lacking in his music.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song will bring admiration when listening to it on a CD, but the first release is on a stage to the audience and through the TV. I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll lack impact. The orchestral accompaniment will go out as the MR and there\u2019s just a piano on the stage. It\u2019s especially hard to deliver the rich music scene on the TV. That\u2019s why the performance becomes an important element.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying the performance is important, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. But Jun Hyuk, have you decided on this song? What happened to Pachelbel\u2019s Canon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to do it. From now on, I\u2019m not going to do the music I want to do, but what other people like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk who had said just yesterday that he wanted to do Canon was saying now that he wanted to play music for others. Why? What had happened to make him change overnight? He had a firm perspective on music unlike other kids these days.</p><br/><p>Jo Hung Joong was surprised by the change in Jun Hyuk and wanted to know what the reason was, but did not want to show his curiosity. There was no need to rush when he would find out anyway. Jun Hyuk was someone who could not help but communicate through music.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 This won\u2019t do. I\u2019m getting greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to listen to everything. Pachelbel\u2019s Canon, both versions. The recorders will be here in a bit so let\u2019s try recording right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, teacher. We can do that next time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it? You\u2019re going to do music that other people want to hear? Let\u2019s hear it. I\u2019ll pick the music that will make you shine most on stage. I\u2019m a person who knows exactly what the public\u2019s preference is. Leave it to me since whatever I choose will be jackpot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jo Hyung Joong winked as he laughed and ran into the shower to regain his consciousness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

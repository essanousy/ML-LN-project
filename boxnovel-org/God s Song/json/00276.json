Jina became nervous because of the sudden silence and turned her head from side to side, hoping for someone to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI live in the U.S., but I\u2019m Korean. Will you tell the foundation legal team to act on this so I can adopt this child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. There won\u2019t be any issues since this girl\u2026 Jina doesn\u2019t have parents either. I\u2019ll take care of it right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. Oh right, Tara. I\u2019m sorry for yelling at you earlier. Truly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara winked and smiled with the phone to her ear.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk sat in front of Jin and spoke calmly and affectionately.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you. You have the voice of an angel, no, of heaven. I\u2019ll create heavenly music for you, so you sing. People will think of the songs you sing as heavenly music. What do you think? Incredible, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the hotelier hesitated because she was not sure whether Jun Hyuk was talking to himself or not, Jun Hyuk kept talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou hear the dry land barking that it\u2019s thirsty, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a glance from Jun Hyuk, the hotelier quickly started speaking in Hindi.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the sound of flies flying around in the bathroom is beautiful? You want to express the passion coming from the hot sun? With your voice, I mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jina nodded her head vigorously. And she started to chat away again.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe says that there are no songs. She wants to sing about the sound of the land crying, flies batting their wings, and the hot sun, but she says that there are no songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll gift those songs to you. I\u2019ll make whatever you want to express, so sing as much as you want. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jina nodded her head again and smiled brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you want to live with me? I\u2019ll make songs for you like I just did, let you eats lots of delicious things, and make it so you can sleep in a cozy bed, so come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jina got the translation of what Jun Hyuk was saying, she got surprised and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe says that she can\u2019t. She\u2019s saying that she can\u2019t leave without the permission of her owners, the men from before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, one of the maids held Jina and started speaking rapidly.</p><br/><p>When the maid was done talking, Jina got on the floor with the maid\u2019s help, bowed over to kiss his feet and would not get up.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me. What on earth did you say to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was surprised by Jina\u2019s sudden actions. When he yelled toward the maid, she bowed to ask him for understanding and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cSir. This girl doesn\u2019t know complicated things like that. She only knows that she\u2019s a slave and that she has an owner. I told her that her owner has changed. I understand your intention to protect her, so just say that you are her owner for now. That is how she\u2019ll follow you. You can help her understand that she\u2019s not a slave once you get to America.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk felt embarrassed that he had thought he and Jina overlapped even for a moment. He was an orphan, but this girl is a slave. The weight of their pain will have been completely different.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk stood Jina up, kneeled in front of her, and slowly embraced her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come to realize on your own that you\u2019re not a slave. I\u2019ll make it so that happens soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Commander had left as though he would be able to handle everything quickly, and came back after only one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat child Jina was someone that didn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst off, Jina\u2019s parents didn\u2019t have birth registration. Of course that was the same for Jina. That\u2019s why it took some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Commander Akhtar handed a manila folder over.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we quickly created documents. Her name is Jina, her age is 10. We made her birthday yesterday when she met you, Maestro. Will you be going back to America today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to. I\u2019d like to take her back as soon as we can and see her ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll bring over someone from the adoption agency. Jina will become that person\u2019s companion. She will become your daughter completely once everything is settled in America.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Commander. I won\u2019t forget all you\u2019ve done for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. What I\u2019ve done for you? It\u2019s overwhelming for me to even think of Jina becoming a world-renowned singer through you. And I\u2019m happy with just the fact that I was able to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk handed a small envelope over to the Commander who looked pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe kids you talked about yesterday. The ones you said were sent to a facility first\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease use this for those children. And JS Foundation will continue to provide sponsorship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Commander Akhtar dropped the envelope when he saw that the check inside was written for $5 million, and sat blankly for a while.</p><br/><p>He had heard rumors that Jun Hyuk would have made enough money to buy entire countries if he didn\u2019t donate so much. The Commander thought that those rumors could be true.</p><br/><p>Commander Akhtar put the envelope away and bowed his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll do my best so those children can live like people.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was not the end however. Jun Hyuk\u2019s continuing gift was more surprising than the amount that he was donating.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll invite you for the first day that Jina stands on stage. Come see for yourself how the girl you rescued yourself grows up.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun looked at Jun Hyuk and the little Indian girl he brought, and just blinked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Father, didn\u2019t I always say that the human voice is an incomplete instrument? But this child is the only exception.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 so you\u2019re saying that this child has a perfect voice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s beyond perfect. It\u2019s better than any instrument created by humanity. She can create various tones and changes emotions within moments. The range she can cover is beyond imagination.\u201d</p><br/><p>A child who is just 10 years old? It was unbelievable, but Jun Hyuk is speaking with confidence. He cannot not believe this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd her ability to remember notes is the same as mine. She memorized a piano song that I played for around 30 minutes perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun remembered his first meeting with Jun Hyuk when he said that he memorized Marlowe\u2019s symphony in its entirety. If Jun Hyuk felt even a little of what he felt back then, it is inevitable that he would be so excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will I be able to hear this child\u2019s voice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen for yourself once Jina gets a bit more stable. You\u2019re really going to be surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll adopt this child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun did not say much else. Jun Hyuk did not bring it up to get permission either. It would be laughable for him to say something about a decision that an adult over 30 made.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, get us a teacher who can teach Jina English. And make a school for her too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, a school for Jina to attend. A school for children who can\u2019t see like Jina. Young kids need to grow up among their peers in order to avoid becoming wicked like me. We need to make it so she has a normal childhood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m against it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it needs to be normal. Is it normal to make a school for Jina? Wouldn\u2019t it be normal to just enroll her in a special school in New York? It\u2019s already abnormal for you to think about making a school for her and bringing friends to her. Shouldn\u2019t you become a normal parent too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk imagined himself dropping Jina off at school every morning and attending parent teacher conferences. Like a normal parent. It wasn\u2019t a bad picture.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then look into a school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Until now is an issue of our family\u2026 What\u2019s going to happen to Maestro Jun?\u201d</p><br/><p>He is reading the situation clearly. There was an aftertaste left in Jun Hyuk\u2019s words and he laughed when Yoon Kwang Hun noticed this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s as you already guessed. I\u2019m only going to focus on teaching Jina for at least 5 years from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Do as you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>He is declaring that he will halt all activities for 5 years. Yoon Kwang Hun did not say much about this decision either. Since it is something that he has already decided, he needs to settle the matters after.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, we\u2019ll have to look around for a conductor to take over JS Orchestra. Is there someone you have in mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I was thinking of Berlin\u2019s Serill Petrenko. If he doesn\u2019t want to do it, the Board of Directors can decide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPetrenko?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s the first conductor to put Inferno on stage. Whether he used a shortcut or not, it\u2019s true that he\u2019s the person who delved deepest into my music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be sure to bring him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is there something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk scratched his head and spoke up cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to tell Amelia about this yet. She\u2019s coming back next month\u2026 Be there when I tell her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke. Are you scared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. If I say I want to adopt when we haven\u2019t even gotten married, she might kick me out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun could not stop laughing for a while. Jun Hyuk watched this and frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you having fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not because of that. It\u2019 because of her name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. When you adopt her, her name is \u2018Jina Jang\u2019. That\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s \u2018Jang Jina\u2019 in Korean. Isn\u2019t the nuance a little strange? He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun did not stop laughing, ignoring Jun Hyuk\u2019s burning up.</p><br/><p>There was another reason why he could not stop laughing. He and Jun Hyuk do not have a drop of the same blood, but he is walking in the same path.</p><br/><p>The fate of taking in a child off the street with no relation to himself. Will Jina take the same path when she grows up?</p><br/><p>However, he stopped laughing when he remembered something he had been forgetting.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m becoming a grandfather all of a sudden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun had become a complete old man.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

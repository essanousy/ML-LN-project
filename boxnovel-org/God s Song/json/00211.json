She had already received the score while Laura was participating in the gala concert. This will become the ultimate coloratura if Laura\u2019s voice is added to this beautiful melody, even if there is no accompaniment.</p><br/><p>And, her expectation had not been wrong. The 5 songs she listened to just now, shows the zenith of coloratura.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said your pronunciation is shaky?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That note is where he wrote each place where it\u2019s shaky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even make out half of this with my ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura looked at her professor\u2019s blank stare and could only laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do about it. Fix what you can make out for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how good his ear is, even notes that are hard for people who spent their lives with music can\u2019t discern?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can only trust Jun\u2019s directing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019re meeting him again in 3 days? Then, let\u2019s adjust the parts that I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura looked at the score and began bringing out a simple yet beautiful sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaura, wait. What you just did is worse than your recording. Don\u2019t just pay attention to the pronunciation. If Jun were only asking for precise pronunciation, wouldn\u2019t he just use a machine? Save the zest that brings change to the sounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Laura spent each day in basic vocal hard training, Danny was finishing up the gala concert in Brussels and returning to New York.</p><br/><p>He knows that rehearsals start in a month, but he is coming back to practice in order to work toward a perfect performance. He already discussed the direction of the performance in a meeting with Maestro Carras.</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny, just stay at my apartment. There\u2019s no reason to stay at a hotel when there are so many empty rooms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t be such a nuisance. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Jun Hyuk met up with Danny, he told him to come out of the hotel.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about practicing? You\u2019ll get kicked out of the hotel if you practice there every night because you\u2019re being noisy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a studio to practice in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen practice at my apartment. It\u2019s made up like a studio, so you can even record. And work on producing music with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducing music? What is it? You wrote a new song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Soprano aria.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAria? Laura Goldberg?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. How did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou kept praising Laura. You don\u2019t just pass by people like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>If there is someone who gave him musical inspiration, he always write a song that fits them. Danny regrets that Jun Hyuk has not yet written a song for him. This means that his playing is still ordinary to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I do that? Anyway, I\u2019m going to try testing out that song. Oh right. What\u2019s the violin you\u2019re using right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuarneri del Gesu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Guarneri?\u201d</p><br/><p>Guarneri del Gesu refers to Italian instrument manufacturer, Guarneri family\u2019s 3rd manufacturer, Bartholomew Giuseppe Guarneri. \u2018del Gesu\u2019 is his nickname because he carved crosses on the backs of the instruments he made. It is one of the top 3 violins in the world, along with Stradivarius and Amati.</p><br/><p>If the Stradivarius is delicately carved and polished to be exemplary and like a woman\u2019s voice, the Guarneri has the rough look of wood and a masculine tone. It is also famous for the distinctive sounds it makes by instrument.</p><br/><p>However, there are also aspects they have in common; they are instruments of high value.</p><br/><p>Danny waved his hand when he saw Jun Hyuk\u2019s surprised face,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not mine. I received sponsorship because I won the Queen Elisabeth Competition and was a finalist in the Chaikovsky Competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSponsorship?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Canadian government lent it to me for free for 1 year. I\u2019m using it well right now because there\u2019s insurance on it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to go back and forth between the hotel and studio with that expensive instrument? You know that New York\u2019s streets are no joke. It\u2019s fine, so come into the apartment. Let me see it. I want to see what brings in hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny was so grateful for Jun Hyuk\u2019s concern that he could cry. He does not yet have the income to stay in a first class hotel without worrying about the costs. It is not an easy ordeal to go back and forth between the studio and hotel either.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Jun. Then, I\u2019ll impose on you a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpose nothing. I\u2019m not just saying it. There really is something I\u2019m working on. I need the sound of a Guarneri too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk seemed to be full of anticipation for the sound of the luxury violin.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yoon. I hope I\u2019m not being a bother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense. I\u2019m just camping out for a bit too. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun is meeting a friend of Jun Hyuk\u2019s for the first time. Even though it has only been a few hours since they met, he is fascinated by the fact that the 2 boys are friends.</p><br/><p>Bright and cheerful Danny kept chatting, and brought happiness to his surroundings. As for Jun Hyuk, who does not like noise, must have let Danny stay with him because he is really fond of him.</p><br/><p>They may like each other because they have completely opposite natures.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir. This is the Guarneri del Gesu violin that goes for over 1.5 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Guarneri? What? Is he from a rich family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. No, Mr. Yoon. It\u2019s sponsored by the Canadian government. A 1 year lease.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see. So the Canadian government invested in a rising star?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you can say it like that? Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny laughed humorously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, shall we hear it? Let\u2019s see what kind of sound comes from something worth 1.5 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk gave him the score for Laura\u2019s aria.</p><br/><p>\u201cDanny, try playing this. It\u2019s a song without accompaniment, so it\u2019ll go well with a violin solo too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny looked over the score for a moment and held up his violin. After playing the 5 songs consecutively, Danny stuck out his tongue and put the violin down.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, this is the song a soprano needs to sing? The singer\u2019s going to die of short breath trying to sing this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is good as a solo song. Playing skills are important because there are a lot of changes\u2026 Danny, you truly are good enough to win a competition. Your technique is academic but rough. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny flushed at Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s praises. The person with the privilege to be the first to see Jun Hyuk\u2019s scores. He heard that this man has a sharper ear than most critics.</p><br/><p>It felt like his praise was instead of Jun Hyuk\u2019s praise.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, you said this song doesn\u2019t have an accompaniment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, it can be played on any instrument as long as the register is matched up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny was already enwrapped in the melody\u2019s beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is, but didn\u2019t you just say that she\u2019ll run out of breath?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt needs to be done by a performer who can express that feeling of running out of breath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Danny\u2019s eyes sparkled as he looked at Jun Hyuk. He was curious as to whether or not he was included among those performers.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Danny, you expressed that well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are you going to give this song to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laughed at Danny\u2019s delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to give. I\u2019m going to release the score as soon as Laura\u2019s done recording. Anyone will be able to play it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, really? What a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who plays this first could become the song\u2019s owner. If Danny performs or releases an album with these 5 songs, any violinist who plays it, is only a second owner unless they give a particularly splendid performance.</p><br/><p>Danny is regretful because, once Jun Hyuk releases the score, the world\u2019s top violinists will fight to release albums. Jun Hyuk yelled at Danny because these concerns came first,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou prepare for the concert! Don\u2019t think about other things. How many days has it been since you said that you would change your career with the New York performance?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

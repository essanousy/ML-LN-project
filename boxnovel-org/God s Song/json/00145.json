Once was because of Jun Hyuk and the other was because of Han Ye Ji.</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji had been bold and really came looking for Professor Jeon Hye Jin for the points.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you got your A, are you thinking of not coming into my class from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor, you told me to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin\u2019s tone had been scary, but Han Ye Ji had said everything she wanted to. Professor Jeon Hye Jin was in such disbelief that she did not want to say more.</p><br/><p>\u201cKids these days\u2026.. Oy. Go.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Professor Jeon Hye Jin waved for her to leave, Han Ye Ji carefully walked backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. But how did you know? About that kid\u2019s piano?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just did. It just sounded like the emotions changed too quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin had expected her to say, \u2018I know the specialties of the pianists that Jun Hyuk played.\u2019 But she said that she just knew.</p><br/><p>Her heart started beating. Could it be that this student has potential that no one had yet discovered?</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin took Han Ye Ji to the practice room. She spoke after having Han Ye Ji sit in front of the piano.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlay. Recall the emotions that Jun Hyuk showed before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji looked like she was on the verge of tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor, I can\u2019t play the piano like that Jang Jun Hyuk. If I were that good, I would have gone to study abroad already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis girl! Who said to play it just like he did? I know that much as well that you can\u2019t play the piano like he does. I\u2019m just telling you to play anything while thinking of those emotions. Just do what you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji hesitated for a while after Professor Jeon Hye Jin\u2019s scolding, took a deep breath, and calmed herself down.</p><br/><p>As soon as her piano rang out, Professor Jeon Hye Jin\u2019s heart started beating. After playing the piano for more than 10 minutes, Han Ye Ji took her hands off of the keyboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Professor. I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not a genius like that kid. How could I capture the emotions of multiple pianists?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji looked at the keyboard as though tears would fall from her eyes. Professor Jeon Hye Jin only had one strong feeling from her piano. The feeling that she misses someone dearly was certainly delivered. That longing needs to develop more to end in a different kind of bliss, but she has not reached that yet. However, it just means that she has not learned it yet. Her ability to deliver such a performance with a lack of skills means that she is a born performer.</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin\u2019s hard face loosened and she spoke in a gentle voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said your name is Han Ye Ji?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to me carefully. I only give one person lessons, once a week for 2 hours. I usually don\u2019t give private lessons, but her mother is ridiculously rich. So in the name of redistributing the wealth, I get paid to teach that kid with no talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>She just blinked because she did not know what Professor Jeon Hye Jin was trying to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to start teaching you every day for 2 hours a day from now on. I\u2019m your advisor started today. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Professor, I can\u2019t do that. My family isn\u2019t rich enough to handle such an expensive lesson fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji bolted up from the piano bench.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve hit the lotto. I\u2019m teaching you for free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin sat Han Ye Ji down again and put her hands on the piano.</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji developed quickly enough to let the professor feel the happiness of teaching her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Anyway, congratulations once again. For meeting a great teacher and for becoming a runner-up. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Professor Jeon Hye Jin wants to personally teach her, she must be a pianist with potential. Jun Hyuk committed her name to his memory.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy standing is nothing. You do know that you became bigger news than the winner of the Tchaikovsky Competition this year, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the hot topic in Korea as well. There was already a lot of talk because 4 Korean people went up, but you added to that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He does not need her to tell him all of this as he already knows. Did the reporters not come looking for him in New York?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut where\u2019s that girlfriend of yours? Didn\u2019t you come together? All of the runner-ups should have been gathered here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s performing in Prague right now. She couldn\u2019t get out of it because a sponsor set it up\u2026 She\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. This kid\u2026 You\u2019re already playing around. Ho ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin poked Jun Hyuk\u2019s side and was happy as he blushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you guys are performing Mozart\u2019s Magic Flute. Are you conducting it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It happened like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Is it okay? You\u2019re fine to conduct it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. There\u2019s nothing really special about it, but one of the sopranos is really impressive. I think she\u2019s going to become top news of this festival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe must be really impressive if you talk about her like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s only just 19 years old. She\u2019ll be able to reign as a diva for the next 20 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Aren\u2019t you just 19 too? Where do you come acting like an adult? Ho ho.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin was going to hit Jun Hyuk\u2019s head, but her hand did not reach.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited to get to see your conducting. Isn\u2019t it your debut in that field?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be excited. I\u2019m not performing. The actors need to do well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s see how our schedules work out and get dinner together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Professor. Please call me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji could not take her eyes off of Jun Hyuk as he said goodbye and walked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s more than you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it when you kept saying that he is good looking, but he really is handsome. He just looked pretty when he appeared on the audition program, but he looks completely different now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Ji, don\u2019t take a liking to him. You know he has a girlfriend. There\u2019s no way people couldn\u2019t know since she basically told the world not to touch him on broadcast. That Amelia girl really is impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Professor Jeon Hye Jin\u2019s eyes, Amelia does not lack anything. Looks, talent, and a bold personality.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor, what did I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looked like your eyes would shoot lasers out of them. If you want, you should give it a try. Doesn\u2019t a ball go in even if there\u2019s a goalkeeper?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. Why do you keep saying stuff like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji knows that the professor likes jokes like this, but she could feel her face flush.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird if a girl isn\u2019t attracted to a boy like that. I would\u2019ve given my all to him too if I were just 30 years younger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you need to be 30 years younger for it to be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon Hye Jin poked Han Ye Ji\u2019s side.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

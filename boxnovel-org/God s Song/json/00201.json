Don\u2019t you need to foster the skill to get through reporters now? He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun tapped Jun Hyuk\u2019s shoulder and got out of the car first. The cameras flashed in his face, but they slipped away from him when he pointed to the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, all you have to do is walk slowly into the theater. There are no reporters who will block your path. Don\u2019t frown, and smile. You don\u2019t have to respond to questions. There will be reporters who try to get you to answer with weird questions. Just ignore them and keep walking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSmile and keep walking. Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tara walked out first, the reporters stepped back and opened up the path. Jun Hyuk saw the reporters split like the Red Sea and thought that Tara would be like Moses if she just had a staff in her hand. He automatically broke out into a smile at this thought.</p><br/><p>Once he entered the theater, the reporters sighed lightly. Now they need permission from the theater to continue filming. If they do not get approval, they will be kicked out of the theater without being able to cover today\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk collapsed into his seat, Yoon Kwang Hun was laughing in the next seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems you did well from your expression.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It wasn\u2019t hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good to Tara. I haven\u2019t seen very many people who are good at her job as she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019re trying to be friends. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the audience was packed without any empty seats, the orchestra and chorus entered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, the Belgian National Orchestra is pretty great. What do you think? You\u2019ll know since you conducted them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re significantly undervalued. It\u2019s just an issue of their repertoire.\u201d</p><br/><p>While they chatted, the moderator appeared on stage. When he finished introducing today\u2019s performers, conductor Pierre Boulez, 2 soloists, and the vocalists walked onto the stage.</p><br/><p>Pierre Boulez climbed on the podium and raised the baton, smiling without the slightest bit of nervousness.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Unlike yesterday\u2019s performance, the 1st part started with the melody of a slow and sorrowful violin and viola. When the stringed instruments\u2019 bows moved slowly, the audience felt comfortable and buried their bodies deep in their seats.</p><br/><p>Maestro Boulez basically declared that his music is different from Jun Hyuk\u2019s extreme. He could not completely erase the intensity of the original, but it was enough to feel a cold winter to raise their coat collars.</p><br/><p>But when the 1st part was ending, the orchestra became an obstacle to prevent the biting winds. The piano and violin dug in happily as though they had discovered a place to get away from the wind.</p><br/><p>When the piano and violin completely melted in with the 2nd part, Jun Hyuk let out a low groan. It was natural as though they had been performing together from the beginning. Since Jun Hyuk too made a lot of effort in this area during rehearsals, he knew what a difficult moment it was.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk glanced at Yoon Kwang Hun and saw that he was moving his hand a little and showing that he was lost in the music. When they entered the middle of the 2nd part, Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s eyes bolted open. Jun Hyuk also straightened his hip off of the back of his chair.</p><br/><p>The 2nd part that he expressed with fear and unrest slowly started to change. The orchestra stirred the fierce winds as though freezing everything, but the piano and violin was maintaining a smooth melody as though still basking in a comfortable shelter.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ho \u2013 So it\u2019s this kind of performance.\u2019</p><br/><p>It is a piano and violin that do not mind the orchestra\u2019s biting winds. A piano with a smooth and light touch, a violin that has a clear and graceful tone and free rubato (not bound to the beat). And a cantabile (as though singing).</p><br/><p>Maestro Boulez is strict in dealing with the orchestra, but he gave the 2 soloists wings that let them fly freely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man, he\u2019s impressive\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun mumbled without realizing it. He had already looked at Jun Hyuk\u2019s score carefully, hundreds of times. He could tell that the 2 soloists\u2019 performances were breath-takingly straying from the score.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? His confidence is impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk mumbled quietly too.</p><br/><p>The performance flowed freely so they could enjoy each sound. When the 3rd part was over, Pierre Boulez closed his eyes for a fairly long time. The audience\u2019s anticipation for a great 4th part grew.</p><br/><p>Starting with the 4th part, there is no longer freedom. The performance was faithful to the score and he led everything with strict conducting. The vocal soloists gave them exact sounds, making the audience think that they were cutting each syllable.</p><br/><p>If Jun Hyuk had built the song with loud sound, Pierre Boulez made it so that they could not leave the standard frame. The chorus also sang as though it had been measured with a ruler.</p><br/><p>That strictness is not very different from Beethoven. The last chorus was so elegant that it inspired reverence and the restrained sound filled the theater.</p><br/><p>When Maestro Boulez put the baton down, thunderous applause filled the theater that the chorus had disappeared from.</p><br/><p>There were even sounds of \u2018Beethoven!\u2019 bursting from different parts of the audience. They do not know exactly why, but the 4th part was a perfect egress as though Beethoven himself had been conducting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow \u2013 He is showing that a choral concerto and choral symphony aren\u2019t very different. It\u2019s killer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk thought that it was a performance where he had to agree with Yoon Kwang Hun.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Well it looks like I\u2019ve taken a hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you look at just the 4th part, today\u2019s performance is much more like Beethoven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Even though he was making such a fuss when I saw him yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay though? He\u2019s brought you a step closer to Beethoven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 100 times the burden. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara watched them and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, Mr. Yoon. We need to hurry out. If we stay like this, I think we\u2019ll be trapped without being able to move in the lobby.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 3 people slipped out among the audience that would not stop looking at the stage and applauding, to go backstage.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. Are you going to meet the Maestro backstage right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, probably.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun was walking quickly, and frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a single CD of Pierre Boulez\u2019s. I\u2019ve never heard him conduct\u2026 I can\u2019t pretend I know him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard it today. That should be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>They urged their footsteps along, Yoon Kwang Hun in his happiness in meeting another maestro and Jun Hyuk in his curiosity concerning today\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>Backstage, only the competition staff were moving busily. It seems the heros of the performance were still answering curtain calls and had not been able to leave the stage.</p><br/><p>When they heard the applause die down and the the audience bustle to leave the theater, the performers came backstage.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, what do you think? Was it okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Pierre Boulez discovered Jun Hyuk, he asked his opinion on the performance first.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe worrying you showed yesterday really was just a fuss. I\u2019m embarrassed that I babbled like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! The soloists were able to center themselves because of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pierre Boulez\u2019s looked to the Asian pianist. The female pianist who shone most in today\u2019s performance. It was a piano that Jun Hyuk had admired as well.</p><br/><p>He had carefully anticipated Han Ye Ji\u2019s win until yesterday, but he is not so sure now. He heard that she is Chinese, but the piano that came from her delicate physique was so free that he could not know its end.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told them to forget Beethoven, but wasn\u2019t that performance Beethoven himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk looked back at Pierre Boulez.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. Was it? Honestly, I was Beethoven from the beginning. I mean from the moment I saw the score. I thought about changing the vocal part in the 4th part to German, but I couldn\u2019t do that because I was scared of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. That would have been good too. What do you think about doing the afternoon performance in German?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would if I could\u2026 but the soloists might try to kill me. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience must have the aftertaste of the perfect Beethoven performance they heard in the morning. If they sing in German in the afternoon, the audience will be 100 times more impressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the afternoon performance like? Is it different?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? I don\u2019t have the ability to play around with music the way I want to like you can. It\u2019s the same as the morning performance. The difference would be the 2 soloists\u2019 influence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun listened to their conversation and poked Jun Hyuk\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Maestro. This is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you like this, Maestro Boulez. My name is Yoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun came forward before Jun Hyuk could finish speaking, and held his hand out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Yoon. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. The maestros yesterday said that you\u2019re a sharp critic. They said they could tell how a genius like Jun could come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s smile widened at Pierre Boulez\u2019s praise. But Jun Hyuk was having trouble trying not to laugh. He had not been a sharp critic, but more of a groupie who laid out all types of compliments.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk took Yoon Kwang Hun by the hand and dragged him away as he was complimenting Pierre Boulez.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir. Let\u2019s go since Maestro Boulez needs to prepare for the afternoon performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. What bad manners. Maestro Boulez, once the competition is over, I\u2019d like to eat together and talk about music.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Yoon. It\u2019s actually what I wanted to ask first. Oh, my friends and I will have a simple get together once the competition is over, and you should come with Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he says friends, he must be talking about the maestros. Yoon Kwang Hun was grinning from ear to ear at Pierre Boulez\u2019s answer. Jun Hyuk took Yoon Kwang Hun by the hand when he could not leave, and quickly left backstage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? Are you going to watch the afternoon performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. He said that it\u2019s the same as the morning performance. I\u2019m going to go check the soloists for tomorrow\u2019s performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk is concerned about the soloists who need to perform tomorrow. If they saw the morning performance, they will be shaken. That is how great the performance was.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then you go first. I\u2019m going to watch the afternoon performance and then go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll send a car for you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can take a taxi, so don\u2019t go through the trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk left the theater with Tara.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara, bring the soloists for tomorrow\u2019s performance. I\u2019ll wait in the car. I think it\u2019ll get noisy again if I run into the reporters. Let\u2019s take the 2 people home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHome? You\u2019re going to practice at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a piano there. Tell the violinist to bring a violin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The 2 people who followed Tara looked a bit excited. They looked full of anticipation because they were receiving a special lesson for tomorrow\u2019s performance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

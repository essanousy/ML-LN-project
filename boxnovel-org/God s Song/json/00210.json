You\u2019re still writing songs now, right? You\u2019re just going to keep storing them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will one day. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that laugh mean? And does that \u2018one day\u2019 really mean something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su spoke while examining Jun Hyuk, who kept smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose songs aren\u2019t that bad, though some of the early ones are cheesy. To say it simply, they\u2019re on reserve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Reserve?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. When it becomes hard to write songs and I can\u2019t think of motifs\u2026 They\u2019re just on reserve so I can reveal them one by one if I lose inspiration.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. That just means you\u2019re never going to reveal them.\u201d</p><br/><p>It just sounds like a joke. Music matures with time. He could lose inspiration, but music is not written only when motifs come to them. As they create music, there are more instances when they start to think up motifs.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou never know. It might just disappear one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry because that\u2019s not going to happen. Isn\u2019t it better to go through them one by one and release them, except for the ones you really don\u2019t like?\u201d</p><br/><p>They did not realize that the time was passing by because they were talking intensely about music. After 3 hours flew by, Jun Hyuk sent the signal to end it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m starting to get hungry. Let\u2019s eat together. We can talk while we eat\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. It went on for too long, didn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s do that. Then, last question: your personal goals? I\u2019m going to do this no matter what. Something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Jung Su posed the last question with the producer\u2019s signal that the interview was over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMozart left the world over 600 songs as he died at the age of 36, but I\u2019ll live at least twice that long, right? Then I guess my goal is to leave over 1000 songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1000 songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. If I keep going as I\u2019m doing now, I think it\u2019s a goal I can meet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll classical?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm. I didn\u2019t really decide on that. Just as it happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking as a fan of yours, I hope you become a great musician, who crosses through different genres.\u201d</p><br/><p>The interview ended with Yoon Jung Su\u2019s meaningful hopes for Jun Hyuk, and Tara approached them.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. The car is waiting, so go first in that. I just made a reservation, so the driver will take you to the restaurant. Mr. Yoon is going to head there too, so eat with everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re not coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have work to do here. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I\u2019m done, so don\u2019t mind me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara and Lim So Mi need to go through the entire interview footage. Jun Hyuk and Yoon Jung Su left the guest room.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, let\u2019s go. We can talk as we eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen Mr. Yoon too. We both live in Korea but meeting in New York.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. When do you go back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow evening. I have plenty of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk enjoyed his dinner with a carefree heart, now that he was done with his last interview. He is happy that he can concentrate on music again now that the cumbersome work is over.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Laura Goldberg never thought she would have to sing an aria with just one sound.</p><br/><p>She had been more excited when she heard that Jun Hyuk had written the song while thinking of her. He is a star and she will be the first person to sing his song. This alone will catch the world\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>The mail with the score included said that they would start recording as soon as she arrived in New York, so she should be fully prepared.</p><br/><p>Laura had not imagined that she would record her first album so soon. She learned the music sheet that President Stern sent her and just waited for the gala concert to hurry up and end.</p><br/><p>When Laura arrived in New York, she forgot her jetlag and exhaustion and ran to the recording studio. Only two people were waiting for her in the recording studio, a sound engineer and Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the gala concert go well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I was out of it once I got the score. I was paying more attention to this song than I was to the concert. And thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura thanked him for choosing her, but Jun Hyuk shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cPush that back until after the recording. If I don\u2019t think you\u2019re up for it, I\u2019m going to get another soprano.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk cut it off coldly and Laura sobered. There is no need to say thank you. Jun Hyuk is the composer and he will be directing her. Her job is to hurry up and end the recording to his standards.</p><br/><p>They have not gathered in this studio because of recognition or friendship. They have come to work.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll bring out a result that you\u2019ll be satisfied with, Mr. Producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled when he heard Laura sound ready to get work done.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Then, do you want to try singing it easily? Let\u2019s see what you practiced over a week first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura went into the recording booth, put the score on the stand, and cleared her throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaura. Since there isn\u2019t an accompaniment, pay attention to the beat. Do you need a metronome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll try it out without a metronome first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice came out through the recording booth microphone and wrapped the whole studio. Jun Hyuk wrote something on a piece of paper while she sang.</p><br/><p>Laura sang 5 five-minute songs without resting and looked at Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaura, what did you do for a week?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why? Is it that bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour pronunciation is completely off in the passage (part of a melody where the notes are quickly changed in direction to go high or low). I\u2019m sure you saw the one message written on the score. The pronunciation needs to be precise. You didn\u2019t see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a lot to say about other things, but there\u2019s no need to say it because you can\u2019t do the most basic part.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura was speechless in the recording booth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaura, let me ask one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song. You don\u2019t like it? It\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s really good. The melody is really beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I haven\u2019t done anything wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cR\u2026 Right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the song is good, it\u2019s okay if the performance is a little off. Contrary to that, if the performance is good, it\u2019s okay for the song to be plain. But, there isn\u2019t a crazy record label willing to make an album just because it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk ignored Laura who could not lift her head, and spoke to the sound engineer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you make what we just recorded into a CD?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? Oh\u2026 Sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound engineer was completely lost in Laura\u2019s hair-raisingly beautiful voice and exquisite technique. He could not understand what the producer was so upset about. This is at a perfect standard for a first take.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaura, come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura came out and Jun Hyuk gave her a sheet of paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are the places where your pronunciation is off while you sing. Take the CD and check it. We\u2019ll just say that you weren\u2019t in good condition today. If it\u2019s like this tomorrow, it might be hard to keep going.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sheet that Jun Hyuk gave her is full of numbers indicating minutes and seconds like a stopwatch.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there are a lot of cases where you have to go straight to the concert hall after getting off a plane because your tour schedule is tight. Being off condition because of long flights\u2026 I\u2019m sure you know that this kind of excuse doesn\u2019t work in the professional world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laura gently bit her lip. This was not a place to come running to out of excitement. She needed to have come with complete preparation.</p><br/><p>Laura looked up at Jun Hyuk and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201c3 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s meet after 3 days. I can\u2019t get ready in 1 day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s face relaxed,</p><br/><p>\u201c3 days is enough? Do you want more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I need to do it within 3 days. I can\u2019t just keep you waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk smiled widely,</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Then 2 in the afternoon in 3 days. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk sent Laura away and then listened to her song again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaestro. I don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re trying to do with this song, but isn\u2019t it pretty great for a first take?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound engineer spoke up cautiously after listening to the recording with Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is great. This kind of unique sound is rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you were really pushing her\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll realize when we\u2019re finishing up with our recording. You\u2019ll know what this sound really looks like.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound engineer was still puzzled at Jun Hyuk\u2019s words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He went down to the basement before the others got up, and started warming up on the drums.</p><br/><p>The 3 people woke up after noon, and gathered in the studio while waiting for their bodies to wake up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that this show is different from that of an average band, right? It\u2019s a joint performance with the Seoul Symphony. It means we can\u2019t perform according to how we\u2019re feeling during the concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk gave Colin and Kyung Min Ho the score.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, what about mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlvin, do you need one? You can just sing along to the accompaniment. It\u2019s actually us who need to avoid being overpowered by your singing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho started by worrying because it is his first time performing with an orchestra.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk, but what about the orchestra\u2019s performance? Don\u2019t we need to start matching our tempos now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s prepared. We recorded the orchestra part on the piano, so play while keeping balance in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we get started?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee cleared his throat a few times and stood in front of the microphone.</p><br/><p>When a hoarse, thick, and low voice came out from the amp, the 3 young men also made quiet sounds. Kyung Min Ho in particular was in such awe that he let go of his drum sticks. A heavy voice incomparable to that of Alvin Lee when he was in his 20s. A vocal that is much more mature with a feeling of depth.</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho felt like he could cry while he was playing the drums. It was not the image he had always seen through videos. He is looking not at his front, but his dependable back. The drummer is the only person who can see the vocalist\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho filled his eyes with Alvin Lee\u2019s back and could really feel that he is Alvin Lee\u2019s drummer.</p><br/><p>When the first song was over, Lee looked at Kyung Min Ho and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, tell the drummer to loosen up a bit. He\u2019s too stiff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay since he\u2019s just nervous because of you, Alvin. With a little time, his true self will come through. Once he explodes, you\u2019ll be able to hear a thunderous sound that doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, what do you think of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>As bassist, Colin could pick up on the drummer\u2019s problem quickest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go without the piano so the drummer can relax. He\u2019s too conscious of the piano\u2019s tempo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk nodded at Colin\u2019s suggestion. Kyung Min Ho has never played with an orchestra. They need to slowly get him accustomed to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMin Ho, let\u2019s try it again without the piano part. And don\u2019t look at my score now, just find the tempo yourself. Relax a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, sorry. It\u2019s as though I was playing soccer on a neighborhood field and am suddenly playing for the English premiere league\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he. Looking at your skill alone, you have plenty right to be here. And let\u2019s start with the 4th track. It\u2019ll help you release tension since it\u2019s heavy metal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho quickly thought of all of the songs on Jun Hyuk\u2019s album. Of a total of 10 songs, there is 1 piano solo, 1 heavy metal, and 3 songs without guitars. The orchestra will play a great role in the songs without guitar in particular. He paid more attention with the thought that unless he hurries up and gets used to an orchestral accompaniment, he could be the reason why their performance is ruined. It is not a time for him to just be in awe.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. Let\u2019s start with the 4th track. Alvin, the original song is heavy metal. Shall we get the mood up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alvin Lee did not look back, put up his finger, and signaled his okay.</p><br/><p>Kyung Min Ho sent the start signal with his drumsticks, and played the drums. When Colin\u2019s fast bass fingering increased and Jun Hyuk\u2019s guitar riff began, Alvin Lee\u2019s rough and husky voice started going up.</p><br/><p>While playing the guitar, Jun Hyuk listened to the harmony between Colin\u2019s bass and Kyung Min Ho\u2019s drums. As the peal grew, he could tell how much Kyung Min Ho\u2019s sense of rhythm had advanced. It seems that playing sessions for all different genres was the driving force.</p><br/><p>When the much freer drum performance ended, Alvin Lee turned and clapped lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Just keep playing the drums like this. Your sense of rhythm is good and the hits are exact.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jun Hyuk translated, Kyung Min Ho blushed and bowed his head. With more confidence, his drumming gradually showed its true manifestation. Even with the orchestral piano accompaniment, his drumming did not waver and their preparation for the concert went on favorably.</p><br/><p>Isaac, who disappeared after the first night they arrived in Hawaii, appeared again after exactly 1 week. He must have been lying around on the beach for a really long time because he has clear tan lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all ready to go? Shall we go to Korea now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRock n\u2019 roll!\u201d</p><br/><p>The 4 people facing President Stern look like a complete rock band. They got on a limousine to the airport and boarded Stern\u2019s private plane.</p><br/><p>When the private plane was flying over Korea, Tara quietly called Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. There are a lot of people gathered at the airport right now. We\u2019re going to go to the hotel after a little photo time. You\u2019ll do your interview at the hotel, so just know that\u2019s happening.</p><br/><p>And change into this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara had been meticulous enough to pack a shirt and suit, loafers, and neck tie.</p><br/><p>\u201cA suit? Why all of a sudden? Everyone\u2019s dressed casually. I\u2019ll stick out too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a broad spectrum, it\u2019s part of creating your image. You\u2019re building your image as a modern maestro. The details are from sponsors. You especially need to wear the watch. When you wave to people at the airport, do it with your left hand so the watch stands out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? We\u2019re doing all this stuff we normally don\u2019t do. Are the suit and shoes advertising too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara laughed and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to accept it when the conditions are good. The amount of money we got to have you wear that watch while in Korea is more than the amount you\u2019d make for selling 100,000 copies of your album. That\u2019s something we need to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re slowly using me as a billboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Do you know how many proposals you\u2019ve gotten as an advertisement model from Korea? Each of the model fees match up to the guarantee for the Seoul concert.</p><br/><p>We turned all of those down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk stopped buttoning the shirt and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s that much, let\u2019s shoot a few while we\u2019re in Korea. Is there need to turn them down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHang on. You need to take care of your image until the real big shot comes in. There\u2019s no reason to shoot an advertisement for some Korean press agency and miss out on something bigger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on earth is the bigger thing? Tell me in more detail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on Aston Martin and Bugatti right now. We\u2019re looking into an exclusive contract with one of the two. Beethoven\u2019s car! It\u2019s bigger than all of the Korean ads combined.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk realized that President Stern had not been joking entirely when he said that he would be working Jun Hyuk hard. He was working him appropriately and expensively.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When the door for the arrivals gate opened, there was tremendous cheering from the people greeting the 4 men. Beyond the reporters\u2019 camera flashes, there were people waving signs of various colors with Jun Hyuk\u2019s name written on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. Don\u2019t forget to wave with your left hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara whispered to Jun Hyuk and he smiled brightly, waving his left hand. Then he turned to Kyung Min Ho beside him,</p><br/><p>\u201cMin Ho. There\u2019s something you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat I have a lot more male fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>More than half of the fans cheering for him in the airport are males.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe guys aren\u2019t here to see you. Men aren\u2019t fans of good looking men. They\u2019re all here to see Alvin Lee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? News about Alvin Lee\u2019s participation hasn\u2019t been revealed yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to get on social media. There\u2019s no such thing as a secret. The whole world already knows about Alvin Lee joining the concert.\u201d</p><br/><p>They got out of the arrival point and went to a temporary wall with the Seoul airport and sponsor logos to smile and wave. Alvin Lee whispered among the endless camera flashing,</p><br/><p>\u201cJun, am I famous in Korea? Are those guys really my fans?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot as much as Nirvana, but you have a lot of followers. Smile for them a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk and his party took photos for a while and then left for the hotel. There were a lot of fans waiting at the hotel as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun. I didn\u2019t know you were such a star in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know either. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the power of the press.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s group waved to the fans again and went up to the hotel\u2019s royal suite.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun and Lawyer Baek Seung Ho were waiting for Jun Hyuk in the royal suite. Fortunately, the two men did not make a fuss after seeing Alvin Lee. Alvin Lee was born too late to be one of their heroes. Yoon Kwang Hun and Baek Seung Ho\u2019s heroes are the already old Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Ronnie James Dio who had already passed away.</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho was pleased to see Jun Hyuk for the first time in a while, and handed him a couple papers after catching up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a statement regarding the income you\u2019ve brought in in Korea until now. Look over it carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you took good care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Hun handed the papers to Jun Hyuk again when he did not even look at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. At least check the quarterly financial statements yourself. It\u2019s not a difficult account book. I\u2019m telling you to take a look at how much you made, how much you spent, and how much you paid in taxes at the least. Even if your management agency takes good care of you, make sure you do a final check. All adults do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk listened to Baek Seung Ho. He looked over 4 sheets filled with numbers and realized one thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I used money freely, but I was actually saving a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. You spend a lot! You just earn more. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could tell that Jun Hyuk had not just skimmed through it without paying attention from the way he talked about his spending. Baek Seung Ho laughed wholeheartedly and kept giving Yoon Kwang Hun a weird look.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. I\u2019m going to talk to Tara for a second, so learn how to spend from Lawyer</p><br/><p>Baek. You need to know how to save, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun gave a pat to Jun Hyuk on the shoulder and left the room to look for Tara. He called Tara out quietly and she went pale after talking for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mistake. I didn\u2019t check on the situation in Korea at all. I was forgetting that it\u2019s</p><br/><p>Jun\u2019s motherland. What do I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you in advance because I thought that would be the case. Just wait for now,</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll talk to Jun. It\u2019s something he needed to go through at least once.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll start by canceling the interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tara was about to walk away, Yoon Kwang Hun stopped her.</p><br/><p>\u201cTara. There\u2019s no way for Jun to avoid it while he\u2019s in Korea. He\u2019ll know as soon as a reporter puts a microphone to him and asks a question. It could be better to just have him face it head on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun calmed Tara down, took a deep breath, and went back to Jun Hyuk.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you learn a little on how to spend your money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know the easiest way. You just don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk laughed as he spoke, but he had felt that something was weird between the two men.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Do I need to keep looking at these documents? If there\u2019s something you need to say, hurry up and say it like an adult!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun looked at Jun Hyuk and cautiously spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have 2 interviews today, right? One joint press conference with all 4 people and one by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn uncomfortable question might come out in that solo conference.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir. Don\u2019t go in circles, and just say it. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho spoke quickly when Jun Hyuk looked frustrated. It is easier to reveal these things quickly. It just becomes harder to say if they keep dragging it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt actually began when you started being treated like a hero in Korea\u2026 but it came out when this concert became news and there was talk about your guarantee amount and money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s voice rose in frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people coming out to say that they\u2019re your biological parents. There\u2019s no better gossip, so the press is pouring out articles like this too.\u201d Yoon Kwang Hun spoke calmly in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll ask about it during the press conference. Are you going to meet the people who claim to be your biological parents or if you\u2019re going to do a DNA test\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Baek Seung Ho could not say anymore. Jun Hyuk\u2019s body was frozen and his expression had not changed at all, and he was just looking at the document on top of the table.</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun gave Baek Seung Ho a look at got up. His thinking is that it is better to let him be alone in such a time. When they came out of the hotel room, Baek Seung Ho looked at Yoon Kwang Hun in worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be okay? I think the shock is big.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it was a big shock. Let\u2019s leave him alone. He\u2019s not a kid anymore. He\u2019ll cope with it well. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll say something once he\u2019s done thinking. Let\u2019s wait until then.\u201d Tara came to them. Her face did not look good either.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yoon. Did you tell him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a huge shock. I thought it\u2019d be best to let him be alone for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s my mistake. I should have known if something like this was going on\u2026 First for the press conference\u2026 I had it pushed back due to exhaustion from the flight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. And Jun needs to know about this anyway. Jun needs to make the decision himself when it comes to matters regarding his biological parents. And you can leave him to us to take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara bowed her head and turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t do. I\u2019ll have them proceed with the joint press conference without Jun. The reporters will understand as well because Jun has his press conference.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you can do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tara needed to get moving busily.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

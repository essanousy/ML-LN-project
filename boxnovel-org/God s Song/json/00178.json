It is also simply known as Turkish March. She did not play it in Mozart\u2019s original version, but flavored it with her own arrangement.</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji used all 88 keys and showed most of the techniques she knows within 2 minutes and 30 seconds. They could tell that she had arranged it in order to show as much of her ability as she could. She showed them the explosive openness that Professor Jeon Hye Jin first showed Jun Hyuk and her own subtlety.</p><br/><p>She was using all of her power, so much so that they could see the movement of her muscles from the sleeves she had pulled up. Her face was flushed because she had used all of her strength. Her face reddened even more at the sound of the 4 people clapping.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. What do you think? She\u2019s pretty good, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Professor Jeon Hye Jin was looking at Jun Hyuk, the pride of her student was evident.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not just pretty good. How did she come in 6th at the competition? She could win and then some.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk\u2019s eyes showed that his compliments to Professor Jeon are sincere.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid! Your girlfriend made such a scene right before Ye Ji that she was overshadowed.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Ye Ji, it was the greatest praise that Jun Hyuk was in such admiration that he had even forgotten that Amelia won.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Professor. I\u2019m grateful for even coming in 6th.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Ye Ji was modest but Yoon Kwang Hun did not miss the chance to compliment her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s a shortcoming in the assessment. That\u2019s really impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun even thought that Han Ye Ji\u2019s piano would soon surpass that of her mentor\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cTchaikovsky was the 2nd competition? It\u2019s a lack of experience. You can reach for the win at the next competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun kept praising her. Hwang Suk Min had a good idea while listening to her play, and clapped his hands together.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a good idea. What do you think about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone focused on Hwang Suk Min.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about holding a performance the day before Jun Hyuk leaves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me? A performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes widened at the mention of a performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Jun Hyuk can conduct for our Fine Philharmonic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Hwang, you\u2019re too ambitious. You think Jun Hyuk will be satisfied with Fine Philharmonic after conducting for Boston?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too mean. It is a bit of a poor instrument, but I\u2019m telling you we can perform Beethoven really well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Fine Philharmonic normally performs music that the average person enjoys, they receive pretty high reviews for Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a bad performance if Ye Ji plays the piano for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the piano and Beethoven were linked, Professor Jeon could figure out what performance Hwang Suk Min had in mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Hwang. Are you saying we should perform Beethoven\u2019s \u2018Emperor\u2019?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019d be perfect? Since the orchestra can\u2019t match up to Jun Hyuk, Ye Ji can cover on the piano.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why the day before he leaves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there are articles criticizing it, it won\u2019t matter. So Jun Hyuk won\u2019t be bothered.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Jun Hyuk had heard this suggestion before, he would have refused it. But after hearing Han Ye Ji\u2019s piano, it is a very slightly attractive offer. He wants to see more of Han Ye Ji\u2019s piano than conduct the Fine Philharmonic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Jun Hyuk, the calligraphy doesn\u2019t cover the brush. And it\u2019ll become a memory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Hwang, you\u2019ll have some damage. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Jeon\u2019s worry was comparing Jun Hyuk and Hwang Suk Min. If Jun Hyuk conducts, the orchestra members would be the first to compare the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell what of it? It\u2019s something everyone knows. And it\u2019s a process without any type of recording. Only the people who come to the performance will see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo ho. Anyway, we have to recognize that you\u2019re wry.\u201d</p><br/><p>If there are no recordings, Jun Hyuk\u2019s music disappears in the concert hall. Anyone who does not want to miss it needs to watch. Even those who try their hardest to ignore Jun Hyuk will come looking for the performance out of sheer curiosity.</p><br/><p>Hwang Suk Min spoke again to prevent any misunderstandings there might be.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it also look good if we donate all of the proceeds to a charity under Jun Hyuk and Ye Ji\u2019s names?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who embraced Hwang Suk Min\u2019s idea was Yoon Kwang Hun. He has not yet seen Jun Hyuk conduct an orchestra. He wanted Jun Hyuk to accept Hwang Suk Min\u2019s proposal just so he could watch Jun Hyuk conduct in person.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Hyuk could not respond to this sudden proposal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no pressure, so just think about it. Call me if it gets boring to just eat, sleep, and hang out. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>A meeting that had gathered just to see faces ended with a performance proposal. When the 3 people left, Yoon Kwang Hun tried to find out how Jun Hyuk is feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Hyuk. What do you think about Teacher Hwang\u2019s proposal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t even decided when I\u2019ll be leaving\u2026 It\u2019s ambiguous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Didn\u2019t Teacher Hwang say it before? Call him if you get bored. For now, rest more.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, not even a day passed before he could tell how Jun Hyuk is feeling. He was humming the melody to piano concerto Emperor.</p><br/><p>There were occasionally fun times when people rooting for Jun Hyuk would come by for a cup of tea or a drink, but Jun Hyuk was still just hanging out.</p><br/><p>In that time, Lawyer Lim So Mi sent over the contract with Stern Corporation.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommission is 15%. The other conditions are unconventional. First, President Stern has an apartment in New York that he will allow Jun Hyuk to use, and everything else is the same as the conditions that the maestro of the New York Philharmonic has. As you know, he can terminate the contract at any time, so it\u2019s a bit much to nitpick over more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll talk it over with Jun Hyuk and call you right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The standing conductor of the New York Philharmonic receives the best treatment from Stern Corporation. As Lawyer Lim So Mi said, asking for anything more is too greedy.</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk signed the contract with Stern Corporation without disagreement, and everything started changing little by little.</p><br/><p>He had been spending half of his days rolling around in bed, but was now sitting in front of his desk from early in the morning until dawn. The scores accumulated as much as he spent the time, and he occasionally sat at the piano to knock on the keys.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you writing a new song? What is it this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s all done. This time, it really feels good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It must be no joke if it\u2019s enough for you to say that you have a good feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s heart beat with anticipation because this is the first time he is seeing Jun Hyuk so full of confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. It lacks too much to be called a masterpiece, but it\u2019s really fun to make. It\u2019s to the point where I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it before. He he.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun could not hold back his curiosity and tried to take a peek at the score, but Jun Hyuk freaked out and hid it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh. Stop it. I said I\u2019d show it to you when it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Why are you hiding it when I\u2019ll see it anyway?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you this is fun. Have patience for that fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun needed to say what he had been holding back while watching Jun Hyuk write songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Jun Hyuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are you thinking of doing the performance that Teacher Hwang proposed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh that? I wasn\u2019t going to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Hyuk was surprised when he saw Yoon Kwang Hun\u2019s disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you looking forward to a performance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not that\u2026 I was just wondering when the people who helped you would get to see you conduct if not for this opportunity. And I thought you were thinking of doing it because I heard you humming the melody for Emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he. I actually got a hint from Emperor and Han Ye Ji\u2019s piano.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHint? The song you\u2019re working on now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun could guess that Jun Hyuk is working on a piano concerto or piano sonata.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I told you it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>But he still could not tell what would be so fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the concert?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon Kwang Hun did not fold his expectations yet. It is also because there is someone he wants to watch Jun Hyuk\u2019s conducting with.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish up the song I\u2019m working on now, and then think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even after saying that he would finish it and think about it, another month passed by.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

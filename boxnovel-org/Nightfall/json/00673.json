However, it seemed to be so close to everyone\u2019s eyes as its every detail could be clearly seen. Its scales were like mirrors and its horns like volcanos. Its specific shape was difficult to describe, but it was the color of pure gold, yet transparent. It emitted endless light and heat that radiated over the Wilderness.</p><br/><p>As the Golden Dragon\u2019s head appeared, the sky in the south suddenly brightened dramatically, returning to its original appearance. Then, mere moments later, it exceeded the light and heat that the West-Hill Divine Palace Hierarch had released with his divine staff by tens and thousands of times.</p><br/><p>The dark night in the northern sky seemed to have felt the strengthening light and slowed in its approach.</p><br/><p>The Golden Dragon\u2019s head turned slowly, its two eyes that were like mirrors swept across the men on the Wilderness silently. Its expression was solemn, terrifying and suppressive.</p><br/><p>There were records about dragons in the teachings of the West-Hill Divine Palace, Buddhist scriptures and legends in the world. However, no one had ever personally witnessed the existence of dragons, much less a Giant Golden Dragon. A mythical creature like that had appeared\u2026</p><br/><p>The humans on the Wilderness all went mad.</p><br/><p>Especially the West-Hill Divine Palace coalition army, who watched as the darkness gradually defeated the light and as Yama approached the world. They suddenly saw the Giant Golden Dragon that represented the light and were filled with excitement. They knelt, pressing their tearstained faces to the ground and kowtowed repeatedly.</p><br/><p>There were even more people who stared at the sky dazedly as if they were dimwitted.</p><br/><p>The Golden Dragon\u2019s head emitted limitless light that represented warmth and love. However, light sometimes also brought with it punishment when it was disrespected.</p><br/><p>Moments later, the people on the Wilderness clutched at their eyes and knelt on the ground in pain. They dared not take another look at the sky. However, the light that the Golden Dragon\u2019s head spread was so enticing that some pious Haotian disciples continued staring with tears rolling down their faces despite the threat of death.</p><br/><p>As the endless light fell, the tears on believers\u2019 faces were instantly evaporated, and the liquid in their eyes was also instantly evaporated, turning into two columns of smoke that disappeared without a trace, blinding them.</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew that the Golden Dragon\u2019s head would appear because of his dream. He did not look up at all. Instead, he tore off his belt and wrapped it around the Big Black Horse\u2019s eyes, pulling the black horse carriage to stand beside Sangsang.</p><br/><p>Sangsang\u2019s eyes were tightly shut and her face was deathly pale. The black dust that swirled around her cleared up at a speed visible to the naked eye as the light emitted by the Golden Dragon\u2019s head shone on. Her body trembled as the cold aura gradually dampened and she looked as if she was in extreme pain.</p><br/><p>The Desolate fell into despair and fear once more. In the face of Haotian\u2019s divine punishment, how could these ordinary people resist? They knelt and lowered their heads, not daring to look directly into the sky.</p><br/><p>Tang did not look directly at the sky either. The light and coercion that the Golden Dragon\u2019s head emitted were simply not forces that the world could resist. However, he did not kneel either because he was the last World Wayfarer of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine. He represented the spirit of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, and the doctrine rejected Haotian\u2019s rule of the world.</p><br/><p>There were also several leaders of The Desolate warriors who cultivated in the Devil\u2019s Doctrine arts. They stood up despite their injuries and stared into the Wilderness covered in light. They tottered but refused to kneel.</p><br/><p>The light falling from the sky grew brighter and brighter. The bodies of Tang and the few Desolate warrior leaders made a slight noise. It was the sound of hard Desolate Man bones fighting against the suppression of Haotian.</p><br/><p>Sensing that there were insignificant humans on the Wilderness who dared to resist his majesty, the Golden Dragon\u2019s head in the sky turned slowly, looked in their direction and roared.</p><br/><p>The dragon\u2019s roar was low and fell onto the Wilderness like a hurricane. It was as if there were countless priests praying and cavalry howling in the wind. Countless rays of light appeared.</p><br/><p>The grass on the Wilderness that had been dampened by blood turned black. Blood evaporated into fetid vapor. The leaders of the Desolate warriors fell to the ground groaning in pain.</p><br/><p>There was a loud smack as Tang\u2019s left thigh bone broke. He howled in anger and resentment before falling to the ground heavily. Even as his blood flowed like a spring, he did not kneel.</p><br/><p>The Giant Golden Dragon came from Haotian\u2019s divine land and represented the power of Haotian. It showed the people the will of Haotian and was a show of divinity and divine punishment. Its roar was power and it could not be withstood by the world.</p><br/><p>The tens and thousands of humans on the Wilderness all knelt, showing their respect, awe and submission.</p><br/><p>In the West-Hill Divine Palace camp.</p><br/><p>Through countless layers of gauze curtains, one could see that the tall figure in the massive chariot had long knelt down. The divine scepter the Hierarch Lord held in his hands trembled, perhaps from fear, or perhaps from something else.</p><br/><p>In the other divine chariot, the Great Divine Priest of Revelation had also fallen on his knees, looking very serene. His blood-covered wrinkles reflected the light entering through the curtains as if they were smeared with gold powder.</p><br/><p>In the blood-colored chariot, Great Divine Priest of Judgment, Ye Hongyu knelt as well, submitting to the Golden Dragon\u2019s head in the sky. She had remained in this position since the moment the Golden Dragon\u2019s head entered the world.</p><br/><p>She was the only who knew that her knees had not touched the ground. Then, the Giant Golden Dragon had roared and Haotian\u2019s power swept through the Wilderness. Her knees had only been forced to make contact with the ground then, when Tang and the leaders of The Desolate warriors fell, spewing up blood. Her face suddenly paled as she bled from her knees and the corner of her lips.</p><br/><p>The infinite light that the Golden Dragon\u2019s head spread on the Wilderness quickly cleaned up the dark aura surrounding Sangsang. Then, light that was absolute light and heat landed on Sangsang and several tendrils of green smoke emerged from her body.</p><br/><p>Sangsang seemed to be in great pain as the light shone upon her. She clutched at her chest and coughed unceasingly. What she coughed up, was not blood or cold aura, but were black transparent ice cube-like objects.</p><br/><p>The black transparent ice cubes emerged from her lips and fell onto the ground. There was a sound of heavy impact as deep craters were formed. Then, they disappeared.</p><br/><p>It was then, when the Golden Dragon\u2019s head roared and arrived before her. The black ice cubes shattered into the tiniest pebbles. Her body twisted as if it was about to break.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was already running at his fastest speed. However, he could never beat the speed of light or be faster than the roar of the dragon. His fingers had just barely touched Sangsang\u2019s body when the power of Haotian fell unto him.</p><br/><p>There was a smack, and he knelt on the ground beside Sangsang. His knees impacted the ground with great force and seemed to have shattered.</p><br/><p>He felt an immense pain, causing his face to pale and he was very terrified.</p><br/><p>The Giant Golden Dragon roared, and no one in the world could fight against that. Before Haotian, he was weak. So what was the point of all the choices he made in the past?</p><br/><p>A winner was about to emerge from this battle between the light and darkness. Sangsang was about to die, and what could he do? What could he change? If he could not change anything, then why did he have those dreams? Why was he able to see the future in those dreams and see what was happening now?</p><br/><p>Ning Que supported himself with both hands and used all his strength to squat. Then, he smashed down heavily with his sole and changed his position from kneeling into sitting. He then stood, despite the suppression of the light, an expression of pain on his face.</p><br/><p>The simple move had used up all his courage and strength. He reached out with his trembling hand and pulled out a pair of glasses made from black crystal and placed them on his nose bridge.</p><br/><p>His complexion was extremely pale but seemed even paler once he put on the sunglasses. The sunglasses seemed even darker by contrast and the world, in his eyes, grew very dark.</p><br/><p>The blood and bodies on the Wilderness occupied most of the light and heat in the sky. In his eyes, everything became much darker and colder and more similar to what he had seen in his dark dreams.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked up directly at the Golden Dragon\u2019s head which almost occupied his entire field of vision. As such, it was easy to aim at. Even though he was behind the sunglasses, the light still shone through it piercingly, making it painful and uncomfortable for him. He teared up unknowingly.</p><br/><p>The iron bow was slowly pulled and creaked; the darkish iron arrow trembled slightly on the string. The sharp arrowhead met the light falling from the sky, making it seem dark and terrifying.</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not look frightened, but instead only looked determined. He looked at the Golden Dragon\u2019s head through his sunglasses and with a roar, he released the arrow on his bow, shooting into the dragon\u2019s right eye!</p><br/><p>Mythical creatures represented Haotian\u2019s appearance on earth. Those living on earth either knelt in a show of respect or submission, or they would remain silent like statues. But no one would think of killing the creature.</p><br/><p>Because it was impossible.</p><br/><p>Yet, Ning Que did it.</p><br/><p>The white turbulence bloomed behind the bowstring and was purified into nothingness by the infinite light falling from the sky. However, the iron arrow had left the string, and in a few moments, it reached the faraway sky.</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone on the Wilderness was kneeling, and no one dared to look directly at the sky and the Golden Dragon\u2019s head in it. Therefore, no one witnessed this incredibly rare scene.</p><br/><p>The Golden Dragon\u2019s head was extremely high up in the sky. It was likely that other than Liu Bai\u2019s sword, only Ning Que\u2019s Primordial Thirteen Arrows could reach where it was located.</p><br/><p>The darkish iron arrow turned into a slender shadow amongst the light. It pierced the dragon\u2019s left eye and then was dissolved by the light in mere moments.</p><br/><p>If the eyes of the golden dragon were like calm lakes, then the Primordial Thirteen Arrow that instilled fear in the cultivation world was like a thin shard of ice thrown into the lake. It disappeared within seconds and did not cause any ripples at all.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was not surprised at all by what happened. However, the word despair did not exist in his dictionary. He would not give up until the very last moment. And since he had to die, he would not be satisfied until he shot the arrow.</p><br/><p>The Giant Golden Dragon looked down at the Wilderness and at Ning Que who was holding his bow. Scorn and contempt appeared in its massive lake-like eyes. Then, indifference swept across its face as it breathed out.</p><br/><p>As the dragon\u2019s head breathed out, golden light condensed into billions of grains that fell onto the Wilderness like a flooding river. However, each grain of sand was transparent and every grain held absolute power!</p>\n</div>"}

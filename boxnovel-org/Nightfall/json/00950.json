But at this moment, what he wanted the most was to take away the chessboard that was left by Buddha because Ning Que, his Youngest Brother, was trapped in the chessboard with his life at stake.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>There were countless temples, unknown Buddha Arrays and Buddhist powerhouses such as Qi Nian and Elders of Commandment Hall in the majestic mountain peaks. Jun Mo was not sure that he could get to the summit easily, so he led the rebellious serfs to lure Qi Nian and Elders of Commandment Hall here.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo could go straight to the summit if he could get through these four. It would be best if he could kill these four because destroying Buddhism had become the most important part of his life and he must carry on whether or not he could take away Buddha\u2019s chessboard.</p><br/><p>It was not until then that Qi Nian understood why the fighting style of the rebel forces underwent such a big change. Their marching route was no longer strong and they simply and bravely rushed toward the summit, totally ignoring the fact that they would be wiped out even though they could only make it to the foot of the peak. It turned out it was a deliberate act as a warning to the opponent. What Jun Mo really aimed was to enter the mountain and grab Buddha\u2019s chessboard!</p><br/><p>Looking at the serfs who retreated like the tide of the sea, Qi Nian went silent, knowing that he and the three Elders of Commandment Hall might not be able to stop Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>Through previous contests, Jun Mo had completely absorbed the strength comparison between the two sides. He was confident that he could cross this barrier, otherwise he would not let those who follow him withdraw first.</p><br/><p>Whether it was on the mountain or on the mountain road, Qi Nian had confidence in stopping Jun Mo with the help of tens of thousands monks of Xuankong Temple even though Jun Mo was stronger.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But the field was so open and clear. How could he stop Jun Mo?</p><br/><p>Qi Nian turned pale, but he was very calm. Looking at Jun Mo who was slowly walking and at the iron sword in his left hand, Qi Nian drew a deep breath of the cold autumn wind.</p><br/><p>His Kasaya flew with the autumn wind. He took a deep breath, and the autumn wind between earth and sky kept entering his mouth. It was starting to wash his Buddha heart.</p><br/><p>It was natural for the sky and earth to respond to the power of Buddha. The silky clouds were floating on the blue sky, and the clouds were pulled to be slenderer.</p><br/><p>The weeds in the range of about one li suddenly collapsed and fell to the ground as if they were worshipping, revealing the human and animal bones and dusty gems which kept rolling in the wind.</p><br/><p>The stream flowing between the abandoned gold washing fields was so shallow and clear. But at this time, it had countless ripples due to the frenzied autumn wind, and the sand under the water made the stream muddy.</p><br/><p>Qi Nian moved his lips, starting the Silent Meditation which he had been cultivating for twenty years.</p><br/><p>This kind of meditation was silent, so Qi Nian made no sounds. Only a breeze came out slowly from his lips. The breeze was so gentle and full of compassion, spreading a faint aroma of sandalwood.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The power of Silent Meditation lay in finding the the awakening of gentle spring in the endless autumn wind chilling. The faint aroma of sandalwood and the smell of wind existed side by side, but they didn\u2019t melt together.</p><br/><p>The silent Buddha Dharma was not really silent.</p><br/><p>Listening to the thunder in a silent place, there was a thunder-like Buddha roar which was contained in the aroma of sandalwood that the breeze slowly sent out, just like the heavy rain always accumulating in the thick clouds like cotton.</p><br/><p>While the thick clouds were suddenly meeting and parting, there was heavy rain and thunder, and the Buddha roar suppressed Jun Mo in the desolate field and also informed the monks in the Xuankong temples.</p><br/><p>Breathing was the most frequent and also the most frequently forgotten movement of the human body, so it was natural and fast. Buddhists believed that breathing was a time dimension, which was extremely short.</p><br/><p>Between breathing, Qi Nian started the great supernatural powers of Buddha. Who could be faster than him?</p><br/><p>Jun Mo\u2019s sword was faster than breathing, the autumn wind, and the rainstorm. Aithin a blink, he came up to Qi Nian!</p><br/><p>The iron sword was even faster than the silent sound!</p><br/><p>Jun Mo\u2019s sword was just a foot away from Qi Nian.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo\u2019s sword was Jun Mo.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Of course, Qi Nian was just a feet away from Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>Beginning with Liu Bai, the art of sword in the human world had undergone earth-shaking changes. But the lonely and invincible Sage of Sword could only try to overturn the heaven and died in the end.</p><br/><p>However, the true meaning of his art of sword was left on earth and began to shine in many people\u2019s hands, including the disciples of the Sword Garret, Ning Que and Ye Hongyu.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo was the most qualified one to inherit Liu Bai\u2019s art of sword and to carry forward. He was Liu Bai\u2019s strongest opponent in terms of the art of sword but also his bosom friend.</p><br/><p>Even Sangsang couldn\u2019t avoid Liu Bai\u2019s approach and had to open her world to him. Then how many people could keep Jun Mo from one foot away? At least Qi Nian couldn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>Qi Nian knew that he could not avoid the sword, so he did not think about avoiding the sword from the beginning. He just blew a breath toward the iron sword.</p><br/><p>It was still the gentle breeze which was coming from the beautiful spring, not the chilly autumn. The breeze contained the true meaning of Buddha Dharma and samsara of all things on earth, and was able to remedy all the killing in the whole world.</p><br/><p>The iron sword of Jun Mo couldn\u2019t move forward, for he couldn\u2019t pierce the cycle of life.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo turned his wrist, and the iron sword and the breeze went away immediately. In the air without a trace of autumn wind, he suddenly swayed his sword to Qi Nian\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>The iron sword screamed in the wind, and Qi Nian\u2019s eyes suddenly became bright, just like the jewels on the Buddha statue. But he still couldn\u2019t avoid the sword, so he moved his right hand which was put before his body to his face. His three fingers were naturally drooping, and the other two seemed to touch yet not touch with each other, as if he was holding an invisible flower. With such a gesture, he approached the cutting edge of the sword.</p><br/><p>The iron sword had no cutting edge, but it still got the intent of a cutting edge. The invisible flower in Qi Nian\u2019s hand revealed tranquil zen, but it was not a real flower in the human world. It was impossible for the iron sword to fall on it.</p><br/><p>The iron sword was gently pinched by Qi Nian with his fingers.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Jun Mo withdrew the sword. The action seemed to be simple, but intact it represented an extremely shocking state. There were a few people in the human world like Jun Mo who could ignore the illusion and truth and survive the Pinch Flower Fingers.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo looked calm even though he couldn\u2019t defeat Qi Nian from the front. As Jun Mo flicked his right sleeve and stepped forward to the right, the iron sword in his left hand was swept behind him and then he swayed the sword to Qi Nian\u2019s face with a backhanded gesture.</p><br/><p>Whether it was forehanded sword or backhanded sword, it was still just a sword. How could you survive this?</p><br/><p>Qi Nina couldn\u2019t avoid the sword, so he had to confront with it the hard way. With the appearance of the Light of Buddha, the Dharmakaya of Acalanatha was once again visible in the field, but was immediately absorbed into his body and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Being invisible didn\u2019t mean it was nonexistent. The Dharmakaya of Acalanatha was absorbed by Qi Nian, which meant that, from this moment on, it became a part of him and his body was as strong as King Kong.</p><br/><p>The iron sword fell on Qi Nian\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The crisp sound sounded like a slap.</p><br/><p>A very clear red mark appeared on Qi Nian\u2019s cheek, which looked like that he was slapped in the face.</p><br/><p>Then his face became swollen at a rate visible to the naked eye. The nine strongest teeth fell out and were shattered into pieces. And blood flowed down his lips.</p><br/><p>Anyone would be as strong as King Kong if they had absorbed the Dharmakaya of Acalanatha. But Jun Mo\u2019s sword could smash anything other than the Chief Monk of Scripture who had turned his body into Buddha and had a gold body which couldn\u2019t be destroyed.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Qi Nian was in pain and felt humiliated.</p><br/><p>He was a traveling disciple of Buddhism and a recognized powerhouse of the Chosen Generation. But he was defeated by his peer, Jun Mo, in such a contemptuous way today. How could he not feel humiliated?</p><br/><p>Because of the pain and humiliation, he couldn\u2019t concentrate on meditating and began to tremble. His blood-covered lips began to twitch, and the breeze that was blown out of his lips was unsustainable and scattered to protect his face.</p><br/><p>Although he was very angry, he was soberly aware that if he were to not protect his face, then Jun Mo was very likely to directly smash his head into pieces.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo did not continue to attack, for the three Elders of Commandment Hall were prepared to attack him. He didn\u2019t intend to linger. He just wanted to enter the mountain.</p><br/><p>With his bloody Kasaya slightly floating, Jun Mo sprang into the air and stepped on Qi Nian\u2019s head with his right foot, violently interrupting the second Silent Meditation he was preparing and falling among the three Elders of Commandment Hall.</p><br/><p>The three Elders of Commandment Hall were sitting in a way that they formed a triangle. The distance among the three was exactly the same, which coincided with the calculation of Buddhist doctrines.</p><br/><p>The Elder who had the highest state sat facing the direction leading to the peak, that is, facing the road Jun Mo had to pass through. If Jun Mo wanted to go up the mountain, then he had to go through the Elder before Qi Nian was strong enough to turn around.</p><br/><p>The iron sword came to the Elder.</p><br/><p>The Elder looked solemn, and the rosary beads in his hand were shining, stalling the iron sword.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The other two Elders began to chant.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo reached out and grabbed the iron sword, and then the rosary beads suddenly snapped off.</p><br/><p>The three Elders of Commandment Hall shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>The rosary beads instantly broke up, and the Power of Buddha hung over the field.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo sprang into the air and stepped on the head of the Elder, then fell on the ground in a distance.</p><br/><p>He was able to pass through in such an unreasonable way.</p><br/><p>The magical power hidden in the rosary beads all fell on Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Jun Mo had quickly passed through the field and blood was coming out of him, the Elder knew that he was severely injured and was stunned.</p><br/><p>He just left like this?</p><br/><p>Why would he rather stay injured than fight?</p><br/><p>Is he still that proud and pretentious Jun Mo?</p><br/><p>In the desolate field, with the bloody Kasaya flying in the autumn wind, Jun Mo swept to the far end and rushed toward the mountain peak with the aid of Qi of Heaven and Earth.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He was still the proud Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>But he was just confident, never pretentious.</p><br/><p>He would never be afraid no matter how powerful the enemy was.</p><br/><p>But he could temporarily ignore his pride if needed.</p><br/><p>He wanted to grab the Buddha\u2019s chessboard, and he had to do so when Qi Nian and the three Elders were not at the peak. All he needed was time, and everything else could be ignored.</p><br/><p>Of course, it didn\u2019t mean that he would not care about the injuries suffered today, but he could deal with it later.</p><br/><p>He believed that he would encounter Qi Nian and the three Elders again in the future. When it was time, he would fight against them with his iron sword.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

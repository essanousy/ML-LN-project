But no one around the imperial city paid much attention because they were too nervous from seeing the Eldest Brother. They thought the dying leader of Sword Garret was recalling his past. It wasn\u2019t until when Long Qing said it again that people started to realize something and became terrified.</p><br/><p>After that spring rain, Hengmu Liren was turned from a manservant into the most powerful and unpredictable cultivator in Taoism. He was enlightened and bestowed with wisdom therefore immediately understood what Long Qing meant. He got stiff and extremely pale, and could not help from looking toward the far north.</p><br/><p>In the far north under the dark sky, there was a magnificent city named Chang\u2019an. He had never been there but could almost see its moss-covered city wall now, and the person standing on top of it with an iron bow in his hand. If it was not because of Long Qing, he would already be dead by now.</p><br/><p>Although that person shot from thousands of miles away, he was almost killed.</p><br/><p>Long Qing looked into the Eldest Brother\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cNo wonder you\u2019ve been so calm. You were never nervous because you\u2019ve been waiting for our strike. When you stepped right previously I thought you were leaving. Now I know you were simply making way for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He made way for the iron arrow that came from thousands of miles away.</p><br/><p>Recalling what happened just now, Long Qing sweated profusely. If it was not because of Hengmu Liren\u2019s Divine Skill, what would he be like now?</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother stared at him and said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect you to see it through and break it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not an easy thing to see through the Academy\u2019s plan. It was even harder to make a correct move and stop Hengmu Liren\u2019s Divine Skill in such a short period of time. The Eldest Brother was alerted by Long Qing\u2019s power. Now he felt even more worried that he would be a big trouble for Ning Que in future.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should have been pleased by Mr. First\u2019s compliment.\u201d Long Qing sounded sad and continued, \u201cOr probably it was only because I knew that iron arrow from years ago therefore I could predict it. It was no big deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many years ago, the iron arrow appeared in the cultivation world for the first time in the snow mountains in North Wilderness. It was shot at Long Qing. His Taoist career or even his entire life was completely changed by that arrow.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cIndeed, you could not defeat the Youngest Brother\u2019s arrow after all these years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing said, \u201cSo he is indeed watching us from Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother answered, \u201cLike I\u2019ve said, perhaps not clearly enough, but he was definitely watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing kept looking into his eyes and asked, \u201cIs this the Academy\u2019s plan? But if Mr. First had not shown up, Liu Yiqing could not have made Hengmu expose himself to Ning Que by himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother answered, \u201cThe Divine Halls have planned it well. They wanted you to kill Mr. Liu. Or it would be better if you could also trap and kill the Youngest Brother. That was your plan\u2026 The Academy just followed your momentum. Since I was forced to be here, you were definitely exposed.\u201d</p><br/><p>As long as they were exposed, they would be shot by the arrows.</p><br/><p>It had happened previously. When the Second Brother brought his new wife to Qinghe Prefecture, he entered the manor by the brook and told calmly who he was.</p><br/><p>It was because he was Jun Mo, the Elder Cui and another hidden powerful cultivator at the state of Knowing Destiny had to apply their real power and were exposed like two bright lamps in the world.</p><br/><p>The iron bow was in Peach Mountain at that time. The person holding the bow saw the two bright lamps in Qinghe Prefecture. The next moment, they died.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Academy\u2026 is so insidious.\u201d Hengmu Liren\u2019s fear was turned completely into fury. He shouted to the Eldest Brother, \u201cTo trap us, you, the so-called righteous Mr. First chose to watch Liu Yiqing die rather than take action!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother paused and said, \u201cYou are wrong. I did not choose to stay idle. But I could not take any actions. Even if I could, why do we need to expose you to the person in Chang\u2019an?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hengmu understood and got even more furious.</p><br/><p>Long Qing certainly understoof too. He said, \u201cTo take action\u2026 it\u2019s not necessarily to take any actions. Your showing up is the action. Otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have dared to attack you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cEven if I had not shown up, I believe you wouldn\u2019t waste this chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing said, \u201cIf Hengmu was shot dead and I was killed by you, Mr. First, then do you think you could survive?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cWe could never be sure of anything in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing became solemn and asked, \u201cTo sacrifice Mr. First for the two of us, isn\u2019t that unworthy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right. I was prepared to leave when I stepped right. But you kept me here. What I am not sure about was what to do next.\u201d The Eldest Brother looked into the darkness and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if he would make me stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bouquet appeared again from the darkness, together with a voice of vicissitudes. It sounded like mellow vintage wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been waiting for me to act.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother looked there and said, \u201cYes. If you don\u2019t act, theh the Academy could never proceed.\u201d</p><br/><p>A scholar stepped out of the darkness. It was hard to tell his age. He seemed extremely old but still had a long way to go. It was weirdly integrated into this man. In his hand there was just a flagon. He was the Drunkard. The Drunkard walked to the Eldest Brother and stood in front of him silently.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother\u2019s cotton-padded gown was stained by dust, yet he seemed extremely pure from inside out. The Drunkard\u2019s clothes were dustless, yet he looked dusted from inside out.</p><br/><p>Ever since he kneeled in front of Sangsang, the Drunkard had become the most powerful in Taoism. It was because of him that Hengmu was certain that the Eldest Brother did not dare to interfere.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother did stay idle. But the Youngest Brother was prepared for an attack.</p><br/><p>Tonight, Taoism wanted to kill the Youngest Brother of the Academy but the Eldest Brother showed up instead. They were willing to kill any of them. But they did not know that the Academy had also planned for a kill.</p><br/><p>Tonight, the Academy wanted to kill the Drunkard. The Drunkard was the most powerful cultivator who had survived the previous Ever Night. He was a legend and an important figure to keep the balance in the human world. To kill such a person was definitely a revolution.</p><br/><p>Yet it was a pity that the revolution had failed.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard placed the flagon by his lips and kept drinking for a long while until his lower abdomen was plump. When his face regained some colors he said sentimentally, \u201cIndeed close, it was indeed close.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother answered sentimentally, \u201cClose indeed, but it was just close.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

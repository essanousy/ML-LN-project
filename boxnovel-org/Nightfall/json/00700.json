He had an obscene feeling from the inside out.</p><br/><p>Since he was famous for his ugly appearance, naturally, he couldn\u2019t make people happy. However, whether it was his wife or him, they both couldn\u2019t deny this. Hence, while standing in the solemn and mian hall, he felt more and more ashamed and more sweat started appearing on his forehead. His triangular eyes didn\u2019t stop flashing.</p><br/><p>Li Yu had seen Shangguan Yangyu many times and he knew that he was extremely ugly. However, every time she saw him, she felt there was newer ugliness added on the pile; a sense of disgust couldn\u2019t help but arise.</p><br/><p>However, she controlled her own expressions and showed great respect through her words, just like the warmth of the spring wind. She was like this as she was very clear that this prefectural magistrate had an incredibly rare prowess under these ugly looks. If not, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold such a thorny position for this long.</p><br/><p>Li Yu was very practical. So long as he was talented, even though his looks were incredibly ugly and he looked crafty and corrupt, she would accept him wholeheartedly.</p><br/><p>Moreover, no matter how many faults Shangguan Yangyu had, he had a beautiful strength: even though he gained fame after attaining his position, he didn\u2019t leave his wife who had ordinary looks. Till today, he still had deep feelings for his wife.</p><br/><p>This impressed Li Yu considerably. In addition, due to the importance of the position of the prefectural magistrate of Chang\u2019an City, this was the first minister that she met since the new emperor started his reign.</p><br/><p>According to logic, for Shangguan Yangyu, this was a godsend. For someone like him who had no idea what morals were, he had no psychological issues to be under the Princess and the new Emperor. As for the soliciting intentions between Her Highness\u2019 words, he immediately worshipped them.</p><br/><p>However, to the surprise of Li Yu and the few people in the hall, Shangguan Yangyu was still as respectful and ingratiating. He looked as if he wanted to kiss the soles of Li Yu\u2019s instep. But whenever the topic went deeper, he stared like a fool with his round eyes as if he had no idea how to answer.</p><br/><p>Li Yu furrowed her brows slightly. She knew of course that Shangguan Yangyu wouldn\u2019t be as dumb to not be able to understand her words. Hence, him pretending to be dumb could only mean that his and some of the courtiers\u2019 attitudes weren\u2019t firm.</p><br/><p>What left her more troubled was that the second person that she wanted to see today refused to enter the palace!</p><br/><p>The eunuch leader and the palace nanny didn\u2019t stop denouncing the man\u2019s disrespect. They looked resentful, almost as if they wanted to send for the Yulin Royal Guards to arrest the man and sent to the palace for punishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone keep quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu shouted as she waved her hand and chased out all the eunuchs, palace maids and the palace nanny nearest to her.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu wasn\u2019t a normal person. Even though she had the position and power she had today, she didn\u2019t dare be disrespectful to him, much less attack this person.</p><br/><p>He was the underground leader of Chang\u2019an City. Even though it had been years since he asked about the Jianghu world, and when he returned to Chang\u2019an City last year, he had ignored the Fish-dragon Gang\u2019s assistance, everyone clearly understood that the Chang\u2019an City\u2019s underground was still under his rule.</p><br/><p>However, if Chao Xiaoshu was only an elder in the Jianghu world, any of the ministers in the hall wouldn\u2019t pay her any attention. Naturally, it would not make Li Yu this troubled.</p><br/><p>The key was that Chao Xiaoshu was a Grand Cultivator of the Knowing Destiny State. He had a brotherhood with her father and when she saw him, she had to address him as Second Uncle Chao. Luckily, he had many brothers who would sacrifice their lives for him and in some ways, they were involved in the safety of Chang\u2019an City.</p><br/><p>After the eunuch and the palace maids were chased out, Li Yu wasn\u2019t the only person left in the hall. There was another middle-aged minister. He was Grand Scholar Mo Han who had joined the ranks four years ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you do not have to worry for now. Just because Chao Xiaoshu isn\u2019t willing to enter the palace doesn\u2019t mean that he has any opinion of you. Back then when he rejected the position conferred by His Majesty and left the palace, he had already stated his position. Today is just a continuation of that day; to let Your Highness understand his determination for not participating in the government.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Li Yu furrowed his brows and said, \u201cChang III and Fei VI have been popular with the Yulin Royal Guards. Liu V is already the commander of the Valiant Cavalry Battalion and when Chen VII returns to the bodyguard office, he would become the right-hand man of Xu Chongshan. These people follow the orders of Chao Xiaoshu. If father was still alive, they would naturally not dare to do anything. But now that he is dead, what if Chao Xiaoshu has any ideas, what dangers would Chang\u2019an City be in? I do not want to give up my life for anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han smile gradually faded as he asked, \u201cThen what does Your Highness think we should do with Chao Xiaoshu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu remained silent for a long time. She understood what the Grand Secretary meant and said, \u201cThese were the old matters that were arranged by father, only time can change them. Neither I nor Her Majesty, can handle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han said praisingly, \u201cIt is precisely because of this that His Majesty created the Fish-dragon Gang back then. It seemed insignificant and was even denounced by the censor as nonsense. But who would have thought that those people from the Fish-dragon gang back then would become such important figures now? These people were only loyal to the previous emperor and hence, they will definitely only listen to the instructions from the designated heir of the previous Emperor. His Majesty and Your Highness do not need to do anything. Your Highness would just need to follow what she used to do to maintain order and Chao Xiaoshu will understand Your Highness\u2019 wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cGrand Secretary\u2019s words make sense. I will make some arrangements later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yulin Royal Guards, the Valiant Cavalry Battalion as well as the Bodyguard office, they all cannot extend a hand inwards. This includes Her Majesty and the Prince. Back then, many had been killed that rainy night at the Spring Breeze Pavillion. This was a declaration from the previous minister and from how I see it, there is no problem with the safety of Chang\u2019an City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han\u2019s expression became increasingly grave as he said, \u201cI am worried instead about matters outside the border. There have been rumors that on the Wilderness, the Headmaster had drawn his sword and battled with Haotian. This has led to the West-Hill army turning against each other. The previous Emperor might have led the cavalry to defeat the enemy but the Headmaster has passed away and so has the previous Emperor. The West-Hill Divine Palace will not squander this opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though the Tang Empire is strong, it has become the public enemy of the world. There are powerful enemies surrounding us and if we are not careful, we will fall into a precarious state. According to sources, Prince Long Qing has already led the cavalry from the Left King\u2019s Palace to attack the Tang Empire. They are prepared to go by the Yan Road to move south; Your Highness should advise His Majesty to think about the military horses and not to place his thoughts on these small things of the court. With an enemy approaching, a civil strife must not break out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu knew the Grand Secretary was referring to the Imperial Astronomer and the Imperial Center Administration. With her expression calm, she was grateful that the Grand Secretary could point out His Majesty\u2019s mistakes and said, \u201cGrand Secretary do not worry, I will speak with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han nodded and said, \u201cThat will be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu then said, \u201cAbout the Left King\u2019s Palace attacking Tang, Grand Secretary you do not have to worry too much. Everyone knows that Long Qing is gunning for the Yan Kingdom\u2019s emperor position when he says he is going south. Crown Prince Chong Ming and I have a deep bond and I have anticipated this a long time ago. General Xian Zhiliang is resourceful and naturally, he will know how to handle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a civil servant by the Princess\u2019 side for all these years, Mo Han naturally was her most trusted confidant. Of course he knew that Xian Zhilang was Her Highness\u2019 person and he was somewhat relieved upon hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can ignore the trouble by the border of Yan territory but I am most worried about the north.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han said worryingly, \u201cBecause Her Majesty is still in Helan City, the position of the Nothern Military Camp seems more special. It cannot be disorderly yet it cannot be oblivious. I wonder what Her Highness has arranged?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Northern Military Camp guarded the countless miles of border area to the north of the Tang Empire. It had the most elite cavalry with the most dangerous mission and was fighting against the powerful Golden Palace for many years.</p><br/><p>The main general of the Northern Military Camp now was General Xu Chi, one of the Four Greatest Generals of Tang. He was always stable and didn\u2019t draw attention to himself.</p><br/><p>However, whether it was Li Huiyuan sitting firmly on the throne or the Tang Empire pitting against the whole world, Xu Chi and the rest couldn\u2019t ignore and bypass an important figure.</p><br/><p>In the past among the four generals, General Xia Hou was the close confidant of the Queen. Now that the general in the north was Xian Zhilang, he was Li Yu\u2019s man. Only General Xu Shi and Xu Chi were impartial.</p><br/><p>They were loyal and only loyal to Tang Empire\u2019s emperor Li Zhongyi.</p><br/><p>What worried Grand Secretary Mo Han the most was whether the loyalty of General Xu Chi to the previous emperor could be successfully passed on to the current emperor. Or would it perhaps move to another prince\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cGeneral Xu Chi will definitely not be involved in the succession of the throne. This was something father had told me from a long time ago and hence, I believe that he will remain neutral.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han shook his head and said, \u201cSince His Majesty has already ascended the throne, it isn\u2019t right for the general to remain neutral.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cGrand Secretary words make sense, I have already decided to send Hua Shanyue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han furrowed his brows slightly and said, \u201cGeneral Hua Shanyue\u2019s loyalty towards Her Highness isn\u2019t doubtful. He has an affinity with General Xu Chi\u2019s family. However all these\u2026 are meaningless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said calmly, \u201cSince I have handed Hua Shanyue the most important mission, I believe that he is able to accomplish my requests. Please rest assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguang Yangyu remained behind closed doors after returning from the palace.</p><br/><p>His wife sat beside the bed and fed him some herbal medicine. She asked worryingly, \u201cAre you going to hit yourself with a stick again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguang Yangyu sighed and said, \u201cThis time, I am only afraid that I will strangle myself with white silk.\u201d</p><br/><p>His wife was shocked as she said, \u201cThe new emperor has started his reign and Her Highness has become so powerful. Since she values you, you should just let it be. Why seek death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguang Yangyu stared at her with his two triangular eyes as he chided, \u201cWhat does an ignorant woman like you know? Even though she values me, how long will that be for? If I worship Her Highness, naturally I can get a load of silver and rise up the ranks. However, when the Empress bring the Prince back to Chang\u2019an, what will I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The wife listened and laughed. She said, \u201cYou have always talked about the law of the Tang Empire, why have you forgotten about it now? The Emperor ascended the throne with the Edict, who would dare oppose him? Who can oppose him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I say you do not understand, you really don\u2019t. The edict might not be able to be faked but Her Highness asked to see me first. Why is that so? This means she is also afraid that chaos would happen in Chang\u2019an City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yangyu said, \u201cWhat circumstances will cause chaos in Chang\u2019an City? Naturally there will be those who are unhappy.\u201d</p><br/><p>His wife got increasingly puzzled as she pushed the herbal soup to the side and asked seriously, \u201cWho else can cause trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yangyu burst into laughter as he said, \u201cNow, all the ministers in the imperial court, whether they are with the Queen or Her Highness, they do not understand a rule. From how I see it, even if His Majesty and the Princess do not understand. The edict isn\u2019t the key, Chang\u2019an City isn\u2019t the key. Even those generals aren\u2019t the key.\u201d</p><br/><p>His wife asked curiously, \u201cThen what is the key?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yangyu said, \u201cThe attitude of the Academy. That is the key.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

The Buddhas shone with glittering gold light, just like countless oil lamp. Looking at Ning Que standing in the opposite while holding a cutlass, they reacted differently. Some were sorrowful, some were angry and some awestruck.</p><br/><p>All Buddhas felt that something important had changed on Ning Que, which might have an impact on the Buddha\u2019s Nirvana. However, none of them understood what it was.</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t understand either. He only knew Sangsang was still on his back, but her spirit had entered into his body. He felt he became fearless and full of strength.</p><br/><p>Sutra chanting resounded in the woods while the golden lights were ever growing. Countless Buddhas appeared everywhere and gradually surrounded them, leaving no way for them to escape.</p><br/><p>All Buddhas seemed beneficent and looked at him with pity. However, none of the Buddhas had ever tried to persuade them since the Chaoyang City or communicate with Ning Que. This was because Ning Que refused to communicate with them. He knew that every difference needed to be settled by force.</p><br/><p>It was also true in this situation. He breathed deeply, and his eyes became extraordinarily bright. He gripped the cutlass and slashed randomly twice to his front in the woods.</p><br/><p>Two hundred-meter-long blades appeared in the dim and dark forest.</p><br/><p>Fierce wind howled. Countless moss was dug up, weeds were pressed down, and rocks cracked. Not a single thing could remain whole after the hundreds-meter blades swept off. On the other hand, the Buddhas within the effect of the blades were pulverized with golden power dispersing in the air!</p><br/><p>If he looked down the whole field in the clouds, the Buddha would see a design that stretched for hundreds of miles. It was a simple yet angry word.</p><br/><p>\u201cY\u201d!</p><br/><p>He wrote the talisman with his cutlass.</p><br/><p>Ning Que wrote such a tremendous talisman. It extended across the entire woods.</p><br/><p>The horrible Fu spirit ruthlessly and intrepidly cut off all in its way. Clear cracks appeared on the skin of a redwood tree that was thicker than several people together. Even the howling wind was cut into pieces by the Fu spirit; the golden powder was gradually blown up to the upper air.</p><br/><p>Ning Que slashed twice. At least two hundred Buddhas died in front of the talisman. Nevertheless, a lot of Buddhas were still in the forest. They looked resolute and moved towards him.</p><br/><p>Talisman Y originated from the first Fu he mastered: Talisman \u201cTwo\u201d, which was created from Master Yanse\u2019s strongest \u201cWell\u201d talisman. It could even break the space when it was cultivated to the utmost, let alone these Buddhas. At that moment, he didn\u2019t need to worry that these Buddhas approaching if he stayed within the Fu spirits. However, the talisman had its own limits. Its spirit couldn\u2019t stay in the natural world forever. No matter how strong a Fu was, it would gradually disappear as time went by. What would he do then?</p><br/><p>Ning Que had never thought he could use the strong talisman to save his life. He\u2019d said that he wanted to fight another round, so he could only attack.</p><br/><p>A clear roar rose from the ground to the sky and spread towards the depth of the woods. It was as if the world was thrilled at the proud and cruel roar. The dim and dark forest lit up in a second.</p><br/><p>Accompanied by the roaring, Ning Que\u2019s right foot stamped heavily on the ground. An extremely deep rupture, hundreds of meters long, appeared. He gripped the cutlass with two hands and ran towards the woods.</p><br/><p>The two quick and forceful Fu spirits in the woods unexpectedly swept forward with his cutlass. It moved slowly but unstoppably towards the east!</p><br/><p>The talisman was different from other cultivating methods in nature. Its essence was to talk with the nature and then mobilize the Qi of the nature. A Talisman master\u2019s communication with the nature was a kind of request. From a certain point of view, it was a passive act, and that was why it could mobilize such a grand amount of Qi of the nature.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, there had never been a talisman master who could move the Fu spirit, because no human had enough spiritual power for nature to follow the orders of a lowly human.</p><br/><p>What Ning Que did today had never happened in the history of human cultivation</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The two quick and forceful Fu spirits were hundreds of meters long and passed through the whole forest. Moving forward with Ning Que\u2019s cutlass, they become two intangible, giant and sharp blades. All obstacles before them were easily smashed.</p><br/><p>What could escape from the reaping of Death\u2019s scythe?</p><br/><p>The countless Buddhas in the woods were different in height and weight, so some had their heads cut off, some bodies halved, some skulls shaved, and some legs broken off. So much blood flowed.</p><br/><p>Golden blood spilled out of their bodies, cut into the tiniest shreds by the Fu spirit, and then turned into golden powder floating in the woods. The dim and dark world lit up.</p><br/><p>The Buddha\u2019s Light was extraordinarily bright. Ning Que had multiple wounds and looked weary and withered after days of fleeing. His face was a little bit pale and became as white as snow against the shining of the Buddha\u2019s Light.</p><br/><p>He squinted and lowered his head. He held up the cutlass and forged ahead without any trace of fear on his face.</p><br/><p>If she was still on his back, Sangsang could have probably died from the Buddha\u2019s Light, even with the protection of the big black umbrella. But at that moment, the one on his back was just the body of Sangsang, while Sangsang was actually inside him.</p><br/><p>The sound of water spread from the east of the forest. He went toward that direction. In front of the blade of the cutlass, the tremendous \u201cY\u201d talisman was followed up, with countless tree peels and golden Buddha blood splashed into the air.</p><br/><p>Countless Buddhas fell down one after the other. There was no sad howling in the woods nor plaintive whines, only the pitiful and merciful sutra chanting. At times, the chanting abruptly stopped, which meant a Buddha was dead under the intangible blades.</p><br/><p>Ning Que lowered his head and ran without stop. God knew how long he had run. He stopped until he felt his hands tremble while holding the cutlass and his breath turned rapid again.</p><br/><p>A huge river was before him. The water murmured peacefully and gently.</p><br/><p>He rushed out the woods with Sangsang on his back.</p><br/><p>He looked back and saw that the gold light was everywhere in the forest. Starting from the distant west, redwoods fell down one after another. The earth shook, stirring up smoke and dust.</p><br/><p>These redwoods were all cut off by the Fu spirit. However, the spirit was too sharp, so the giant trees didn\u2019t fall immediately after being cut. When one tree fell down, the others fell from the aftershock.</p><br/><p>Redwoods were tall enough to soar into the clouds. Even the shortest one was about a hundred of meters in height. With the collapse of these giant trees, smoke and dusts pervaded and soared up to the sky. During this, one could vaguely hear the panicked howling of goshawks.</p><br/><p>These goshawks were nested on the top of the trees. Now, they had no other choices but to find somewhere else.</p><br/><p>Hectares of woods were flattened to be ground like that. Countless giant trees piled up and smashed the wet ground into a huge mess. The tragic end of the Buddhas within the woods went without saying.</p><br/><p>Three thousand three hundred and thirty-three Buddhas died in the woods.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

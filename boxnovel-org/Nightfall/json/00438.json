They got off the horses and knelt before the horse carriage, ignoring sayings that they couldn't bow in armor.</p><br/><p>Chen Bachi's expression grew ugly, and he slowly knelt with the help of his attendant.</p><br/><p>\"Ye Hongyu left the Judicial Department. But it does not mean that she has betrayed the Divine Hall.\"</p><br/><p>\"Because leaving does not equate to betrayal.\"</p><br/><p>There was a sigh in the carriage.</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue could sense the sadness of the Divine Priest of Revelation and he grew angry and sad. Cheng Lixue's snow white hair danced faster and faster. He blankly looked at Chen Bachi who knelt before the horse carriage and said coldly, \"Go and receive your punishment.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Bachi violently whipped his head up to look at Cheng Lixue. If not for the bandages around his eyes, one would probably see vicious hatred in them.</p><br/><p>At the palace in the Wilderness last year, Cheng Lixue had been the one who had sent him to receive the punishment of beatings with a thorn stick. Ye Hongyu had betrayed the Divine Hall and blinded him, why did he have to be punished?</p><br/><p>The summer breeze sped through the cliff, lifting the curtains of the horse carriage. A wizened hand was revealed as it landed on the window lattice, knocking against it slowly.</p><br/><p>That was the Great Divine Priest of Revelation's hand.</p><br/><p>The cavalry and decons lowered their head and dared not look at the hand.</p><br/><p>Chen Bachi could not see, so he continued to look in that direction with a spiteful expression.</p><br/><p>The wizened old hand continued to knock on the windows.</p><br/><p>An aura enveloped them.</p><br/><p>Those by the horse carriage could hear the knocking, and an odd fear rose from their chest.</p><br/><p>One of them saw Chen Bachi's face and fell to the ground in horror.</p><br/><p>Chen Bachi did not sense or see anything.</p><br/><p>His expression was still spiteful, as if he was trying to find a rebuttal.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn't speak when he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>He touched his mouth, and touched a wet and sticky object.</p><br/><p>There was something very sweet in his mouth.</p><br/><p>Then, he realized what had happened. The vicious expression on his face faded into terror and hopelessness.</p><br/><p>His tongue was gone.</p><br/><p>There was only blood and bits of flesh in his mouth.</p><br/><p>Everyone was terrified as they saw the blood streaming out of Chen Bachi's mouth. Some could not stop their shouts of terror from escaping. A few cavalrymen of Divine Hall subconsciously moved forward and stopped in a sudden. They knew that this was the punishment of the Divine Priest inside the horse carriage.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation's voice rang from the carriage again.</p><br/><p>\"You shouldn't have spoken.\"</p><br/><p>\"You do not know how to speak.\"</p><br/><p>\"But you want to pass messages for others.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then you shan't ever speak again.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The lavish horse carriage dealt with matters of the cavalryman of Divine Hall and sped towards the four majestic temples on the Peach Mountain without delay.</p><br/><p>In the dark horse carriage, the Great Divine Priest of Revelation looked at the summer lands in the Peach Mountain. After a long silence, he said, \"I don't wish to and shouldn't interfere in matters in the Judicial Department. But it seems that I must interfere, so I did.\"</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue did not speak. He looked at the divine priest's weary face and was suddenly annoyed at the bigwig sitting upon the Ink Jade Throne.</p><br/><p>The different horse carriages of the delegation had long split up, leaving behind only the black and gold horse carriage of the Great Divine Priest of Revelation. It sped to the highest part of the temples and came to a black colored, solemn temple.</p><br/><p>The horse carriage stopped before the grand and majestic temple, looking insignificant and lonely. However, the deacons, no matter which temple they belonged to, all appeared startled and respectful when they saw who was in it.</p><br/><p>They respected the Divine Priest inside the horse carriage.</p><br/><p>They were shocked that the Great Divine Priest of Revelation had appeared at the Temple of Judgment.</p><br/><p>The three Great Divine Priests of West-Hill Divine Palace had never entered other temples except their own's. This was out of respect for others, and because of their own pride.</p><br/><p>The people knelt on the stone steps outside the temple and by the pillars. They knelt by the roads and looked at the horse carriage uneasily. They did not know what happened earlier today.</p><br/><p>They watched the wizened Great Divine Priest of Revelation emerge from the horse carriage slowly. He walked up the stone steps slowly and entered the black Temple of Judgement. The people watching were all surprised.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation was very old and frail.</p><br/><p>But he seemed strong and big when he walked into the Temple of Judgment. He looked just as tall as the roof of the temple.</p><br/><p>He walked across the smooth stone floors. Everyone in the Judicial Department knelt and welcomed him.</p><br/><p>It didn't matter what the Great Divine Priest of Revelation's presence at their temple meant to the Judicial Department. He could be here to shame or challenge them. But other than the Great Divine Priest of Judgment, there wasn't anyone who could reveal how they truly felt.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation walked into the Temple of Judgement. He stood before the empty halls and looked at the beaded curtains afar. He stopped and did not continue forward.</p><br/><p>He was here to talk, so he had to walk into the Judicial Hall. However, if he continued forward, the ill-tempered fellow behind the bead curtains would definitely think that he was here to fight.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of West-Hill was human after all, and humans would definitely have emotions.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation looked at the figure behind the beaded curtains and said, \"I went to the South Jin Kingdom and brought back the ashes of someone.\"</p><br/><p>The beaded curtains in the depth of the hall moved even though there wasn't any breeze. It revealed the Jade Ink throne behind it.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Judgment propped up his head on his hand and looked at the Great Divine Priest of Revelation with hooded lids. He stayed silent.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation shook his head and said, \"You shouldn't have done those things.\"</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Judgment did not raise his head. He said coldly, \"So what? I am second to Haotian only. Should I bow down to Liu Bai?\"</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation spoke after a long silence, \"You did not have to bow down to anyone before Senior Brother Guang Ming left. But after his leaving, you can only sit on the throne, and your head is thus naturally bowed down.\"</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Light had escaped from the You Prison and caused a commotion in the West-Hill Divine Palace. A rare few knew that this old man who was known as the strongest Great Divine Priest of Light in centuries had overturned the Confinement that the Great Divine Priest of Judgment had built with his life force.</p><br/><p>Almost no one knew that his overturning of the confinement had brought harm to the Great Divine Priest of Judgment. He was still unable to leave the Ink Jade throne.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation knew about this, naturally.</p><br/><p>That was why he had said that.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Judgment sat on the Ink Jade throne that looked as if it was made of the congealed blood of millions of people. He held up his head with his hand as if he was thinking. However, his head that used to sit upright and strongly on his shoulders was indeed lowered.</p><br/><p>He lifted his head slowly. His deep-set eyes were cold and cruel. He looked at the Great Divine Priest of Revelation who stood beyond the curtains and said, \"I can lift my head anytime.\"</p><br/><p>A gust of wind tore through the empty dark hall.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Those from the West-Hill Divine Palace did not know what happened in the Temple of Judgment. They did not know why the Great Divine Priest of Revelation had entered it and did not know what he said or did after meeting the Great Divine Priest of Judgment. They did not know what this meeting meant for history.</p><br/><p>They only heard the wild crazy winds. It was more frightening than the hurricane on the east shores of the Kingdom of Song. It sounded like the war cries of many giants.</p><br/><p>The winds swept out of the temple and onto the stone steps, slapping on the stone pillars. Many knelt on the ground in fear, but could not hide from the wrath of the wind.</p><br/><p>After some time, the howling of the winds stopped, as did the wind.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation walked out of the temple. He looked the same as he entered, and his expression was calm. However, the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes had deepened.</p><br/><p>The people watched with respect and unease as he walked down the stone steps. He did not enter the horse carriage, but walked to the peak of the Peach Mountain and towards the purest and white temple. Shocking guesses erupted in their hearts.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation did not return to his own temple after leaving the Temple of Judgment. Instead, he walked to the most solemn place in Haotian Taoism.</p><br/><p>The purest white temple belonged to the hierarch of West-Hill Divine Palace.</p><br/><p>No one knew why the Great Divine Priest of Revelation had visited the Great Divine Priest of Judgment, and then, visited the hierarch. Similarly, they did not witness what happened in the pure white temple. They only heard several roars of thunder ringing from the hall and across the Peach Mountain.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>There was a curtain of light in the deepest part of the white temple.</p><br/><p>The light curtain was formed by the purest Haotian Divine Light and possessed unimaginable power.</p><br/><p>The light curtain represented the rule of Haotian on the world.</p><br/><p>The figure of a Taoist landed on the pure Divine Light.</p><br/><p>The figure was extremely tall. He looked as if his head could reach the skies with his feet standing on the ground. He looked as if he could force heaven and earth apart.</p><br/><p>A roar of thunder accompanied each word that the Taoist spoke.</p><br/><p>He was the highest ruler of Haotian Taoism on earth. He was the Hierarch Lord of West-Hill Divine Palace.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation bent slightly in a bow at the figure behind the curtain of light.</p><br/><p>A sound rang from behind the curtain.</p><br/><p>\"Revelation, you think too much.\"</p><br/><p>The voice was calm, but caused the ray of lights to move when the sound crossed through the curtains. Then, it became the thunder that roared above the clouds.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation looked at the large figure and said calmly, \"The Tao Addict represents the Divine Hall's future. Those idiots have chased her away, and I cannot accept that. Hierarch Lord, you have remained silent on this matter, and I feel that that is very stupid.\"</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priests of West-Hill were people in unique positions. They were able to point out the Hierarch Lord's stupidity, which was hard to imagine. But what was even more unimaginable, was that the Hierarch Lord did not get angry, but instead, thought about it for a long while.</p><br/><p>\"The Tao Addict cannot return.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know.\"</p><br/><p>\"She is ruined.\"</p><br/><p>\"Possibly.\"</p><br/><p>\"The Divine Hall needs power.\"</p><br/><p>\"She can still be powerful.\"</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation said without expression, \"I see more than any of you.\"</p><br/><p>After the Great Divine Priest of Light had left, the Great Divine Priest of Revelation was the one who could see the future most accurately in the Peach Mountain.</p><br/><p>Even the person behind the curtain of lights had to agree with that.</p><br/><p>\"Perhaps you might be right.\"</p><br/><p>The roaring thunder faded.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation left.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>-</p><br/>\n</div>"}

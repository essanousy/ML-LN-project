Li Qingshan averted his eyes from the rolling leaves and looked at the palace walls at a distance. As he squinted, he took out a white handkerchief to cover his mouth and made several slight coughs. Then he folded the handkerchief carefully and put it into his sleeve.</p><br/><p>As the Nation Master of the Tang Empire, he was highly privileged but known for his banter. With the increase of wrinkles, however, he was obviously older and more silent.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the old people who died this year, a trace of worry emerged in his eyes. Although such matters as birth, death, illness and old age were all natural matters, he could not help sighing for the death of so many old friends in such a short time. As the abbey dean of the South School of Haotian Taoism, he worriedly pondered whether this represented Heaven\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>His Majesty seemed still healthy, but actually became increasingly weaker in recent years. Xu Shi aged more quickly in those years. If this generation was not dead but kept aging, how could he not feel worried about the future of the Tang Empire?</p><br/><p>If the Headmaster could live forever, the Tang Empire would have no problems. Even if there were some, it would be nothing but ripples in the pond. But the Headmaster would pass away one day.</p><br/><p>A yellow oiled-paper umbrella rested quietly on the jet-black wooden floor.</p><br/><p>He Mingchi knelt behind Li Qingshan, not seeing the worries on his teacher\u2019s face. He whispered, \u201cThe God-stunning Array is linked to the security of the Tang Empire and the array eye has always been kept by us from the Southern Gate Temple. Master Yan Se passed it to Ning Que, who has been missing for a long time. So in principle, it should be returned to us or His Majesty to avoid arousing suspicion. It seems improper to leave it at the Academy now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan shook his head and said, \u201cSince Senior Brother gave it to Ning Que, it is fine to allow the Academy to keep it temporarily. You must remember that although we belong to the Haotian Taoism, we should know the true meaning of the Academy to the Tang Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Mingchi agreed.</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan turned around. Looking at the chess board in front of him, he reached over to take away the black chess piece at the center of the chess board. He said, \u201cCompared with the Lanke Temple, my skill in chess is quite ordinary, even extremely terrible. However, when it comes to seeing Heaven\u2019s Way on the chess board, I am confident to compete with the monks in the Lanke Temple. One night years ago, I saw a carriage blocking the street but did not understand it. Now I realize something since I know that it was from that night when Ning Que began his journey of Tao enlightenment. It will be fine if he is dead. Otherwise, he will be a real trouble for our country.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Mingchi understood him. If Ning Que and the Daughter of Yama died, the world would keep going forward peacefully. If they were alive, what attitude would the Academy take? What should the Tang Empire do? Would it become the enemy of the entire world?</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan looked at the chessboard and kept silent for a long time.</p><br/><p>The fallen leaves in the courtyard were still rolling on the ground, making continuous rustles.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I am still alive when His Majesty dies, I will stand by the Princess and support Prince Li Yuanyuan\u2019s succession. If I die, I hope you can lead the Southern Gate Temple to do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan suddenly said.</p><br/><p>He Mingchi was shocked and suddenly looked up at his teacher.</p><br/><p>Nobody dared to openly talk about the succession of the throne in the previous years. However, with the coughs at the imperial study becoming deeper and more painful, such discussion finally emerged in Chang\u2019an today.</p><br/><p>However, this had a completely different meaning when the words came from Li Qingshan, comparing with discussions among ordinary people. Because it meant that in his opinion, His Majesty\u2019s time was running out even if he could still stay alive now.</p><br/><p>What increased He Mingchi\u2019s shock was the choice of his teacher. The Tang Empire\u2019s imperial court and even the villagers knew the close relationship between the Queen and the Nation Master. But why would he choose to support Li Yu and her brother?</p><br/><p>He Mingchi immediately recalled the letter sent back to Chang\u2019an City from Qinghe County by Ning Que last summer. At that time, Li Qingshan asked him to send the letter directly to the Princess, which made him more confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026 why?\u201d He asked Li Qingshan blankly.</p><br/><p>Looking at the black chess piece he moved to one corner of the chessboard, Li Qingshan fell into silence for a long while. When the rustle in the courtyard gradually disappeared in the autumn wind, he said in a low voice, \u201cBecause the Queen is the Saintess of Diabolism.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Queen of the Tang Empire was the Saintess of Diabolism? He Mingchi was so shocked by the news that he sank to the futon, looking at Li Qingshan in disbelief.</p><br/><p>With a sad laugh, Li Qingshan said, \u201cI promised His Majesty years ago that I would keep the secret till death. But this is unfair to our people who know nothing about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at his most loyal disciple and said, \u201cDon\u2019t doubt the truth of it. His Majesty\u2019s old illness which cannot even be cured by the Headmaster was the Queen\u2019s conspiracy then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Mingchi shivered with shock and dared not to reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was of course the thing in the past before they fell in love with each other. So I always felt pity for the high price they had to pay before they could understand each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan said slowly, \u201cI believe that the Queen would not betray His Majesty, nor would the Academy. That is why she can be the Queen. But what if His Majesty dies? Li Yu and her brother are not kids of her own. Her own son is still young. Can we allow the Saintess of Diabolism to rule the Tang Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides life and death, there were also aging and illness. And to imperial court officials, aging or illness was the best reason to retire, even though it was not always the real one.</p><br/><p>In the early spring of the 17th year of Tianqi Era, Zeng Jing, a Grand Secretary in the Imperial Library, suddenly resigned due to illness. It was less than one month since he succeeded Wang Shichen, an old scholar who died of an illness. Thus the Queen was further weakened.</p><br/><p>From then on, Grand Secretary Zeng Jing and his wife kept close at home. It was said that the Grand Secretary lived a leisurely life after retirement, enjoying life with his wife by growing flowers and weeding in the back garden.</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing put down the hoe in his hand. He felt a little bit hot and annoyed. He opened his clothes slightly, but could not help coughing immediately due to the chilly autumn wind.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Zeng hurriedly helped him to sit down in the pavilion and brought him a cup of warm tea. Looking at the gaunt face of his wife, Zeng Jing could not help heaving a sigh. He wanted to mollify her but did not know how.</p><br/><p>Few people could be seen in the Jing Park\u2019s autumn pavilion. The couple sat quietly in the pavilion, drinking tea. Mrs. Zeng suddenly burst into tears and said in a trembling voice, \u201cHow could the child I gave birth to be the Daughter of Yama?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to her words, Zeng Jing fell into silence. The wrinkles on his face seemed to be deeper.</p><br/><p>They were Sangsang\u2019s birth parents. So the Academy did not conceal the truth about the Lanke Temple\u2019s destruction.</p><br/><p>In fact, rumors about Sangsang being the Daughter of Yama had long been popular in the countries outside the Tang empire. Today, people began to discuss it secretly in Chang\u2019an. Zeng Jing\u2019s resignation as a Grand Secretary in the Imperial Library was naturally related to it, although nobody dared to speak up about it.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Zeng wiped away the tears from her eyes and calmed herself. She looked at his husband and asked, \u201cThe man is still in the lobby. Do you really refuse to see him?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Zeng Jing said, \u201cSince he came to Chang\u2019an from the Qinghe County, I guess he won\u2019t leave until we meet. Alright, let\u2019s go to meet him. I will see what bad ideas they have now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged scribe who was drinking tea while waiting in the lobby was Cui Xiu, a well-known figure in the Cui family from Qinghe County. In addition, the man had another complicated relationship with Zeng Jing.</p><br/><p>Looking at the man, Zeng Jing thought of the incident from years ago and could not help frowning slightly. He said, \u201cThe Cui family has always refused to come to Chang\u2019an. For what have you come from afar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Xiu slightly raised his eyebrows and said unpleasantly, \u201cAfter so many years since our last meeting, aren\u2019t you willing to call me brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing said, \u201cI divorced your sister 16 years ago. I don\u2019t know why I should still call you brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Xiu choked down his anger and said indifferently, \u201cSince you asked why I am here, I will tell you frankly. My sister misses you so much after she went back to Qinghe that she has not remarried. My father wants to know what you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing frowned and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Xiu said, \u201cWe, the Cui family, are willing to let bygones be bygones and send my sister back here to resume her relationship with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing said with a slight anger, \u201cWhen I came first in the palace examination, the Cui family instigated me to marry your sister. I admit that I coveted the Cui family\u2019s fame in Qinghe and I really wanted to live together with your sister till we were old and grey. But I did not know how cruel she was. Although I had some fault in taking a concubine, how could I forgive her intention to kill my poor daughter? Our relationship is ridden with hatred, how would it be possible to resume it?\u201d</p><br/><p>As an important figure among famous families in Qinghe County, Cui Xiu was still a bigwig when he came to Chang\u2019an. He had never been so humiliated before. Thus he rebuked angrily, \u201cMy sister wanted to execute your daughter along with that worthless maid because she knew that the child was evil. You did not appreciate her but dared to say those words. Don\u2019t think you can hide the truth forever. Yes, the news that your daughter is actually the the Daughter of Yama is still blocked. But it is said by the West-Hill that the Divine Hall is going to remove her title. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing\u2019s face became as cold as frost. Just as he was about to smack down on the table, his wife rushed out from behind the curtain and cried in tears, \u201cThe Cui family is made up of evil monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Xiu did not want to argue with this woman, so he stood up to make a casual bow and said coldly, \u201cAccording to the situation in the court, the Prince must be the one to succeed to the throne. You are not indispensable. This is the last chance offered by my father. Since you do not value it, don\u2019t blame our cruelty in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Jinghan said in a cold voice, \u201cI was a Grand Secretary in the Imperial Library, second only to the prime minister in the court. Considering the disposition of your father, if I have nothing helpful for him, how could it be possible for him to lower his standards to send back your sister. Don\u2019t the Qinghe County Families think that I can see through this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Xiu sneered, \u201cAll right, I just want to remind you that when the West-Hill Divine Palace announces the news to the world, hundreds of millions Haotian believers will know that your daughter is the Daughter of Yama. We will see whether your house will still be free from disturbances at that time. Let\u2019s see how many people in Chang\u2019an will come to burn your house!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing squinted and asked, \u201cAre you threatening me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Xiu said, \u201cYes. So what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing rebuked angrily, \u201cThe Qinghe County Families are really completely lawless, to think you would dare threaten an imperial official in Chang\u2019an. Do you really think the law of the Tang Empire does not exist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Xiu sneered, \u201cThe law of the Tang Empire? There are some things in the world that are beyond the jurisdiction of the law.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, a voice came from outside the lobby.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things beyond the jurisdiction of the law, can they be handled by the Academy?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

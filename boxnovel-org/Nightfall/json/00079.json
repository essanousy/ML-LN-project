The bluestone tiles on the pavement seemed to exude warmth, hurrying those outside home. However, the candidates who had already found out their results have yet to leave. They gathered in a corner and eyed the young candidate who seemed extremely normal. They would on occasion, also look at the handmaiden before murmuring in low voices.</p><br/><p>Their gazes held many conflicting emotions. Some were puzzled while others were much surprised. There was a candidate who managed to score three A-pluses in the entrance exam, beating third young master Xie from the South Jin Kingdom. Furthermore, no one had heard of this unknown young man. It was perfectly logical for the lad to be the top scorer in archery and equitation. After all, he had been recommended by the Military Ministry and might have polished his skills on the grasslands of the frontier. But he had managed to score an A-plus in Math, beating the predicted top scorers, Xie Chengyun, Zhong Dajun and Wang Ying, who had all only managed an A grade.</p><br/><p>A candidate who could no longer suppress his curiosity wondered aloud. Situ Yilan adjusted her wrinkled robe and asked Ning Que, \"How did you manage to score so well in math?\"</p><br/><p>The question was pregnant with doubt, and her tone disaffected which displeased Ning Que. He looked at the girl and decided that she had no ill intentions, but was merely surprised by the news and was slightly confused. He spread his hands and smiled innocently without saying anything.</p><br/><p>There were many from Chang'an who were displeased by the number of candidates recommended by the Military Ministry. Now that Ning Que had emerged as one of the top scorers and overshadowed the other candidates, and yet did not reply to the question, the young people of Chang'an started to discuss the issue frenziedly</p><br/><p>The candidates from the frontier and military camps were certainly proud that a candidate recommended by the Military Ministry was the top scorer for three subjects. However, they were also older than the average candidate and were more discreet. They were in no hurry to speak up even though they supported Ning Que in their hearts.</p><br/><p>There was, however, a young master from Chang'an who could not bear to watch any longer.</p><br/><p>Chu YouXian walked to Ning Que's side, waving his fan. Slinging a hand around Ning Que's shoulders, he glared at the other students. \"What are you all upset about? Ning Que is my friend. Do you know who he is? He doesn't need to pay when he drinks and visits the ladies at the House of Red-Sleeves! Is there anything in the world that he can't do?\"</p><br/><p>It didn't matter if you came from a family of officials or from a wealthy family. In an open-minded society like the Great Tang, your social status and wealth might change anytime, and it is just crass to compare like that. What is more important is a person's talent, reputation, and contacts.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt that one's family background plays a part in their contacts. But there were places like the House of Red-Sleeves that cared naught about that. A person who could come and go freely in a place like that is a person to be in awe of.</p><br/><p>Chu Youxian did not intend to shame Ning Que by saying that he did not need to pay when drinking and visiting the ladies at the House of Red-Sleeves. He was in fact, boosting his reputation. Not surprisingly, the expressions on the youths of Chang'an changed and they looked at Ning Que with respect.</p><br/><p>Not everyone was calmed by Chu Youxian's proclamation. Sangsang's watched Chu Youxian's shaking hand that was on her young master's shoulders with furrowed brows. She was displeased hearing about her young master's exploits at the brothel. Situ Yilan was looking at Ning Que oddly as well.</p><br/><p>\"I'm still dissatisfied. There was only one question in the math exam. If you're right, you're right. If you're wrong, you're wrong. How many answers can there be to the question of how many jugs of wine did the headmaster drink and how many pounds of plums did he gather? How is it that you got an A-plus while the third young master Xie only got an A?\"</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan held onto Jin Wucai's hand and said that loudly in dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>She wasn't an unreasonable person, but she was aware that her friend Jin Wucai had a crush on the third young master of the South Jin Kingdom. Jin Wucai was upset about the third young master being overshadowed by Ning Que and Situ Yilan could not bear to see her friend's crestfallen expression. That, and there was a more important reason for her kicking up a fuss, but she probably had not realized it.</p><br/><p>She had been tossed off the horse in the driving exam and had almost been trampled by it. As the daughter of General Yunhui, it was an embarrassment that she couldn't even control a horse. Ning Que how had gone on the course after her had managed to control the dark horse easily and even managed to score an A-plus for that exam. This was unfathomable to her. The A-plus on the math exam baffled her even more. It was difficult for her to accept.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a hoarse voice rang out behind the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"He was the first to submit the paper in the math exam. It was such a dumb question, we were practically giving away the marks for free. Those who cannot answer the questions are worse than idiots. It really depends on your reading speed. He answered the question before I could even get my ink ready to mark the papers. That is why he got an A plus. Excuse me, please let me pass.\"</p><br/><p>An old woman wearing a blue cloth gown appeared from a corner, holding a bamboo broom. She swept at the dust under the crowd's feet and walked out slowly, back hunched.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The candidates were speechless as they watched the figure of the old woman disappear into the depths of the Academy. In actuality, there were four-fifths of the candidates who could not answer the question in the math exam. And yet, the old woman said that it was a question that even idiots could answer. Someone said angrily, \" Who does she think she is?\"</p><br/><p>An instructor within the crowd replied, \"She's the only female honorary professor in the academy. Those amongst you who have tested into the academy will be taught by her in math for the next few years.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is she... the second professor?\" Ning Que watched the hunchbacked old woman who was now a distance away and tried to suppress the laughter bubbling within him.</p><br/><p>The third young master Xie, Xie Chengyun, of the South Jin Kingdom was completely calm. While he was full of youthful vigor, he still came in first place in the overall rankings of the entrance exam today. Furthermore, his goal was different from the average candidate, his views were completely different too. He placed more importance on how to enter the second floor of the Academy. The lad before him should be a regular person, and as such, there was no reason to enter into a conflict on a matter like this.</p><br/><p>Conversely, he couldn't help but be impressed by Ning Que's ability to answer the question in such a short time after hearing what the old woman had to say. He asked seriously, \" I first used the method of exhaustion to find out the infinite number before finally understanding the reasoning behind the question. How did...\"</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan came to his side and told him Ning Que's name. Xie Chengyun nodded in thanks and continued his question. \"How did Brother Ning calculate it? Did you use another method to find out the answer so swiftly?\"</p><br/><p>\"If you knew it was infinite, why bother with the method of exhaustion? I'm too lazy to reason backward if I only had to find out the answer. I just wrote a close enough number.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que's answer was sloppy and seemed irresponsible. However, he was not speaking nonsense. The change between infinity and accurate figures were fuzzy and irresponsible by itself.</p><br/><p>Many did not understand and thought that Ning Que got lucky. Some thought that he was hiding something. Only Xie Chengyun understood, and just as he was about to ask further, the voice of an Academy instructor sounded from afar.</p><br/><p>\"Xie Chengyun, Wang Ying, Ning Que, Chen Simiao, He Yingqin... report to the Department of Magic.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que was astonished upon hearing his name. Report to the Department of Magic... What did that mean? Why did he feel like he was about to enter the House of Respectful affairs? Was that a slight breeze between his legs? There was no one he could ask about the matter. As such, he followed Xie Chengyun and the others into the depths of the Academy after leaving instructions with Sangsang. It was only when he realized that there was a female candidate in the group when he felt slightly calmer.</p><br/><p>The other candidates on the pavement did not express any surprise. It was late in the day, and yet, none had left. They all wanted to hear if they would be called into the Department of Magic. Jealousy colored their expressions as they watched the few called walk into the depths of the Academy. Situ Yilan kicked at the cracks of the bluestone pavement in disappointment. She complained in a low voice as she watched Ning Que's back walking further away, \"Why is it that he got everything good?\".</p><br/><p>It didn't take long before the candidates returned. It felt as if they merely went for a walk. Xie Chengyun had the calmest expression while Wang Ying could not hide the joy in her face. Only Ning Que was completely expressionless.</p><br/><p>Other than the six subjects in the Academy, there was also an additional department in Magic meant to cultivate those with potential. These students would be able to learn sword and talisman magic in Department of Magic. The few who were called up previously were thought to have potential by the instructors and were sent for an examination in psyche.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was chosen because of the Hairpin-style Small Regular Script he wrote as well as his lightning fast response in the math exam. The Academy thought him to have potential, but the instructor examining him had made an unusual slip and was disappointed to find that his chi was completely blocked.</p><br/><p>It was yet another cycle of hope and disappointment. If there was no hope, there would not be disappointment. Ning Que was well aware of his body condition and as such was able to face this calmly.</p><br/><p>Xie Chengyun had already started on cultivation when he was in the South Jin Kingdom, as such he had nothing to be excited about. Wang Ying and the others had only just found out that they might be able to enter the legendary enigmatic doors today and could not suppress their excitement.</p><br/><p>\"I can't.\" Ning Que laid out both hands and explained to the masses. \"Erm, you can't say that I completely can't... The instructor said that there was no problem with my will. It's just that my chi is bad and my body is ill suited for cultivation.\"</p><br/><p>There were seven called in by the Academy and he was the only one who had not passed the examination. The gazes of the other candidates changed. Some who had looked at him with animosity previously now looked upon him with compassion. Of course, there are others who looked at him ridicule.</p><br/><p>The Tangs respect the strong, but do not look down upon the weak. A thousand years of merriness has cultivated a tolerant and graceful society. Situ Yilan who had previously found Ning Que unpleasant sighed and comforted him, \" Do not be too disappointed. There are not many who can enter cultivation. Look at us, we all can't do it either.\"</p><br/><p>\"There is much sense in your words. Not being able to enter cultivation doesn't make me a useless stack of firewood.\" Ning Que accepted and drank from a bottle given to him by Sangsang. He looked at her and smiled, \"I'm a professional firewood cutter.\"</p><br/><p>With that, the young master and his maidservant left the Academy in the twilight.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He could not help feeling stunned and realized that it was indeed the moment of life and death. After a brief silence, he looked toward Mo Shanshan who also looked right at him. So the two people made eye contact beside the lake and in the wind and knew of each other's true feelings.</p><br/><p>If the Tao Addict had not entered the Knowing Destiny State, the Calligraphy Addict and Ning Que would have acted more calmly and never been threatened by her. However, what was strange was that though it was unusually dangerous, they looked a little anxious but not frightened at all.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu did not care about their eye contact, for she had great confidence and arrogance to defeat and kill them in the deep valley of the boundless mountains.</p><br/><p>The lake, which had become a bit calmer, shook again as her psyche moved. The clear water was sucked up by an invisible wind and slowly turned around her graceful body. Later the end of the water detached from the lake surface and formed a transparent water bundle. Soon, dense twists and turns gradually appeared on the surface of the transparent water bundle, which turned into numerous light slices and looked like silver scales when the faint light of the sky projected onto them. And the water bundle around her waist turned like a fish.</p><br/><p>As she gently flicked her slender fingers, that thin fish-like water bundle around her waist ejected like an arrow and broke through the slightly cold air above the lake, rushing toward the two people on the northern shore of the Daming Lake along with the terrifying aura of heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan furrowed her brows and stared at the water fish that was flying towards her at a high speed. She put her left hand behind and stretched her right hand out of her cotton sleeves. And then she used her index finger to quickly draw several lines in the air. She ignored the quick consumption of her psyche power and once again decisively applied a Half Divine Talisman, filling the air above the lake full of the talisman aura.</p><br/><p>As the water fish made by the condensation of Tao Addict's aura reached the shore and was about to make contact with the transparent air mass formed by Half Divine Talisman, suddenly a very bright light shot from deep inside the transparent water bundle. Just like the pure and holy Haotian Divine Light, the light suddenly shone brightly after the reflection of the innumerable scales on the surface of the water fish. It instantly sparkled throughout the verdant valley and the Daming Lake, as if the sun in the sky came here!</p><br/><p>The blazing light suddenly broke out and was ruthlessly thrust into the clear black pupils of Mo Shanshan. The young girl gently groaned and her face instantly became pale. Because she felt a shock in her sense of perception, her control of the Divine Talisman suddenly became weak.</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not anticipate that the tiny fish-like water bundle could have produced such a strange Taoists Law effect. A flash of light came to his eyes, making him feel a severe pain. He could not help groaning and almost fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Accompanied by a series of fizzing sounds, that semi-transparent fish-like water bundle shone brightly and continued to move forward mightily when the Divine Talisman was still weak. It was almost about to tear apart that transparent air mass!</p><br/><p>It was a very simple but extremely effective means to condense the psyche power into the water bundle and weaken the enemy with a stronger light. Tao Addict, Ye Hongyu, had reached a perfect level on the mastery of the Taoists Law and the meticulous calculation of a battle.</p><br/><p>The Haotian Divine Light became more dazzling as it was refracted by the transparent scales. It made Ning Que and Mo Shanshan beside the lake feel a great pain in their eyes and no longer see anything at all. They were almost about to be hit by the water bundle that contained a terrifying power.</p><br/><p>However, at this time, a strong talisman suddenly appeared beside the Daming Lake. It looked so calm, pure and peaceful, but was particularly powerful because of this quality.</p><br/><p>The transparent water bundle that had come to the lake immediately became still. No matter how the powerful bundle struggled, how the complex scales on its surface reproduced, how intensely the blazing light reflected from its depth, it no longer moved forward further. It seemed that a giant hand between the heaven and earth stretched out and caught the water fish indifferently.</p><br/><p>The wind on the northern shore of the Daming Lake suddenly stopped and the breeze suddenly disappeared. Suppressed by that powerful talisman, the air ceased to flow. The debris that had fallen down in the air also became motionless in the air.</p><br/><p>This kind of motionlessness was not an absolute one, but a kind of stillness that everything was forced to stop and could not struggle.</p><br/><p>Half the lake was trapped in this motionlessness. The restless lake water struggled to flow out but failed. The thin ice on the lake struggled and gradually broke into pieces. The ice pieces did not spread out in all directions, but compressed inwards and continuously became smaller as it was squeezed.</p><br/><p>A green leaf floated from the bank to the lake and was immediately torn to pieces by the talisman force. However, the pieces were tightly tied into a bundle and did not spread out. They just turned into a group of green furs and looked very amazing.</p><br/><p>There seemed to be a great number of ropes appearing beside the lake. It bound all things and limited their movements. Because this talisman was called the Restriction Fu.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The embroidered purse Ning Que clenched in his left hand had broken. It was dark inside the slightly scorched purse and nothing was in it. The Divine Talisman had started with his mental state and began to bind everything it could encounter on the lake.</p><br/><p>Standing on the thin ice of the lake, Tao Addict's fluffy red Taoist dress was pressed against her body by the force of the Restriction Fu. Her graceful undulated body was wrapped by the thin, soft material and looked extraordinarily beautiful and tempting.</p><br/><p>Her red lace belt that had floated in the wind fell down and was forced to bind her thighs. The bright red lace was entangled with her bare legs, revealing a sense of evil beauty.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the water bundle that was trapped by Restriction Fu was still shining brightly. So Ning Que was unable to open his eyes for a moment. Otherwise, if he saw the Tao Addict bound by the lace, he would certainly feel very comfortable both for his eyes and his minds.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu knew what she looked like at this time. She certainly did not think how beautiful or tempting she was when the clothing stuck to her body and the curves of her body were presented. She only felt very shameful and angry.</p><br/><p>In addition to anger and shame, she was more alert in her mind at this time. Because she was faced with a strong and complete Divine Talisman. Although it was far less powerful than the Divine Talisman Master's, she could not ignore it. This terrifying Restriction Fu could not constrain her Psyche Power, but had bound her body.</p><br/><p>At this crucial moment, Mo Shanshan took the first shot and opened the fingers of her right hand like an orchid, instantly dispelling the Half Divine Talisman that had fought against Tao Addict's water fish. And then she suddenly thrust her left index finger like a sword.</p><br/><p>There was a strong dryness appearing on the lake. There was no flame in the air, but it was hotter than a flame. The half-acre lake water near the north bank suddenly boiled up and a mass of water mist showed up.</p><br/><p>After the water fish shone, Ning Que kept his eyes tightly closed, but used the Psyche Power in his sense of perception to keenly perceive the surroundings. He could clearly perceive the fluctuation of the aura of heaven and earth, except locating Tao Addict who was integrated with heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>When that dryness had just appeared, he knew Mo Shanshan was ready to use the Fentian Fu.</p><br/><p>As soon as the water mist appeared above the lake and slightly covered the shining light, he opened his eyes and took the bow with the fastest speed, and then shot an arrow at the Tao Addict hidden in the mist above the water!</p><br/><p>There was no sound, only a very thin black hole formed by the mist on the lake and the high-speed swirling fog beside the hole. The hollow Talisman Arrow made by a mysterious iron just came to the front of Tao Addict!</p><br/><p>The Divine Talisman bound Tao Addict's graceful body, so she should be able to avoid the Talisman Arrow. However, to his shock, the fish-like water bundle that had also been bound by the Divine Talisman seemed to perceive his thought before his shooting and forcibly broke its water body, and then instantly returned to her front!</p><br/><p>There seemed to be a moaning cry appearing in the misty fog on the surface of the lake.</p><br/><p>The water fish was directly torn to pieces by the powerful Primordial Thirteen Arrow. Later it turned into water droplets and fell into the lake, as if it were a heavy rain.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ning Que finally knew that Tao Addict's Natal Item was actually a fish.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Tao Addict's left shoulder was severely wounded again. The fresh blood was spewing out of her shoulder, but did not flow into the lake due to the majestic Restriction Fu. It turned into numerous round droplets of blood against her bare white shoulder blade.</p><br/><p>If the water fish had not blocked the Talisman Arrow at the most critical moment, she might have been shot and killed by that arrow. However, even though she was alive, she was seriously injured and broke her left arm. More crucially, her Natal Item had been devastated and might not be repaired in the future.</p><br/><p>Her beautiful face was unusually pale. She stared at the lakeside over the water mist coldly and indifferently. She said with a hint of madness, \"Uncle Yan Se's Divine Talisman is really powerful, but unfortunately you're not him.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que ignored her words and put the fourth Primordial Thirteen Arrow on the tight bowstring. His fingers controlling the string shivered slightly and blood dripped from his lip. After the continuous Talisman Arrow shots, his sense of perception got a huge shock and his body was severely harmed. However, he only had one idea at this time. He wanted to shoot her dead at all costs when she was bound by the Restriction Fu. For this purpose, he was even willing to use up all the 13 Talisman Arrows.</p><br/><p>However, Tao Addict absolutely would not give him any chance to launch an arrow.</p><br/><p>A shrill, irritating, grim cry was heard above the Daming Lake.</p><br/><p>Tao Addict could not escape from the Restriction Fu for the time being, but she did not need to do so. Because she was really furious at the moment and wanted to kill the other at any cost just like Ning Que. She was even willing to sacrifice her Natal Item that had been broken into two parts for being seriously damaged!</p><br/><p>The water fish that had struggled out of the Restriction Fu to rescue her was torn apart into two parts. One part was shot by the Primordial Thirteen Arrow and turned into a rainstorm. And the other was lying still over the lake surface.</p><br/><p>With that grim cry emitting from Ye Hongyu's red lips, the water fish suddenly calmed down, as if it moaned before its death. And then it suddenly exploded!</p><br/><p>After the explosion, the transparent water fish turned into a heavy rain. The dense scales on its surface were stripped from its body by some magical power and shot into the shore of the lake!</p><br/><p>A transparent fish scale turned into a small and sharp Taoist Sword in the air.</p><br/><p>Thousands of transparent fish scales turned into numerous small and sharp Taoist Swords in the air.</p><br/><p>As the water fish was transformed into a rain on the lake surface, thousands of Taoist Swords shot towards the two people on the shore of the lake like a torrential rain. They were as irresistible as a dark cloud over a city and seemed to be able to destroy everything in the world!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, the hope and curiosity could never be erased completely once they have appeared.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI came from the ground, and these two also came from the ground. If the ground is the divine kingdom of Buddha, then you can regard us as the messengers of Buddha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo looked at the herdsmen calmly and began to tell the stories in the Buddhist scriptures, which contained the perfect world without snowstorms and cruel nobles, heavenly maids scattering blossoms, beautiful colored glazes, spring-like weather all year round and the most beautiful things human beings could think of.</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at Jun Mo and suddenly said, \u201cEveryone from the Academy is crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que never thought that a gentleman like his Second Brother would deceive people. He sighed. \u201cOnly a gentleman with true compassion could ever make such sacrifices.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang responded, \u201cSpeaking of deceiving people, you are the real master. Jun Mo should learn from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He requested helplessly. \u201cWhen will you stop saying bad things about me?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Sangsang answered quickly and simply, \u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo\u2019s voice echoed across the lakeside, like the warmest spring breeze. The herdsmen were so intoxicated that they had long forgotten the previous fears and uneasiness.</p><br/><p>At the end of the preaching, the herdsmen bowed to Jun Mo and then dispersed. Jun Mo walked to Ning Que and reached out to pat his shoulder. Then he looked at Sangsang and asked, \u201cAre you looking for your way back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not everyone could be so natural while facing Haotian, not the Abbey Dean, not Chief Monk of Scripture, not the Drunkard and the Butcher, and not even Eldest Brother.</p><br/><p>But Jun Mo could, for he had never been afraid of death. He only respected the Headmaster of Academy, Youngest Uncle, and Eldest Brother in his whole life. So, he feared nothing and only regarded Haotian as normal person.</p><br/><p>Besides, on the Unknown Mountain in the north of Chang\u2019an many years ago, Jun Mo had decided that he would treat Sangsang as a little girl worthy of pity when he saw her kneeling down on the cliff and holding the ashes. He still felt the same way about her at this point.</p><br/><p>After Sangsang left the Divine Halls of West Hill and especially after entering the Tang, Sangsang had the similar feeling. But this was the first time a person except Ning Que ever treated her in an ordinary manner.</p><br/><p>She frowned slightly, wondering how should she react: be angry or just let him?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Jun Mo simply ignored what she was thinking and continued, \u201cWhat is wrong with staying in the human world? The Headmaster said that you will be very pitiful. It seems that he was right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang was a little angry at this point.</p><br/><p>She once felt Ning Que\u2019s pity for her in the Divine Hallsl and also felt Mo Shanshan\u2019s pity for her by the Ink Fountain of the Great River Kingdom. She was furious to learn from Jun Mo that the Headmaster also felt sorry for her at this moment.</p><br/><p>As Haotian, I don\u2019t need your pity. All human beings, including the Headmaster of Academy, are all my defeated opponents. You humans don\u2019t have the qualification to feel sorry for me.</p><br/><p>She reached out to Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo slightly raised his eyebrows, and his left hand held the iron sword tightly.</p><br/><p>The iron sword could smash the Buddha stone statue in Lanke Temple, sweep away the millions of enemy troops in front of the Verdant Canyon, make Ye Su stunned and scare Liu Bai off, but it couldn\u2019t stop her hand.</p><br/><p>Her hand fell on Jun Mo\u2019s face, but she didn\u2019t harm him.</p><br/><p>She looked at Jun Mo quietly, and the atmosphere by the lake became a bit weird.</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t understand why she agreed to accompany him to search for his Second Brother before. Seeing this, he realized that Sangsang was up to something.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Sangsang moved her hand along Jun Mo\u2019s face, sliding over his eyebrows, his nose and his lips.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was stunned. What are you doing? He is your brother-in-law! As her husband, Ning Que was jealous and angry that she touched Jun Mo\u2019s face like this.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo\u2019s Kasaya rose with the wind and so did his anger.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere suddenly became extremely tense and the situation was on the verge.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ning Que suddenly fell forward onto Jun Mo and clung to his thigh, crying out, \u201cSecond Brother, keep calm. You can\u2019t defeat her!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tragic and serious drama about the fight between Haotian and a human being was about to be staged, but all of a sudden, Ning Que turned it to a farce by playing the intruder. The eyebrows of Jun Mo trembled slightly, and he was anxious to give Ning Que a kick.</p><br/><p>Sangsang finally pulled her hand back from Jun Mo\u2019s face and then turned around, heading to a small tent by the lake. He is not Buddha. Where has Buddha hidden? Why can\u2019t I find him?</p><br/><p>She knew that the tent was the residence of Jun Mo. Approaching the tent, she picked up the curtain unreservedly and prepared to walk in. Then she remembered something before stepping in the tent.</p><br/><p>She looked back at Jun Mo and said, \u201cI grant you eternity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without thinking about it, Jun Mo responded, \u201cYou can grant me eternity when you are actually immortal.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Sangsang came to the human world, she had already granted eternity to quite a few people who all had different reactions. The Drunkard and the Butcher were transported with joy, Tang Xiaotang thought her offering was unexpected and suggested to buy vegetables first, Mrs. Zeng Jing was absorbed in crying and didn\u2019t understand what she meant, and Ning Que just refused her decidedly.</p><br/><p>In most cases, she didn\u2019t hear what she wanted. And Jun Mo\u2019s answer today surprised and puzzled her.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you,\u201d she thought for a while outside the tent and said to Jun Mo. Then she stepped into the tent.</p><br/><p>Looking at the tent, Ning Que said helplessly, \u201cYou sell the eternity with a big discount like it is cabbage. But it seems that nobody wants it even though you set the price low.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo asked, \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cYou used to treat her well, so she wants to pay you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo was so wise that he understood her intention immediately. He commented, \u201cIt is a stupid way to cut off her ties with the human world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que sighed and said, \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo asked, \u201cIt seems that she has not found the way to return to the Divine Kingdom. What about you? Have you found a way to keep her in the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Remembering what he was thinking in front of Chang\u2019an, Ning Que answered, \u201cNot yet. I intended to come to Xuankong Temple to get some inspiration, but now it appears to be in vain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Is there not a way in this mortal world to embrace both my faith and my beloved? If there is any, it must be far more profound than the Buddha Dharma.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo said, \u201cI observed the night moon these days and found that the Headmaster is struggling. If she ever goes back, the human world would be destroyed. So you have to be careful.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Ning Que went silent for a while and said, \u201cIf the day ever comes, I have no other choice but to make the final decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo said, \u201cThat would be a breach of human relationship. You shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cYou are a man with noble character, but I am not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the iron sword in his hand, Jun Mo thought about it and said, \u201cI still think it is wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t want to discuss this issue and changed the subject. \u201cYou have been in Xuankong Temple for some time. Seen anything new?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo raised his iron sword and pointed to the majestic mountain in the distance. \u201cThis filthy place has nothing but filthy people and filthy things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que realized that he had asked a stupid question, for his Second Brother wouldn\u2019t have the mood to explore a place where the people who lived there suffered greatly. So he said, \u201cYou must be very happy to preach and eliminate the bad people in the field.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo shook his head and said, \u201cI have been telling the stories in the Buddhist scriptures to the herdsmen and serfs these days. Today is the first time I have killed someone here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was surprised. You hate Buddhism and monks the most. You didn\u2019t even read much Buddhist scriptures before, so how could you preach to these devoted Buddhist followers?</p><br/><p>Jun Mo said, \u201cI have read some Buddhist scriptures in the Back Hill and read some more on the journey here. These herdsmen don\u2019t even know how to read. It is most effective to tell the simple stories.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Ning Que praised him. \u201cThe Buddhist scriptures must have dawned on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo said indifferently, \u201cIn my opinion, the Buddhist scriptures are deceptive. How could I let it dawn on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people here had lived underground for generations. They used their flesh and blood to worship Xuankong Temple, but they have never heard of anything about Buddha Dharma. So they were thrilled to listen to my preaching and treated me as a Guru.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the field that gradually became cold and dark, Jun Mo\u2019s voice also gradually became colder. \u201cBuddha said he would love all human beings equally but treated people here as pigs and dogs. Buddhism said that inexhaustible meanings were contained in the Buddhist scriptures but even didn\u2019t allow its followers to read them. What is the difference between these Buddhist scriptures and wastepapers? What is the difference between the monks and liars?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your next move?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo answered, \u201cI originally came here to cultivate Buddha Dharma, but I would have never thought that Buddha was so abominable. How could I meditate after seeing such a miserable underground world? These bold donkeys deserve to die\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que reminded him. \u201cSeventh Sister said we can\u2019t curse like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo touched his newly regrown hair gently and said, \u201cI can call them bold donkeys since my hair grew back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que agreed, \u201cYou do have a point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Ge looked up at the crescent moon and said, \u201cThe Headmaster is fighting against Haotian. As his disciple, I should have helped him, but I don\u2019t have the power to go up to Heaven or to defeat her. All I can do is to serve the human world as the Academy should do. I shall destroy Xuankong Temple first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que praised him again. \u201cYou are truly compassionate.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Jun Mo turned around and said to him, \u201cI started killing today, and I must keep killing henceforth. I can\u2019t help you with your troubles for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew that Second Brother injured the nobleman and allowed him to run away deliberately or else the nobleman would have been dead. Jun Mo\u2019s purpose was to draw more people back and kill them all.</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling the nobles will inevitably attract soldier monks, and killing the soldier monks will inevitably attract the Gurus and Living Buddhas. Eventually the Xuankong Temple will come after you. I am afraid you can\u2019t kill them all on your own.\u201d Ning Que was a little worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told the herdsmen that if they have the courage, they can climb to the top no matter how high the cliff is. The same is true for killing. I can kill them all as long as I keep trying.\u201d Jun Mo looked at the giant peak in the night and said, \u201cLook at the dark mountain over there. After I killed these dogs down here, I will climb up to the mountain peak, kill all the bold donkeys in the temple and set the mountain on fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que praised Jun Mo again. \u201cCultivating Buddha Dharma means eliminating Buddhism.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo said, \u201cNo. Eliminating Buddhism is my way of cultivating Buddha Dharma\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cOr maybe it is what the compassion of Buddhism truly means.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo said, \u201cYou are right. I will stick to my point even though Buddha has reborn and stands in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que went silent for a while and said, \u201cMaybe Buddha\u2026is still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be naughty.\u201d Jun Mo replied, \u201cBut I will kill Buddha if he were still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Buddha Dharma that Jun Mo cultivated was meant to eliminate Buddhism.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

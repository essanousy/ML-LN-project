He fell from the air and killed several Golden cavalry riders. Then, he stepped on the saddle and stood up.</p><br/><p>His movements could not be clearly seen, but the podao in his hand became an ordinary boxwood bow. He pulled forcefully and the bow bent. An arrow shot toward the high priest on the northernmost carriage.</p><br/><p>There were thousands of cavalry troops in front of him, but no one tried to stop the man. What was even more shocking was that the man\u2019s arrow did not deviate at all even as he stood on the horse and shot the arrow.</p><br/><p>There was a thud as the arrow pierced into a shield!</p><br/><p>The high priest heard the sound from the shield in front of him and he paled slightly. He thought to himself that if not for the protection of the palace soldiers, the arrow would have made a large hole in his chest.</p><br/><p>The arrow was stopped by the shield, but this did not stop the man. He exhaled slowly and then gathered all the strength in his body and sent that to his legs. He stomped down heavily!</p><br/><p>The saddle broke!</p><br/><p>And the reins were torn!</p><br/><p>The great strength in the man\u2019s body spread to the horse. There was a loud moan, and the horse\u2019s hooves shattered as it fell heavily onto the ground of the wilderness, shaking up a cloud of smoke!</p><br/><p>Gathering the countering forces, the man sprung up from the horse\u2019s back and rushed to the horse carriage in the north. He blasted through the air, causing the wind to howl. His speed was only slightly slower than that of the arrow!</p><br/><p>The arrow\u2019s shaft was quivering at a high speed and humming.</p><br/><p>The shield-wielding Golden Palace warriors had not had time to withdraw their arms.</p><br/><p>The high priest behind the shield was still pale, frightened by the power behind the arrow.</p><br/><p>The person who had shot the arrow had already reached them.</p><br/><p>He clenched his right fist tightly and struck heavily at the shield that was at waist level.</p><br/><p>Several extremely deep cracks appeared on the shield.</p><br/><p>The warrior holding the shield had been slow to move. His arms snapped and twisted oddly.</p><br/><p>The shield fell backward, crashing heavily onto the high priest.</p><br/><p>The high priest\u2019s sternum collapsed and his lungs were crushed under the pressure. He had neither the time to curse nor the time to crush the bone breaking chain to save his life before he died.</p><br/><p>The Empress heard the pitiful cries and painful moans from the north and turned to look over.</p><br/><p>She saw the young man standing on the carriage.</p><br/><p>Black hair swept over her gentle cheeks, covering her surprised expression.</p><br/><p>She did not expect to see Ning Que here at all.</p><br/><p>Ning Que saw the Empress turning around.</p><br/><p>For some reason, he suddenly felt lost. Then, he turned to look at the carriage at the very end and at the ordinarily-dressed old man on it.</p><br/><p>He did not know that the old man was the legendary Golden Palace Nation Master at that time. But his intuition told him that the man was the most important figure on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>That was why he had to kill the man first.</p><br/><p>The Nation Master did not know who the person who had suddenly appeared from the north and killed a high priest in an instant was. He looked at the person who was changing the tides of the war and knew that the young Tang citizen was very powerful.</p><br/><p>That was why he decided to kill him first.</p><br/><p>Ning Que charged toward the carriage.</p><br/><p>The Nation Master reached behind him to pull on his red hood.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was still more than a hundred feet away from the carriage.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the Nation Master which were barely hidden by the hood landed on him.</p><br/><p>Their gazes met.</p><br/><p>Large waves appeared in Ning Que\u2019s sense of perception.</p><br/><p>He only knew then, that the old man was a terrifying Psyche Master.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had meditated since he was a child, so his Psyche Power was strong. This was very rare in itself. Since his journey to the Front Gate of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, he had gained Master Lotus\u2019 consciousness in his sense of perception. As such, he did not fear this battle of Psyche Power at all.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had never lost a battle of Psyche Power before.</p><br/><p>Whether it was Dao Shi standing in the steam coming from the Chang\u2019an bun stall or Bao Shu on the mountain path, or Qi Nian from the Lanke Temple. These Buddhist Sect powerhouses who were known for their Psyche Power could not defeat him.</p><br/><p>He did not believe that a Psyche Master from the Tribe of Savages on the Wilderness could defeat him on this point.</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not hesitate to use his Psyche Power, turning it into a hail of rocks and tossing them madly with his sense of perception.</p><br/><p>Two extremely powerful spiritual forces that could not be seen by the naked eye met in the air above the grassland.</p><br/><p>Ning Que hummed lightly and then fell from the air heavily, blood trickling from his mouth and nose.</p><br/><p>The Nation Master shook slightly and then recovered.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked up and stared at the seemingly ordinary old man with an expression of horror in his eyes.</p><br/><p>There was someone in the world who could seriously injure him just through spiritual strength!</p><br/><p>The other party could even suppress the fragments of consciousness that were Lotus\u2019 in his sense of perception!</p><br/><p>Ning Que had lost in the spiritual battle and was gravely injured. However, his Psyche Power was still very powerful. Adding on the help given by Lotus\u2019 consciousness in his sense of perception, the Golden Nation Master was also dealt with a heavy blow.</p><br/><p>The Empress was most aware of this feeling. The spiritual power that had reverberated in her sense of perception suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>She no longer felt weak and her heavy footsteps became light again. She raised her eyebrows slightly, calling up the power in her body. Then, she swept forward, pulling out her belt and whipped it in front of her.</p><br/><p>Power had been infused into the soft belt and it immediately became stiff. It flew into the air and lengthened until it pierced into a high priest in another carriage!</p><br/><p>The palace warriors on the carriage yelled out loud, blocking the belt with a large shield.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the belt was about to hit the shield, the Empress twitched her fingers and the belt softened once more. It bent like a willow stick, bypassed the edge of the shield, and tapped the throat of the high priest lightly.</p><br/><p>The high priest wrapped his hand around his bleeding throat and fell back.</p><br/><p>Three high priests had already died. Things gradually returned to normal on the grassland before Helan City. The cavalry of the Golden Palace was in a mess as they watched the Tang cavalry who had mobilized through the mud.</p><br/><p>There was a low growl followed by a sharp whistle. The Golden cavalry quickly regrouped and stopped fighting against Ning Que and the Empress. They covered the last carriage and entered deep into the Wilderness.</p><br/><p>The Golden Palace Nation Master looked at Ning Que and the Empress and said a few words before leaving.</p><br/><p>Ning Que and the Queen were both very mindful of the old man\u2019s terrifying state, so they did not give chase.</p><br/><p>The Tang Empire cavalry roared past the two, chasing after the retreating Golden Palace cavalry. It was not a good time for them to give chase, but they had to ensure that they would gain a safe area outside of Helan City once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say before he left?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Queen asked. She had seen Ning Que\u2019s information for many times and knew that he was proficient in many languages of the Wilderness.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Ning Que said, \u201cThe old man said that the grassland was a place where everything lived and died. The Palace priests are not afraid of anything but those who cultivated in the Devil. He had gone into seclusion for many years and heard that the Devil\u2019s Doctrine had died off. He had not expected to see two Devil\u2019s Doctrine powerhouses in Helan City today.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were naturally the two Devil\u2019s Doctrine powerhouses that the old man was referring to.</p><br/><p>The Queen and Ning Que looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Could they both be pursuing the same goal?</p>\n</div>"}

Since groups of flies have been dancing and flying, it does not matter if one more fly exists.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su said, \u201cI wanted to fight with you back at Chang\u2019an City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Brother answered, \u201cIf it had not been because of the prohibition from my Senior Brother, I would have searched for you and gotten out of the mountain with a sword in my hand, at the time when you were watching over the small Taoist temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su said, \u201cTo kill people, you have to use a sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>With iron sword raised up in his hands, Second Brother said then, \u201cI won\u2019t say such crappy things like the sword having already been in my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su asked smilingly, \u201cThen what are you going to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Brother replied, \u201cWhat I want to say is that you are showing up at a pretty bad time which is bad for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Taking his smile back, Ye Su asked calmly.</p><br/><p>Second Brother said, \u201cI have been killing hundreds of people for these two days. My sword momentum is going strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Bai has been waiting for the time when you kill people to a frantic state. But I do not want to wait any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su said, \u201cBecause by then, it would perhaps be the worst time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then with his brows suddenly creased over, he said, \u201cJun Mo, you are now in a somewhat bad state.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Brother replied with a peaceful and conscientious way.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is natural of my spirits to be in a somewhat absent state after a sleepless night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su asked, \u201cDo you need to sleep for a while first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Brother replied, \u201cNo, it is unnecessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>With his eyebrows tilted up slightly, he asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Brother said, \u201cBecause you are still not Liu Bai after all.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>\u201cYou are not Liu Bai. You may become Liu Bai, but at this moment you are still not Liu Bai.\u201d</em></p><br/><p><em>\u201cThen, even after a sleepless night, I am still confident in beating you down.\u201d</em></p><br/><p>That was what Second Brother was trying to say.</p><br/><p>The ordinary soldiers and generals in the West-Hill Divine Palace Coalition Army had no idea as to who that person was.</p><br/><p>While for some priests who held extremely profound qualifications in the Divine Hall, they had figured out the identity of that person. The joyous expression on their faces was too obvious to be concealed.</p><br/><p>However, Ye Hongyu slightly frowned.</p><br/><p>She once regarded the person as her idol and the object of her cultivation.</p><br/><p>However, currently, in her eyes, that person was also a fool.</p><br/><p>The same as the Abbey Dean and Liu Bai.</p><br/><p>Due to the fact that they had been cultivating for a very long time and they were so proud, transcendent and pure, they were consequently cleansing their hearts and limiting their desires.</p><br/><p>They were all sublime beings.</p><br/><p>Even Sages.</p><br/><p>But they were not the people who would claim the final victory.</p><br/><p>In the battlefield where life and death were settled in just an instant, there was no room for pride and a good presence was an unnecessary thing.</p><br/><p>At this very moment, she thought of Ning Que once again.</p><br/><p>If they both were still alive after many years, no one would know who would be victorious, no one knew.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had no idea as to how highly this contemporary Great Divine Priest of Judgment regarded him and expected of him. He was currently focusing all of his attention and energy on the floor in front of him.</p><br/><p>There were numerous stereoscopic shapes made up of haze and line lying across the wide granite floor. While in the city wall whose surrounding was of thick light, there lied Wanyan Tower whose height less than knee-high and square cities which looked like scales.</p><br/><p>This microminiature Chang\u2019an City was the God-stunning Array.</p><br/><p>Crossing his legs and sitting outside this Chang\u2019an City, Ning Que made his inspection with a silent yet attentive manner.</p><br/><p>He had already been looking at the array for the whole day and the whole night.</p><br/><p>He had already noticed where the problems lied in long since.</p><br/><p>Chang\u2019an City was blocked.</p><br/><p>It was neither Vermilion Bird Avenue that had been jammed by the horse carriages nor the streets and valleys of Eastern City that had been jammed by vendors. Not to mention that it was not the groundwater artery that had been jammed by sludge. It was not a physical blockage.</p><br/><p>The obstruction \u201cjammed\u201d referred to the functioning and operation of aura in heaven and earth inside this grand city had become somewhat not smooth.</p><br/><p>With his naked eyes, even Ning Que was able to see that in over ten places of Chang\u2019an right in front of him, the haze flow and functioning were obviously affected by some disturbance, which had made them converge into one turmoil.</p><br/><p>Chang\u2019an City itself was actually a big array.</p><br/><p>A big tactical array that could stun the gods.</p><br/><p>The power of this big tactical array came right from the Qi of Heaven and Earth flowing in Chang\u2019an City.</p><br/><p>Back to thousands of years ago when Chang\u2019an City was initially built, with his own unprecedented wisdom, the Headmaster had taken advantage of the topography inside the city to build up the palaces and the architecture. While directing the aura of Heaven and Earth into this city, he had arranged this big tactical array which could be healed on its own and which was of limitless growing cycle.</p><br/><p>While over the years to come, the Qi of Heaven and Earth which was originally supposed to flow at their own free will blew into Chang\u2019an City like the fresh breeze. It was as free as before, however, it started to have its own rules.</p><br/><p>Those rules were where the original source of God-stunning Array lied.</p><br/><p>Time was a weapon that was both the cruelest and the most powerful. Though God-stunning Array was able to heal on its own, for it to stay in the best state as always, the maintenance from people inside the city was still needed.</p><br/><p>The imperial court of the Tang Empire had a specialized refund of the mantainance. While the most important work of Clean Water Department of the Ministry of Workers was to be in charge of dredging all the natural water channels and lakes inside Chang\u2019an City.</p><br/><p>The cleaning of Yanming Lake was a civil engineering project superficially. In fact, it was a routine maintenance for God-stunning Array.</p><br/><p>However, it was impossible for the big God-Stunning Array to lose its power because of some architectural modification or some typographical change. As a matter of fact, even if the imperial court had never held maintenance towards this array, in no way should this situation happen either.</p><br/><p>Getting himself up and walking into the Chang\u2019an City frozen by haze, Ning Que climbed over the Yanming Mountain and came to the front of the imperial city whose height was no more than that of knees. He bent himself to grab the array eye pestle which had already been half plugged in the ground and pulled it out.</p><br/><p>With this motion going on, Chang\u2019an City lying on the granite floor gradually transformed itself into a dense haze and then it was frozen downwards into the watery liquid light, dripping itself down slowly along those carving scars on the floor.</p><br/><p>The array eye pestle in his hands also became dark bit by bit, with its own complicated pattern blending together with its pestle body.</p><br/><p>After leaving the Imperial Palace, Ning Que came over to the top of the city wall.</p><br/><p>Looking down upon the Chang\u2019an City located at the foot of the city wall, he had been silent for a pretty long time.</p><br/><p>With the turmoil inside Chang\u2019an City being subsided, life went gradually back to normal.</p><br/><p>There were more and more horse carriages running across the street. The passers-by wore calm looks on their faces, most of them being in a hurry.</p><br/><p>At this time, with Tang Empire having all been mobilized, the Tangs were all dedicated to their own things in a conscientious way.</p><br/><p>It was pretty clear to them that only via doing so could they best show out their support towards the soldiers and generals who fought dauntlessly in the front line.</p><br/><p>Without sleeping for a really long time, Ning Que was so wearisome. His eyes felt somewhat itched.</p><br/><p>With his eyes closed, he began to sense this city.</p><br/><p>He appeared to have seen through the inner sides of the Tangs who were peaceful and strong.</p><br/><p>While at the same time, he saw the aura of heaven and earth from over ten places had been blocked.</p><br/><p>At the time when all the Tangs recovered to claim their confidence and courage.</p><br/><p>He saw that Chang\u2019an City was at risk.</p><br/><p>He was anxious and ill at ease.</p><br/><p>He had been sleepless all through the night.</p>\n</div>"}

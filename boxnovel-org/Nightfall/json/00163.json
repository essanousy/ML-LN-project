He tidied up his appearance before entering through the doors with a serious look on his face. Seeing the precious stationaries that he had not seen for a long time and breathing in the smell of the ink that lingered in his memories, he could not help but shiver as he recalled the incident that happened last year.</p><br/><p>Infront of the book shelves stood a middle-aged man, with his back facing the main door of the imperial study room. He was dressed in thin plain cotton top and a belt sewed with black and golden threads was placed at his waist, making him seem skinny. Though his face could not be seen, Ning Que had easily guessed the identity of the man.</p><br/><p>Without any advice from the eunuch, he was not sure when he should kneel or bow with his hands infront to show respect to the man infront. By right, it should be the former, yet not many Tangs were willing to kneel down to people. For a moment, he felt lost and embarrassed.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man suddenly spoke. His gentle, warm tone and the content of his speech had managed to release Ning Que from his embarrassment in time, \"Don't you think of kneeling down. You ain't offering sacrifice to Heaven.\"</p><br/><p>Just a simple sentence from him, Ning Que started to become fond of this middle-aged man. He would have imagined that an emperor of Tang should appeared to be cold, strict and majestic, yet he was such a warm and friendly person.</p><br/><p>\"Understand that you're my secret guard?\" The middle-aged man took a shabby-looking book from the shelves, as he flipped the pages and asked casually.</p><br/><p>Ning Que bowed deeply and replied, \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Isn't this secret guard a little too secretive? Even I myself don't know about it.\" The middle-aged man laughed as he took out a bookmark from the side of the shelves and placed it inbetween the shabby-looking book to mark the pages. Suddenly, he asked, \"How did you get into this room last year?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ning Que was wondering how he should address himself as. After hesitating between \"humble student\" and \"low-rank officer\", he decided that \"low-rank officer\" should certainly be eliminated. After listening to the man's question, he subconsciously replied, \"Student was ordered to enter palace for some task, and was asked to wait in this room.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man made a soft \"ehh\" sound, as though he was suspicious of something. He remained silent for a while before saying, \"Since you're here for some tasks, then why do you enter my imperial study room? No one saw you entering?\"</p><br/><p>At this point of their conversation, Ning Que was feeling less anxious, but more suspicious. On his way to the palace, he had tried to imagine the scene of him meeting his Majesty, and he thought that upon seeing him, his Majesty would definitely laughed happily and hurriedly stopped himself from kneeling infront of him. His Majesty would then gently stroked his own beard while admiring Ning Que's young and adorable face. His Majesty's face would be looking so pleased as he confessed to Ning Que that he had been searching high and low for him, and would definitely reward him with lands, women and any officier position he wanted in the palace...</p><br/><p>However, the fact was that though Ning Que was not so pretty as Prince Long Qing, but under such exciting scenario, he would also tend to think pretty far-fetched about things.</p><br/><p>Just as he was feeling slightly disappointed and confused, he heard his Majesty's last question, which made him understand something all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Last year, that young eunuch named Lu Ji brought him to the imperial study room. Since his Majesty had searched for him for about half a year, and that \"The Flower Blooms on the Shore Astride\" calligraphy has made such a big wooha, that young eunuch Lu Ji and Commander Xu Congshan had no reason not to confess about this matter. His Majesty failed to find him all these while and this would meant one thing --- Neither Commander Xu Congshan nor the young eunuch Lu Ji had reported to his Majesty about the fact that he had entered imperial study room.</p><br/><p>As for the reason behind their doings, there could be numerous reasons, such as they had forgottened about it, or they had gone crazy, or they worried that this matter would give them troubles instead, etc. At this moment, Ning Que was unclear of the reason, but he was clear that if his reply to his Majesty now did not match up with the answers given by Commander Xu and the young eunuch, it would bring great troubles to the both of them, or perhaps to himself as well.</p><br/><p>Hence, he frowned his brows and thought carefully. He then shook his head and replied honestly, \"I doubt anyone knows about it.\"</p><br/><p>His Majesty heard his answer coming from his back and bursted out laughing loudly. He placed the shabby-looking book back onto the shelves and turned towards the young student, who was standing by the imperial study room main entrance. He said with emotions, \"What a person with good character. No wonder Brother Zhao likes you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared at the middle-aged man who stood infront of the book shelves, only to realize that he was just a simple-looking man with slight grey hair. He was not as majestic as he had imagined, neither did he had the vibe that was scarier than the Vermilion Bird. Moreover, seeing the man's expression and smile on the face, he knew that he had answered correctly, though he was unsure which part he did answer correctly.</p><br/><p>His Majesty gazed at Ning Que. All of a sudden, he gestured for him as he smiled and said, \"Come over.\"</p><br/><p>Seeing the smile on his Majesty's face, Ning Que was slightly worried, but he quickly suppressed his feeling as he walked over nervously.</p><br/><p>The Emperor pointed at the calligraphy on the table as he grinned and asked, \"Is this your work?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que took a glance at the calligraphy. The large characters written on the yellow paper had instantly made him recall how joyful and proud he felt after writting these words on that day. He replied softly, \"This is indeed student's ridiculous work.\"</p><br/><p>\"Not ridiculous at all.\" His Majesty smiled and added, \"I like your writing.\"</p><br/><p>The process of praising one another had finally started, yet Ning Que suddenly realized that he was unsure how he should react. Perhaps his Majesty had expressed it in a tone that was too natural and casual. There was only admiration, without any agitation on the Emperor's part. It was just like commenting that Her Majesty had done a great job in peeling the garlic or had baked delicious cookies. Under such situation, how could one react or even thank the Emperor?</p><br/><p>The Emperor obviously did not expect Ning Que to feel touched by his sentence. He gently stroked his beard and looked the words \"The Flower Blooms on the Shore Astride\". After admiring them for a while, he then said with emotion, \"Your Majesty had searched really hard for you.\"</p><br/><p>Before that, the emperor was using \"I\" to address himself, yet when he suddenly switched to \"Your Majesty\", the atmosphere in the imperial study room changed instantly. Furthermore, this sentence had a strong hidden meaning, much stronger than the one before. It was the switch from pure to strong intense admiration. Ning Que was not used to the former and could not react, but when it was switched to the latter, he had trouble reacting to it as well.</p><br/><p>The Emperor grinned at him and suddenly said, \"The Fish That Jumped Across The Sea, The Flower Blooms on the Shore Astride. You've only added one sentence, which seems pretty lacking. Now that you're here, why don't you complete it with two more sentences? Do you need your Majesty to prepare the ink for you?\"</p><br/><p>Letting Tang Emperor prepare ink and stationaries for you was the best luxury a scholar could have in his whole life. In fact, they did not even dare to think of having such luxury. It was a way better treatment than having all the ladies from House of Red Sleeves to help you prepare ink and serve you.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing it, Ning Que was taken aback and he sincerely rejected the offer, \"How can I accept this? As for 'The Fish That Jumped Across The Sea' sentences were originated from his Majesty. Student was just copying. If I were to continue...and right infront of an expert like you, how will student dare to show one's incompetence?\"</p><br/><p>Since young, he had been drifting and wandering in the wild. Even in Tang Empire, he was struggling to survive. In fact, he did not have much experience hanging out with the nobles. That time he could get along with Tang princess Lee Yu while escorting her back to from the grassland was because Lee Yu acted as a maidservant. Though he already knew Lee Yu's real identity, he was determined to treat her as a maidservant so that he could be himself along the way. However, at this moment, he was facing the man who had the strongest authority in the world. How should he behave infront of him then?</p><br/><p>If today was an inexperienced young man facing the emperor, the imperial study room would be in a great mess. Ning Que was still Ning Que. He was still the kid who could survive under the harshest circumstances. Besides having the chopper tied to his waist and his courage to kill humans, he must also be a sweet talker and had the skill to act innocent whenever necessary, in order to handle such situation.</p><br/><p>In regards to cheering the top and bootlicking the nobles, as long as he was willing to do it, he could do better than anyone. In the past as a young soldier from other lands in the City of Wei , he could pleased every soldier in the city. To be able to let every general in the City of Wei adore him like their own nephew, his ability of bootlicking must be great. If he were to use such ability to bootlick the emperor now, it would be an easy job for him.</p><br/><p>Upon listening to words that depicted how a skillful person had obtained suddenly inspiration and was just showing off in the presence of an expert, the Emperor was stunned and could not help but raise his head to look at Ning Que's face. He then broke into a chuckle as he reprimanded, \"Aren't you over-flattering me? Everyone knows that your Majesty is bad in calligraphy, so how can you refer me as an expert? Moreover it's infront of you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que chuckled. He was well-known for having a thick skinned personality, hence he was not affected by those words at all. Furthermore, he had seen before his Majesty's work, which was indeed...bad, but so what? No matter how fake it is, one still has to flatter the Emperor. Even if his Majesty know himself that his own calligraphy is bad, he will still be happy to hear people flattering him. Moreover, that person who flatters him is me?</p><br/><p>Watching Ning Que's unaffected expression, the Emperor was indeed glad about it. He thought, though the calligrapher I adored is much younger than expected, but he has a good taste. The remark he gave was definitely just to bootlick me, but since he sounded sincere, perhaps my calligraphy skill did improve a little, at least to the extent that it's quite remarkable?</p><br/><p>\"Enough of casual talks. Since your Majesty had found you, it's time for you to perform tonight. Write some words and let your Majesty admire them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty, student had exhausted most of the energy at the Academy last night, and my body felt weak as well. Not that student is unwilling to abide to your request, but it will be quite impossible for student to write any good calligraphy now. Afterall, calligraphy talks about being energized and focus...\"</p><br/><p>The expression on the Emperor's face suddenly turned awful, but on the thought that what he said made sense, and understanding that the Second floor of the Academy examination was very tough yet this lad infront of him was able to defeat Prince Long Qing to enter Second floor of the Academy, this lad was definitely a great man in future. However, he was also worried that this lad would be ambitious and if he only treated him as a calligrapher, it might make the other party feel ashamed too.</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt embarrassed as he confessed, and was secretly observing the Emperor's expression at the same time. All of a sudden, like magic, Ning Que took out some pieces of calligraphy from his sleeves and placed them neatly on the table.</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty, these are some of the recent student's work which student has handpicked. Would appreciate if your Majesty could give some advice.\"</p><br/><p>When the Emperor heard him saying such words, and seeing the pieces of calligraphy on his table, his eyes brightened. He instantly bent over and unrolled the calligraphy, before he started admiring the words as he kept silent for a long time.</p><br/><p>After god-knows-how-long, a gasp of admiration broke the silence in the imperial study room.</p><br/><p>The Emperor shook his head and exclaimed in admiration, \"Great work! Truly great work!\"</p><br/><p>He turned around and looked at Ning Que with spark in his eyes as he said, \"Brother Ning, I heard that you've a shop at the Eastern City of Chang'an. I believe there are more great works being written over these years in the shop. Hurry and bring them all over. Let your Majesty admire all of them.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que was taken aback. Looking at the Emperor's hungry-for-calligraphy expression, he awkwardly replied, \"Your Majesty, student's calligraphy, such as this, and that, are basically sold for money.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Not far away from the huge and majestic city wall, there was a serene Taoist temple hidden within the woods. That was where South School of Haotian Taoism was located.</p><br/><p>Deep inside the South School of Haotian Taoism, the Divine Talisman Master Yan Se, who were previously filled with heroism and busily arguing with Second Brother, had instantly became a child who admitted his mistake. He folded his laps and sat on the dark wooden floor. He stroked his dry and frizzy beard as he innocently stared at the floor infront of him. His eyes were no longer shabby-looking and he dared not look at the other party. Even so, the wrinkles on his face were all cramped together and filled with guilt, as he looked as though he wished to beg for forgiveness.</p><br/><p>Tang's Master of Nation Li Qingshan looked at his Senior Brother, his eyes looked like the ladies in the palace who were filled with hatred. All his respect for his Senior Brother had instantly become disappointment and anger.</p><br/><p>\"Ning Que could not enter South School of Haotian Taoism. This means that even if he's your student, after your death, our South School of Haotian Taoism will never have our own Divine Talisman Master. This also means that after our deaths, there is no one to take care of the South School.\"</p><br/><p>Master Yan Se lifted his head and laughed foolishly towards his junior brother. He then comforted him and said, \"It's not that serious. Afterall, Ning Que is still my student. Once he become a Divine Talisman Master in future, there is no reason for him to see South School fall. Furthermore, though I am almost near the end of my life, but you are still young. By the time you passed away, Ning Que might long be dead. If that's the case, what use will he have?\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan stared at his Senior Brother without any expression. He kept silent for a long while before he sighed, shook his head and said, \"Senior Brother, do you seriously not know the difference between the two? If Ning Que were to enter South School, I can hand over the authority to him and he would be my Tang Master of Nation. By then, it would be tough for South School to fall. However, if he's only your student, he will at most be a visiting professor at South School, and what's the use of having a visiting professor? Liu Bai at South Jin Kingdom is the visiting professor for West-Hill Divine Palace, but when did you ever see Liu Bai putting in effort for the Divine Hall?\"</p><br/><p>Yan Se agreed to the request stated by Second Brother from the Academy, to take in Ning Que as a Talisman Taoism student under his name in exchange for letting Ning Que to enter South School of Haotian Taoism. He was ashamed of his own choice, and was unreluctant to face Li Qingshan upon returning. Now that Li Qingshan had explained the seriousness of his choice, he felt worst and could not even look into the eyes of the other party. Instead, he walked away embarrassingly.</p><br/><p>As he passed by the corridor of trees, the disciples of South School of Haotian Taoism politely bowed at him and made way for him. However, Master Yan Se was in no mood to present his pleasant side today. He hurriedly dashed through the corridor with a black face, headed straight for the side door instead of the main door, and walked into the side alley. He then stretched out his hand to flick the leaves on his shoulder, which made him felt slightly better.</p><br/><p>Though he indeed let down his sect, but he had finally found his successor. Yan Se was feeling guilty, but he could not hide his happiness either. Just now at the South School, infront of Master of Nation Li Qingshan, the feeling of embarrassment and guilt had overtook his happiness, but now that he was in the side alley, he could finally revealed his happiness.</p><br/><p>Just then, a horse carriage stopped at the alley. Looking at the mark on the shaft, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>A man, who looked like a steward, alighted from the horse carriage. He took a glance at Master Yan Se from head to toe and looked confused at the appearance of this taoist. It was after a long while before he recalled what his owner had instructed him, as he humbly smiled and said sincerely, \"Good day, Master Yan Se. I am the steward from Anle Duke's mansion. Under the command of my master, I was tasked to look for you. Heard that you have some writings...\"</p><br/><p>Master Yan Se gazed at the steward's face coldly. Without thinking much of the steward's intention, he answered directly, \"Get lost.\"</p><br/><p>After which, he pushed the steward out of his way and arrogantly marched his way towards the head of the alley.</p><br/><p>The steward's face turned black, but at the thought of Yan Se's Divine Talisman Master identity and the high social ranking this master was in, he dared not grumble. Instead, he followed closely behind Yan Se as he cried, \"Master, please allow me to finish my sentence.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the voice of an old man echoed in the alley and said, \"Think about Master Yan Se's status and your status. No matter what request Anle Duke has for Master Yan Se, he should either formally invite him to his residence or respectfully pay the master a visit. This is the most basic respect a junior should have for the elderly. Yet he sent a steward over instead? What an impetuous act.\"</p><br/><p>The steward dared not offend a Divine Talisman Master, but that did not mean that he dare not ofend the people in Chang'an city. Upon hearing this piece of advice, which in fact was directly tauting him, his temper rose as he stomped out of the alley. Staring at the old man with a head of grey hair standing by the green bamboo carriage, he gestured his hand and cursed, \"What is my status...\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his body froze and his voice trembled. He hurriedly kneeled on one knee and with a bow, he said, \"How would I dare to trouble the Grand Secretary? How careless of me! I will pass on your message to our Hou Master.\"</p><br/><p>The old man with a head of grey hair looked plainly at the steward, who was still kneeling down on the floor. He gestured his hand for him to rise and added, \"Never thought that your reaction is pretty fast. I would say that you must be a responsible and trustworthy steward.\"</p><br/><p>The old man was Wang Shichen, the Grand Secretary of Tang Imperial Library, who had been in the position for the past three dynasties and was in favor of the Emperor. Even the Prince Lee Peiyan would need to bow and show respect to him upon seeing him, so it was needless to say for Anle Duke.</p><br/><p>Though the steward from Hou Residence was not sure why Grand Secretary Wang would appear at the alley of the Northern Gate, but how would he dare to question? He bowed to the two old man and quickly escaped on his own horse carriage.</p><br/><p>Master Yan Se frowned as he stared at Grand Secretary Wang, followed by a bow with his hands placed infront and asked, \"Old scholar, today is a rest day and there's no need to hold court, why are you here? Coming out for a stroll is definitely not an acceptance reason.\"</p><br/><p>\"I had an argument with the Old Chancellor a few days ago, is this reason acceptance then?\" Grand Secretary Wang coughed twice before answering.</p><br/><p>After some thoughts, Yan Se pulled up his sleeve and retorted, \"Didn't both of you argued last year winter? That's not a few days ago.\"</p><br/><p>\"Whatever it is, that 'The Flower Blooms on the Shore Astride' double-hook facsimile is currently in that old fellow's residence. Not only does he forbid me to see, he often use it to piss me off,\" Grand Secretary Wang could not hide his frustration as he stroke his beard and added, \"That double-hook facsimile is focusing too much on the strokes. Though it does have the look, but it doesn't project the same feeling of the original. How can it be better than the facsimile his Majesty has given me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your saying does not make any sense,\" Yan Se was clear of this incident, so he shook his head and explained, \"As everyone knows, if you want to copy the original piece, using double-hook method is the best way to go.\"</p><br/><p>Yan Se was the only official Divine Talisman Master in the Northern Gate of Haotian, whereas Wang Shichen was a respectable man who had gone through three dynasties. Both of them knew each other for a long time and both shared a common identity, which is the world's calligraphy master. Speaking of the best method to create facsimile, both of them would never admit defeat.</p><br/><p>\"Even if the double-hook method is the best,\" Wang Shichen smiled gentle and added arrogantly, \"So what? Wait till I've obtained the Chicken Soup Calligraphy, I will not hang in my study room but in the main hall. Just to piss that old fellow off.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hold on,\" Yan Se asked surprisingly, \"What's that Chicken Soup Calligraphy?\"</p><br/><p>\"That piece of account book you've took from the House of Red Sleeves.\"</p><br/><p>Grand Secretary Wang stared into his eyes and said solemnly, \"Now that the news is spreaded, those calligraphies that were sold at Old Brush Pen Shop in the Eastern City were confiscated. I felt that there's nothing special about those calligraphies, but this Chicken Soup Calligraphy is different. You managed to see the potential of Divine Talisman Master in Ning Que from this Chicken Soup Calligraphy, and this makes it meaningful. If you could let me have the honor to hang that calligraphy at my residence, isn't that even better?\"</p><br/><p>Yan Se sighed with emotions and said, \"Indeed, this rumor spreaded quicker than a book.\"</p><br/><p>The Grand Secretary Wang gazed at him and said, \"Enough chatting. Anle Duke was a fool to send a steward over to ask it from you. But my case is different. I am the Grand Secretary of three dynasties, and what I wanted is your student's writing. I am already giving you face so you better not shame me, or things will be rotten between us.\"</p><br/><p>\"I could almost feel that gangster vibe from your words, and I don't feel that you are saving face at all,\" Yan Se went mad and continued, \"Both of us know each other for more than ten years. I never would have thought that a Grand Secretary of three dynasties would lose his cool over such a trival matter!\"</p><br/><p>Grand Secretary Wang snarled, \"If it's other matter, I won't care. However, this Flower calligraphy is getting too famous in Chang'an and that old fellow had been pressurizing me. If I don't do something to win back my face, how am I, a Grand Secretary of three dynasties, going to keep my foothold?\"</p><br/><p>Yan Se looked at him. He opened his mouth abruptly and said, \"10 thousand.\"</p><br/><p>Grand Secretary Wang's angry face suddenly softened as he chuckled and bargained, \"Four thousand.\"</p><br/><p>Yan Se drew out the thin piece of account book paper from his sleeve and handed over as he said, \"Deal.\"</p><br/><p>Grand Secretary Wang took over the thin piece of paper without looking as he turned around and returned to his green bamboo carriage. He then shouted at his subordinates, \"What are you waiting for? Hurry back to the residence. Also, get me the best Chef Xing from Rong Bao Zhai Restaurant. Let San prepare for a house party tomorrow to celebrate my birthday and invite guests to admire this Chicken Soup Calligraphy!\"</p><br/><p>The green bamboo carriage hurriedly departed as it brushed against the direction of the wind. A conversation between the Grand Secretary and his chamberlain could be heard faintly.</p><br/><p>\"Master, your 80th birthday was last month.\"</p><br/><p>\"Dumbass! Elder brother's servant is having birthday this month!\"</p><br/><p>\"Invite that girl, Jin Wucai, as well. Most most most importantly, don't forget her miserable old grandpa!\"</p><br/><p>\"If he refuses to come, I will personally invite him over!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ning Que was nervously facing the Emperor and searching for the right opportunity to flatter him. Never did he know that the memo he scribbed when he was drunk last year was already sold for two thousand taels of silver, and not to mention, that's a discounted price due to friendship.</p><br/><p>As for the receipent of the memo who had never seen it before, it was Sangsang. At this moment, she was speechless and panicking at the Old Brush Pen Shop along Lin 47th Street.</p><br/><p>Listening to the continuous knocking of the door, peering at those anxious-looking stewards who were waving those cash notes in their hands from the crack between the door and its frame, and looking at the people who were excitingly discussing about them across the street, the little handmaiden had no idea how she should handle such messy situation.</p><br/><p>She then recalled what her young master reminded her before he left. She tidied and packed all the writings she had collected before she revealed the bed frame and took out the box in it, where she placed all the writings together with the precious cash notes. She then grabbed two thick metal chains to lock all windows and doors.</p><br/><p>After she was done with all these, she returned to the front of the shop and secured the wooden board that was used to loosely prevent the door from opening with large metal nails. This made her felt better. She couldn't be bothered with the waves of uproar outside as she swept away the perspiration on her forehead, carried the big black umbrella on her back and took the important items which Ning Que had told her. She then quietly slipped her way out through the small door in the backyard.</p><br/><p>At this time, the day was still early and it was the time for lunch. As Sangsang strolled her way into the House of Red Sleeves, there were no noisy scenes nor loud giggling from the ladies. All she could smell was the endless fragrance from food and wine. Since she haven't eaten for one whole day, she could not help but swallowed her saliva.</p><br/><p>Mistress Jian's maidservant, Xiaocao, was at the top floor looking down and stoning at the railing when she suddenly saw Sangsang walking into the building. She instantly felt ecstatic as she rushed her way down and grabbed Sangsang's hands with both her hands. After a while, she started grumbling,</p><br/><p>\"Why didn't you come and visit us these days? Or did your young master stop you from going out? Mistress Jian told Ning Que not to come over to such area with an intention of letting him focus on his studies, yet he make use of you to show his displeasure! Also, I've heard that you've been invited to the princess' residence as a guest. Is it now that you know these nobles, you've decided to forgo poor friends like us?\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang could not be bothered by her grumbles and instead, she was more focused on being faster than the rest of the people in Chang'an city. She asked directly, \"My young master had written a piece of memo here when he was drunk last year, where was it?\"</p><br/><p>Xiaocao was taken aback by this abrupt question, and she replied, \"I'll help you ask around.\"</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, Xiaocao came running back and said, \"I've asked. Seems like Dewdrop Sister had took it away that time. Why are you looking for it? It had been a long time, so probably it was already thrown away somewhere.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Cao Youning usually spoke with confidence within Chang'an city since his brother-in-law was an assistant minister and when the Minister of works position was left vacant last year, his brother-in-law was appointed as the next Minister of work. Yet no one expected a sudden change at the beginning of this year when a high-ranked officer returned from He Yun Palace and became his brother-in-law's greatest opponent. The Emperor kept silent throughout this whole incident, and none of the prime minister and Grand Secretaries could come out with a better idea to resolve this problem.</p><br/><p>During this critical period, the assistant minister became quieter and stayed low. Cao Youning's words had also become weaker in Chang'an city and at this moment, he was not only weak, but became humble when facing Dewdrop in the House of Red Sleeves.</p><br/><p>\"My good lady, please do me a favor and give me that memo.\"</p><br/><p>Cao Youning watched the full figure lady who was sitting infront of him. If it wasn't for that matter, he would have pounced onto her without thinking much, yet today, his only focus was totally on the memo and he could not care much about other things.</p><br/><p>He sincerely said, \"About the student named Ning Que, he's the author of that Flower calligraphy. Now, the Emperor has already confirmed his identity and is having a chat with him in the imperial study room. If this is a lie, I could have save up some silvers. But you and I are friends, and there's not reason for me to treat you badly. So neither should you ignore my request, Miss Dewdrop!\"</p><br/><p>Dewdrop, who had already cool herself down from the initial shock, rubbed her forehead and replied helplessly, \"But that piece of account book paper...\"</p><br/><p>Cao Youning seriously corrected her and said, \"Not the account book paper. The news from the Northern Gate had been spread to the whole of Chang'an city and now, everyone knows about that writing. That writing is called the Chicken Soup Calligraphy.\"</p><br/><p>Dewdrop unwillingly waved her hand and said, \"Alright, whatever you say. But that...Chicken Soup Calligraphy, is honestly not with me. When I took it that day, someone took it away that night.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who?\" Cao Youning asked anxiously, \"My dear lady, you gotta recall it. You must understand that memo is very unique. It is from that memo that the person, whom the Northern Gate worshipped, determined Ning Que has a potential to be a Divine Talisman Master. That memo is going to become famous in the future!\"</p><br/><p>Dewdrop smirked and said, \"What is there for me to recall about? That Old Taoist was not only dirty-looking and had a weird temper as well, yet he was pretty generous. How can I forget such a person who is our frequent customer?\"</p><br/><p>Upon listening to her description, Cao Youning was stunned but he suddenly smacked his thigh and exclaimed, \"Gosh, my lady! He's not any dirty old taoist. That Taoist must be the Divine Talisman Master, Master Yan Se!\"</p><br/><p>Dewdrop was shocked as Dewdrop was shocked as she covered her mouth with her handkerchief and could not utter a word. She thought, what is exactly happening in this world now? It's only been a day yet many changes have happened. Her cute lad has suddenly become a great calligrapher that the Emperor had searched for half a year, and the dirty old taoist that come over every month, except for last month, is actually a Divine Talisman Master!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she remembered another matter as she quickly stood up and instructed her maidservant to carry an old and worn out table from behind.</p><br/><p>\"Take a look at this table, the scribbings on top is by that dirty old taoist...no, I mean by that Master Yan Se who was only offical Divine Talisman Master who is the senior Brother of the Master of Nation and whom was worshipped by South School of Haotian Taoism. He had used this talent to copy the Chicken Soup Calligraphy on this table!\"</p><br/><p>She used her hand to sweep away the dust on the table. Starting at those scribblings, she felt that she was indeed someone who was good at seeing people for she had the ability to foresee what was coming. As she started to admire her own talent, she could stop talking and kept going on...</p><br/><p>Cao Youning looked closely at the scribbings on the table. Though they were messy, the carvings were deep. His eyes brightened as he said joyfully, \"Say no more, miss Dewdrop. Quote me a price.\"</p><br/><p>Dewdrop covered her smile with her handkerchief as she stated without feeling any sense of embarrassment, \"Three thousand.\"</p><br/><p>Cao Youning stood up and said with determination, \"Deal.\"</p><br/><p>\"Not for sale.\"</p><br/><p>The courtyard door was suddenly pushed opened as Sangsang and Xiaocao marched in quickly.</p><br/><p>Cao Youning was confused and asked, \"Why not for sale?\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked carefully at the scribbings on the table as she stared at Dewdrop and said, \"Sell the printed copy only.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

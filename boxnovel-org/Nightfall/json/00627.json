Bells and drums, as well as screams and curses, sounded everywhere. People were running and throwing garbage in the streets while Ning Que was running with Sangsang on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, fighting against the entire world is like this.\u201d He thought, with the hilt in his hand. Looking at the people getting together, he breathlessly asked, \u201cDo you feel sad?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had tried his best to hide. He was out of breath and his voice was quivering which was not loud nor clear enough.</p><br/><p>Sangsang heard him very clearly. She opened her eyes to look at the terrified people around them, and could not help becoming upset with a hum.</p><br/><p>Ning Que wore a smile on his face and said, \u201cThe good guys will feel sorry because of others\u2019 attitude, while we are the bad guys, so don\u2019t be grieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the vegetables and eggs, even the stones could not stop them, the people in Chaoyang City became angrier so that some of them dared to intercept them.</p><br/><p>A half-naked hunk with black hair on his chest ran out of a tea shop, roaring and trying to clasp Ning Que under the cheers of his neighbors.</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t stop. He just rushed toward him. With a slight boom, the hunk was hit to the ground like a kite, breaking many bones.</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t slow down by the impact or change his face. He continued running toward the northern city, creating a line of smoke under his feet.</p><br/><p>The neighbors surrounded the hunk who used to bully them but was able to stand out today, and found that he barely breathed. They could not help crying out and began to curse Ning Que.</p><br/><p>The man carrying the Daughter of Yama was so cruel and cold-blooded!</p><br/><p>Just after he turned a street corner, Ning Que saw several men walking following a Village Head, holding thick straw ropes, shouting to boost their courage.</p><br/><p>Moderate fear easily inspired human\u2019s anger and courage. In order to capture Sangsang, many sluggards in Chaoyang City would take the risk of being hurt to be the hero of the city.</p><br/><p>Ning Que understood them.</p><br/><p>He had seen lions being besieged by cattle in the wilderness, so he knew he should be crueler and stronger instead of being soft-hearted. That was the only way to shock the unusually crazy people who used to be docile.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he rushed to the crowd without any hesitation. Many men crashed down and broke some bones. They spit out blood as they fell down on the ground that looked so sanguine.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the people who were cursing Ning Que and Sangsang subconsciously covered their mouths. When they were reminded of the Daughter of Yama\u2019s legend, no one dared to throw things anymore.</p><br/><p>However, Ning Que\u2019s speed was too fast so that the people in front of the street had no idea what had happened, so more and more people would stand out to stop them.</p><br/><p>More and more people came into the street, holding farm tools in their hands. As they were dangerous, Ning Que had to dodge. When he finally rushed out of the block, he saw a more dangerous picture.</p><br/><p>A few rows of archers were aiming him behind piles of grain bags in front of a building, as well as on both sides of the street.</p><br/><p>\u201cShoot!\u201d</p><br/><p>As a very harsh voice sounded nowhere, countless arrows, like a rainstorm, shot toward them in the middle of the street.</p><br/><p>Ning Que could jump up to the roof or some other place, but if he did so, he would be stalled, and be surrounded by the strong cultivators of Buddhism and Taoism, so, he just shouted, \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang opened the big black umbrella at once, which was broken with a lot of holes. The big black umbrella created a great resistance when it was open and almost blew her off Ning Que\u2019 s body if she was not tied with ropes.</p><br/><p>As the soldiers already knew the weakness of the Daughter of Yama from the Buddhism Sect, so most of the arrows were aimed at Sangsang. They wanted her to be killed as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>The torrential arrows pierced the air and deeply stuck into the walls and the ground, leaving clear marks.</p><br/><p>However, when they found the dense arrows could not penetrate the big black umbrella, they became panicked and could not help thinking if the umbrella was made of iron?</p><br/><p>The big black umbrella could cover Sangsang\u2019s body, but it could not completely cover Ning Que, especially when dozens of arrows were shooting at the same time. However, considering his body strength, if marksmen who used the heavy bows could not hurt him, no one could. Except for several arrows which flew over his face, he did not dodge at all.</p><br/><p>An arrow shot at his chest and fell down on the ground, breaking. One shot at his throat, leaving a tiny crevasse which was even not bleeding.</p><br/><p>The archers, who were still in the shock of the big black umbrella, felt so astonishing when they saw it. They were wondering if he was made of iron. Especially the dozens of archers behind the grain bags, looking at Ning Que who ran as fast as the wind, they even could not tightly hold their bows.</p><br/><p>Under the clouds, a dozen black crows were quacking above the street. Under them, Ning Que was running with Sangsang on his back. No one could stop them for a second, but he was unable to get rid of the people\u2019s hunting, either.</p><br/><p>The crows flying in the sky were like the Guiding Lights for the people in Chaoyang City. Wherever he went, people were waiting for them. They were ambushed by Buddhist Ascetic Monks for twice.</p><br/><p>The angry people and cultivators narrowed Ning Que and Sangsang into a corner while the black crows quacked and flew toward the palace in the northern city.</p><br/><p>The people ran following the black crows in the sky to the palace. The strong cultivators converged and waited there as well. They both wanted to end the noisy and tense story.</p>\n</div>"}

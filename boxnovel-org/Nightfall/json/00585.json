He left the Xuankong Temple to Wa mountain and prepared all of these just because he firmly believed that Ning Que was the Son of Yama. He never thought of Sangsang.</p><br/><p>Quni Madi and the others were still in shock, but Cheng Lixue was the one who was most shocked. As the Priest of the Revelation Department in the West-Hill Divine Palace, he was unable to reconcile the fact that Sangsang, who was considered as the Daughter of Light, would turn to be the Daughter of Yama? While thinking of this, he could not help straightening his now blanching face.</p><br/><p>The Daughter of Yama. what did that mean?</p><br/><p>Compared with this, Ning Que\u2019s joining the Devil would be no longer the most troublesome thing. Although the Devil\u2019s Doctrine had disappeared for so many years, there were still many cultivators following it. The most important thing for him now, was that Sangsang had become the root cause of the end of the world.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The light coming from the Buddha figure in the Wa mountain ignored all physical barriers and marvelously penetrated the roof of the Lanke Temple. It looked solemn and beautiful as if it mixed the gold and pearl powders together, ignited by the sunshine.</p><br/><p>The big black umbrella unfolded over Sangsang\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The Light of Buddha shined over the oiled umbrella and was reflected around. The view was beautiful and astonishing.</p><br/><p>Somehow, the Light of Buddha spurted like rain instead of getting through the umbrella.</p><br/><p>The Light of Buddha was more magnificent and infinite than a normal rain as if it were a waterfall condensed with countless beams of light, ceaselessly falling on the umbrella.</p><br/><p>The big black umbrella was like a black stone at the base of a waterfall, ceaselessly being washed and struck. No matter how tough and strong it was, it gradually started trembling.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s right hand holding the handle slightly shook. He didn\u2019t feel much power from it, but he did feel the pressure by the Light of Buddha outside the umbrella. His every bone started creaking.</p><br/><p>What terrified him most was that the layer of dust and oil covering the umbrella fabric for years was becoming thinner and thinner under the light, and seemed as if it would evaporate at anytime.</p><br/><p>Master Boshu stopped playing the Yue laan Bell because he was too shocked, so even though the bell of the Lanke Temple was still ringing, its clear sound had gradually died away.</p><br/><p>Ning Que took Sangsang up to his back.</p><br/><p>Sangsang put her head on his shoulder, pale and weak as a baby when she was taken up on his back in the cold rain many years ago. She habitually stretched her hand to hold the umbrella for him.</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew she was in bad state, so he didn\u2019t want her to hold the umbrella.</p><br/><p>Sangsang still took the big black umbrella over. It was amazing that after it was in her hands, it became more stable and able to withstand more of the Light of Buddha.</p><br/><p>Then, Ning Que started moving out of the Light of Buddha.</p><br/><p>Holding the podao across his chest and putting the arrow box on his back, he looked at the people in the temple like a mother tiger guarding her child, coldly and fiercely.</p><br/><p>Even though the people in the temple were all experts, when they saw his eyes, they subconsciously avoided making contact.</p><br/><p>Then, they found something amazing that calmed them down.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was walking out of the Light, but he didn\u2019t get out of the Light.</p><br/><p>The Light of Buddha coming from the Wa mountain followed his footsteps as if it could locate him. More precisely, it could locate Sangsang\u2019s position.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the fragments dropping from the edge of the umbrella and disappearing into the air without saying anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Chenjia who was in shock suddenly burst into laughter in the next moment. Her body trembled as a flower in the wind. She gasped for breath until her face was full of tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour most important person has become the daughter of Yama. Ning Que, what are you going to do? I wish you are as miserable as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que contemptuously looked at her with a little pity.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Lu Chenjia stopped laughing and became blank.</p><br/><p>Her face was pale and the wound was bleeding, however, she understood what he meant and could not help being confused. He did what he had said, but why didn\u2019t he think a little more?</p><br/><p>She was the Daughter of Yama!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Thirteen, please put her down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Boshu compassionately chanted the name of Buddha and said to Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Cheng Ziqing lowered his head and sat in front of the temple. He drew his sword and put it across his knees.</p><br/><p>Ning Que glared at the little brass bell in Master Boshu\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Then he turned to the sword on Cheng Ziqing\u2019s knees.</p><br/><p>At last, he looked at the big black umbrella.</p><br/><p>Master Boshu was the chief monk of the Xuankong Temple who was the wisest man in the world. He was at the middle-stage of the Knowing Destiny State or even higher. The bell in his hand was the Buddha\u2019s relics which was of the purest Buddha power which was exactly Sangsang\u2019s deadly foe.</p><br/><p>Cheng Ziqing was the Sword Sage, Liu Bai\u2019s Younger Brother, also a middle-stage expert at the Knowing Destiny State. Even though he had been unobtrusive these days, his sword was still powerful.</p><br/><p>The big black umbrella had shown its best in Sangsang\u2019s hands just like the past ten years. However, its oil and dust were washing up under the Light of Buddha so that the tiny gaps barely bore the Light.</p><br/><p>Facing the two strongest masters from the Xuankong Temple and the Sword Garret, even if he didn\u2019t carry Sangsang, Ning Que wasn\u2019t confident to get away, not mention Sangsang who was on his back and the light that was tracking them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we have found Yama\u2019s daughter, we can\u2019t let her go. No matter if you can hide in the depth of the Wilderness or the ocean, you can\u2019t get away from the Light of Buddha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Boshu tightened his fingers holding the bell and said to Ning Que, \u201cPut her down.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Master Qishan sadly said, \u201cAs they can\u2019t go, please stop the bell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at him for a while. Then he moved his hand away from his hilt and pated the scabbard in his waist.</p><br/><p>People believed that his silence represented his psychological struggle, and revealed different expressions. Cheng Ziqing sighed in his heart and thought,<em>\u201cYou have no choice even if Yama\u2019s daughter is your parent.\u201d</em></p><br/><p>Only Master Qishan vaguely knew what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at Master Qishan and discovered he was more sad than shocked. Then he confirmed that the master had already known Sangsang was Yama\u2019s daughter for a long time.</p><br/><p>He had felt something was going to happen before they left Chang\u2019an. Now he knew the significance of the recent events; Sangsang\u2019s disease, the three games in Wa mountain, and the cultivation in the temple, all indicated the truth of the fact: the Lanke Temple was the inexorable doom of both him and Sangsang.</p><br/><p>Then, he thought of something farther away and he could not help chilling\u2014It was the Headmaster\u2019s idea to come to the Lanke Temple to heal Sangsang. In other words, it was arranged by Eldest Brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said to himself and he wanted to push this idea out of his mind. However, he needed the realistic answer, even if the answer would make him suffer tremendously.</p><br/><p>For that reason, he looked at the master silently.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan knew what he was looking forward to, so he said, \u201cDo you believe she is Yama\u2019s daughter now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said without any emotion, \u201cYou told me she was the daughter of Light, now you tell me she is the daughter of Yama. I don\u2019t know which one I should believe. I only know I picked and raised her up. If you need to consider her as someone\u2019s daughter, it should be me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Master Qishan said, \u201cBut this is the truth of the fact. When you asked me to treat her in the cave days ago, I felt her chilly aura on her wrist. That was the moment I knew it was the imprint left by Yama. Since the Headmaster and the West-Hill Divine Skill could not disperse the chilly aura in her body, did you ever think about how it could not be a normal disease?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been doubting it for a long time, but he was unwilling to think or talk about it. He wanted to forget it until the master brought it out. He said after a silence, \u201cIt\u2019s only your speculation and you cannot prove it. My teacher told me that there was no omniscient man in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, so the Headmaster sent you here. First, we need to figure out what her disease was. By this, we can know the truth and find a cure for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan sighed and said, \u201cThe three chess games on the Wa Mountain this year were prepared for Sangsang. In the Jumping Tiger Stream, I intended to let her play the game anyway no matter how tough you were.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ning Que asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo prove who she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cThe way she broke the Messy Phase Game was using the Heaven\u2019s power. It was not at the level a man would be able to reach. The first game accurately proved she was not a human.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que kept silent.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan added, \u201cIn the pavilion, she played the second game with Dongming and she chose the black stone. Dongming\u2019s best ability was to see the Heaven\u2019s will on the chessboard. It was hard to tell if the black stones or the white stones would win, just like the day and night of the world. That was another sign pointing at Yama\u2019s daughter.\u201d Ning Que said, \u201cMaster Dongming told me that chess should follow the heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan looked at Sangsang and lovingly said, \u201cThe God\u2019s will depends on her heart.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

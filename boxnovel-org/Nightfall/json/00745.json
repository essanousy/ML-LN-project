Hundreds of people were sitting inside, but it did not seem cramped at all. The people inside were all very silent, so the large empty tent felt even quieter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an order from the Great Divine Priest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Haixin looked at the people protesting with silence. He said indifferently, \u201cDon\u2019t think about the glory and respect that you normally enjoy in your own sects. You should know that we are now in the army and that we are fighting against Tang, acting under orders of Heaven. We are carrying out the will of Haotian.\u201d</p><br/><p>A powerhouse in the Seethrough Realm stared at him and said sternly, \u201cThere is no way for the armored cavalry to rush over. What can we do? Who can fight against the sounds of the zither and flute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Haixin said, \u201cSince you want to abandon your horses and fight, then you need not worry about the cavalry. As for the sounds of the zither and flute\u2026 The Divine Hall of Revelation is making a talisman now and will distribute them to you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear more questions. What you need to do now is to accept.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for the prideful cultivators to speak, he continued with a straight face, \u201cOf course, it is up to you to carry out what ordinary soldiers cannot do. Otherwise, why would the Haotian Taoism keep you around for?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was an angry voice behind the crowd, \u201cAren\u2019t you sending us to our deaths?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Haixin\u2019s expression turned cold and looked toward the direction where the voice came from and said, \u201cWho\u2019s talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody answered as they did not dare to. And no one dared to speak again.</p><br/><p>There were hundreds of powerhouses from the military and cultivators from various sects of various countries in the great tent. Even though Bai Haixin was a general of the South Jin Kingdom, he would not have cowed them into silence. However, in the Coalition Army of the Divine Hall, everyone knew that he represented the West-Hill Divine Palace.</p><br/><p>However, not daring to speak did not mean they weren\u2019t thinking. The cultivators all shared a disgusted look. They all knew that the man who spoke up was right. The West-Hill Divine Palace wanted to have its smaller vassal sects head to their deaths. They would, through their deaths, whittle down the Academy\u2019s disciples\u2019 Psyche Power, energy and physical strength\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about your sects, whether they want to live and prosper or disappear like fireworks. Think about your relatives and fellow disciples in your hometown, and think about the great one existing in the Firmament.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Bai Haixin turned and left the great tent.</p><br/><p>All were silent in the great tent; the silence represented acceptance as they were forced to do so.</p><br/><p>Compared with the warm atmosphere in the Verdant Canyon, it was very cold here.</p><br/><p>With green hills blocking the warm mist in the southern Great Lake, Qinghe County had always been famous for its spring-like seasons. However, it was late autumn after all, so after nightfall, the temperature of the plains gradually fell.</p><br/><p>Campfires were lit in the Military camp.</p><br/><p>The stars in the Night Dome were dim and hard to see by the bright moon\u2019s silver glow. The reflection of the countless bonfires between the plains caused them to dim even more. If one did not look carefully, they might even think that it was a starless night.</p><br/><p>There were more than 20 people sitting around a bonfire.</p><br/><p>They were all disciples of the Sword Garret of the South Jin Kingdom.</p><br/><p>The disciples respectfully sat around a man.</p><br/><p>The man was dressed in linen and wore a simple bun. His face was ordinary and the only special part about him was his eyebrows which were so thick they seemed to be drawn with ink.</p><br/><p>There was an old golden crown on the ground beside him.</p><br/><p>Only Emperors could wear golden crowns.</p><br/><p>But this man was not the Emperor of any country.</p><br/><p>He was the Emperor of Sword Taoism. He was the sage of Sword Taoism.</p><br/><p>He was Liu Bai, which was why he had a golden crown.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Divine Hall\u2019s idea will not be effective.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai looked at the moon in the Night Dome and remained silent for a long time.</p><br/><p>His disciples did not dare ask and waited for their teacher to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are but a few people in the Academy, but yet, they have come to stop troops of tens and thousands. It might seem foolish, but they are no fools. That\u2019s why the Divine Hall\u2019s idea of sending troops there to waste Jun Mo\u2019s energy will not be effective.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yiqing coughed painfully and said, \u201cAlthough Mr. Second is mighty, he will grow weak. Furthermore, his arrogant and domineering tactics will not hold for too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was defeated again in the hands of the Academy\u2019s disciples and was severely injured. However, he was not as angry or sad as before and was able to analyze the situation calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Divine Hall thinks like that too, which is why they will make the same mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said, \u201cYou all think that Jun Mo is prideful and that his tactics are arrogant. That is why he has to use more Psyche Power and energy with every strike of his sword, which cannot last for long. However, this is a ridiculous thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might seem more laborious for Jun Mo to smash down or hit with his sword compared to just a swift cut. However, this is because you do not understand that cuts are made with strength and will damage blades. But his smashing and tapping use the Qi of Heaven and Earth. That thick iron sword of his will never be damaged until the end of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said that, the world\u2019s most powerful man in Sword Taoism pulled out an unlit twig from the bonfire. He slowly lifted it up until it was a foot away from his eyes and then waved it downward casually.</p><br/><p>The aura of heaven and earth near the bonfire moved with the swing of the twig. Several light and ethereal aura adhered to the twig and thickened, gathering into a ball as the twig waved.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai\u2019s twig landed in the bonfire.</p><br/><p>The gathered ball of aura dispersed in the fire.</p><br/><p>There was a sudden explosion of flames as the flame rocketed into the night sky, lighting up the Military camp.</p><br/><p>Shouts rang in all directions before tapering down.</p><br/><p>Liu Yiqing looked down and considered silently for a long while.</p><br/><p>He could not see, but his Psyche Power could clearly sense what the twig had done.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Second does not need energy to wave his sword around, he is using the aura of Heaven and Earth to move the sword and uses it to help power it. This is not a Martial Arts cultivation or Dark Methods. But\u2026their origins are the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly looked up at the Verdant Canyon that he could not see. His voice trembled slightly as he said, \u201cThis kind of Sword Taoism consumes the least amount of Psyche Power and physical strength. He can continue to kill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are both right and wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai threw the broken half of the twig in his hand into the bonfire and said, \u201cYou are right about what kind of method Jun Mo is using. But you are wrong because you still have not understood that he is not using heaven and earth to move the sword\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is using heaven and earth to attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>All was silent beside the bonfire.</p><br/><p>The Sword Garret disciples were silent and each had his own thoughts. They studied under the world\u2019s most powerful cultivator and practiced the art of the sword diligently. They had pride in their work, which is why they refused to bow to the Academy and were unimpressed by Mr. Second\u2019s pride. However, they had finally realized that Mr. Second had his own reasons to be proud.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai asked, \u201cWhere has the iron sword of Jun Mo been?\u201d</p><br/><p>A disciple thought and said uncertainly, \u201cThe sword is in front of him when he does not hold it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai asked, \u201cHow far away is it from him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody had noticed this detail.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said, \u201cI was the only one who noticed this because this was what Jun Mo showed to me. The sword had always been\u2026 one and a half feet in front of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>Because everyone knew that the Sword Sage, Liu Bai\u2019s, most famous concept was that the sword should be no more than one foot in front of a person.</p><br/><p>One and a half feet was further than one foot.</p><br/><p>Then was it more powerful?</p><br/><p>Liu Bai knew how his disciples were feeling and he smiled and said, \u201cThe cultivator must be confident, so pride is the most common outward manifestation of it. I have seen many proud people in my life. For example, Ye Su, or the old Priest of Judgement. But I have never seen a man prouder than Jun Mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>All his disciples remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd pride will kill him.\u201d Liu Bai stopped smiling and said nonchalantly, \u201cBecause pride is an emotion, and a true swordsman cannot have any extra emotions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, a disciple could not bear it any longer, he asked, \u201cWhen are you going to attack?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile the Divine Hall might be worrying, I am not. The destruction of the Tang Empire is not something that can be done in just a single battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said, \u201cThis battle of the Verdant Canyon is a great opportunity for you to learn from the Academy. Jun Mo is also my favorite opponent. Just as I have said earlier in the day, I will definitely wait until he is at his strongest before I strike.\u201d</p><br/><p>The disciples thought to themselves that Mr. Second had already caused blood to flow through the plains with his sword, and he had not retreated a single step. It was evident that he was very strong and seemed almost invincible. Could he become even stronger?</p><br/><p>Liu Yiqing asked, \u201cWhen will he reach his strongest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Mo is an ordinary person, so he would act like an ordinary person. That is why he let you all live today. But when he holds his sword, he will no longer be ordinary. When he starts getting injured and tired, and when he discovers that his pride is being challenged and becomes truly angry\u2026 and when everyone thinks he is about to fail\u2014 that is when he will be strongest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai stood up and looked at the quiet Verdant Canyon on the other side of the plains. He felt the warm aura coming from there, and slowly placed his hands behind his back, not speaking for a long time.</p><br/><p>All the disciples of the Sword Garret stood up and looked at the place, not knowing what he was looking at.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe army is mighty and the powerhouses have gathered. Yet they are still in the mood to cook carefully even faced with danger. Well, some of the rice is burnt, but the pickled vegetables smell really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai inhaled the scents brought by the night breeze and lamented, \u201cThis is life. It is a process that cannot be affected by war or deaths.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can the disciples of the Academy be so calm? It is not because they are confident, but because they are doing what they want to do and doing what makes them happy, so that is why they have done it so confidently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy sword can be like them too, but I cannot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai looked at the Verdant Canyon with a smile and said, \u201cThe Academy is really magical. It is a pity that the teacher is no longer there, otherwise I would really want to live in it for a few years.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the second day of the battle of Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>It was gloomy and looked as if it was about to rain.</p><br/><p>The stench of blood on the plains thickened.</p><br/><p>The scent of millet porridge in the pot grew thicker too.</p><br/><p>Everyone praised the pickles that Sangsang made back then at the back of the mountain, and began to slurp up their porridge.</p><br/><p>They drank it loudly and well.</p><br/><p>After finishing their porridge, they helped Second Brother into his armor.</p><br/><p>Second Brother held his iron sword and walked out into the plains.</p><br/><p>Seventh Sister did not sleep well last night. She rubbed her slightly sore eyes and said, \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was well fed and well rested today.</p><br/><p>Everyting was going on well.</p>\n</div>"}

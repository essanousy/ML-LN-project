Now, he returned again without hesitation. But this was not a representation of him being indefinite, although he often called himself a vile person. He returned because he was aware of the predicament that Elder Brother was going to face. Under such circumstances, he had no choice but to return. Even after he returned to Chang\u2019an, and ultimately won the battle, realizing the prayers of all, he would not be able to look at the world in peace if Elder Brother did not live to see them.</p><br/><p>However, he did not expect his return to be too late. He did not get to hear what the Abbey Dean said, therefore he would not know what those words mean to the Drunkard. He also never imagined that such a grand cultivator like the Drunkard would be so shameless and cunning to attempt a sneak attack on Elder Brother.</p><br/><p>Witnessing the Elder Brother bleeding, and the potted sword left in his body, he felt as if he was the one who was being stabbed. He was filled with wrath, and his eyes turned red due to the pain. How could he even bother about the cliff that was right before him?</p><br/><p>He held the Drunkard and slammed it toward the cliff like a rock.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard looked very pale. As a grand cultivator at the level of the distanceless state, one thing that he tabooed the most was to let martial art masters who were at the most advanced level or great dark skill practitioners like Ning Que Yu Lian to get close to him. However, he was locked by the sneak attack of Ning Que at the moment. How was he supposed to avoid the cliff that was directed to his face?</p><br/><p>It was at the very last moment that this great cultivator who had been through the Ever Night, and was very experienced and knowledgeable on surviving skills, erupted a rare energy.</p><br/><p>A loud hiss burst out between his lips, and the breath of nature in Tian Qi Mountain that was already extremely thin was summoned by his enormous psyche power, into the air in layers before him.</p><br/><p>Every layer of the breath of nature was very thin, thinner than a piece of paper, but when innumerable layers of the breath were accumulated, like countless papers overlapping one another would render its thickness and mighty power.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard summoned and rebuilt hundreds of layers of the breath of nature within such a short time. It might seem easy, but it actually demonstrated an unimaginably formidable state!</p><br/><p>An invisible swamp suddenly appeared in front of the tough cliff.</p><br/><p>Ning Que, holding the Drunkard, banged into the swamp like a flowing fire stone.</p><br/><p>A loud sound echoed around the mountains. The collision was not very clear, so it did not sound like a Bang but sounded like a Buzz as though it was the sound of a heavy hammer hitting on a thick pile of paper.</p><br/><p>If it was a thick rock, then it might be shattered by a hammer. But if it was a stack of papers, then it could not be crushed.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard hummed, as blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth, causing his chic beard to be wet.</p><br/><p>Ning Que hummed too, as his face turned pale. He experienced a setback on his rib cage after being hurt by Long Qing outside the Rognon sea of the Yan territory. His rib cage fractured again, and the blood had drenched the clothes on his chest.</p><br/><p>Neither of them died.</p><br/><p>Web-like cracks appeared on the wall of the cliff, and two of them were in the middle of the web.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stepped on the wall of the cliff with one foot, creating more concentrated cracks. Utilizing the immense anti-shock force, he then landed on the solid surface of rock along with the Drunkard\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Landing extremely fast!</p><br/><p>At the same time, he strangled the Drunkard with both his arms and exerted his power as he vigorously hit on the back of Drunkard\u2019s head with his forehead, treacherously lifting his right knee and aimed at the Drunkard\u2019s perineum!</p><br/><p>He was a master of hand-to-hand battle. He beat A Da to death, banged Hengmu to death and killed Long Qing by the riverside, all done with his bare hands. Apart from Ye Hongyu, no one was capable of being his opponent.</p><br/><p>The question was, in terms of the state of cultivation, there was a big gap between him and the Drunkard. If it was a normal battle, he could not even get close to him, let alone attacking. Relying on the sneak attack and Elder Brother\u2019s natal, the natural stream magical finger, he got to lay aside with the Drunkard. How could he possibly let go of this chance?</p><br/><p>As much as he cherished it, he did everything he could to make the Drunkard a dead man!</p><br/><p>As they were falling on the ground which was hundreds of feet away from them, it was enough for him to strangle the Drunkard to death with his steel-like arm. Even if he could not, he would use his fists and beat the Drunkard to death.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard screamed continuously, and the flagon in his left hand suddenly increased in size, blocking Ning Que\u2019s arm that was strangling him. He took out a sword from the flagon, and thrust it towards Ning Que at an unbelievable extent.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s arm could not break the Drunkard\u2019s neck due to the blocking flagon. The flagon symbolized an immeasurable state. At the same time, he found his attack unable to reach the Drunkard\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>All because of that d*mn sword.</p><br/><p>Before today, people rarely knew that the actual natal item of the Drunkard was not the flagon, but the sword in it. And today, he finally used the sword, which had injured the Elder Brother badly with one attack, showing off its immense power.</p><br/><p>The reflection of the swords glittered in between the cracks of the cliff, but it did not show any signs of criss crossing. They just seemed very sharp and weird. The razor-sharp sword\u2019s wills passed through the Drunkard\u2019s armpit and even between his legs, and headed towards Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Ning Que attempted an attack towards the Drunkard\u2019s leg, but he was blocked by the sword. However, his forehead almost hit the back of the Drunkard\u2019s head. At the same time, the Drunkard\u2019s sword, once again, reached in an extremely peculiar way.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard placed his sword horizontally as if he was trying to cut his throat, but the tip of the sword passed through his neck and accurately pierced between Ning Que\u2019s eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Anyone would want to avoid it when they encountered a sword like this. It was an instinct to avoid the shadow of the sword that was approaching. However, Ning Que did not avoid it as his eyes were red, and he could not see a thing.</p><br/><p>He ruthlessly slammed on the Dunkard\u2019s sword as if he did not even see it.</p><br/><p>Along with a clear snap, the sword was broken.</p><br/><p>Ning Que were covered with a pool of blood between his eyebrows as he was stabbed by the sword. This time, his eyes really gone red.</p><br/><p>Although the sword formed a blockage, he successfully attacked the Drunkard at last, even though the remaining energy could not utterly smash the Drunkard\u2019s head into pieces.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard roared ferociously due to the irresistible pain.</p><br/><p>The roaring stopped as they landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>Thud! The rocks on the cliff were all over, and the air was filled with smoke and dust.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s body was thrown out due to the quakes.</p><br/><p>The smoke and dust started to fade away, clearing the vision. The Drunkard was seen to be holding the flagon that was half-stuck in the solid rock. Blood was all over his body, especially at the back of his head; the blood kept flowing out.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s face and body were stained by blood too.</p><br/><p>Both of them looked tragic.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard looked at him with blood at the corner of his mouth. His glance was horrific and ice-cold, and he did not look like a human anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 how dare you ambush me?\u201d His voice sounded callous too, as if he was not a human. His anger has reached the greatest extent at this point. He never thought that he would be placed in such an embarrassing state by a junior who has not even surpass the Fifth State. He was triggered even more by the fact that he was almost killed by him. He thought that all this happened solely because of Ning Que\u2019s sneak attack. Or else on what basis?</p><br/><p>Ning Que had never seen such a shameless person like him. Even though he called himself the shame of the academy all this while, he also felt that the Drunkard was unbelievably shameless.</p><br/><p>Ambush\u2026 Didn\u2019t you ambush my Elder Brother too?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare\u2026 how dare you ambush me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard the Drunkard\u2019s cold, furious, arrogant and intermittent question, Ning Que emotionlessly answered, \u201d I dare to even f*** your mother, what could you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>What could he do? There was nothing that he could do.</p><br/><p>There was still an unsurpassable gap in terms of state between Ning Que and the best few in the world. As he was not in Chang\u2019an, it was hard for him to beat grand cultivator like the Drunkard. But Ning Que had special advantages as he cultivated Haoran Qi with the dark methods. Additionally, he cultivated with Sangsang in the Buddha\u2019s chessboard for thousands of years. His body was extraordinarily strong, thus would be hard to cause fatal injury on him from head to toe. Back then, when he was watched Sangsang left Chang\u2019an City, he himself wanted to break his heart apart but yet he failed, let alone being hurt by the enemies?</p><br/><p>He was yet to reach the mythical state of the immortality of Devil\u2019s Doctrine, but he was now a \u2018loud bronze pea\u2019 that could not be steamed, cooked, smashed, and fried. You could surmount him, but it was difficult to kill him, so he could also be a sticky candy that you could not get rid of or tear apart.</p><br/><p>Long Qing prepared numerous strategies to kill him, but he only managed to cause excessive bleeding on him, failing on the assissination. Although the Drunkard showed his hidden peculiar doctrine of the sword, killing Ning Que was still not an easy task. Ning Que would like to see the Drunkard attempting to kill him.</p><br/><p>There were four people in the mountains at the moment: the Abbey Dean, the Elder Brother, the Drunkard, and Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Sangsang had entered the city of Helan.</p><br/><p>Though no one knew why must she entered the city of Helan, but obviously, she was confident that she would be able to free herself from the tracing of the Abbey Dean and the Drunkard, and returned to Chang\u2019an as long as she entered that town.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill her.\u201d The Abbey Dean\u2019s voice was heard in between the mountains. It was calm and determined, without a single tinge of hesitation.</p><br/><p>This statement was directed to the Drunkard. The Drunkard glanced at Ning Que and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt a hint of coldness all of a sudden as he saw the glimpse of the Drunkard before he left.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard\u2019s glance was cold and brutal with a clear meaning that he was going to kill her now, but there was nothing that Ning Que could do. He could only witness her death with his eyes.</p><br/><p>Subsequently, another voice was produced. It was from the Elder Brother. \u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s bring her back to Chang\u2019an!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the Elder Brother who was covered in blood, but was still calmly lifting the wooden rod in front of him, and the broken sword on him. He did not know how to react.</p><br/><p>He ambushed the Drunkard, but he only gained a partial success. Next, he was thinking that he could work together with the Elder Brother to seeking for opportunities with ferocious will, at least to ensure that Sangsang would be safe from danger.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean spoiled his plans by a single instruction. The Abbey Dean stood at the peak, therefore, he was able to see furthest.</p><br/><p>The weakest part between the mountains was not Ning Que, but outside the mountains.</p><br/><p>Now the weakest was Haotion. The Drunkard was on his way to kill her. What could Ning Que do? Should he stay and help the heavily injured Eldest Brother, or leave to rescue the heavily injured Sangsang? He could only choose one which would mean to abandon another.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother started speaking again. He, too, said one word to spoil the Abbey Dean\u2019s plan. \u201cI am not gonna die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Eldest Brother never lies.\u201d Ning Que firmly believed in this and the fact that at the end of this story, he would not be crying and shouting, blaming the Eldest Brother for lying to him before the end of his life, because the Eldest Brother would never tell lies.</p><br/><p>He jumped down from the cliff, and rushed towards the city of Helan.</p><br/><p>Today, in between the mountains, he came and went.</p><br/><p>Perhaps everything in the mortal world was just as such. It might look repetitive or even boring, but it had to be done because no matter leaving or returning or leaving again, there was a reason for us to do so.</p></div>\n</div>"}

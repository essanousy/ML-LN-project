However, Xia Hou was undoubtedly a great general of the Tang Empire and a visiting professor of the West-Hill Divine Palace, so why did the Eldest Brother say that he was also a superior in the Devil's Doctrine?</p><br/><p>The manner and tone of the Eldest Brother were very calm, or in other words, very slow. Ning Que was shocked, so he had to spend more time to think it over. So when he supported Mo Shanshan and walked with the other two girls to the misty exit of the valley, that world-shaking fight had been going on for a long time.</p><br/><p>A hole as deep as half a man's height appeared on the firm, stony ground. At the bottom of the hole were two clear footprints in the center, from which numerous tiny cracks spread out to the surrounding area and eventually covered an area of over 100 feet, looking like a huge spider-web.</p><br/><p>Looking at the spiderweb-like cracks on the ground and thinking of the terrible power that was produced when the man's downward-moving foot and Xia Hou's upward-punching fist had met, he could not help feeling frightened and even absent-minded. Now that he had entered the Seethrough State and understood the Haoran Sword that was left by the Youngest Uncle, he could be called a superior. But he was quite clear that if he were to face such pure power, he would have no way to fight back, and would just be smashed into a puddle of blood.</p><br/><p>The two figures darted around the cracks. Their speed was too fast for the naked eye to see them, so others had to rely on the sounds of them breaking the air to judge where their specific location was. And those extremely severe and sharp sounds even pricked the eardrums of the bystanders.</p><br/><p>The two figures could not separate from each other at all because they were tangled with each other, and specifically, because the man coming down from the sky silently focused all his killing intent on Xia Hou. Although the surrounding area of over 100 feet looked vast, under their terribly high speed, it appeared to be as small as a pinhead.</p><br/><p>These two superiors of the Devil's Doctrine from two generations had tempered their bodies to the extreme, and perfectly controlled their bodies to the extreme. But they still could not completely avoid their opponents' attacks.</p><br/><p>Since they could not avoid each other, then they would be the first to beat their opponent to death. That was the fighting philosophy of the Devil's Doctrine.</p><br/><p>Faster than the blink of an eye, the two figures had collided no less than ten times. Their strong auras surged out to the surroundings like a constant tide. The thunderous roars produced a sound similar to the ringing of bells in ancient temples, which seemed never to stop.</p><br/><p>Tang waved his fist in the air and brought out flames as red as blood. His fist pounded on Xia Hou's body, and it produced a deep impression of the two fingers. Between the lines of fire, the adust smell came out.</p><br/><p>Comparatively speaking, the fist of Xia Hou was more silent and firm. Surrounding his tough fingers was a faintly golden luster. When he punched Tang, it was like a blunt knife chopping toward him, which was like iron-forging when it struck Tang's body.</p><br/><p>The fists punched directly on his flesh, making thunderous sounds. More than ten deep holes intensely appeared on the cliff for some unknown reason. The smoke and dirt gradually faded, revealing the smooth inside walls of the deep holes. It looked extremely horrible.</p><br/><p>They really did deserve the title of having the strongest and most dominant bodies in the world. Their fists did not actually touch the walls but had penetrated them through the air with the intention to kill, as if the walls were just made out of dough. However, they seemed to have no special feeling when their strong fists punched each other.</p><br/><p>What on earth were these fists? What kinds of bodies did they have? The fists striking their bodies were like hammers striking an old bell. The sound became more and more intense, sharper and sharper. And the situation became more and more dangerous.</p><br/><p>A strong wind surged up beside the valley, bringing sand and small stones to crazily dance in the air. Standing behind the Eldest Brother, Ning Que and the other three people did not confront it face to face. But feeling the terrible power sent from the far distance, they still could not help turning pale. That was because their eardrums were compressed by the wind and the sound that the fists produced, or more so because their minds were controlled by those two powerful men.</p><br/><p>Staring at that man coming down from the sky, Ye Hongyu turned pale, which reflected her true feelings. Gradually, she admitted that the ordinary-looking man who wore a fur-lined jacket was indeed qualified to be at the same rank as her elder brother.</p><br/><p>The gaze of Tang Xiaotang rested on the same place. When she looked at her elder brother, her pale face was filled with anxiety, and her bright and clear eyes constantly showed an expression of cheering for him.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan stood beside Ning Que, and her little round face was a bit pale and her eyes were dim. Originally, she was the Calligraphy Addict who was greatly respected or even admired by the people engaged in cultivation, but this time in the Wilderness, she had met so many Grand Cultivators. It was not until now that she learned that the real strong figures always stayed behind the scenes, so she was greatly shocked. Especially thinking of the powerful states that those two men were in, and the fact that even her master, the Master of Calligrapher, might not be able to defeat them, she could not help feeling depressed.</p><br/><p>Ning Que thoughts were not as complicated as the three girls. He followed the Eldest Brother's instructions and watched the ultimate confrontation, which could barely be seen. And, with his excellent ability of perception, he even remembered to perceive the disturbance of the Qi of Heaven and Earth created by the two figures.</p><br/><p>However, the moment that he used his Psyche Power to perceive the surrounding Qi of Heaven and Earth, he knew that he had made a big mistake. Now, the Qi of Heaven and Earth inside and outside the valley was actually torn into countless pieces by the two men's fists. The torrents formed by those pieces flew around chaotically, complicated and intense in the extreme. If he wanted to perceive those changes with his current state, it was like a daydream. In an instant, his sense of perception was greatly shocked, his face turning pale. He had probably been injured.</p><br/><p>Those two men were too powerful. According to the odds or the standard law of being bestowed by Haotian, figures with such dominant and powerful bodies should have no equal in this world. However, today they met two.</p><br/><p>Looking at the rain of debris, the increasing number of holes that mysteriously appeared in the rain, and the two severe and god-like figures, Ning Que did not recover from the shock until some time had passed. He asked bitterly, \"Are we just going to watch them fight? Shall we go first? I always feel that it's dangerous to be around these monsters. Even if they were to just kick away a stone unconsciously, it would be more horrible than a crossbow arrow.\"</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother looked at him in confusion and asked, \"Then what should we do?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at them fighting and said with a smile, \"How about you use a finger to stab them to death.\"</p><br/><p>\"How can that be possible? I'm not a monster. I'm already happy because they didn't take action against me. They have given the master and the Academy face. But I can't do anything if they want to fight. At least I can't stop them. As for taking the initiative to attack them, I feel that it is somewhat unreasonable and not at all virtuous.\"</p><br/><p>Eldest Brother was a virtuous man, so he would not take any action at this moment. He explained patiently and slowly, gently and movingly, \"And in addition, I'm not good at fighting.\"</p><br/><p>As a member of the back of the mountain of the Academy, Ning Que naturally knew those Senior Brothers and Sisters living on that mountain were all insane guys, except for himself, who appeared to be more normal. However, he still did not expect that the Eldest Brother would give such an answer. You stand here, saying that nobody has dared to take any action against you. Then you said that your opponents are monsters, instead of yourself? If you are not good at fighting, who else in this world can dare to say he is!?</p><br/><p>Discovering that the Eldest Brother was also unreliable, Ning Que found that his admiration toward him had instantly disappeared, even though the previously stable, warm, and intimate feelings from him still existed. Then he directed his attention to Tang Xiaotang and asked her, \"Is that your brother?\"</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang nodded.</p><br/><p>Ning Que confirmed it inwardly. A man who could fight forcibly with Xia Hou, a superior at the Peak state of Martial Arts, had to be that World Wayfarer of the Devil's Doctrine. He continued to ask, \"Why do people in your family like to jump down from the sky?\"</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang was nervously eyeing the fight, so she answered casually, \"It's hard to be injured by jumping, so we don't bother walking.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que slightly stiffened, thinking to himself that this brother and sister of the Devil's Doctrine were really marvelously lazy to the extreme.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the two howling figures finally rested.</p><br/><p>During the fight, the fur-lined jacket that Tang wore had been split under the tough punches of Xia Hou and was flying around in the wind. Then it plopped on the ground as if it had been dragged by lead. The upper part of his body was bare, revealing his muscles, which were as tough as rocks. On the surface of his face and body was condensed a thin layer of toughness. And his eyes, in particular, vaguely revealed a sense of ominous toughness.</p><br/><p>The end of Xia Hou's thick eyebrows had been burnt into ashes, losing all their vitality, which now looked like spiritless black worms. His eyes were filled with agitation, as if the whole autumn were hidden inside them.</p><br/><p>Tang looked at him indifferently and said, \"If you want to steal the Tomes of Arcane, I will kill you.\"</p><br/><p>Xia Hou gradually ripped off his worn clothes, thus exposing the armor inside. He looked at Tang and said coldly, \"There are many people in this world who want to kill me, but none of them have succeeded.\"</p><br/><p>The fight between these two superiors of the Devil's Doctrine had originated from Tang's extreme intention of killing. He had silently followed Ning Que and the other people all the way, just waiting for Xia Hou to appear and steal the Tomes of Arcane. He had been secretly waiting for this sneak attack, or rather, strike, for many years, and he finally had the opportunity. He won by having favorable climatic, geographical, and human conditions. So it was obvious that Xia Hou was more heavily injured, but he still did not die.</p><br/><p>He stood there, still looking like an unshakable mountain, even though he had been heavily punched numerous times on his chest, even though his cotton jacket was filled with holes that looked like the mold of a plum cake in the Academy, and even though he had the least momentum now and had become restless.</p><br/><p>In the past, he had betrayed the Devil's Doctrine and boiled the saintess to death. He then claimed loyalty to the West-Hill Divine Palace and became their visiting professor. He had been fighting for the Tang Empire for many years as a general. Therefore, such a powerful man would not die so easily.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Tang said, \"You are more heavily injured than I am. I still have a chance.\"</p><br/><p>Xia Hou shook his head, saying, \"Anyway, you are not your master. So no matter how seriously I was injured, you have no way to kill me now. Instead, you are the leftover evil of the Devil's Doctrine, but I'm a visiting professor of Taoism and a great general of the Tang Empire. In this bright world and under the shine of Haotian, do you still think you have the chance to kill me?\"</p><br/><p>Tang turned back and looked at the scholar, earnestly asking, \"What's your opinion, Mr. First?\"</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother shook his head and honestly said, \"This has nothing to do with our Academy. I am just following my master's order and have come to the Wilderness and I'll take my Youngest Brother back to Chang'an since it's on the way.\"</p><br/><p>An honest man did not necessarily speak honestly. Anyway, the Wilderness he had reached to take Ning Que back was not on his way.</p><br/><p>Tang nodded.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the Eldest Brother pointed at the Snow-capped Peak, and said, \"I am just passing by, but I don't know what that man will think.\"</p><br/><p>A sword style attacked from above the Snow-capped Peak, and reached them across all the ice and through the snow in an instant.</p><br/><p>After a moment, a lonely man with a wooden sword, who was no longer proud, appeared on the snow cliff far in the distance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

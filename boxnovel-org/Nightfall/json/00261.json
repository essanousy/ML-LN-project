Neither the dense forests nor the cold wind could slow down the movements of the red shadow.</p><br/><p>Ning Que and Mo Shanshan rushed down the meadow towards the other end of the lake. Although they ran really fast, they were still too slow to catch up with the Grand Cultivator in the Knowing Destiny State. The shadow of the Tao Addict, Ye Hongyu, had already floated out from the forests and fallen on the wetlands at the south shore of the lake the moment they got the north shore.</p><br/><p>There was no threat of dialogues or negotiations. The Tao Addict looked at the two people on the other side of the lake, indifferently raising her right arm and pointing out his index finger in the air with a very light and slow breath of aura.</p><br/><p>The Qi of Heaven and Earth above the slightly swinging lake suddenly fluctuated as if an invisible sword had abruptly cut off the beautiful lake and the surrounding mountains. After a loud noise, the green and turquoise water tumbled and flew to both sides with rolling white waves, forming a deep gully, which was about several-feet-long and seemed to directly be in the bottom of the lake.</p><br/><p>The deep gully that seemed to have been cut open by an invisible giant sword originated from the slim fingertips of the Tao Addict, tearing the wetlands on the southern bank of the Daming Lake, the aquatic plants and fish in the lake, and the lake water without any formidable condition. Like a straight line, it pierced directly to Ning Que and Mo Shanshan on the northern bank of the lake.</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt the horrible aura coming from afar, knowing that he could not find a suitable shelter at the moment even if he had turned into a rabbit. Therefore, he stopped and turned around without thinking too much and got ready to shoot a Talisman Arrow.</p><br/><p>The iron bow was pulled with s strong power. The bowstring was as tight as his mood at this time. But he did not release the string as there was an invisible sword between him and the Tao Addict in a red robe. The aura of heaven and earth experienced a turmoil in that space, which caused an intense flow of air and even gave the light a strange refraction.</p><br/><p>He could not aim at the Tao Addict.</p><br/><p>However, that invisible sword had torn the lake and the grasslands at the northern shore, approaching Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Ning Que loosed the bow to let go of the arrow and held the big black umbrella behind him.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan had been standing beside Ning Que and silently watching the girl on the side of the lake. As the Calligraphy Addict, who was as famous as the Tao Addict, she definitely had a wired feeling as her counterpart had broken the realm of the Knowing Destiny State.</p><br/><p>Maybe she wanted to get rid of the strange feeling in her heart or for some other reasons, she did not escape when she was facing the invisible Taoist Sword coming from the other side of the lake. Instead, she quietly came forward and began to write in the soft wind along the shore with her right hand, which was as white as a jade.</p><br/><p>Two lines of very unhealthy flushes appeared on her face. Her slender fingers writing in the slightly cold wind shivered slightly. A powerful invisible talisman was born in the wind with a few lines drawn by her fingertips.</p><br/><p>She knew both her original state and strength were worse than the Tao Addict. Now as the Tao Addict had entered the Knowing Destiny State, she did not hesitate to play one of her most powerful methods at this moment, Half Divine Talisman.</p><br/><p>The lines in the wind shrilled, and then instantaneously collapsed into numerous extremely fragmented fragments. The talisman force of her fingertips abruptly compressed and turned into a transparent air mass in a second.</p><br/><p>The transparent air mass and the invisible Taoist Sword encountered at the northern shore of the Daming Lake, suddenly creating numerous extraordinarily fine turbulence as catkins in the air.</p><br/><p>The next moment all these catkins exploded and the Taoist force and talisman force, which was contained the compressed together, violently erupted around the clear lake. The lake surface suddenly startled as if the water had jumped into the air!</p><br/><p>With a loud deafening noise, a large amount of the lake water jumped up and splashed among the green valleys. The ice, which was getting firmed, at the heart of the lake was shaken into pieces.</p><br/><p>Responding rather quickly, Ning Que loosed the black umbrella, lifting the bow again, and shot another arrow with the fastest speed to the opposite side of the lake at the moment when the lake collapsed.</p><br/><p>The air was full of thin ice and Qi of Heaven and Earth. However, it seemed that Ye Hongyu was able to see everything across the lake. She waved when he had just raised his bow. The thin ice, which had just collapsed into the air, instantly filled the space between the two people as if they had received an order.</p><br/><p>Those ice cubes seemed to be more fragile when they faced the iron arrow with the talisman force. The powerful and terrifying Primordial Thirteen Arrow approached the Tao Addict after piercing all the ice like a thunderlight with crackling sounds.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu quietly watched the man on the northern bank of the lake and did not escape.</p><br/><p>The Talisman Arrow flew through her previously wounded shoulders, very close and even blowing the pieces of her broken red robe off. But it failed to hurt her. It flew into the jungle with countless sounds of booming. Many green trees were shot down by this arrow.</p><br/><p>At this point, the water cut broken by the invisible Taoist Sword flew back and filled the deep gully with scattered ice floating on the surface like wild duckweed.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu flew up with the wind and elegantly fell on a piece of thin ice, standing.</p><br/><p>She was already a Grand Cultivator who had entered the Knowing Destiny State at this time. However, she was still not confident enough to avoid the Primordial Thirteen Arrows of Ning Que across the lake. So she did not evade at all but opted to disrupt the trajectory of the arrow. The speed of the Primordial Thirteen Arrows was really scary, which could not be changed by merely a piece of thin ice. However, there would always be some kind of interference and there were dozens and even hundreds of pieces.</p><br/><p>The Taoist bun combed with her black hair did not move in the wind, making her look more delicate and bright. Standing on the thin ice, she calmly looked at the other side of the lake with a very light and emotionless smile in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan, who looked slightly pale, stared at the woman on the thin ice without saying a word. Her right hand hanging out the sleeves slightly shivered and she felt slightly sweet in her throat. She thought with a bit confusion and unwillingness, \"Is the Knowing Destiny State so powerful?\"</p><br/><p>Silently looking at the girl in a red robe on the thin ice, Ning Que severely clenched his fist, not out of reluctance, but to ease the pain of the torn shoulder and quickly let his right-hand stop tremble.</p><br/><p>This was the first time for him to meet the legendary Tao Addict and feel her power, which was not only the strength of the state but also the incredibly precise and accurate degree of control over the Taoists Law.</p><br/><p>It appeared to be easy to change the trajectory of the Primordial Thirteen Arrows with hundreds of pieces of thin ice. However, it was actually very difficult to achieve. The angle between the thin ice and the arrow bunch in the air must be extremely accurate before tiny differences could be made into an infinite superposition. It was hard to control a piece of thin ice, let alone controlling hundreds of pieces of ice at the same time in such a short period. What kind of accurate controlling ability did one need to do so? How could she do it?</p><br/><p>There were still ups and downs of water in the lake. Ye Hongyu, standing on the thin ice, also gently went up and down. She calmly looked at Mo Shanshan and said, \"The Half Divine Talisman cannot be neglected. You have made a lot of progress and can be my opponent now. If you can become an actual Divine Talisman Master in the Knowing Destiny State, you may beat me one day. However, it will still take many years for you to get there.\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan bowed and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu then looked at Ning Que and mocked him, \"Are you Ning Que? I know you are the weakest World Wayfarer in the world, but I really never expect that you will be as weak as this. You embarrass the Academy.\"</p><br/><p>If others mocked Sangsang, Ning Que might be very angry and would immediately jump up to greet his or her ancestors. However, he felt nothing when he was mocked by others. Looking at the girl on the lake, he laughed and said, \"Do not say that, I let you bleed.\"</p><br/><p>He did not raise his iron bow to aim at the girl as it had been proved in the previous battle that the Primordial Thirteen Arrows were not able to kill a Grand Cultivator in the Knowing Destiny State. He would not do anything he was not sure about. At this time, since the Tao Addict would like to talk with them, he certainly desired to speak with her.</p><br/><p>According to his judgment, the Tao Addict seemed to have a good grasp of killing him and Mo Shanshan together.</p><br/><p>But as they were enemies, they used harsh words towards each other. His words would be connected with the love affairs between men and women if he was talking while eating and drinking. However, both the Tao Addict and the of Addict lived in the mountains of the cloud for their entire lives. They could not get the sexual indication of his words. As a result, they did not make any response at all, which let Ning Que down.</p><br/><p>He went on asking, \"Can I ask you a question?\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu calmly looked at him without any emotions in her eye as a bobcat looked at a bamboo mouse. She did not have the intention to disdain or play with him as it was meaningless. She peacefully waited and softly whispered, \"What?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \"Did Prince Long Qing die?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>\"Very good, since I cannot kill him, then you cannot kill me.\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the Tao Addict above the lake, Ning Que said sincerely, \"I admit that I am indeed the weakest World Wayfarer in history. I admit that it is a shame for the Academy and my teacher that I cannot beat. But I want to remind you that if you kill me, they will be more embarrassed. At that time, none can help you.\"</p><br/><p>It was a very boring means that he once again relied on the Academy and the Headmaster of Academy. However, judging from what happened in the Wilderness palace and countless stories recorded in the annals of history had proved that this was the most effective means.</p><br/><p>Only the next moment he found that this method did not work on the Tao Addict.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu eyes gradually grew bright and said seriously with her eyes focusing on him, \"Of course I know you are the core disciple of the Headmaster of Academy, so it is more interesting to kill you.\"</p><br/><p>While her voice and eyesight were calm, Ning Que felt extremely cold as he found a strong sense of madness and excitement hidden in this calmness.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at Ning Que, who took on a solemn look. She stroked her chest, no longer suppressing the excitement, and said, \"I have always been wanting to kill someone from the Second floor of the Academy, but I cannot find a reason. Today I am so happy that you give me a reason as you destroyed Long Qing.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt dry in his mouth. He frowned and asked, \"Don't you fear to start a war with the Divine Hall and the Academy?\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \"It is my greatest wish to fight a real strongman from the Second floor of the Academy since my cultivation.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not know what to say but to look at her. He was finally convinced that the Tao Addict was really a crazy monster, who even scared Chen Pipi and let him form an idea of perverted men and women.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at the two people at the shore of the lake and smiled, charming and pure, and sincerely said, \"I am very happy to have a chance like this. So to express my thanks to you, I decide to... kill you by myself.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Any one of them was comparable to the white horse Chanyu of Left King\u2019s Palace had gifted to Flower Addict back then. One could imagine how luxurious the chariot was just by the eight horses pulling it.</p><br/><p>But actually, the chariot was very shabby. Holes on both sides were covered with a few withered wooden planks and embroidered pads on the chariot had long rotted away. The chariot appeared as if it had been picked out of the garbage.</p><br/><p>However, that wasn\u2019t the main point. The main point was a donkey on the chariot. The donkey was not large and was entirely black except for a white patch around its mouth. It laid lazily on the chariot, four hooves pointing up at the sky like wooden sticks.</p><br/><p>There was a basket of unidentifiable orange fruit on the chariot. The black donkey was chewing on one and judging by the crunching \u2013 the fruit was probably really juicy.</p><br/><p>It was already very shocking that there were thousands \u2013 or even more \u2013 wild horses in the desolate swamp. However, the fact that a donkey was leading the team was even more so. Anyone having seen it would think that the donkey, sitting like a human on the chariot and lazily eating fruits, was a monster.</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew that the black donkey was not a monster because he was used to such behaviours at the back of the Academy\u2019s mountain. Whether the old yellow bull, the white goose or his own Big Black Horse \u2013 they were all like that. If that black donkey on the chariot were a monster, then it could be said that he had lived with such monsters for many years.</p><br/><p>He had already guessed where the black donkey was from at first glance.</p><br/><p>At the back of the mountain of the Academy, at the top floor of the House of Red Sleeves, at the bottom of Daming Lake \u2013 from Second Brother, Aunt Jian and many other people \u2013 he would hear stories about Youngest Uncle. And a black donkey would always be mentioned in those stories.</p><br/><p>Having heard those stories, Ning Que was familiar with it. Even though he had never seen the black donkey, it had always held a place in his heart. He did not feel any fear towards it, only agitation. He leapt off the horse carriage and rushed towards the rundown chariot.</p><br/><p>When he reached the chariot, Ning Que noticed that the black donkey\u2019s fur was not smooth and was even balding in some areas. He could not help but feel sad.</p><br/><p>A few decades ago, Youngest Uncle had left the Academy on a little black donkey. He entered Chang\u2019an and then traveled the world on that donkey. He had been to Lanke Temple and Front Gate of Devil\u2019s Doctrine in the Wilderness. The black donkey had been present and witnessed as legends of the cultivation world played out. Decades since then, the donkey had miraculously survived, but it had become old.</p><br/><p>It was no longer a little black donkey but an old black donkey.</p><br/><p>Several strong wild horses circled around from behind the chariot and stopped in front of Ning Que, blocking his view.</p><br/><p>Ning Que jumped up and waved his hand at the chariot, shouting, \u201cI\u2019m from the Academy! I\u2019m from the Academy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old black donkey was leaning against the chariot\u2019s back and chewing on a delicious fruit. It looked lazy and unbothered.</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought to himself, that even if the donkey did understand him, it wouldn\u2019t believe that he was from the Academy just because he said so. He felt a little dumb.</p><br/><p>Convinced what he had to do, the crystal-like liquid suspended deep in his body began to churn. Extremely pure Great Spirit flowed into his arm and then dispersed into the air along his fingers.</p><br/><p>A strong aura appeared by the rundown chariot.</p><br/><p>The black donkey continued chewing on fruit, not concerned with Ning Que. It thought to itself sarcastically, that had it not discovered that Ning Que was a disciple of the Academy, would it expend effort on saving him? Ning Que was behaving like an idiot \u2013 using the Great Spirit to perform. It was such an embarrassment \u2013 it seemed like the Academy was going downhill.</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not understand why the black donkey did not react. But he understood the ridicule in its expression. He lamented that it was indeed Youngest Uncle\u2019s donkey, for it was extremely prideful.</p><br/><p>Big Black Horse stared at the broken chariot with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>It knew about the black donkey after spending a long time at the mountains behind the Academy with the old yellow bull and others. Judging by Ning Que\u2019s expression, it guessed that the donkey before them was the one. As such, it was very shocked. It felt uneasy and afraid. After much consideration, it mustered the courage to walk over.</p><br/><p>The eight wild horses watched as Big Black Horse approached with a bowed head and felt that it looked too sneaky. They neighed solemnly, issuing a warning.</p><br/><p>Big Black Horse was frightened by the solemn neigh and its legs turned into jelly. It almost keeled over.</p><br/><p>The black donkey didn\u2019t care for Ning Que but was evidently interested in Big Black Horse. It called out twice, signaling to the eight horses that Big Black Horse was its nephew and to allow it to pass.</p><br/><p>Big Black Horse trembled and moved with great difficulty towards the donkey. It popped its head into the chariot respectfully and carefully rubbed its head against the black donkey\u2019s round belly before licking it.</p><br/><p>It had been bullied by the goose called Wooden Fish at the back mountain of the Academy. It thought to itself that the goose was only its Senior Brother, while the donkey was its Uncle, who might try to keep it in line. It had better get into the donkey\u2019s good books.</p><br/><p>The black donkey snorted twice, seemingly satisfied and comfortable. Then, it patted the basket beside it with its front hooves, somewhat clumsily, signaling for Big Black Horse to help itself, just like how an elder would dispense snacks to children.</p><br/><p>Big Black Horse understood and was extremely happy. However, it didn\u2019t dare to take too much and only picked one up with its mouth. Then, it bowed its head several times in a show of respect and gratitude, and shook its butt at the eight horses as a gesture of goodwill. Then, it strutted away and returned to the carriage to partake in the delicious snack.</p><br/><p>The black donkey could not help but shake its head as it watched the dumb and shameless behavior. It snorted lightly, as if it was sighing. Then, it looked at Ning Que and thought of how he had fought stupidly and shamelessly with the girl in the swamp, and shook its head once more. It snorted lightly as if it was disappointed.</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt rather awkward, thinking that he and Big Black Horse were well-matched partners. However, when compared to Youngest Uncle and the little black donkey, they were rather lacking in both disposition and power \u2013 it was quite embarrassing.</p><br/><p>The black donkey squawked twice and the eight horses in front of the chariot looked up, ready to leave.</p><br/><p>Just as Ning Que was about to speak, black crows stopped on the horse carriage could bear no longer and began squawking happily.</p><br/><p>The black donkey grew furious. It thought to itself \u2013 it did not matter whether they were crows formed by Yama or Haotian \u2013 they were too disrespectful to squawk like it! It squawked angrily in response.</p><br/><p>The black crows did not truly exist. Ning Que could kill them neither with arrows nor talismans. But when they heard the black donkey squawk, they immediately felt dizzy, fearful and did not dare make another sound.</p><br/><p>Ning Que followed beside the chariot as it began to move. He yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for us to meet! At least say something. I could be considered Youngest Uncle\u2019s disciple and I\u2019m the only one who knows about the Great Spirit. Accordingly, his legacy belongs to me. If you continue like this, I won\u2019t show you any politeness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black donkey bared its belly and looked at the sky, looking bored and ignoring Ning Que completely.</p><br/><p>Being ignored was one of the greatest humiliations one could endure.</p><br/><p>Ning Que grew more and more embarrassed and asked, \u201cHow can I find you in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black donkey did not react.</p><br/><p>Ning Que continued, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to return to the Academy? Headmaster and the old yellow bull are still alive. Eldest Brother and Second Brother are no longer kids. I\u2019m sure they miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black donkey looked hesitant. It turned to Ning Que and after a moment of silence, its lips parted to reveal a mouthful of white teeth as though it were grinning. Then, it bellowed once, moved its front left hoof back and pointed its right towards the north.</p><br/><p>The wild herd resting on the meadow looked up without hesitation when they heard the donkey\u2019s call. They abandoned the first mouthful of tender grass they had encountered in more than ten days, gathered into groups and started running.</p><br/><p>Smoke and dust rose. The hooves of horses were as loud as thunder. Wild horses dominated the Wilderness as they began to move at high speed. Surprisingly, there was no confusion, only a great deal of discipline \u2013 just like an army.</p><br/><p>Earlier, Ning Que had found black donkey\u2019s action of folding a hoof and extending the other rather funny. However, when he witnessed the shocking scene of thousands of horses running, he suddenly felt that the black donkey was like a powerful general, extending its right arm and directing its army towards their conquest.</p><br/><p>Wild horses rushed off and dust gradually settled. Ning Que stood on the meadow silently, looking at the black dots in the distance and at that broken chariot.</p><br/><p>After a long while, he muttered to himself, \u201cI\u2019m never going to eat barbequed donkey meat again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que vaguely understood that the black donkey was the team leader of those wild horses. It had led tens of thousands of wild horses through the swamp and the northern Wilderness, to chase after water and grass.</p><br/><p>Places that herdsmen and cavalry cannot reach belonged to them. The true path of legend that herdsmen spoke of might have been made by the wild horses over the past decades, as they stepped through the quagmire.</p><br/><p>As for the battle between Ye Hongyu and himself, just as they were about to decide the victor and just as he was likely about to die, the black donkey had led its team by\u2026 There were no coincidences in this world. The black donkey had the intention of saving him and had brought him away from the swamp.</p><br/><p><em>\u201cBut why was it a chariot pulled by eight horses? Why was it so specific?\u201d</em></p><br/><p>He looked at the herd, moving like a shadow and asked subconsciously.</p><br/><p>Sangsang peered out of the window and looked at the herd in the distance, and at the dust billowing behind them. She asked, \u201cCould it be that Youngest Uncle and Headmaster liked to use the \u2018Eight Horses\u2019 in their drinking games?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que got in the horse carriage and turned to look at the wild herd, moving farther and farther away. He thought to himself that Youngest Uncle had spent his life pursuing freedom. The life that the black donkey was leading was dream coming true, so why would he have to feel sad for it?</p><br/><p>Under the boundless sky, on the vast plain, when wind blows and grass bends, cows and sheep could be seen.</p><br/><p>It was spring and the grass had not yet grown tall. As the breeze would go by, the green grass would bend slightly and spring back up again. Even when the grass stood tall, it could not hide the sheep which were scattered in the meadow like clouds.</p><br/><p>The black horse carriage left Yuelun and crossed the swamp before reaching the Wilderness where Golden Palace was based.</p><br/><p>Golden Palace was a nation, almost forgotten by the countries in Central Plains \u2013 except for the Tangs.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was in the army of the City of Wei. He was part of the northern border army of the Tang Empire. Having gathered firewood at Shubi Lake for many years, he was very familiar with Golden Palace and this part of the Wilderness.</p><br/><p>Black horse carriage traveled through the unpopulated meadows silently.</p><br/><p>Like a black cloud.</p>\n</div>"}

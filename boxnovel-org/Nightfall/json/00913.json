Racking her brains to God\u2019s Plan, she was best at mathematical inferencing and had difficulties dealing with the trivial matters of daily life.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t mean that she was actually slow. As long as she was willing to put her mind to it, she could reason out the abominable truth hidden in Ning Que\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was very clear about this, so he continued to say before she reasoned out, \u201cIt\u2019s even more ridiculous that you named me as the monarch of the Great River Kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang asked, \u201cWhy is it ridiculous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic. Even if the Great River Kingdom were to not dare to oppose your will under the pressure of fearing the Divine Hall of West-Hill, we have to return to Chang\u2019an one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said without any expressions, \u201cWhen did I say I want to go to Chang\u2019an?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que sighed in his mind and then said, \u201cBut we can\u2019t stay in Great River Kingdom forever.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be the monarch, then just give the throne away when you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought about it and said, \u201cThat will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>God knew how many bloody conflicts were caused by the throne of a country in the human world. However, for Sangsang and Ning Que, the throne was no different than a toy. Ning Que said that all the things on earth were trivial in Sangsang\u2019s eyes, and he was right from this point of view.</p><br/><p>Strolling out of the palace, they were getting farther away from the flower trees. Sangsang looked at the lonely flower tree in the corner of the Imperial City and said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see this tree cut off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew that she was explaining why she had helped him break down the Splash-Ink that was casted by the Sage of Calligraphy, but he couldn\u2019t help but smile. She was just as unyielding and sensitive as before even after becoming Haotian.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to discuss the issue further and force Sang Sang to say that she cared about him, which might make Sangsang turn shame into anger. Therefore, he changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw you put a cloud on the branch on the way here and I found it amazing, but what Sage of Calligraphy did was even more magical.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Calligraphy Wang now. Besides, the clouds he collected are dirty.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYou can guarantee that the clouds you collected are clean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll my clouds are coming from the middle of the Storm Sea of the Song Kingdom thousands of miles away. There are no human traces or dust pollution, so it\u2019s absolutely clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s so low-carbon and environmentally friendly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say any word from your world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, they walked out of the palace and came to the royal road covered with red leaves. The big black horse looked down and sniffed the faint smell in the maple leaves. Looking into the distance, Ning Que suddenly did not know where to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere should we go?\u201d Ning Que looked at Sangsang and asked.</p><br/><p>Sangsang answered, \u201cMogan Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que went silent for a moment and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Sangsang stared at him quietly and then said, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered without thinking, \u201cIndeed I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Staring at his eyes, Sangsang said, \u201cI know what you are thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThen I\u2019ve got nothing to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Mogan Mountain was verdant and beautiful, just a few miles away from Jingdu. Ning Que and Sangsang saw the lake on the mountainside at sunset.</p><br/><p>The cottage on the shore of the lake was decorated with lanterns and colored hangings to welcome the upcoming wedding. It seemed to be quite lively, but no sound could be heard. The Ink Fountain was very quiet, and even the lotuses floating on the lake found the situation odd and faced to the cottage curiously.</p><br/><p>Ning Que and Sangsang walked toward there but didn\u2019t see any guests or disciples along the way. Ning Que sensed the situation to be a little weird.</p><br/><p>Approaching the gate of the cottage, he pushed the door open, and several lights of sword flied at him.</p><br/><p>The sword\u2019s will was fierce and decisive. It was the famous Windward Chop of Black Ink Garden!</p><br/><p>Facing the fierce lights of sword, Ning Que kept calm and said, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The lights of sword were restrained immediately, and the three slender Xiu Swords stopped in front of his eyebrows. Seeing Ning Que, the women who held the swords were surprised and cried out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Que!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Thirteen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Ning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only the three women who held the swords, but at least a dozen disciples of Black Ink Garden recognized him and cried out surprisedly. They called him by different names due to their old habits.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was very familiar with the female disciples of the Black Ink Garden since they had journeyed together to the Wilderness and fought against mounted gangsters and the Yuelun Kingdom in the past. Although they haven\u2019t seen each other in a long time, their friendships remained the same as before.</p><br/><p>Ning Que walked into the cottage in smile and saw Mo Shanshan.</p><br/><p>She wore a cotton white dress, standing next to a fine yellow horse with a bag on its back. It seemed like she was ready for a long journey instead of a wedding.</p><br/><p>Looking at her, Ning Que had mixed feelings and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>The big black horse Ning Que was holding was much more direct. Looking at its former mistress, the horse opened the thick lips and revealed the big white teeth, whinnying cheerily toward her.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Ever since the Sage of Calligraphy had agreed to marry Mo Shanshan to the monarch, the disciples of Black Ink Garden had been worried, many of which had expected Ning Que to come here. They were pleasantly surprised when he actually did.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ning Que, Cat Girl was even more surprised. Ning Que did have a heart, and all the snacks I gave him by the Thin Blue Rognon Sea were not a waste after all. She rushed over to him with silvery laughters.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, her arm was grasped by Zhuo Zhihua.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Zhihua grasped Cat Girl\u2019s arm tightly, and even her knuckles turned pale. She seemed so frightened that her face turned pale too.</p><br/><p>She saw the woman in light cyan walking behind Ning Que.</p><br/><p>The woman in light cyan was very tall and a little fat, with a plain face. Standing there with her hands behind her back, she seemed to be as high as the sky.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Zhihua was sure that she had never seen the woman before, but she guessed who the mysterious woman was. Thus her mind was instantly occupied by fear and her hands were all sweaty.</p><br/><p>The big black horse suddenly woke up and was too afraid to whinny again. He sent his apologies to Mo Shanshan by winking and then hurriedly retreated behind Sansang obediently.</p><br/><p>With her hands behind her back, Sangsang looked at the cottage of the Black Ink Garden, revealing no emotions on her face.</p><br/><p>Looking at the tall figure of the woman in light cyan, the disciples of Black Ink Garden all turned pale.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Mo Shanshan had a hint of joy in her eyes which were as clear as the lake the moment she saw Ning Que, but the joy suddenly turned into bitterness and disappointment after seeing Sangsang.</p><br/><p>Walking to Sangsang, she lifted her white dress gently and kneeled down slowly.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the disciples of Black Ink Garden confirmed their speculations and knew who Sangsang really was. So they all went forward and kneeled down before her silently.</p><br/><p>Looking at the brush pens hanging between the beams of the cottage, Sangsang felt that they were not as attractive as the cured meat hanging on the beams of the farmhouses in Yanbei villages she saw last year. It took her a while to realize that the disciples of Black Ink Garden were kneeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d she said.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan and the disciples got up and stood still quietly.</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at her pale cheeks and asked, \u201cDo you fear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan said, \u201cRespect, not fear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cThen why are you so pale?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan said, \u201cI\u2019ve always had a white face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sang Sang thought about it. When we met in Chang\u2019an, she was indeed very white and I was the one who had dark skin. Actually I\u2019m only becoming a little whiter recently.</p><br/><p>Staring at her face, Sangsang said with an unpleasant voice, \u201cYour face is not as round as before.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Mo Shanshan didn\u2019t understand her dismay, but answered, \u201cOccupied by mundane affairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang asked, \u201cYour engagement has been canceled. What else could bother you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the disciples of the Black Ink Garden were pleasantly surprised first and then a bit stunned, for they were confused why Sangsang did them such a favor.</p><br/><p>Staring at Sangsang\u2019s eyes quietly, Mo Shanshan was very grateful but didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>As Calligraphy Fanatic, the youngest Divine Talisman master in the human world and sworn sister of Mr. First of the Academy, the one thing that bothered Mo Shanshan had to do with romance.</p><br/><p>Sangsang said suddenly, \u201cIt appeared that you didn\u2019t fear me at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan still kept quiet.</p><br/><p>As a follower of Haotian, Mo Shanshan had the courage to stand before her, stared at her calmly and did not even take a step back, but it didn\u2019t mean that she would utter impertinent remarks to Sangsang.</p><br/><p>She knew for sure that Haotian could understand what she was thinking.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve asked this world what is the love on earth that binds the lovers up in life and death? I don\u2019t care about life and death, let alone fear.</p><br/><p>Sangsang understood what she was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI admire you.\u201d Looking at Mo Shanshan, she continued to say, \u201cBut not your teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody understood what she meant expect for Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cHumans who dare to contend with me are much more fun, such as the Headmaster of the Academy, Liu Bai, Maniac Ke, and you. Although you are not as powerful as those three people, you are indeed their equal in terms of courage. However, I don\u2019t really understand where you find the courage.\u201d</p><br/><p>If contending with Haotian was rebelling against the Heaven, then Mo Shanshan was definitely doing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my memories of the human world, he was really good to me. I offered him immortality, but he refused. It\u2019s none of my business that he wants to suffer in the human world and how he plans to deal with his relationship with you.\u201d Sangsang continued to say, \u201cI\u2019m Haotian, and you are a human being. The things that concern us are naturally different. Your courage shall fall upon him, not me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan stared at the tips of her shoes and remained silent.</p><br/><p>Being forgotten for quite a while, Ning Que couldn\u2019t help but say helplessly, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you ask for my opinion first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour opinion never matters,\u201d Sangsang said emotionlessly and walked out of the cottage with hands behind her back.</p><br/><p>The Ink Fountain in the twilight seemed to be burning and the lotuses were like elves in the fire. It looked beautiful. Sangsang sat by the lake and looked at the lake quietly.</p><br/><p>She seemed to be as high as the sky a few moments ago, but at this moment, she looked lonely.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

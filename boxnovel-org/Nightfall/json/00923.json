Although it was not as good as that of the palace of South Jin Kingdom, which could keep the stairs dry during rainstorms, the continuous spring rains these days did not leave too many traces here. It proved that the followers, under the leadership of Ye Su, had been rewarded for their efforts.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Sangsang walked through the streets with her hands behind her back, and Tang Xiaotang followed her, with her black braid swaying in the spring breeze, which resembled her disturbed mood at this time.</p><br/><p>Sangsang was indeed her best friend. However, with Sangsang now being Haotian and she belonging to the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, it seemed impossible for them to continue their friendship. She wondered why had Sangsang taken her out?</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang felt strange that Sangsang who used to be black and thin became so white and chubby, and she was also not used to the silence along the way. So she gently kicked the stone on the street to ease her tension.</p><br/><p>Walking up to the front of a vegetable store, Sangsang suddenly stopped and said, \u201cHe is now a basket case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang froze for a while, then realized she was talking about Chen Pipi. \u201cYou locked up his Ocean of Qi and Mountain of Snow. He is weak and likes to stay in bed. Of course you can call him a basket case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walking into the store, Sangsang looked at the normal vegetables on the shelf and said, \u201cI left Peach Mountain. The Divine Hall must have begun to chase you.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang said, \u201cYes. We can\u2019t get through Qinghe without the Divine Hall knowing, otherwise we have already returned to Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang stopped and turned to her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang was puzzled and asked, \u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cEverything is determined by destiny. Why do you have to go to Peach Mountain to save him? Why do you accompany him to wander around? If you are willing to surrender to me, I will grant you eternity.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a very inconspicuous vegetable store in Linkang City suffusing with the smell of vegetables and mud, she calmly said that she would grant Tang Xiaotang eternity.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang was stunned for quite a while, and then said unnaturally, \u201cThis is a surprise for me\u2026Why don\u2019t we buy the ingredients for dinner first?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the woman who owned the vegetable store recognized Tang Xiaotang and greeted her warmly and humbly. The woman put everything that Tang Xiaotang was looking at into her basket.</p><br/><p>Sangsang was confused, pointed to the basket, and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t we need to pay for that?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang, Chen Pipi and Ye Su had lived together these days. Ye Su normally would teach the children in the street some courses. Thus, for the people living on this street, Ye Su was no different from a sage even though he lived in a decrepit house. They respected and adored Ye Su, and naturally gave Tang Xiaotang and Chen Pipi the same treatment.</p><br/><p>The woman thought that Sangsang was an ordinary friend of Tang Xiaotang. She patted her shoulder intimately and said with a smile, \u201cWhy are you regarding me as an outsider? How could I let you pay for these worthless vegetables?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang frowned, for she noticed that the woman had just touched the vegetables and had some muddy water on her hand.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang quickly pulled the woman to the side and asked her to take care of her store with a smile. Then she looked at Sangsang and said nervously, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand. I thought that the poorer the people are, the more they value money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Remembering that Sangsang was very mean when she was still a human being, Tang Xiaotang couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cSometimes people just like something so much that they use things that they value the most to express their kindness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang thought about it and asked, \u201cLike how the followers of Taoism devote their wealth and life to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang answered, \u201cMore or less. But\u2026there is still a difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang thought for a while and said, \u201cAdore and respect?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Sangsang suddenly felt a little displeased, and then she found that she actually began to care about whether or not she was liked by others. Then she became even more displeased.</p><br/><p>The basket was stuffed with green vegetables. Tang Xiaotang offered to pay, but the woman rejected her firmly.</p><br/><p>Walking out of the store, Sangsang said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang reached out to hold Sangsang\u2019s hand, looked at her with sympathy and said, \u201cAfter visiting so many places with Ning Que, you haven\u2019t figured it out yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang answered, \u201cThat\u2019s different. If he were to die, then I will die too. I have to follow him around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang smiled and responded, \u201cIn fact, that\u2019s not different at all. If Chen Pipi were to die, then I wouldn\u2019t want to live by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang thought for a while and said, \u201cHumans are indeed stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang said, \u201cBut sometimes we\u2019re happy being stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at her hand and said, \u201cI am not happy that you sympathize with me, and I am also not happy that you touch my body. I don\u2019t understand why you are happy for being stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang answered with a smile, \u201cIt is not a good thing for the Academy and Light\u2019s Doctrine that you are still alive, but I am still very happy seeing you alive. Maybe this is the pleasure of being stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The two girls went out to buy food and talked heart to heart, leaving the three men in the decrepit house, who sat facing each other in silence. It didn\u2019t matter how they survived as long as they were still alive.</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi looked at Ning Que and asked worriedly, \u201cIs she willing to return to Chang\u2019an with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and answered, \u201cShe didn\u2019t say so, but we are getting closer to Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi asked, \u201cDoes she know about the Academy\u2019s intention?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThe Headmaster once said that Haotian knows everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi went silent for a moment and said, \u201cIf that is the case, then you have no chance of winning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the blue sky and white clouds outside the window, Ning Que said, \u201cThe Headmaster also said that there are some people in the world who would do things which they know clearly can\u2019t be achieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi said, \u201cThe Youngest Uncle and the Headmaster are exactly this kind of people. You and I may be more like them in the future, but this cannot influence her, for she is not a human.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que signed. \u201cI hope she can make her own choice.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Chen Pipi said, \u201cBut no one will make a choice that may destroy themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que laughed and said, \u201cAs you said, she is not human being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi asked, \u201cIf so, what\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was hit by mixed feelings and answered, \u201cI hope to find a solution when the time comes. The original plan I thought of now seems impractical.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi asked, \u201cIs it possible to fix the God-Stunning Array without her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cWhoever started the trouble should end it. She had lived in Chang\u2019an for many years, and her footsteps and breath had broken the God-Stunning Array. To fix the array, she must be back to Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi looked at him quietly, and then suggested, \u201cI only hope that you have no regrets when the time comes. If you have any doubts, then it is better to change your mind now, for there will be no turning back when the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cWhen I left Chang\u2019an and went to Peach Mountain to pick her up, I had already made my mind. Even though I have to choose one day, it won\u2019t be that hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi sighed, for he understood the hidden determination in his words.</p><br/><p>Ye Su kept quiet all the time and looked at the streets and the sky outside the window with a smile on his face. His pale face was covered by the sunlight and it seemed very gentle.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>All of a sudden, he said, \u201cPlay with god, you can only end up hurting yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que turned to him and asked sincerely, \u201cDo you mean that we will do nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su turned around and smiled to him. \u201cDoing well in your own business is more important than anything else. Haotian to Haotian, and Earth to Earth. Why bother meddling with things beyond our reach?\u201d</p><br/><p>Haotian to Haotian, and Earth to Earth. This was the Tao that Ye Su believed.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was somehow woken up, and then asked, \u201cThe Divine Hall of West Hill won\u2019t allow you to continue to preach, and even the Sword Garret can\u2019t protect you. What are you going to do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su said, \u201cLinkang City is getting better. I am ready to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi was surprised, for he had learned that the Elder Brother intended to leave Linkang for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are going to Chang\u2019an, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was also surprised. Since the Divine Hall won\u2019t allow him to continue to preach, Ye Su can only go to the Tang where he can be tolerated after leaving the South Jin Kingdom. \u201cLike I once said, the Tang is too good, and the world is too bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su continued to say calmly, \u201cSince I plan to experience human sufferings and save humans, I have to step foot on the soil where sufferings happen and really understand the people who are suffering.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sunlight penetrated the window and landed on him. His old shirt seemed to shine, and the chopsticks used in his Taoist bun seemed to be more beautiful than the most expensive ebony.</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly asked, \u201cDo you remember the first time we met?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Ye Su shook his head. When they first met at the foot of Tianqi Mountain in the Wilderness, Ye Su was still a proud traveling disciple of Taoism and had his eye on the position of Eldest Brother, and he had no impression of who Ning Que was.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I am very impressed with you.\u201d Ning Que looked at him and said, \u201cI have never met a person so lonely, as if your feet were not standing on the ground but on another world. Although you are clearly alive, I still felt that you were dead for many years. To be more accurate, you seemed to be alive and dead at the same time in my eyes back then, and I pitied you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su laughed and said, \u201cYou should pity me now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \u201cNo. Although you are far less powerful than you were in the past, you are not pitiful at all. I think you will become a sage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su said, \u201cThe world can only see a sage once in a millennium. You just give me too much credit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que disagreed. \u201cIf you can make everybody become sage, then you are indeed a sage.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the door was pushed open. Tang Xiaotang held the basket and shouted merrily, \u201cLook, we brought so many vegetables back. Throw away the leftovers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dinner was very simple, mainly vegetables.</p><br/><p>In order to please Haotian, Chen Pipi went to the butcher shop to buy streaky pork and braised it with Chinese cabbage. Then he went next door and brought back two buckets of light wine.</p><br/><p>Meat and wine can always liven things up. After a little while, the atmosphere in the house was lively. Ning Que was a wimpy drinker and was no longer his normal self after a few drinks. He asked for paper and ink, and then wrote the famous article, \u201cAn Epigraph for My Humble Room\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cA mountain needn\u2019t be high; it is famous so long as there is a deity on it. A lake needn\u2019t be deep; it has supernatural power so long as there is a dragon in it. My home is humble, but it enjoys the fame of virtue so long as I am living in it. \u201d</p><br/><p>With her hands behind her back, Sangsang stared at the and then asked, \u201cWho is \u201cI\u201d?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered angrily, \u201cWhy are you asking me such a philosophical issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang pointed to the word \u201cI\u201d on the paper.</p><br/><p>Ning Que then understood what she meant and pointed to Ye Su. All of a sudden, it occurred to him that Sangsang must had some expectations since she brought this up. So he pulled back his finger and answered, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am you, and you are me. Who do you think I am talking about? \u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang knew he was lying, but she seemed satisfied.</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi was very dissatisfied and said sarcastically, \u201cWhen you wrote the article, I just thought you are still shameless. After listening to your explanation, I realize that you can be worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was angry and shouted, \u201cI am always like this. Suck it up!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was time to say goodbye.</p><br/><p>Sangsang couldn\u2019t stand this kind of human custom so she stood afar with her hands behind her back.</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi looked at Ning Que and said, \u201cTake care.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered with smile and walked to Sangsang.</p><br/><p>Sangsang suddenly turned around and said to Ye Su, \u201cYou will be burned to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the sky was covered with the sunset glow which was like blood and fire.</p><br/><p>Ye Su stood in the twilight and it looked like he was standing in fire.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

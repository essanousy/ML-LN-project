He asked his father a question which he had kept in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"You said earlier that Ning Que was a proud and cold-blooded person. I think otherwise. There has been information from Chang'an city, including words from the Princess Manor saying that he is an extremely shameless person who is seemingly clear and bright. He is good at talking and is thus doted upon by the Headmaster and His Majesty. How could a person like this be called proud?\"</p><br/><p>Old Master Cui smiled and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Cui Shi laughed bitterly and continued. \"Alright, even if he has learned to be proud from the Second floor of the Academy, how could he be cold-blooded? I always thought that what he had done when he was in the military did not count. He even managed to maintain a good relationship with Ye Hongyu. From what I see, Ning Que is skilled and learned about matters of the world.\"</p><br/><p>Old Master Cui said, \"If you look at his records and listen to his stories, you would not be able to see a person clearly. That is why I wanted to see him in person. Even if it's only a glance, it would be enough.\"</p><br/><p>Cui Shi paused.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone knew that Ning Que was about to visit the Lanke Temple. However, he did not follow the diplomatic delegation. Even though he was staying in the best inn of Yangguan City, he did not have any servants. I only saw him and his notable handmaiden. I saw that he held his tea but did not drink it. I saw that he seemed to be carefree but was actually vigilant when he spoke to you. But I did not see that he liked to be quiet and peaceful.\"</p><br/><p>Old Master Cui said, \"These are habits that he had born with. It only proves that he is an extremely prudent young man and at the same time, he is a man who doesn't know what trust is. I feel that he does not completely trust anyone other than his handmaiden, not even the Headmaster.\"</p><br/><p>Cui Shi stayed silent.</p><br/><p>Old Master Cui looked at the thick curtains and thought of the young man in the inn. He sighed, \"He doesn't even trust someone like the Headmaster. This person is more than just cold. Should there be any major changes in the future, remember to have the West-Hill promise us before it occurs. They have to promise to get rid of that young man, or we might have to pay an unimaginable price.\"</p><br/><p>Two secret letters from the Qinghe County reached Chang'an city.</p><br/><p>A letter came through the Tang's secret guard system, and entered the South Gate Temple because the recipient of the letter was the Nation Master of the Tang Empire, Li Qingshan.</p><br/><p>After a moment, He Mingchi walked out of the Southern Gate Temple. He looked at the vast and distant sky and thought that it might rain later. He clasped the yellow oiled-paper umbrella under his arm tightly and boarded the horse carriage.</p><br/><p>Under the respectful lead of the steward, He Mingchi entered the depths of the Princess' Mansion. He arrived at the terrace that was quite famous in the social circles of Chang'an City and greeted Li Yu, who was calmly sitting on a futon.</p><br/><p>Li Yu frowned and waved to have the palace nanny take little Wild, who was writing calligraphy, away. Then, she gestured for He Mingchi to sit down and asked, \"There seems to be a problem.\"</p><br/><p>He Mingchi did not sit. This seemingly inconspicuous action implied that Li Yu's perceptions were not wrong. There was indeed a problem, and it was not a small one.</p><br/><p>He took out a letter from his sleeves and handed it over.</p><br/><p>Li Yu took the letter and opened it. She looked at the familiar handwriting and was startled. After reading the contents of the letter, her brows furrowed even deeper.</p><br/><p>The letter was from Ning Que to the Nation Master Li Qingshan. In the letter, he mentioned what he had seen and heard in Qinghe County. He especially mentioned how the Family Cui had used the House of Red Sleeves to probe him, as well the old steward's visit at the inn.</p><br/><p>The Dominant Families of Qinghe County were Li Yu and her brother's greatest supporters in court. If she wanted to help her younger brother ascend the throne, she would need the Academy's approval and the help of Qinghe County.</p><br/><p>Li Yu did not know the reason why Ning Que had written the letter, but she vaguely understood why the Nation Master had shown it to her. She frowned slightly and said, \"Sometimes, I do not understand what those old men do. I can only say that those things have nothing to do with me.\"</p><br/><p>He Mingchi nodded and said, \"I will bring your word to the Southern Gate Temple.\"</p><br/><p>Li Yu raised her head and looked at him quietly. Then, she asked, \"You did not have to show the letter to me. You could have brought it to the palace and showed it to my father or the Empress.\"</p><br/><p>He Mingchi smiled and said, \"This is my master's will. I am his disciple, but I do not understand. But I'm sure that our master will be delighted to hear that what happened at Qinghe County had nothing to do with Your Highness.\"</p><br/><p>The meaning behind the words was so carefully concealed, even appearing as nothing special. However, Li Yu, who was involved in the matter, could vaguely catch the implications of his words. Her eyes brightened.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for your trust, Nation Master.\"</p><br/><p>The second letter from Qinghe County arrived at the Academy.</p><br/><p>Professor Huang He looked at the characters on the letter. He smiled, and then had someone take the letter to the back of the mountain without opening it.</p><br/><p>It was the Second Brother who read the letter.</p><br/><p>He read it while the Headmaster stood nearby.</p><br/><p>Second Brother bowed to his teacher respectfully and said, \"Our Youngest Brother has spotted a problem.\"</p><br/><p>The Headmaster was completely occupied with the fish frying on the hot plate. He asked casually, \"Is it serious?\"</p><br/><p>Second Brother thought about it and said, \"There are only two in the Knowing destiny State in Qinghe County. It is not serious.\"</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \"Then, why are you bothering me? Can't you see that I'm busy?\"</p><br/><p>Second Brother was startled and he asked, \"What should we do?\"</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \"Your Youngest Brother was studying the truth of Tao enlightenment by the Daming Lake while he was cooking fish. However, he still cannot fully understand the truth of this world. Whether the fish is fried or cooked, it will end up being eaten.\"</p><br/><p>Second Brother learned from the statement and said, \"Then we shall wait for them to start the trouble.\"</p><br/><p>The Headmaster suddenly thought of something and his expression turned grave. He had forgotten to remove the bamboo ladle from the pot and its sides were singed. The fish smelled like it was starting to burn.</p><br/><p>After some time, the Headmaster laughed without restraint. He said, \"Even if the fisherman dies, it doesn't mean that fish can't be caught. If the cook dies, it doesn't mean that fish can't be fried. The beam cannot hold the broken house all the time. Someone can only jump from the beam if it breaks. Even though these two things have nothing to do with each other, troublemakers will always be troublemakers.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not know that the patriarch commented on him in such a serious and prudent tone. After Sangsang had confirmed that there was something wrong with the old steward, he had written two letters immediately and sent them to Chang'an. After that, he did not think about the matter again.</p><br/><p>He ranked last in the back of the mountain. There were the Headmaster and his powerful Senior Brothers and Sisters who could settle the problems in Qinghe County. He did not need to worry. He boarded the black horse carriage and left Yangguan City with Sangsang. Two days later, they stopped at a port.</p><br/><p>There were no inconsequential robbers trying to rob them. Neither were there any stupid officials who wanted to collect bribes. What had stopped the horse carriage was a misty, endless water.</p><br/><p>The lake before the wild in the south of the Tang Empire had an ordinary name. It was called the Great Lake. Only those who had seen it could feel the power behind the simple name. The lake was extremely big. There was no other word that could describe it other than that.</p><br/><p>Just like that yellow river further south.</p><br/><p>The Great Lake was mighty and stretched across the land for miles. Even birds would find it difficult to cross. Even the most powerful cultivator could not cross it without a boat.</p><br/><p>This was the largest lake in the world. It stretched between the two most powerful countries. When Haotian decided to make a buffer between the Tang Empire and the South Jin Kingdom, it would cause plenty of inconveniences for people in the world as well as bring forth peace to them. There would be different types of boats for goods and people to move freely between the north and south. When the mist dissipated, one could see numerous ships over the reeds, which would be majestic and beautiful.</p><br/><p>However, the black horse carriage could only wait by the Great Lake. The path to South Jin Kingdom had been sealed and many large fleets of the Tang Empire were waiting for the diplomatic delegation to arrive.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had many ways to ignore the martial law. He could just leave quietly. However, it was better to wait for the delegation than to take out his token to reveal his identity and have the fleets open a path for him, whether it was for the sake of peace or, as the Old Master Cui said, he was born to be a cold and cautious person.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the scenery at the Great Lake was mesmerizing enough and the delegation didn't spend too much time to come over. They arrived just as he was about to get bored with the autumn reeds, and sick of eating raw lake fish.</p><br/><p>On the Tang Empire's fleet, Ning Que saw the main ambassador\u2014 Xian Zhilang, who was the Defender General of the West and was famous for his powerfulness and resourcefulness\u2014 of the delegation for the first time.</p><br/><p>The head seat at the main hall of the battleship was empty. Ning Que and Xian Zhilang sat across each other because it was hard to make out who was lower in status.</p><br/><p>The Defender General of the West was not simple.</p><br/><p>This was Ning Que's first impression on Xian Zhilang.</p><br/><p>He thought that to himself as he looked at the man who looked feminine and had a disposition that was more akin to a scholar's.</p><br/><p>\"I'm on the Princess' side. To be more exact, if the Emperor leaves, I will be loyal to Prince Li Huiyuan. Do not look at me like that. This cannot remain a secret forever.\"</p><br/><p>Xian Zhilang looked at him and smiled, \"This was not a secret anymore when the Princess attempted to have me replace Xia Hou. Furthermore, I believe that since the Empress tried her best to have His Majesty put me in this delegation, she must have known about my relationship with the previous Empress.\"</p><br/><p>This was a very honest conversation. It made Ning Que think of Yangguan City and how the Master of the Family Cui had begun his speech. So he laughed and asked in a direct manner, \"I don't know anything about it.\"</p><br/><p>Xian Zhilang said, \"I was Empress Ren Xiao's manservant before she married into the palace.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \"This relationship is quite distant.\"</p><br/><p>Xian Zhilang looked at Ning Que in the eye and said, \"And I'm on good terms with Chao Xiaoshu.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \"What do you want to say?\"</p><br/><p>Xian Zhilang said, \"I want to win your favor.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \"The Academy prohibits us from interfering with court affairs. Furthermore, you are already a bigwig in the military. I don't think it is meaningful for you to win my favor.\"</p><br/><p>Xian Zhilang smiled and replied, \"The Academy prohibits students from interfering with court affairs. But that does not apply to those who have entered the human realm. If you aren't allowed to do anything, why did the Headmaster let you enter the human realm? Besides...\"</p><br/><p>He suddenly leaned forward and whispered mysteriously, \"...Xu Shi is old.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \"It seems that I have underestimated your ambitions. And you have overestimated mine. Do not forget, I am now the most unpopular person in the military of Tang Empire right now.\"</p><br/><p>Xian Zhilang smiled and said, \"But I welcome you.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

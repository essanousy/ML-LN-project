Looking at the pile of chicken bones, Ning Que remained silent for a long time.</p><br/><p>The big black horse seemed anxious. It snorted uneasily and looked back at the wooden hut.</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly turned around and led it back to the hut. He pushed the door open and entered. The room was still pitch black, without a trace of light. It was also empty, not a single occupant to be seen. Ning Que let go of the reins and walked to the window, looking out at the sea of snow.</p><br/><p>The oil lamp on the table glowed. Sangsang gazed at him silently.</p><br/><p>He still couldn\u2019t see her, but he knew that she was there, so he started talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Qing is dead.\u201d He paused and continued, \u201cI killed him\u2026 it was in North Yan. I didn\u2019t expect it to end so easily. Originally, I had planned to oust him from his position and imprison him within the Front Gate of Devil\u2019s Doctrine, so that he would never again taste freedom. Just like what Youngest Uncle did to Lian Sheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then I thought, that wasn\u2019t reasonable. He didn\u2019t actually offend me that much, except for that time when he was rude towards you and tried to threaten me with you, which ended up an empty threat. The one Lian Sheng killed was Xiaoxiao. He didn\u2019t hurt you. I had overreacted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que turned around and looked into the dark room. \u201cEver since that day by the barkless mulberry tree where I first met you, the most intense emotions that I have ever felt in my life had arose because of you. From killing grandpa at the start, and then Long Qing, not to mention that time when I first came to the City of Wei, I had fought for you quite a number of times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang was very close to him. If the barrier wasn\u2019t there, they might even hear each other\u2019s breathing. Listening to his words, her expression was still stoic, but her eyelashes were slowly descending, as if she was exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI went to the Lanke Temple and sculpted many stone statues with your image.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que retrieved a stone statue from his clothes and set it on the table by the window. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you still remember what you said in the temple that year, while you were ill. I remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at the table, where a likeness of herself was sleeping peacefully on her side. Curiosity glinted in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I went to the City of Wei first. I had assumed that it carried the most significance for you and me. You might have been there, but unfortunately I couldn\u2019t find you. Well, I killed a lot of people there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly stopped talking. After a long silence, he said, \u201d I don\u2019t wish to talk anymore. It is meaningless to cry bitterly or even to stab myself with a knife to force you out. Anyway, since I am here now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked into the void of darkness in front of him. \u201cCome out,\u201d he begged.</p><br/><p>There was no taunting provocation, or a sentimental reliving of memories, but a calm request, just like all those years ago: for her to serve him tea, for her to pour him some water, for her to settle her feet in his lap for a good massage.</p><br/><p>In the still wooden hut, a soft, barely noticeable sound could be heard, as if the thinnest paper was sliced apart by the sharpest knife, or like the most brittle of glass falling from the sky onto the ground, shattering. Then it opened.</p><br/><p>The dim light from the lamp gradually pervaded the entire space, from the faintest speck of brightness to illuminating the entire hut, casting light on the stone statue upon the table, on Ning Que\u2019s face and on herself.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at her, whom he hadn\u2019t seen since their separation ages ago. Looking at her swollen belly, her crude animal leather clothes, Ning Que felt his heart clench. He stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her, embracing her tightly.</p><br/><p>Sangsang\u2019s indifferent expression didn\u2019t change even as she allowed him to hold her. Her head was held high, seemingly in arrogance, or merely in numbness.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d she whispered.</p><br/><p>The indigo lion prowled towards them from the corner of the hut. It lowered its forelimbs and crouched, as if it was about to pounce, growling warningly.</p><br/><p>The big black horse stared at it from its imposing position above, its eyes blazing with ferocity. Its meaning was clear.</p><br/><p>The indigo lion quickly stopped growling, instead turning docile and well-behaved.</p><br/><p>Ning Que held Sangsang tightly with his head buried in her neck. His voice was muffled and incoherent, yet clear. Incoherency was the tone, but clear was the meaning, there was no trace of doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sangsang repeated coldly, \u201cRelease me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ning Que stubbornly refused.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever. No means no.\u201d</p><br/><p>The big black horse and the indigo lion exchanged a look. They moved to a corner unobtrusively and pretended to not see or hear anything.</p><br/><p>Ning Que wrapped Sangsang tighter in his arms, as if he could hold on to her forever, till the end of the world.</p><br/><p>No one knew how much time had passed, but fortunately it was not yet the end of the world when Sangsang finally lowered her head. Their cheeks touched each other, warmth spreading from that point of contact.</p><br/><p>After another period of silence, again luckily before both of them age into skeletons, Ning Que was finally sure that she would not disappear out of reach again. At last, he loosened his vice grip on her, grabbed her right hand, and led her to the bed.</p><br/><p>They held hands and sat side by side on the bed. If Sangsang put on her wedding dress right now, it would be like their first wedding night, and the room was where they were about to consummate their marriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome home with me,\u201d Ning Que said to her.</p><br/><p>Sangsang did not answer him, but neither did she extricate her hand out of his. Instead, she seemed to be spacing out while staring at the wind and snow outside.</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew that she was not actually distracted, because she was a god, and she was still here.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome home with me,\u201d he repeated.</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at him and asked expressionlessly, \u201d Which home? Your earliest home?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Ning Que was the one who couldn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Headmaster of Academy wanted to break into my world as he was motivated by his irresponsible desire for freedom. You were so persistently trying to break into my world, just because you wanted to return to that home? In fact, I have been wondering, when did you believe that breaking into my world would let you return to your hometown?\u201d Sangsang asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Que gripped her hand tighter and thought for a moment. \u201cIn fact, I had figured it out a long time ago, because there are stars all over this place, and Teacher became the moon in the end,\u201d he explained.</p><br/><p>Sangsang raised her eyebrows slightly and asked, \u201cWhat can this explain? He became a moon because you told him about it that year, on the sea. He thought the moon was beautiful. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, it\u2019s snowing.\u201d Ning Que pointed out of the window and said, \u201cThere are also stars in the sky. These are all unnecessary things\u2026 If you lived in an isolated and self-contained world, you wouldn\u2019t have the need for four seasons. But you have all of them here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour world is very much like the one I came from.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned his gaze from the window to her. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to explain it. This world is still the same one I used to know, and it can be interlinked with, or can at least be observed from yours. Imitation can only be done through observation, that\u2019s why both of them are similar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang still looked unimpressed. \u201cIt can be observed, so I know what your world is like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boundless, unrestrained world,\u201d said Ning Que.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a cold, dead world,\u201d Sangsang rebutted.</p><br/><p>The warm sun spreads life, and boundless space is waiting to be explored, so this is a vast and free world. However, most of the space is filled with extreme cold and death and silence, so it is also a cold and dead world. There is nothing wrong with their statements, because they looked at the world from different perspectives.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was silent for a long time. \u201cThe fate of human beings is ultimately determined by human beings. You need not continue shouldering this responsibility. It\u2019s too tiring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you once, I love the people, the ones that reciprocate my love. The ancestors of these people had chosen me, thus I will continue to shoulder this responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no point in this discussion.\u201d Ning Que broke off the conversation abruptly and settled his hands gently on her shoulders. \u201cYou are my wife, and you are also pregnant with our child. Please, you have to come home with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After watching him wordlessly for a while, she said, \u201cYou wish so fervently for me to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe day you boarded that colossal vessel and sailed to the Divine Kingdom on the other shore, I wanted to do something, but I failed. You should know my attitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonetheless, I had warned you that I am a collection of laws in this world. If you want to destroy this world, I cannot continue to exist.\u201d Sangsang refused to make eye contact as she said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, I was really worried, but now I\u2019m not. There is still a Haotian in the Divine Kingdom, and now that you have become a human, you will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at his face, her expression as blank as ever. \u201cHow would you prove it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que glanced at her bulging belly. \u201cIsn\u2019t this proof?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang got up and walked over to the window. She looked out into the distance, words rolling off her tongue. \u201cThe New Stream has been spreading their faith worldwide for so long, while Taoism is gradually fading away. I am becoming weaker and weaker. What does this mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>This meant that she was still Haotian.</p><br/><p>\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s because of\u2026 the pregnancy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que followed and stood behind her. \u201cPregnant women are usually weaker, as they have two lives to sustain. Do you still remember the fat aunty in the City of Wei? When she was pregnant, she couldn\u2019t even muster the strength to shout at people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you still can\u2019t prove it.\u201d Sangsang turned to face him. \u201cTherefore, I might still die.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no emotion on her face as she said this. It was calm, even indifferent, yet Ning Que could perceive the paralyzing fear and grief in the depth of her eyes.</p><br/><p>His heart ached for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am really\u2026 afraid of death,\u201d Sangsang said with a blank expression. \u201cFrom the moment I woke up in the Divine Kingdom, I was afraid I was going to die. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d She said it calmly, but her face was wet with tears.</p><br/><p>Sangsang rarely shed tears. Haotian never shed tears.</p><br/><p>Ning Que forgot how long it was since the last time he saw her cry, be it years, or decades, or even millennia.</p><br/><p>He again enveloped her in his arms and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. It\u2019s ok, I won\u2019t let you die.\u201d</p><br/><p>As before, Sangsang let him hold her, her own arms limp by her side.</p><br/><p>But this time, she leaned her head on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone wants to kill me\u2026 not only them, even you want to kill me too. Now, I am vulnerable and mortal, so I am afraid, I\u2019m afraid that even you are going to kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her face was calm, but she was still in tears, an inexplicable sadness constricting her throat. It was hard to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Ning Que held her tightly and said, \u201cIf you are really afraid, then we won\u2019t do it. We will return to another home, not the City of Wei, but Chang\u2019an. The courtyard of the Old Brush Pen Shop is still there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about your home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head. \u201cI have forgotten about it long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Home was where the heart was, where the mind was calm. Where there was peace of mind, there was home. Sangsang was his home.</p><br/><p>It was like that time, when she wanted to go to the other shore, but she couldn\u2019t return to the Divine Kingdom. Because the other shore, to her, was where he stood.</p></div>\n</div>"}

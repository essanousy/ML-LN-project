It was hard to be simply copied, but he could study and consult as his Youngest Uncle did and save himself some twists and turns.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome people cultivate by talking and living. It stinks but it\u2019s real; as long as you can live longer, you can cultivate better. I am average but I am living a long life.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow to be strong like me? First, you should learn how to compete with time\u2014one of the two powerful rules of Haotian. You should try to stay alive longer. The longer you live, the better you cultivate, and then the longer you can live. It is a cycle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cTeacher, you\u2019re just spouting rubbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cBut that is what I am doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013 Looking at his teacher\u2019s wrinkles, Ning Que said, \u201cTeacher, you are the most powerful man in the world. You can fly to the sky and live forever. Strictly speaking, you are not an ordinary person and you have been beyond all human beings. You can live a happy and peaceful life like Drunkard and Butcher. Why do you have to go against Haotian? For the sake of the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, we should be clear. If the world is simply repetitive, limited, and boring, the longer you live, the more bored you will be. Only a boundless world can bring infinite joy. I have seen many beautiful views and tasted all the delicious food in the world. I am bored living in Haotian\u2019s world. It is time for me to break the heavens and go out to see other views. I have told you that before.\u201d</p><br/><p>He added, \u201cSecond, you said I was beyond human beings and should not have the mood to look for a new world for humans, satisfying their curiosities\u2026 Many years ago, I have also wondered if I am a human being. In order to confirm it, I did one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Ning Que.</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cI ate a piece of human flesh. But I found it tasted bad. More accurately, it was disgusting. I kept spitting until my stomach was empty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIndeed, but how did it solve your problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster answered, \u201cThe old yellow bull likes eating variable platyfish and it never has beef while the Big Black Horse enjoys mutton and I believe it never wants horseflesh, either. Since the old yellow bull is a bull and the Big Black Horse is a horse, I would like to try all kinds of meat in the world except for the human flesh because I am a human.\u201d</p><br/><p>The simple but unreasonable answer was straight and unquestionable.</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cSince I am still a person and live in the world, I have to do something for humanity. We are different from the people in the Haotian Taoism, who believe they are the people of Haotian and they will eventually return to the arms of Haotian. Therefore they are doing Heaven\u2019s Way.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the black carriage had arrived at the Academy. The thermostable flowers full bloomed on the green meadow and looked beautiful. The back of the mountain could be faintly seen behind the fog.</p><br/><p>The Headmaster didn\u2019t return to the back of the mountain and the carriage kept moving forward.</p><br/><p>Ning Que took a deep breath and happily smiled.</p><br/><p>Looking at him, the Headmaster said, \u201cWhy are you so happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t explain, repeatedly waving his hand.</p><br/><p>He was happy because the Headmaster did not return to the Academy, so he didn\u2019t have to say goodbye to his brothers and sisters, which meant his most worrisome concern would not happen.</p><br/><p>The carriage ran heading to the north.</p><br/><p>The dialogue between them continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you overcome Haotian since you are already strong enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you. This world is Haotian\u2019s world and Haotian is its rules. Though the cultivators who can go beyond the Five States can make their own rules, they are still within Haotian\u2019s rules.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery flower, grass, tree, wood, smile, and thought are all in its eyes. Even the Karma can\u2019t get out. Lotus thought he could get out of the Three Realms, but in fact, he was still in them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking of this, he looked at Ning Que\u2019s waist and turned to Sangsang. He said, \u201cAs for me, I can ignore the rules, being limitless, but I can\u2019t get rid of the so-called Karma that Buddha mentioned. It is the sequence of the things happening and the sequence is the time. Time is everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, Haotian knows everything and is capable of everything. It can calculate and arrange everything that we can\u2019t predict it in advance and avoid it. This is called the unpredictable fate and the inviolable fate.</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cSince Haotian is omnipotent, why hasn\u2019t it killed you yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt tried. The thunder, rainstorm, and seaquake. I have seen all kinds of heaven\u2019s anger which are probably more than all the cultivators combined.\u201d</p><br/><p>He added, \u201cBut I ran faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he slightly waved his sleeve and the Qi of Heaven and Earth around the carriage was changed.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had sharp sense. After he entered the Knowing Destiny State, he could tell the most subtle changes. At this time, he felt the Qi had been divided into many layers, between which was an ethereal and smooth space.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis world is covered with the Qi of Heaven and Earth and it is divided. Maybe because the world is crooked, there are many crooked passages, through which people can reach a place thousands of miles away,\u201d said the Headmaster.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIs that the Limitlessness?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster answered, \u201cYes, it is. If you can enter the Limitless State, it would be harder for Haotian to kill you. The problem is, you are unable to run all the time because you will be dead tired. So you need to find some other ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you that my only advantage was having lived for a long time. Because of this, my state is so high that I can\u2019t find a predecessor to learn from. I have to grope by myself. Fortunately, I did find something to stop it from finding me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have given up this body and did not to jump out of the Three Realms, staying in the human world. I integrated myself into the world. If Haotian wants to kill me, it has to destroy the whole world. As the rule of the world, if the world is destroyed, Haotian will be devastated as well. Therefore, it has been trying everything to find me, so it can invite me to fight with it in heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a dangerous way: if it can find a piece of me, it can trace back to me. However, it is the safest way because I am everywhere. If my person doesn\u2019t show up, it will never find me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought about it for a long time and said, \u201cI still don\u2019t understand, but it sounds pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black horse carriage arrived at the Sishui River.</p><br/><p>The willows were green and the houses on the other side looked brand new.</p><br/><p>Ning Que and Sangsang sat beside the Headmaster, looking at the view and taking a rest.</p><br/><p>The story about Haotian and the Headmaster was over, but there was an important role that had never been mentioned.</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cWhat is Yama?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cThere is no Yama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was stunned. He turned to his teacher and asked, \u201cNo Yama?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster answered, \u201cI have been to many places and seen many sceneries. There is no such a place called Underworld. If there is no Underworld, there is no Yama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was confused. He said, \u201cHow could that happen? Isn\u2019t the Underworld about to invade the world? Aren\u2019t the Buddha Light Array in the Lanke Temple and the magical weapons that the Buddha left prepared for countering Yama?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cThe Buddha wanted to suppress the one who he considered as Yama. In this sense, his preparations were reasonable, but he never figured out who Yama was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que became more confused. Pointing at Sangsang who was playing with a weaved toy, he asked, \u201cShe is Yama\u2019s daughter. If there is no Yama, where did she come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster turned around and said with a smile, \u201cIdiot. Is it that you really don\u2019t understand or you just don\u2019t want to believe it?\u201d</p><br/><p>His smile was gentle and his eyes were calm. Ning Que\u2019s heart chilled and his eyelids began to tremble. His legs became weak like willow branches and were about to fall.</p><br/><p>Countless sweat drops poured out from every part of his body and drenched his black robe. The Great Spirit inside him was going to collapse because of his mood.</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt so bitter in his mouth that he could not say anything.</p><br/><p>Looking at Sangsang, the Headmaster rubbed her head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, she was the Daughter of Light before she became Yama\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Sangsang looked up at him, not knowing what he was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, she has been the Daughter of Light all the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster patted him on the shoulder and calmly said, \u201cIn other words, she is the Daughter of Haotian. She is the doppelganger of Haotian which means she is Haotian itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang heard this sentence but she failed to understand it. She was upset and her face turned paler than the cosmetic powder of the Chenjinji Cosmetics Store on her face.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s face was paler than hers. He said with a hoarse voice, trembling, \u201cBut they all said she was Yama\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cI told you many times. There is no Underworld nor Yama. If you have to find a Yama, it should be Haotian. Haotian is Yama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que put his head between his legs and said, \u201cIt\u2026 makes no sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the most simple fact, even a little kid can understand it. In fact, I should have understood it long before, but the reason is just too simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolute brightness, is equivalent to absolute darkness.\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes rested on the azure sky through the willow branches. He praised, \u201cThe great Way makes everything the most simple.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

He said, \u201cBack then, I was considered as the Divine Son of West-Hill. It seemed as if they thought well of me, but I always knew that to the old people of the West-Hill Divine Palace, the future of Haotian Taoism had been entrusted to you. Compared to you, I am nothing. And I believe that I have never existed to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This statement was very true. To the deacons and priests working under the West-Hill Divine Palace Judicial Department, and to the ordinary believers in the world, Long Qing was the most dazzling person. There were so many believers of Haotian in countless Taoist temples, but not many had heard of Chen Pipi\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>However, in the eyes of the upper-level figures who truly understood the secrets of Haotian Taoism, only Chen Pipi was qualified to represent Haotian Taoism in the future. It was because he came from the Zhishou Abbey, and had inherited the Abbey Dean\u2019s Taoists Law. He had been thought of as a rare genius since he was a child. He could only compare to the successors at the Academy or the Xuankong Temple. But after he became the Headmaster\u2019s disciple, there was no reason to compare anymore.</p><br/><p>When compared to Chen Pipi, who was born in the embrace of Haotian\u2019s grace, Long Qing seemed too ordinary no matter how genius he was. And no matter how noble his family was, they seemed common.</p><br/><p>Several years ago, Long Qing entered Chang\u2019an, hoping to enter the Second floor of the Academy. Ning Que once asked Chen Pipi about him. Back then, Long Qing was well known in the world, but Chen Pipi did not care at all. The difference between the two was too great, and it was indeed hard for Long Qing to exist in Pipi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not Ye Hongyu. I did not feel the need to watch you.\u201d Chen Pipi said to Long Qing.</p><br/><p>Long Qing said, \u201cYou are the rare genius of Haotian Taoism while I am just a Prince in the mortal world. Of course, you had no need to watch me. Furthermore, you are indeed the youngest person in the cultivation world to enter the Knowing Destiny State. But what I find confusing and funny, is that you have remained stagnant since then. Ye Hongyu has already surpassed you, and your cultivation state is lower than mine. You have an incredible lineage and experiences, and you are talented, yet in the end, you became a mediocre person. How can this be simply explained away by having a smart childhood but being mediocre in adulthood? This only proves that there is something wrong with you. A useless person who possesses plenty of talent is still useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi smiled and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Two red patches appeared on Long Qing\u2019s pale cheeks. He looked at Chen Pipi\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Even I can see that there is something wrong with your heart. Why can\u2019t the elders in Haotian Taoism see it? Why didn\u2019t the Abbey Dean see it? Why didn\u2019t the Headmaster see it? Why do you still have the right to be placed in the You Prison and be taken so seriously even though you are now useless? How can someone so useless like you has the right to become an oblation at the Light Sacrifice and become the sacrifice that Haotian wants?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi thought that it was indeed rather funny and he said, \u201cThe oblation at the Light Sacrifice has to be burnt to death. I don\u2019t think this is very glorious. If you think I don\u2019t have the right to do it, please hurry and tell the Hierarch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing suddenly realized that he had lost control of his emotions. He did not know why he had spoken about his true feelings after looking at Chen Pipi\u2019s amiable expression, and his expression froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I\u2019m useless, I do not wish to listen to too much crap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi looked at him and said, holding his palms out, \u201cYou must have spent a lot of effort to enter the You Prison. Is it just to vent your resentment and jealousy? I don\u2019t remember meeting you when I was a child. If you had any psychological trauma from your childhood, I can\u2019t be responsible for it. Just look at that woman, she has never been responsible for mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing calmed down and looked at him, saying, \u201cI admit that I am indeed a little jealous of you because your cultivation path has had too much smooth-sailing. People like me have to put in a lot of effort and even suffer plenty of torment to be able to reach the state we have now. You have only managed to reincarnate well and met a good teacher, so you were able to reach where you are easily. I can\u2019t not be jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi comforted him, \u201cGet over it, I didn\u2019t want for things like that to happen either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing looked at his smile and his eyebrows picked up. He continued, \u201cI am more angry rather than jealous. I\u2019m angry that my teacher has an unfilial descendant such as you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi only recalled then that Long Qing was his father\u2019s disciple. After a moment of silence, he said, \u201cI did my best for the Academy in Chang\u2019an, and I was filial to my father outside the city. I do not owe anyone anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing stared at him and said, \u201cTeacher isn\u2019t doing very well now; he is no better than an ordinary person and needs someone to take care of him. If you cannot be filial, then I hope you can help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi did not understand and asked, \u201cHow do you want me to help you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing replied, \u201cI went to Zhishou Abbey but could not enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi said helplessly, \u201cThere are still times you have to be rational in this world. I won\u2019t really become useless just because you called me that many times, and then be so stupid to believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing answered, \u201cTeacher needs someone to take care of him now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi replied, \u201cHe is the Abbey Dean of the Zhishou Abbey and is supported by several countries in the mortal world. He does not need anyone to care for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing answered, \u201cYou know what I mean by taking care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi lowered his eyelids and said, \u201cIf Haotian does not speak, there is no one in Haotian Taoism who would dare to disrespect the Zhishou Abbey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing realized that Chen Pipi was indeed very clever. Even though he did not have much experience with worldly matters, he knew what he wanted to say, and it was as if he could see through the depths of Long Qing\u2019s heart. Long Qing could not help but grow vigilant.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrder depends on strength and comes from knowing that the Zhishou Abbey can control the West-Hill Divine Palace from behind the scenes and influence the world for countless years. The anthill on the green hills was trampled by the Headmaster, and the strongest power in the abbey disappeared like clouds and smoke. Teacher was seriously injured and it is extremely difficult for the Zhishou Abbey to be any sort of influence, much less control the Divine Hall. The hundreds and thousands of Taoist temples and Haotian believers in the mortal world only know about the existence of the West-Hill Divine Palace but not of the Zhishou Abbey. In such a situation, even if Haotian does not speak, do you think that the West-Hill Divine Palace which has been suppressed for countless years would not start having ideas? Do you think the Hierarch Lord is willing to think back on the days he was my teacher\u2019s dog? Would the cottages by the lake be able to weather the storm if no one takes care of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing looked at Chen Pipi and said frankly, \u201cI know my present cultivation state is not enough to restore the former glory of the Zhishou Abbey. But whether it\u2019s Emperor brother Chongming or the cavalry in the wasteland, they can give me strength. Otherwise, I would have been forced to leave the Peach Mountain long ago. I think this should be some kind of proof.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi looked into his eyes silently and said, \u201cHe was seriously injured in Chang\u2019an, and his cultivation state has been irrevocably damaged. Even if Haotian takes pity on him, there is no way to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing understood that Chen Pipi had said this to remind him that it\u2019d be pointless for him to use the Grey Eyes to take the Abbey Dean\u2019s power if that was why he wanted to enter the Abbey.</p><br/><p>The temperature dipped slightly and he felt that Chen Pipi\u2019s seemingly simple gaze was suddenly filled with conflicting thoughts. It was as if they were looking at the deepest part of his soul, and he could only remain silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven in and thirteen out.\u201d Chen Pipi suddenly said.</p><br/><p>Long Qing paused slightly and asked, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi looked at him and smiled, \u201cIt is the way to enter the abbey. If you cannot understand this, then it means that you\u2019ll never be as good as someone useless like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing left the prison cell after receiving the answer he wanted.</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi turned around and looked out of the stone window.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s face appeared and he looked at Chen Pipi, asking something soundlessly.</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi smiled and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Ning Que pointed his middle finger once more.</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi refused to say anything else. He turned around, showing his wide back and buttocks to Ning Que. Then, he lifted his right hand high above his head and pointed his middle finger.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at his Senior Brother\u2019s back through the stone window on the precipice. After a long pause, he tugged on the rope.</p><br/><p>The Big Black Horse who was on the cliff platform felt the movement from the string. It walked backwards. Ning Que climbed up the precipice, and the distance between him and the stone window grew gradually.</p><br/><p>The Light Sacrifice was the greatest ceremony of Haotian Taoism. It could only be held when Haotian sends miraculous signs to the world. The human world had not seen the miracle of Haotian for many years, so the Light Sacrifice had not been held for many years. Even the most learned priest in the Revelation Department of the West-Hill Divine Palace was not very clear about the requirements and procedures of the sacrifice ceremony. Ning Que naturally did not know anything about it.</p><br/><p>After leaving the You Prison in the precipice and returning to the Revelation Institute, he stayed in the Book Hall to consult the Classics, and finally found some relevant content in an extremely thick record, confirming that the Light Sacrifice really needed sacrifices. The sacrifices could be swords, sheep or a blade of grass, but they must have the purest belief, and sometimes are even the essence of Haotian\u2019s miracles, so they were extremely rare.</p><br/><p>As time passed, the shadow of the Everlasting Night slowly approached. The belief in Haotian\u2019s world gradually declined, and it became extremely difficult to find such oblations. If one looked at the requirements of the oblations, Sword Sage Liu Bai might be the most suitable. However, his belief in Haotian was questionable. Perhaps the old yellow bull in the Academy might be qualified, but the West-Hill Divine Palace did not dare to even think about it.</p><br/><p>Ning Que gathered plenty of information through various means and eventually ascertained that the oblation at the Light Sacrifice was Chen Pipi. He heard from the rumors that the West-Hill Divine Place was using him as an oblation not because he was a known genius in Haotian Taoism or that he was a disciple on the Second floor of the Academy. The crux of the matter was that his father was the Abbey Dean of Zhishou Abbey and his mother was a descendant of the Great Divine Priest of Light who had left the Peach Mountain six hundred years ago for the South Sea and then had disappeared.</p><br/><p>His identity as a successor of the Academy was a betrayal to Haotian, and the most precious blood of Haotian Taoism flowed in his veins. Was there any other traitor of such pedigree who was more suitable to become an oblation?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, to the West-Hill Divine Palace, when the Peach Mountain burns with holy fire and when Chen Pipi faces the danger of burning to ashes, would the Academy do nothing? Would Ning Que continue staying in Chang\u2019an?</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt cold thinking about how the fat boy would be burned into a puddle of fat. He looked at the Divine Hall of Light at the peak and thought, \u2018do you really want him to die so badly? Do you really want me to die?\u2019</p></div>\n</div>"}

The biggest one fell neither in the Wilderness nor in the capital of Yan. Instead it fell in the comparatively warm capital of Song. Recalling that snowfall, many people saw it as an omen because something very important happened during that snowfall.</p><br/><p>In the snow storm, Taoism burned Ye Su, the founder of the New Stream. It shocked the entire human world. People found a series of strange things during the process. For instance, why did the Abbey Dean made such a ruthless and resolute decision? And why was the Academy lagging behind in reaction? It was not their style.</p><br/><p>The Fourth Brother traveled thousands of miles to the Song and brought the River and Mountain Sandbox. He joined the battle and helped Chen Pipi, Tang Xiaotang and other disciples of the Sword Garret retreat. But he was not able to change the story. He failed to save Ye Su. And most importantly, he came by himself.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother also came to Song and was severely wounded by the Drunkard. But he was too late. By the time he arrived, the heavy snow had entirely covered the pile of firewood. He could not even see any burned wood or ashes, not to mention to save Ye Su. Likewise, he also came by himself, not on behalf of the Academy. ( Boxno vel. co m )</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother and the Fourth Brother came by themselves. They could have represented the Academy but did not do so because currently in the Academy, Yu Lian and Ning Que were in charge.</p><br/><p>Apparently the Academy did not have any plans for this. But what were Yu Lian and Ning Que thinking about? Were they really waiting indifferently for Ye Su\u2019s death as Long Qing had told Ye Su before he was burned?</p><br/><p>Chilling winter wind roared among the cliffs. The Helan City was enveloped by a weird silence ever since the retreat. The barracks used to be the station for tens of thousands of cavalrymen. Now there was nothing but some goshawk whistling in loneliness.</p><br/><p>The last Tang troop of hundreds of soldiers was guarding the only path to the Helan City via the West Wilderness. Having been stationed here for a few years, they would not have survived if it were not for the abundant supplies Tang had prepared and the secret help they received from the Wild People.</p><br/><p>On top of the city gate, a dominating figure was standing high. The goshawk approached from the snow peak out of curiosity and found the figure to be strangely disproportioned. Upon a closer look, the goshawk realized it was not a disproportionate person, but a combination of two people. That was why it looked weird.</p><br/><p>Tang stood on top of the city gate and looked to the west where the Golden Tribe Royal Court was located. He looked indifferent. The fur he wore fluttered in the chilling wind, as if it was an unbeatable flag of blood.</p><br/><p>He was the World Wayfarer of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, and the most powerful man in the Wilderness. In terms of being dominating, no one could have surpassed him ever since Xia Hou\u2019s death. But right now someone was sitting on his shoulders. More precisely, there was a specially designed back-basket on his shoulders with a stool in it. And someone was sitting on the stool. Tang was very tall. Therefore that person on the stool was sitting high.</p><br/><p>The person on his shoulders was a pretty girl. She was about twelve or thirteen years old. Her black ponytails swung cutely in the wind.</p><br/><p>Many years ago in Chang\u2019an, this girl leapt into the sky, chopped a rainbow, and carried Li Manman down. She broke her legs and was reluctant to walk ever since. She used to be in a wheelchair. But when she came to the Wilderness she was sitting on Tang\u2019s shoulders and would not get off even when her legs had fully recovered.</p><br/><p>She said it looked more powerful sitting there. Since she turned into a little girl many years ago, she found being not strong enough to be most annoying, even more annoying than the monthly menstruation.</p><br/><p>Tang did not dare to comment or object her because she was the current leader of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, and the Eldest Sister of the Academy. She was Yu Lian, his master.</p><br/><p>In recent years, Tang had been carrying Yu Lian everywhere in the Wilderness. Today they came to the Helan City because she wanted to know what the Golden Tribe Royal Court was planning on the other side of the Helan City.</p><br/><p>The priests sent by the Left Royal Court on the East Wilderness, as well as the powerful cultivators sent by the Divine Halls had mostly been killed by her and Tang throughout the years. Long Qing\u2019s loyal subordinates were the first they killed.</p><br/><p>It sounded simple but rather horrifying. There were only the two of them, but they were about to extinct an entire tribe. The territory and population of that tribe was no smaller than those of a kingdom. They had tens of thousands of selected cavalrymen and endless support from Taoism. There were countless cultivators at the state of See-through and Knowing Destiny. However, they were facing extinction.</p><br/><p>When Ning Que carried Sangsang during their escape, he felt like he was standing against the entire world on his own. Whereas these two were destroying a world on their own.</p><br/><p>In a few days, when she would kill the last powerful figures in the East Wilderness, the warriors of the Wild Kingdom would come down to the south. It did not matter that the thousand cavalrymen of Divine Halls would come to the north because the term of the Left Royal Court would be erased from human history. It probably could only be found in the archives from now on.</p><br/><p>Yu Lian was confident. She was so certain that she did not even care about being confident in this. But she knew that the Golden Tribe Royal Court would not just sit aside. So what was Chanyu\u2019s plan? And what kind of gift had the national master and the thirteen priests prepared for her?</p><br/><p>The snow in the Wilderness ceased last night, as well as in the City of Wei and Helan. The air was fresh and the sky was washed spotless after the snowfall. She stood up and looked to the west.</p><br/><p>The city gate of Helan was high-rising between two cliffs and Tang was very tall. She stood on his shoulders but still felt not high enough. Therefore she stood on tiptoe and looked a bit funny.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not waiting any longer. I can sense they are taking action.\u201d Wind swayed her hair and annoyed her. She wiped impatiently on her face and yelled, \u201cI wanna go and take a look.\u201d She swung in the back-basket and made it hard for Tang to stand still. He held the bottom of the basket and said, \u201cThe Golden Tribe Royal Court cannot take Helan City. They have to find an alternative if they want to save the Left Royal Court.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Lian thought about the alternative and realized it was not a possibility but would definitely happen. She said, \u201cThey are coming to the south. Tell the tribe that we are also heading south.\u201d She said it emotionlessly, but with the voice of a girl. It seemed like some little girl copying the way her parents talked. She sounded serious but funny.</p><br/><p>Tang was used to her voice. His dashing eyebrows shivered while he said, \u201cThe Golden Tribe Royal Court must have prepared well. We\u2019d better get prepared too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m eager to see what gift they\u2019ve prepared for me.\u201d Yu Lian showed no emotions on her little face and said, \u201cThey say the young slave was Sangsang\u2019s gift to the human world. Being Ning Que\u2019s Sister, I\u2019m going to unwrap the gift on behalf of him. If I\u2019m not satisfied, I will return it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be concerned about what happens in the Central Plains?\u201d Tang thought of the World Wayfarer of Taoism who used to be a match to him, and felt anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Abbey Dean is no idiot, not like Xiong Chumo. Killing Ye Su won\u2019t do anything good to Taoism. Then why would he do so? The best and only reaction Taoism could take now is to wait.\u201d Yu Lian continued, \u201cIf our master could defeat Haotian in the Divine Kingdom before the New Stream takes over Haotian Taoism, they would win the gamble.\u201d</p><br/><p>The New Stream was faith, and was protected by the Academy and Tang Empire. It was impossible for Taoism to extinguish the faith. The harder Taoism tried, the more they would help the New Stream grow.</p><br/><p>If the Academy wanted to seize the opportunity in this battle, they would have to give full support to the New Stream and weaken Haotian\u2019s power before the battle in the Divine Kingdom came to an end.</p><br/><p>Comparatively speaking, Taoism seemed to be privileged but was actually in a passive position. It was wrong whether or not they would react. As Yu Lian said, they could only wait calmly, or helplessly. The Academy had the initiative. That was why Ning Que wanted to negotiate with the world. He was qualified. He was confident that he could convince Taoism and the Abbey Dean. So was Yu Lian.</p><br/><p>Right then, the Tang troop in Helan City brought news.</p><br/><p>Many years ago the Tang Empire spent massively in building the Transmission Array via Helan City. It delivered the simplest messages only under extreme circumstances. They used this channel only a few times throughout the decades. The last time was when the previous emperor passed away. Today the Transmission Array was activated again and brought another news of death. It was a very bad news, something that Yu Lian never expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Su is dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon that message, Tang recalled what had happened throughout the past twenty years: the tree in the Wilderness and the proud young man who had a sword and mocked the devils and the aliens. He kept silent for a long while.</p><br/><p>Yu Lian was also silent for a fairly long while. It was indeed long. Ever since they heard of the death, she stayed silent in the chilling wind, until the sun set and darkness prevailed.</p><br/><p>A wisp of white smoke rose from someone\u2019s chimney inside the Helan City.</p><br/><p>She looked at the wisp of smoke and said, \u201cA bad news could be good news sometimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Throughout the hours she was not being sensational in the silence, but rather contemplating and re-examining the situation. She tried to figure out what influence Ye Su\u2019s death would bring forth to the human world. Eventually she concluded that the result would be slightly favorable for the Academy. Therefore she said it might be a good news, the same as the rising smoke from the chimney. It seemed lonely, but actually stood for living.</p><br/><p>Yu Lian was cold-blooded. That was why Long Qing said she and Ning Que were waiting for Ye Su\u2019s death. Although it was not what they had planned, he was already dead and she just accepted it. It was not the most important thing.</p><br/><p>She stayed in the chilling wind pondering for half a day, from noon to dusk. Apart from the influence of Ye Su\u2019s death, she also figured out something really important.</p><br/><p>What was the Abbey Dean thinking about?</p><br/><p>She told Tang that Ning Que and herself were certain that the Abbey Dean would not kill Ye Su. But they were proven wrong. There must be something missing in their wrong speculation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t feel at ease unless I know what he is planning.\u201d Yu Lian walked toward the city and left the prevailing darkness behind, as well as the Golden Tribe Royal Court. It was of no significance compared with what she was worrying about.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Transmission Array in Helan City was connected to the imperial palace in the Tang Empire, which meant people inside the imperial palace had heard about Ye Su\u2019s death before Yu Lian received it in Helan City. It was very depressing.</p><br/><p>Li Yu looked pale either because of her lack of exposure in the sunlight or because of some other reasons. She seemed calm, but she clenched her hands harder on the chair and that showed her anxiety.</p><br/><p>It was actually more than anxiety. She was very nervous or even scared. But she was currently the assistant governor of the empire and had to be a role model for the young emperor. Therefore she could not unveil her sensations.</p><br/><p>The young emperor was going to take over the reins the following year. Being taught by the Eldest Brother, he had made outstanding achievements in terms of virtue and capability. But he was still too young and had never been confronted by such situations. Recalling the fierce battle a few years ago, he could not help but be scared.</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing, the Grand Secretary stood by the stairs and said, \u201cAs an emperor, you should stay calm even when mountains collapse, when rivers dry, and when the universe overturns. You are a role model for your people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young emperor felt nervous and looked at Li Yu. He said, \u201cI understand\u2026 I\u2019m just a bit worried whether the Thirteenth Uncle could stop that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing, the Grand Secretary yelled, \u201cSo what? That person had visited Chang\u2019an previously. At that time, Lady Chu gathered all of the women and children to the Vermilion Bird Avenue as they were holding their blades. Elder Chao brought his friends and fellows together as they were scorning him in the chilling snow. Everyone in Chang\u2019an stood against him with their weapons and stones. None of us were afraid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu walked to the emperor, held his hand and asked gently, \u201cStill scared?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young emperor was stimulated by Zeng Jing\u2019s words. He blushed and his courage was boosted. He held her hand and claimed, \u201cNot anymore! I won\u2019t be afraid even if that person were to come into the imperial palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor and ministers were anxious. The palace was intensively guarded but the gate was left open. The front gate of the imperial palace of Tang was wide open as if they were welcoming some important guest.</p><br/><p>Everyone from the government officials to the common people was getting ready for a battle. They were prepared to confront a formidable enemy. It was certainly not because of Ye Su\u2019s death, but because of something else.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The iron arrow did not appear in the capital of Song. There was only sand and snow dancing above the square, but no whistling arrows.</p><br/><p>Where was Ning Que? And what was he doing? When the legendary Thirteen Primordial Arrows were aimed at a target, it required very strict conditions. However every condition was satisfied ever since last night.</p><br/><p>The Arcane Tome of Sand in Long Qing\u2019s hand, the strength of faith Ye Su had collected, and the River and Mountain Sandbox brought by the Fourth Brother had all illuminated the Qi of Heaven and Earth here, and made the target clear enough for an arrow shot.</p><br/><p>When Tang Xiaotang jumped down from the sky, Long Qing became as bright as a golden flower in the ocean of consciousness, just like he was many years ago on the snow cliff in Tianqi Mountain. Ning Que paralyzed Long Qing with a single shot back then. Why did he not make a shot today?</p><br/><p>Was Long Qing right that he was waiting for Ye Su\u2019s death?</p><br/><p>The snowfall had lasted for a few days in Chang\u2019an. Snow kept falling last night and accumulated on the city walls, on his clothes, and even his face.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s eyebrows turned white because of the snow and because he was extremely cold. The chill came from inside rather than outside, as he was fully concentrated on somewhere else.</p><br/><p>He was holding the jet-black iron bow extremely tightly. The bow was pulled to the fullest, like a bright moon. The bowstring was stretched taut. It sank into the three fingers that were holding it and looked horrifying.</p><br/><p>He had been pulling the bow like that from last night until this morning. He never switched the posture as if he was a lifeless statue. Perhaps that was why the snow had accumulated on his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Some snow fell on his shoulders and was melted by the warmth of his body, then was frozen by the chilling wind immediately. It reflected the morning glow as if it was the shining colored glaze formed by grit melted in flames.</p><br/><p>Throughout the night, the iron bow never moved.</p><br/><p>He saw the radiating light in the Divine Halls last night, and the illuminated coastline in the east this morning. Then he saw two flowing lights between Heaven and Earth. They were the Eldest Brother and the Drunkard.</p><br/><p>He stayed in Chang\u2019an but was aware of everything that was happening in the world. He knew that many things had happened from last night. He saw many powerful figures fighting fiercely.</p><br/><p>But he did not loosen the bowstring. He did not make the shot. It was not because he was hesitating on whether or not to save Ye Su. He was cold-blooded, but not like Lian Sheng. He could watch Ye Su die, but not him being killed.</p><br/><p>The morning glow shone on him. He sensed what was happening on the coastline in the east. He was not willing to see it, but he could not make the shot.</p><br/><p>His black hair was bound up tightly. Sweat steamed from his hair and rose into the chilling morning wind. He held the iron bow and looked ahead. Sweat fell onto his face and melted the snow on his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>The iron arrow never left the bowstring because someone was standing in its way. He had to target that person and leave everything else aside ever since last night.</p><br/><p>For Ning Que, that person was the most horrifying enemy as well as the most alluring bait. He aimed the arrow at him out of fear and out of the determination to kill.</p><br/><p>In front of Chang\u2019an, the fields were covered by snow. There was a priest in an indigo gown standing in the snow field. Ning Que\u2019s iron arrow had been aimed at him ever since last night. The priest in indigo gown held his hands behind his back. He seemed calm and tranquil despite the iron arrow being aimed at him.</p><br/><p>The Thirteen Primordial Arrows were legendary killing weapons. They scared the proud barbarian A Da as well as the Drunkard. But the priest in indigo gown could not care less.</p><br/><p>His indigo gown fluttered in the snow storm as if he was a sage, like he used to be many years ago when he fought the battle in Chang\u2019an on his own.</p><br/><p>Today, he came down from the Peach Mountain and visited Chang\u2019an again. He stayed in the snowstorm for the whole night in front of the city. Ning Que held his bow for the whole night too. He shone throughout the night, and was still shining when the dawn came and the torches on the city wall died out.</p><br/><p>He shone like a torch that caught Ning Que\u2019s attention, and locked his iron arrow and his spirit. He made Ning Que paralyzed even if he could see the entire world clearly.</p><br/><p>Because he was the first in Taoism. The first in Taosim throughout a thousand years.</p></div>\n</div>"}

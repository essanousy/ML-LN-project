Therefore Cheng Lixue said it was a very simple sum. But Ning Que did not think so. He wanted the answer even though it was simple.</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue looked at him who was standing in front of a curtain of rain, and said, \u201cMr. First had to stay in the imperial palace and guard the Tang emperor until you came back from the Xuankong Temple. Even though he had left Chang\u2019an, he still has no freedom but to follow the Drunkard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Second has pinned down the entire Buddhism and stunned the cultivation world. Yet he won\u2019t be able to leave the Xuankong Temple soon because after all he is not the Headmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued, \u201cMrs. Third is hard to track. It seems no one knows where she is. But actually we are all aware she has always been in the grassland, leading the strongest from the Wild People and working together with Tang to secretly kill those in the East Royal Court.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThe East Wilderness is not far from Yan or Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue said, \u201cBut she is not coming to the south. Being the current leader of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, how could she waste her time on the East Royal Court? What she really wants is Helan Mountain. The Academy wants the Wild People to enter the West Wilderness and attack the Golden Tribe together with the Northern Battlefront Army from both sides. You could never conceal this from the Abbey Dean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely hard to be concealed. But what matters is whether or not we can succeed. You cannot deny that we at least seem to have a bigger chance of winning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue smiled faintly and said, \u201cYou used to serve in the army of Wei so you should know clearly how strong the Golden Tribe Royal Court is. Then why are you deceiving yourself? Even if she is the Twenty-Three-year Cicada, she could never win against the Golden Tribe alone. If she wants to carry out the Academy\u2019s plan, how could she have the extra energy to deal with the Central Plains?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to exhaust Senior Sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue said, \u201cSince the three of them are away, who can you count on? Chen Pipi\u2019s Mountain of Snow and Ocean of Qi was destroyed, and Tang Xiaotang has been in exile with him. Xu Chi has been struggling against General Lebu and other priests. How could you and the rest of the Back Hill be a match against the powerful Taoist cultivators?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said after a short pause, \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue looked at the calm Ning Que and mocked. \u201cThe Abbey Dean, the Hierarch, Zhao Nanhai, Long Qing, or Hengmu, you could hardly defeat any of them. What do you mean that\u2019s not a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cFighting a battle is different from playing chess. Those powerful Taoist cultivators are nothing to me, so that\u2019s not a problem. But you left out someone\u2026 The middle-aged priest by the Abbey Dean\u2019s wheelchair, to me, is far more troublesome than people like Zhao Nanhai and Long Qing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue wondered, \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cryptic ones are always more dangerous. But of course I just think he is more troublesome. I\u2019m never afraid. And I still think that\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Ning Que looked into his eyes and said, \u201cAs long as we can take down the Drunkard and the Butcher, the Divine Halls of West-Hill are nothing but some shabby buildings to me. That\u2019s the confidence I want you to have as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since the beginning, the Academy had always made precise judgements for the situations. They supported the spread of New Stream, prepared Chang\u2019an for a war, sent Yu Lian to the Wilderness and Jun Mo to the Xuankong Temple. Intentionally or unintentionally they had been trying to quake the foundation of Taoism to extinct them as soon as possible. Only by doing so could they cut off Haotian\u2019s power supply and help their Headmaster defeat Haotian.</p><br/><p>In order to destroy the Haotian Taoism in Haotian\u2019s world, they must undergo extremely hard battles. The Abbey Dean was a wastrel now despite his unparalleled wisdom. He could never restore the divine power that he once possessed when he visited Chang\u2019an by himself. Even though many young cultivators were blessed by the rain in spring, they could never defeat the three masters of the Academy.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, before Haotian left the human world for her Divine Kingdom, she found the two most powerful and terrifying watchdogs for Taoism and her followers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said it was a very simple sum. Even some kid who had only attended preliminary school would be able to do that. Everyone knows who the Academy wants to kill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue continued, \u201cBut the problem is, it\u2019s impossible to kill these two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cAs long as they are human, they can be killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue said, \u201cTo an extent, hese two are no longer just humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThe Abbey Dean used to be a divine figure, but he was also deadly wounded by the Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue said, \u201cThe Drunkard and the Butcher are different from the Abbey Dean as they know exactly how to keep themselves alive. They have lived many years under Haotian\u2019s watch and even survived the previous Ever Night. Even time is not a problem for them. The Headmaster did not try to take them down. Why do you think you could do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not explain further but simply asked, \u201cSo on the day when we will kill them, will you and the Revelation Institution surrender?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Lixue became stern and asked, \u201cThe Academy\u2019s confidence\u2026 where does it come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que turned to the pouring rain and said nothing further.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The South Jin was located in the south, so even in the deep autumn the leaves on the mountains outside Linkang were still green. It seemed even more like spring after the morning rain.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard and the Eldest Brother were strolling on the mountain trail. It was hard to tell who was faster although there were walking side by side. After all, they were temporarily keeping each other company on the journey.</p><br/><p>With the Abbey Dean on the wheelchair, they were the fastest two people in the world. Yet they were walking extremely slowly and unrestrained in the rain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you have always wanted to kill me, more than you wanted to kill the Butcher. It is because I am faster than the Butcher, and thus more dangerous for you.\u201d Raindrops fell on the Drunkard\u2019s gown and then onto the ground, like dewdrops on lotus leaves. His voice also seemed like dewdrops and was no longer full of vicissitudes or rottenness.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother stared at the blood stain on his gown and said, \u201cAnd also the one we want to work with the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard smiled and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cWe want to help the Headmaster to defeat Haotian, so we have to destroy Taoism.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cThen you should be more eager to kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cYou have nothing to do with Taoism. Working together with the Academy to go against Taoism might just seem like a simple choice to you but could mean much less bloodshed in the human world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cThat was in the past\u2026 Ever since she came to me, I have been bonded with Taoism.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cBut she has already left the human world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said with a meaningful smile, \u201cThey say you are the most virtuous, kind, and loyal person in the world. Who would expect you to talk me into treachery? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLoyalty is for human, but she is not human. So it\u2019s hard to say what is loyalty\u2026\u201d The Eldest Brother suddenly became quiet. After a long while he pointed at the Drunkard\u2019s gown and said, \u201cThat was nonsense. Treachery is treachery. If you would betray her, then I would ignore the death of the governor, not to mention the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

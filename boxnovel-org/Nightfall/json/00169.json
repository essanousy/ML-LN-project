Their fur became a mess because of blood and dirty water, and their bodies were so dirty that their snowy white fur could no longer be seen. Having been starving for a long time, their bodies became bony and their shoulder blades protruded up high, and their giant mouths had the stench of flowing saliva from time to time.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how weak they were, the Snowfield Direwolf group was still the king in this frigid world. Hundreds of giant wolves with huge bodies, which looked like a small mountain, orderly stood in a row on the Wilderness like insurmountable mountains.</p><br/><p>They stepped toward the narrow mountain entrance silently, staring at the small girl rushing toward them like staring at fresh meat in motion. A few young male wolves at the back were somewhat disordered. Their breath became more and more intense while their eyes became more and more greedy. Yet they did not dare to act frivolously.</p><br/><p>Then a deep roar resounded within the wolf group. A strong Snowfield Direwolf jumped out, lowered its head with its mouth wide open, then, like a mountain, it pounced upon the little girl.</p><br/><p>Even standing with four legs, a Snowfield Direwolf's height was still so much taller than the height of two girls combined. The contrast between the giant wolf body and her small body produced a desperate feeling, which was exasperated by its thunder-like running sound.</p><br/><p>The jumping ability of Snowfield Direwolves was extraordinary. They rushed clumsily but their speed was very fast. The wolf rushed out several dozen feet in the blink of an eye and came in front of the girl. The strong hind legs of the Snowfield Direwolf suddenly kicked the ground, sinking its back and using its whole strength, to attack the girl with its front paws as fast as lightning!</p><br/><p>A big shadow enveloped the ground. Almost at the same time, the two furry paws with a stinking smell tore the cold air, covering the immature face of Tang Xiaotang. However, her eyes had no sense of fear. She slightly bent her legs and jumped into the air in a strange way, swiftly avoiding the attack and bouncing up 10 meters high!</p><br/><p>From her commanding position in the air, she overlooked the giant Snowfield Direwolf. Tightly holding up her huge machete, she used all her strength to hack at it, like a red moon in the sky that had broken through the chill, and she precisely chopped the wolf's head. \"Crack!\"</p><br/><p>The eyes of the giant Snowfield Direwolf seemed bigger than a human's head. But with a wound appearing on the wolf's neck, its eyes changed from indifferent into vast and desperate.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang fell down on the wasteland, with her dark boots heavily stepping on the ground and cracking a few pieces of frozen ice. Then, she dragged her heavy machete, which was super huge, and quickly walked out of the shadow.</p><br/><p>The giant body of the wolf fell down like a mountain collapsing, making a booming sound, and naturally failed to hit Tang Xiaotang. Staring at a certain location in the wolf group, her fresh and lovely little face flashed a hint of determination. Dragging her huge machete, she suddenly sped up toward the rolling hills of the wolf group, and launched a sprint to attack them once again.</p><br/><p>An overbearing roar resounded at the back of the Snowfield Direwolf group, through which an irritability and anger could be sensed after their dignity had just been violated. After this roar, the entire wolf group started to howl, making the frozen ground slightly tremble. Hundreds of Snowfield Direwolves quickly spread out and began to surround the girl to kill her.</p><br/><p>The huge, heavy red machete was dragged on the black ground of the Wilderness, producing a harsh screeching noise. Sparks could be seen due to friction from time to time. Yet, Tang Xiaotang just bit her teeth and lowered her head to rush forward, showing no care of her machete. Only when a giant wolf pounced in front of her would she lift her machete to hack at it.</p><br/><p>Lifting her machete with difficulty, she hacked at the wolves slowly, like a red moon casually moving through the night. However, even those Snowfield Direwolves with a fast speed could not escape the slow chops. Falling down on the ground with an angry howl, the wolves blood spurted everywhere.</p><br/><p>In just a few minutes, three Snowfield Direwolves had died under the red machete.</p><br/><p>Another two wolves pounced upon her, howling and bringing a wind with a rank smell. The wind beat the fur around Tang Xiaotang's neck. She bent her legs again and bounced into the air. However, the Snowfield Direwolves were so good at hunting and killing that they already knew her next move. So a giant one successfully made a sneak attack and knocked her through the air!</p><br/><p>And at the place where she would fall down, there were already three giant Snowfield Direwoves waiting for her. Roaring and jumping, the wolves showed their paws, which were as sharp as knives, to tear up the small body.</p><br/><p>A child-like angry voice sounded in the Wilderness. Tang Xiaotang forcefully reversed her body in midair. She used her red machete to cut as fast as lightning, producing a strong power. At last, she narrowly prevented the attack and avoided those six horrible scratching paws, and almost hit a Snowfield Direwolf's head.</p><br/><p>She grasped the fur of a wolf and wrung it. Her machete drew a strange arc in the air, then directly stuck into the wolf's eyes. It made a miserable cry. Then, she jumped off of it and landed on the ground. Breathing heavily, she dragged her machete again and launched another attack toward the center of the group.</p><br/><p>Her face showed no feelings, and her bright eyes had no fear and no excitement, just determination. It seemed that nothing\u2014danger, difficulty, or a horrible death\u2014could stop her.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The battle between the girl and the Snowfield Direwolf group still continued. At least seven Snowfield Direwolves died under her charming red machete. But some blood oozed from her mouth. No one knew when she had gotten injured.</p><br/><p>That red machete looked particular heavy. When walking forward, she could only drag it and struggled to move on. It seemed that she could never lift her machete up again.</p><br/><p>Every time that she feebly took back the red machete, it always seemed like that would be the last of her strength to hold up her machete. Yet, the fact was that she was able to raise her heavy knife again.</p><br/><p>And every time that she used that red machete to slowly chop in the frigid sky, it always seemed that she did not have any further strength to make another chop, and this would certainly be the last time. Yet, the fact was that she was certainly able to wield the heavy knife again.</p><br/><p>Compared to her small body, the giant bodies of the Snowfield Direwolves were like small mountains. Tang Xiaotang tightly held that huge red machete, which was like a red moon.</p><br/><p>She neither succumbed to the giant wolves nor slowed down her pace for holding the heavy red machete. When the Snowfield Direwoves pounced at her, that red machete slowly but precisely hacked at them, leaving the bodies of dead wolves behind, piling up like a small mountain.</p><br/><p>The battle between the girl and wolf group was silent but cruel, dull but furious. There was no shouting and no rest or break, only hitting against each other over and over again.</p><br/><p>If people living in the prosperous south could have a chance to personally witness a battle like this, to see a cute girl wearing tattered fur fighting against a wolf group, then they would understand what a real battle was and know what fearlessness was.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The fighting wisdom of a Snowfield Direwolf absolutely could not be underestimated. Snowfield Direwolves were kings from extremely cold northern areas. Although this time they fought in a foreign land and their power was affected due to the hunger and cold, they still could not be defeated by average people.</p><br/><p>The injuries on Tang Xiaotang were getting worse and worse, and her footsteps became heavier and heavier as well as the red machete that was held by her tiny hands. Although the wolf group still could not drive her to desperation, she could not get into the center of the wolf group either.</p><br/><p>A deep roar resounded in the wolf group for the second time. But this time, this sound was particularly serious, no longer angry, but with some taste of appreciation.</p><br/><p>However, an alarming sight appeared to Tang Xiaotang's eyes after hearing the sound. Already guessing what the wolves would do, she hacked at them and tried to return to the mountain entrance. Unfortunately, several strong young wolves blocked her way.</p><br/><p>The Snowfield Direwolves started to distribute their force. They respected Tang Xiaotang, but would not to give up these tribespeople, who were walking slowly toward the south entrance, for in all probability, these tribespeople were the last food that they would have this month.</p><br/><p>So 10 strong Snowfield Direwolves surrounded Tang Xiaotang. Their mouths were slobbering and their fur was upright. They trapped her at the same place in a desperate way.</p><br/><p>More and more Snowfield Direwolves walked by behind them and headed toward the direction of the mountain entrance. None of them looked back at their companions, even though they knew that most of those 10 would die under the girl's knife.</p><br/><p>When these 10 Snowfield Direwolves received the order, they felt desperate at first. And then their despair changed into cruelty. They stared at the girl that was surrounded, then extended their sharp paws, which were shining like steel.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang looked back toward the south, with her black hair floating in the wind, while some hair under her leather hat was touching her bloody lips. Seeing the wolves walking toward the mountain entrance, she thought of the women, children, and the elderly in the tribe, then her bright eyes became dim.</p><br/><p>Then, all of a sudden... a weird thing happened at the mountain entrance.</p><br/><p>The strong Snowfield Direwolf in front of the group was thrown into the air by a powerful horrifying force. Becoming a shrinking shadow and crying plaintively in the air, it was like a poor wild dog.</p><br/><p>Then came the second one, and the third one.</p><br/><p>A bare-handed man appeared at the entrance. He casually wore fur-like clothes, exposing many parts of his body. His muscles were as strong as rocks and steel. It seemed that he was not afraid of the cold at all.</p><br/><p>Directly ignoring the angry wolves who were roaring in front of him, he stared at the back of the wolf group and said, \"Withdraw, or die.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

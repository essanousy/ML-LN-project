When he returned to the room to help Sangsang change, he handed her an embroidered purse and asked her to tell him with her heart if she had any problems.</p><br/><p>Telling him with her heart was a moment of thought and with respect to such a sudden attack, before she could even do anything, she didn\u2019t forget to tell him.</p><br/><p>The moment she thought, Ning Que knew right away.</p><br/><p>Hence Ning Que also thought for a moment.</p><br/><p>With a thought, he triggered the embroidered purse that was hidden up in Sangsang\u2019s sleeve.</p><br/><p>The light in the dark hall was suddenly deformed, especially the space in front of Sangsang, which was twisted to numerous mirrors that overlapped each other by a powerful talisman power transmitted from the purse.</p><br/><p>The jasmine flower petals that had sputtered from the tea landed on the mirrors and the two auras clashed into each other, causing a huge wind in the hall. The dust between the bricks was scraped out and billowed about.</p><br/><p>The petals on the mirror quivered their way into it. However, they were only able to pierce through two to three layers before losing their power. They twisted around powerlessly, then were turned into dirt and dispersed.</p><br/><p>The Flower Addict, Lu Chenjia who was seated in a corner was incredibly shocked. Her flower-like face showed a bitter pain as she spat out blood all over her shirt with a shriek.</p><br/><p>After a moment, the Fu Character aura that swirled around the hall gradually dissipated.</p><br/><p>Numerous mirrors that had protected Sangsang at the front also converged and disappeared without a trace. The jasmine flower petals mixed with the tea that had been torn into the finest drops gently landed on her face, which was a little damp.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stood up slowly as he looked at Lu Chenjia without any expression on his face.</p><br/><p>With this trip to the Lanke Temple, before meeting the Buddhist chariot, he was never worried about his and Sangsang\u2019s safety. Just like what Xian Zhilang had once said: In this world, people stronger than him wouldn\u2019t dare offend him due to the background of his sect. Those that do not have the experience and dared to offend him couldn\u2019t afford to do so.</p><br/><p>However, this wasn\u2019t an absolutely rational world and there was still madmen like Long Qing and many people who would become crazy for various reasons, like those who had suffered bereavement.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was incredibly grateful to Long Qing for giving him an almost fatal blow in the autumn rain at the Red Lotus Temple\u2019s front. That allowed him to regain the caution and calmness he had when he was in the Min Mountain. After speaking a few words with Lu Chenjia at the monastery in Wa Mountain, especially after seeing the expression in her eyes, he was wary of her becoming crazy like Long Qing and hence gave the embroidered purse to Sangsang.</p><br/><p>There was a Divine Talisman from Master Yan Se in the purse.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though I cannot accept it, I can barely understand it. Because of your fiance\u2019s misfortune, you have always wanted to kill me. But this has nothing to do with Sangsang, why do you do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at Lu Chenjia and asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Chenjia raised her arm and wiped away the bloodied water at the corner of her lips. She showed a crazy smile on her pale yet beautiful face and said, \u201cI am certain that only by killing myself now I can attain salvation and make myself suffer less. Since I want you to be in pain, why should I kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She stared at Ning Que with hatred and said in a quivering voice, \u201cYou once killed the most important person in my life. Do you know how that feels? It feels like your world is being destroyed in front of your very eyes. The more precious the memories used to be, the more pain you will suffer. You killed Long Qing, which is the same as destroying my world. You have made me a walking corpse. I live in pain every day, struggling on the verge of collapsing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que replied, \u201cThis pain is something that many have experienced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You do not know! You will never know what kind of pain it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Chenjia shed tears as she said wretchedly, \u201cIf you have never lost someone before, how could you understand that pain that rips your very being into shreds. So when I know that Sangsang is about to die from her illness, I am really happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at her and said, \u201cWhen you realized that her illness might be cured by Master Qishan, you could no longer endure it and decided to kill her yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Chenjia looked at him and said in a daze, \u201cThat is right. I want you to watch your most important person dying before you. I want you to feel such pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que replied, \u201cI am sorry but I will probably never experience the pain you have gone through. Although I am curious\u2026 since Long Qing is not dead yet, where is your pain coming from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Chenjia smiled bitterly and said with extreme pain. \u201cYes, he has not died, but he has become half-alive. He is like a dog chased by the West-Hill Divine Palace, hiding in the Wilderness. He even betrayed the faith he had believed in for more than half of his life and became a demon. Isn\u2019t this even more terrifying than dying? Compared to now, I would rather him be killed by you back then in the Wilderness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion, no matter how one lives, it is better than dying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \u201cWhat I don\u2019t know is whether you really like Long Qing or just his position as the Prince of Yan Kingdom; the symbol hidden under the shiny exterior of the beautiful son of God in the West-Hill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he really is the most important person to you, no matter how his position changes or how his stance changes, whether he is glorious or dim, godly or a monster, a Sage or a demon, he would always be the most important person in your heart. That is, unless you only like him for his shiny exterior. But if that is the only thing you like and it makes you feel so pained, it is still something that cannot be understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was calm and he didn\u2019t mean to ridicule or to be mean but every word hit home.</p><br/><p>Lu Chenjia\u2019s face turned even paler and she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to patiently speak this much with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \u201cI just want to expose you and make you feel more pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such honest and simple words sounded incredibly cold to the people in the hall.</p><br/><p>Who would have expected that just as they were discussing the Underworld Invasion, the Flower Addict Lu Chenjia would attempt to murder Sangsang. Nobody had any idea what to do now. Besides the fact that Sangsang had a valuable position in the West-Hill Divine Palace, Ning Que himself wouldn\u2019t ignore the attack, what would he do?</p><br/><p>Not everyone in the temple had past dealings with Ning Que and was as familiar with his personality as Cheng Lixue. However, all of them knew how the Academy dealt with people entering the human realm. Thinking back to Mr. Ke, some people\u2019s faces changed.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan sighed and looked pitifully at Lu Chenjia before saying, \u201cThe world is mostly suffering from love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Boshan looked at Ning Que, his lips quivering, preparing to plead for the Flower Addict.</p><br/><p>After all, Lu Chenjia was the Princess of Yuelun Kingdom\u2019 and Yuelun was the only and most important secular country within the Buddhism Sect. Those from the Buddhism Sect could not watch as she got into trouble.</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t give Master Boshu a chance to plead.</p><br/><p>With a clanging sound, he unsheathed his podao.</p><br/><p>He stood in front of the futon, slashing in mid air.</p><br/><p>With the slashing motion, the podao in his hand became immediately brighter.</p><br/><p>Countless golden light emanated from the dark body of the blade.</p><br/><p>Just like the sun peeking out from the clouds, it brightened up the dark hall and shot towards the Flower Addict Lu Chenjia.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Light!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Ziqing from the Sword Garret looked at the golden light that emanated from Ning Que\u2019s blade as his expression changed.</p><br/><p>Back then when Liu Yiqing lost under Ning Que\u2019s blade at the Academy, there were rumors that Ning Que had learned the West-Hill Divine Skill. However, the Sword Garret didn\u2019t really believe it and felt that there was something wrong with the telling. Until today, seeing first hand how the podao in Ning Que\u2019s hands was shining with the Haotian Divine Light, Cheng Ziqing knew that the rumors were true.</p><br/><p>The Priest of the West-Hill Divine Palace, Cheng Lixue, had a conflict-filled expression. He had seen Ning Que\u2019s sword burning with divine light at the side door of the Academy. However, he didn\u2019t expect the Divine Light on his podao now to become even stronger.</p><br/><p>Watching the blade, the powerhouses in the hall changed their faces.</p><br/><p>They were watching from the side, so they didnt have to close their eyes.</p><br/><p>However, the Flower Addict Lu Chenjia was facing the Divine Light from the podao head on and had no choice but to close her eyes.</p><br/><p>In fact, before Ning Que even waved his blade, she had already closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>She had wanted to die a long time ago, so she was waiting for death.</p><br/><p>But someone couldn\u2019t watch her dying like this.</p><br/><p>Quni Madi shouted as she sprang up from the futon to the front of Lu Chenjia. She held her walking stick horizontally with one hand, forming a thick veteran Buddhist aura.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s blade travelled across the hall and landed heavily on the walking stick.</p><br/><p>The Haotian Divine Light clashed with the thick Buddhist aura from the walking stick as it splattered all around like burning flames.</p><br/><p>Quni Madi closed her eyes firmly. The wrinkles on her face were lighted up clearly by the Divine Light, almost as if they had countless golden threads or like magma that was burned, ready to collapse at any moment.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the old woman\u2019s hands holding the walking stick started trembling. She seemed to feel incredible pain as she moaned before falling against a wall, spurting out blood from her mouth.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was done with his blade skills as he lifted his right foot and walked over.</p><br/><p>Quni Madi sat leaning against the wall. Her body was full of blood and as she saw Ning Que walking over; her pale face was filled with horror and pain as she shouted angrily, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you taken your shot!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the hall had no idea whom this old woman was seeking help from.</p><br/><p>Master Boshu sighed softly as he created an Emblematic Gesture with both hands in front of him.</p><br/><p>This gesture was weird, the index finger of the right hand was slightly bent, like a mischievous kid shooting out a rock.</p><br/><p>A compassionate yet stifling Buddhism Sect aura attacked Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Master Boshu was still the president of Commandment Yard of the Xuankong Temple and if one were to judge him based on the state of his cultivation, his shocking cultivation was at least in the Knowing Destiny State. Among the people in the hall, only Cheng Ziqing could fight him.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s actual cultivation state was still some distance from this monk. He was only able to intimidate him at Tile Mountain as he had the Primordial Thirteen Arrows in his hands back then. His arrows had been in full force for a long time and had incredible power.</p><br/><p>In the temple today, Ning Que was holding a blade but not a bow. However, he didn\u2019t show any fear on his face as he rushed forward, ignoring the power of the Emblematic Gesture of the Buddhism Sect.</p><br/><p>Quni Madi shouted angrily as she tried to raise her walking stick again.</p><br/><p>Ning Que swung his blade down.</p><br/><p>The walking stick broke as Quni Madi spat blood again.</p><br/><p>The Buddhism Sect Emblematic Gesture was already behind Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Ning Que lifted his brows slightly as the point of the blade tipped slightly, going past Lu Chenjia\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Then, his left hand twisted into a figure of a bird\u2019s beak at his side.</p><br/><p>The aura of the Buddhism Sect Emblematic Gesture was slightly stopped.</p><br/><p>Ning Que went back leisurely and stood in front of Sangsang.</p><br/><p>After that, the power of the Emblematic Gesture fell on the floor.</p><br/><p>With a soft thud, the tough stone tiles of the hall were slightly dented.</p><br/><p>A wisp of black hair fell off Lu Chenjia\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>A bloody wound appeared on her face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

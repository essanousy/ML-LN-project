Ning Que stood outside the temple and looked at the sky high up above and said, \u201cAt the Front Gate of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, Master Lotus once said that the Devil\u2019s Doctrine cultivates in themselves and that they are the world. That is why they were not accepted by Heaven\u2019s Way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you said earlier, that once cultivators break through the Five States, they would have a chance to create their own rules. This would mean that they would have their own world, and this is no different from the Devil\u2019s Doctrine\u2019s ways. This would also be unacceptable by Heaven\u2019s Way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan stood up and walked to his side. He looked up at the sky and said calmly, \u201cThe Classics from Haotian Taoism said that cultivation was a gift from Haotian. However, if we look toward the end, no matter the Haotian Taoism\u2019s desire to live a prolonged life, or the Buddhism Sect\u2019s desire to reach the other side of the shore, or the mad craving of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine for immortality, they are all attempts to break free of the restraints that Haotian has placed on Mankind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought of how Youngest Uncle had died from Heaven\u2019s punishments. Then, the thought of many notable characters in the cultivation history who disappeared, silently succumbing to Heaven\u2019s Way. He grew cold, and said bitterly, \u201cHaotian doesn\u2019t care about the Underworld Invasion, but keeps a keen watch on the mortal realm. It is very annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan smiled and said, \u201cSuch speech and thoughts are considered blasphemous. If you were not a disciple of the Academy, and if you had not spoken inside a Buddhist temple, the West-Hill Divine Palace would not spare you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly recalled something. He turned around and asked the Master, \u201cI heard that Buddha had read the \u2018Ming\u2019 Handscroll from the Tomes of the Arcane?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan nodded and said, \u201cMany thoughts of Buddha might have been created by himself, but they originate from his reading of that tome. I heard that Buddha once wrote a scroll to explain it. Unfortunately, it is now lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que had heard this from the Headmaster. He could not understand the \u201cMing\u201d Handscroll, so he wanted to know what Buddha had seen from it, so he felt a little regret when he heard that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Buddha must have mentioned the Underworld Invasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn Buddhism, the Underworld Invasion is called the Dharma Ending Period. On some old scriptures, it is also called Nirvana. The Xuankong Temple and the Lanke Temple exist because of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about rituals commemorating the Underworld during the Yue Laan Hungry Ghost Festival? Or the legendary Light of Buddha?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, the most important mission of the Lanke Temple is to find the Son of Yama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cMaster, you know that I am very sensitive to the term \u2018Son of Yama\u2019 now. Furthermore\u2026 The Buddhism Sect is focused on tolerance and leaving the mortal realm. Even if they found him, would they use the Light of Buddha against him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The master laughed and said, \u201cEven if they tolerated, they\u2019d want to know what they\u2019re tolerating, no? The Buddha had not experienced the previous Dharma Ending Period. I guess he must have been curious about what Yama would do when he entered Nirvana.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is something that I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cEven if the rumors become reality, with the coming of darkness and the Underworld Invasion really happening, why would Yama send his son to our world? It is ludicrous to think of the Son of Yama as his vanguard. If it was meant as preparation for him to inherit the throne, that\u2019d be even funnier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRumors say that Yama was born before the beginning of time and would die at the end of time. He is the opposite of Haotian\u2019s light and is almighty. He doesn\u2019t move and doesn\u2019t die, and is called Invariant Yama. There are also rumors that Yama stays outside of space and holds the infinite world in his hands that is wide and endless. So he is known as the Lord Guang Ming. However, what he wants to do most, is to turn the mortal world into the Underworld.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said.</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly said, \u201cTeacher doesn\u2019t believe in the Underworld Invasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said with an odd expression, \u201cDid the Headmaster tell you that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que nodded and said, \u201cBecause teacher has not found where the Underworld is located.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said with a slight smile, \u201cThen just treat it as me telling you a story.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cThank you, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The master smiled and continued, \u201cTo counter the Underworld Invasion, Haotian recreated 69,999 false worlds in the Infinite Space after a previous attack. Then, he mixed the real world into it. No matter how powerful Yama is, he cannot differentiate which world is the real one in Haotian\u2019s light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo at the cost of sleeping for a thousand years, Yama divided 70,000 auras and sent them into the 70,000 worlds. They are the legendary 70,000 children of Yama. The 70,000 children who grew up in their own world will eventually wake up one day, and once they wake up, the Underworld will be able to sense the rules of the child\u2019s world, confirming whether it is a real or a false world.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Master Qishan remained silent for a long time. He whispered a few names of Buddha, forced himself to suppress his fatigue, and went on to say, \u201cIf the Son of Yama wakes up, Yama will know the exact position of our world in the light of Haotian. Then he will come to earth according to his son\u2019s coordinates.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the cooling pot of tea and suddenly said, \u201cSince the dark night has come, there is no point in finding the Son of Yama now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dark night has yet to come. What we can sense now are all warning signs of the danger that will come to pass. Even if the Underworld is aware of our location, without the body of Son of Yama as a conduit, it would be impossible for it to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 we have to kill the Son of Yama to save the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are other ways aside from killing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example, having him cultivate in the Buddhist heart of peace, and then cleansing him with light?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026 why do I feel like you\u2019re talking about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Que, you really are an interesting child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are interesting because you can control your mental state perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you desire. And if you do not wish to do it, you can stop yourself from doing it. This is a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I have said that I am not good at meditation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you good at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the quiet and cold Buddhist temple, Ning Que\u2019s and Master Qishan\u2019s voices droned on.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t anyone around the temple, so there was no need to worry about anyone overhearing them.</p><br/><p>Deep inside the Buddhist temple, Sangsang had awoken from her meditation. She was reading a Buddhist scripture seriously.</p><br/><p>Scriptures were scattered all around her.</p><br/><p>Some of the scriptures were old and yellowing at the sides, while some were newly printed and still smelled of ink.</p><br/><p>The light from outside the temple entered through the window and shone upon her.</p><br/><p>A black cotton robe was wrapped around her slender body.</p><br/><p>Her slightly dark long hair flowed down her shoulders.</p><br/><p>She read the Buddhist scripture in earnest. She looked at ease and did not hear the voices outside the temple.</p><br/><p>At the end of the next day.</p><br/><p>Ning Que entered the meditation room. There was a copper plate by the window and in it, burned a stick of incense.</p><br/><p>Sangsang lowered the Buddhist scripture and looked up at him with a happy smile, revealing two clean teeth.</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cIs it interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang nodded and answered, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThe thing is, whether it\u2019s useful or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang thought for a moment and said, \u201cErm\u2026 it seems to be useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she explained softly, \u201cIt\u2019s like, I don\u2019t have to think of it, and then my illness is forgotten and won\u2019t flare up again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo forget it is not enough. You have to keep thinking about how to get rid of the cold aura.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que sat beside her and reached for her wrist. After a quiet moment of perceiving, he confirmed that the cold aura deep in her body had become much calmer than the previous days.</p><br/><p>He suddenly noticed the calmness in Sangsang\u2019s eyes. Her entire disposition seemed to have changed. He was surprised, and thought to himself wondering whether studying Buddhism really came with so many benefits.</p><br/><p>Sangsang continued reading the Buddhist scriptures. Perhaps she was anxious to cure her illness for Ning Que to stop worrying about it, so she worked really hard. According to the common concept of Buddhism, this kind of meticulous idealism was not necessarily beneficial to the study of Buddhism; it might even be a great obstacle. But the amazing thing was that it didn\u2019t seem to affect her at all.</p><br/><p>Ning Que sat by the window and began to read scriptures illuminated by the twilight.</p><br/><p>He comforted himself in the knowledge that it was natural to read the scriptures in a temple. This was also a silent explanation to his Second Brother who insisted on slandering Buddhism.</p><br/><p>He began to study Buddhism yesterday. While he did not possess a connection to Buddhism like Sangsang, his understanding was stronger than most. He read the scriptures quickly and when he encountered any difficulties, he went to consult Master Qishan\u2026</p><br/><p>Slap!</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly closed the scripture he was reading.</p><br/><p>The sound startled Sangsang, who looked up at him.</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head indicating that nothing was wrong.</p><br/><p>Sangsang continued reading scriptures.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared at the scripture in his hands, stupefied.</p><br/><p>The scripture was very old, but the pages did not curl up because of this. It looked as if it few people ever read it.</p><br/><p>The cover page of the scripture was empty; there wasn\u2019t a title on it.</p><br/><p>Ning Que only recalled then, the complex expression on Master Qishan\u2019s face when he handed him the book. Master Qishan had looked comforted, freed, and extremely grave.</p><br/><p>After some time, he slowly opened the scripture in his hands again.</p><br/><p>The scripture was not profound, it was written by a monk describing the method to break the Knowledge barrier.</p><br/><p>However, in the warm red glow of the setting sun, other words appeared on the yellowing pages.</p><br/><p>There was a second layer in this scripture.</p><br/><p>Ning Que carefully studied the binding of the scripture and confirmed that the page on Knowledge barriers was imposed on the original page in order to hide it.</p><br/><p>With stable hands, he carefully pried the page open.</p><br/><p>10 yellowed pages appeared before him.</p><br/><p>These pages were made from an unknown material and written with unidentifiable ink. The colors made it look as if it had existed for tens and millions of years. They were extremely yellow but were not damaged at all. When he held them in his hands, they did not give any signs of flaking into dust.</p><br/><p>The writing on the page did not look exceptional to Ning Que.</p><br/><p>But when he saw the words, he did not blink even once.</p><br/><p>The first paragraph was:</p><br/><p>\u201cWise men, so were the Sun and Moon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que had seen this sentence\u2026 on the \u201cMing\u201d Handscroll of the Tomes of the Arcane.</p><br/><p>So he knew that these pages were the notes written by Buddha after he read the \u201cMing\u201d Handscroll.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

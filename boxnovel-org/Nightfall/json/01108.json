Yet, the sky above the town was still cloudy.</p><br/><p>The Steel Arrow penetrated right into the ground. No one knew how long it took to finally stop. Although the quake that had extended to the ground was minimal, the field outside of the town started to shake vigorously. The wilted saplings wobbled while the water spilled out of the stream. The quake had radiated to the town, causing the already worn out houses to collapse.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the quake seemed to have affected the night sky, agitating the grey and dense clouds. Just like the boiling water, it seethed persistently without any sign of dispersing, resembling an agonized human\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Along with the earthquake, the Drunkard\u2019s body decomposed rapidly. Or more precisely, his body was cremated as it turned into yellow sand-like ashes. Then, it was blown away by the wind and disappeared into the night sky.</p><br/><p>Looking at this scene, Ning Que recalled the natural phenomenon that happened many years ago when he opened the Bright Volume of The Tomes of Arcane at the wasteland. That was when he realized what the Drunkard\u2019s murder could mean to the world.</p><br/><p>Yet, he was puzzled and failed to figure out the reason the Drunkard\u2019s body turn into sand-like ashes. Sangsang was the only person who knew what was happening. Since a long time ago, the Drunkard had already outclassed a normal human being. In other words, he was no longer human.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard was never an ordinary cultivator, he was a Grand Cultivator. In fact, the Headmaster of Academy, Buddha, Ke Haoran, the Abbey Dean, or any other titles of the same rank, even the Grand Cultivator was not sufficient to describe him.</p><br/><p>He came from a far-off place alongside the Butcher. They arrived at this world before Buddha did. Ranging from the Headmaster of Academy and Abbey Dean from thousands of years ago to Ke Haoran from tens of years ago, they were all his juniors. He and the Butcher were the real deal, they should even be called as the legend. He had lived for countless years and it would seemingly last forever.</p><br/><p>But tonight, he died.</p><br/><p>The man, who was deemed immortal, was dead, implying that nothing was definite between life and death. Ning Que did not spend extra time and energy to think about this incident. He walked toward Chao Xiaoshu directly, then landed his gaze on Sangsang.</p><br/><p>The sword borrowed by Liu Bai had penetrated Chao Xiaoshu\u2019s body. This was a trap set up by the Academy many years ago. It was well known Chao Xiaoshu would definitely die once the trap was triggered. However, as nothing is definite between life and death, it is not certain that Chao Xiaoshu would die. Ning Que thought, I\u2019ll completely trust it even if it\u2019s destined too.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he did not believe in fate at all because Sangsang was standing right next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan he be healed?\u201d Ning Que asked Sangsang. With a glance, she was able to heal the Headmaster of Academy, who was hurt by Ning Que, and Ning Que, who was badly injured by Sangsang. Similarly, she cured Xiong Chumo who was crippled with his hand broken. Regardless of the severity of the injuries, she was able to completely recover them with merely a look. Although he knew that Sangsang, with her current ability, was nowhere close to Haotian, he still had high expectations of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis would be difficult to treat even with my previous abilities.\u201d Sangsang walked toward the cracked stone step to look at Chao Xiaoshu who was covered in blood. She said expressionlessly, \u201cTo be frank, Liu Bai\u2019s attack with the sharp sword was too damaging. Chao Xiaoshu has been severely wounded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que remained silent. He held Chao Xiaoshu\u2019s hand as his eyes were misted by sorrow. With a pale face, Chao Xiaoshu looked at him as he strained to put on a smile0. He had no intention to leave his last words before he passed on. As long as The Tang and the Academy could claim the ultimate triumph, he believed that everything and everyone he was worried about would be taken care of in the best interest. Therefore, why would he not be rest assured?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Sangsang spoke. \u201cBut now I know how to heal him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was confused by her statement.</p><br/><p>Sangsang gently stroked that ghastly wound on Chao Xiaoshu\u2019s chest. Clear light faintly shone from the wound. A pouch of thread and needles appeared out of nowhere from her right hand. She said calmly, \u201cI am more experienced to treat this type of injury now.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was right. At the Taoist shrine that was located at the capital of Song Kingdom, her stomach was slit open by a sword too. She then successfully healed herself. She was indeed very experienced in this field.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Que Ning stared at the thread and needle that were zigzagging on Chao Xiaoshu\u2019s chest. Suddenly, he recalled the time when Sangsang left City of Wei many years ago and was worried that her needlecraft would not be on par with the ladies of Chang\u2019an City. Little he did not know that Sangsang experienced a similar reminiscence yesterday in the Taoist shrine too.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu was still looking pale, but his breathing had turned steadier before he eventually fell asleep. Que Ning finally felt at ease. Unable to endure such extreme physical and mental torments anymore, he sat on the wet ground.</p><br/><p>It was only now he noticed that the big black horse was carrying two bamboo baskets on both sides of its saddle. Simultaneously, he realized that despite Sangsang\u2019s waist was not as thick as it was when he met her at the Snow Domain despite her still chubby face.</p><br/><p>The big black horse paced toward him and lifted its front hoof to give him a clearer look.</p><br/><p>He looked at the two babies who were sleeping soundly in the baskets. After a long while, Ning Que regained his composure. Somehow, his chest was overwhelmed by warmth and he felt rather carefree.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard was dead. Yet, Second Brother Chao was still alive. Sangsang bore both of his children. There was no any destined reincarnation between life and death. Apparently, life was filled with both moments of terror and happiness.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Once Ning Que made sure that Chao Xiaoshu was safe, Ning Que, without further ado, left the town on the big black horse\u2019s back together with Sangsang. Like a flash of light, they fled to Tuyang City in the west. Tuyang City was the military base of the army of the northeast border of Great Tang. There was a Transmission Array there and it provided the faster path to Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the night, when the sky was at its darkest, an inconspicuous house, that was located at the back of the General\u2019s mansion, emitted a ray of clear light. The Breath of Heaven and Earth was disturbed. Before long, it returned to its calmness again.</p><br/><p>The next moment, a circle of clear light was radiated from one of the unremarkable small buildings within the palace of Chang\u2019an too. The Breath of Heaven and Earth was moving freely like the cloud and the alerted animal-carvings on eave of the palace looked in that direction.</p><br/><p>The guards of the imperial palace and the officials of Tianshu Institute rushed to the building once they were alarmed. They were certain that the Transmission Array was activated. However, nothing was discovered and they were perplexed. After a short while, Li Yu ushered the young emperor, who had just woken up, to that building. When they saw a broken arrow, they could vaguely deduce what has happened. Their constant tension resulted from the battle had instantly been relieved.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was back.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The midnight was usually the liveliest moment at the House of Red Sleeves. Due to the ongoing war, the ladies of the song-and-dance troupe had followed the Military Appreciation Group to the battlefield to cheer for the soldiers. Moreover, under Shangguan Yangyu\u2019s strict watch, neither the wealthy officials nor the businessmen dared to visit the House of Red Sleeves. Therefore, the place had become considerably quiet.</p><br/><p>The appearance of an extraordinarily handsome big black horse and a lethargic green-skinned dog outside of the House of Red Sleeves raised the public\u2019s curiosity. The House of Red Sleeves are hosting customers tonight? Two customers had indeed visited the House of Red Sleeves today. But, apparently, they were not here for leisure purpose.</p><br/><p>In the room at the top floor, Mistress Jian and Xiaocao were each holding a baby with complex emotions. It was a rare sight to see parents who abandoned their new born babies.</p><br/><p>Ning Que and Sangsang were standing in front of the house beside the Yanming Lake, precisely the bank of the lake. Standing before the bald osiers, they stared at the lake that was covered by snow wordlessly.</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since they were last here. They returned to the place they used to call home, not intending to reminisce about the past, but to ponder on something more important.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was holding Core Vajra of the Array of the God-stunning Array in his hand. Resembling an old woman, Sangsang stood beside him with her hands at her back as though she had grown very familiar with the human world after all these years.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill\u2026 I can\u2019t write it,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Sangsang turned to glance at him. She could not conclude if he genuinely could not write it, or merely refused to write it. In spite of their telepathy, she failed to figure out his mind.</p><br/><p>This was too complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuddenly, I somewhat miss Long Qing,\u201d Ning Que spoke again.</p><br/><p>To some extent, Long Qing was the real second male lead in Ning Que\u2019s version of the story. But, different from the other stories, he was not emotionally attached to Long Qing. Naturally, he would not share sympathy with Long Qing. He merely recalled his self realization, namely everything that was relevant to the grand word, before Long Qing passed away at the bank of Mad River.</p><br/><p>The actions of ditching the heavily injured Chao Xiaoshu to his unreliable nephews and leaving his newborn babies at the brothel did not mean that Ning Que was irresponsible. He was in a hurry to return to Chang\u2019an just to write that word.</p><br/><p>But, that word was too grand. It was so grand that even with the help of God-stunning Array, it would still be very difficult to write. The word extended so far that the West Wilderness, the shore of the southeast sea, or even the Snow Sea in the Cold Arctic, that was located further away, could not reach it.</p><br/><p>One could reach however far one\u2019s mind was. But, no one had ever considered the fact that mind was extremely abstract. It would be a difficult job to make the mind travel far.</p><br/><p>Ning Que recalled the dream that he had many years ago, the dream he had when he was at Initial Awareness State. He saw an ocean in his dream. Sangsang was in his arms when he was having the dream.</p><br/><p>He might be able to send his Psyche Power to every corner of the world if Sangsang was there to help. However, how should he ask for Sangsang\u2019s favour?</p><br/><p>Sangsang turned around. A bench made from osiers appeared out of nowhere. she looked him while she asked, \u201cDo you think our kids will like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI like it very much. I\u2019m positive that they will like it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at him in silence before she said abruptly, \u201cWhat did you say in that small wooden hut?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a brief pause, Ning Que replied, \u201cI said that\u2026 it\u2019s not compulsory to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cYet, you want to write the word.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang gazed at the night sky.</p><br/><p>Chang\u2019an was clear of snow and rain tonight. There was a bright moon in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write the word\u2026 even if I have to sacrifice my life for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never agreed with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang continued, \u201cRight now, I have no idea how to aid you despite my will to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que spoke, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at her and said, \u201cNo one has the right to demand your sacrifice even if it\u2019s for humankind. Moreover, I\u2019m the least qualified person to request for your help. Therefore, I have nothing else left to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang\u2019s gaze landed on his hand. She noticed he was holding the Core Vajra of the Array so tightly, to the extent that his knuckles were blanching.</p><br/><p>From Ning Que\u2019s point of view, Chang\u2019an was a safe place. The Abbey Dean would not be able to take any action even if he arrived at Chang\u2019an. However, the battle was not over yet. The final victory, that would land either on the Abbey Dean, Eldest Brother, or West-Hill, was crucial.</p><br/><p>He appeared calm. But, in actual fact, he was overwhelmed with uneasiness.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The cloud above the town swirled in agitation, resembling an anguished human face. The face was staring at the earth, studying every corner of the human world. Thus, everyone who could see it, saw it.</p><br/><p>With thousands of feet between them, the Abbey Dean and Eldest Brother were standing at the cliff outside the city of Helan. Their green shirts were worn out and their cotton-padded gowns were significantly stained with blood. Two days and one night were sufficient for many things to happen.</p><br/><p>There was neither witness nor record keeper to the battle at the cliff. Otherwise, it would definitely be ranked as one of the top five battles in history in terms of level and intensity.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean looked at that cloud at the south. After a prolonged silence, he spoke, \u201cThe Drunkard has actually died.\u201d</p><br/><p>The incident was deemed impossible even for the Abbey Dean. He, too, was rather appalled by the Drunkard\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>Saying nothing, Eldest Brother followed the Abbey Dean\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean turned to Eldest Brother and said, \u201cThey have returned to Chang\u2019an. You don\u2019t have to stop me anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eldest Brother raised the wooden stick calmly and placed it in front of his brows. He spoke no word but his intention was clearly delivered.</p><br/><p>Ning Que and Sangsang had returned at Chang\u2019an after they successfully overcame all the obstacles. Since the Abbey Dean was unable to enter Chang\u2019an, it was only reasonable for him to stop risking his life to hinder the Abbey Dean.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eldest Brother answered, \u201cTeacher has read the Seven Tomes of Arcane.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean kept quiet for a moment and said, \u201cSeemingly, you know my plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eldest Brother replied, \u201cMore importantly, I know how you want to execute it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning of that sentence was not as clearly delivered as the wooden stick before his eyebrows. However, if one was to study his words in details, one could figure out the hidden yet crucial messages in his reply.</p><br/><p>Chang\u2019an might be able to help in Ning Que\u2019s win against the Abbey Dean, but it could not stop the Abbey Dean from snatching Sangsang\u2019s divine character. The Headmaster of Academy had studied the Seven Volume of Sky Books and understood that there was a reason behind every secret of Taoism.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean dwelled in his thoughts before he vanished.</p><br/><p>It was then followed by Eldest Brother\u2019s disappearance.</p><br/><p>The cliff that witnessed the battle between the two strongest humans alive remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>If one continuously headed north, one would eventually arrive at the bottom of the Snow Mountain no matter which side of the world one departed from. The Snow Mountain was the tallest mountain in the world. A few years ago, the mountain was broken into half by the fallen meteorite that travelled at light speed. Although the top half had fallen into the dark ocean behind the Snow Mountain, but it remained as the tallest mountain in the world.</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, Snow Mountain was the tallest among all. Similarly, the Abbey Dean and Eldest Brother were undoubtedly the strongest among all. Hence, it was the most suitable choice to pick this place as their final battle ring.</p><br/><p>The stars from the sky gleamed on the Abbey Dean\u2019s swords as he walked toward Eldest Brother. The stars in the night sky were beautiful and dazzling, so was the sword. No one could tell what was the sword made from.</p><br/><p>Eldest brother, too, could not identify the material of the sword. Therefore, without looking at the sword, he simply attacked forward with his wooden stick. With a swoosh, the wooden stick had arrived before the Abbey Dean.</p><br/><p>With a block from the Natural Stream Magical Finger, the stars in the sky shifted along with the sword and stopped the ferocious attack. A single star was separated from the night sky and fell on Eldest Brother\u2019s hand that was holding the wooden stick. Immediately, fresh blood oozed out of his hand.</p><br/><p>The stick was blocked, but it was still moving forward.</p><br/><p>A buzz resonated softly.</p><br/><p>The ebony hair stick between the Abbey Dean\u2019s hair was broken subsequently.</p><br/><p>His hair fell onto his shoulders and fluttered along the winter wind.</p><br/><p>He looked at Eldest Brother as he praised, \u201cLi Manman, no one will say that you\u2019re slow anymore.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

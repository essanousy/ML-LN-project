Please shower.</p><br/><p>This sentence would sound especially weird if anyone were to say it to someone else. Moreover, it was to a pretty woman decked in a ruling robe.</p><br/><p>However, what happened next wasn\u2019t something anyone expected, including Ning Que.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing perverted is an abnormal state, this should be a compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold frost on Ye Hongyu\u2019s face slowly dissipated and turned into a faint smile. She extended her hand to her collar and started unrobing herself, her fingers twisted slightly as the thin red robe went away with the wind, showing off her jade white body.</p><br/><p>Across the pond, Ning Que and Sangsang were shocked.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu didn\u2019t take notice of their gaze and she didn\u2019t hide anything. Under the clouds and in the swamp, she walked naked into the clear pondwater and started washing her black hair.</p><br/><p>Ning Que and Sangsang looked at the perfect body in the pond. Looking at the charming curves, they had a stunned expression and didn\u2019t know what to say at all. They didn\u2019t know if they should stop her.</p><br/><p>After a moment, Sangsang looked at the woman in the water and sighed, \u201cShe is beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t blink as he nodded and said, \u201cShe is really beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu appearing before the black horse carriage wasn\u2019t the chance encounter that Ning Que had mentioned. The dark cloud and dozens of black crows were always following them. However, not many people dared to enter the quagmire to search. Ye Hongyu had waited in the swamp alone for more than 10 days, of course she could find them.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t mind Sangsang and especially Ning Que looking at her body, naturally, she had no intentions of seducing them. Ning Que recalled back on the stone steps of the Taoism temple in the Kingdom of Qi. Looking at the divine light in her eyes, he could vaguely understand the meaning within.</p><br/><p>Those who sit on the great divine priest seat are more focused on the mental cultivation, chasing after the state where their Taoist heart is unimpeded. As Ye Hongyu sees it now, no matter how alluring her body is now, it was but an annoying shell. She couldn\u2019t wait to throw it in the trash hence, why would she mind if others see it?</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly asked, \u201cHow did you know I would walk this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu took out a comb from somewhere and started combing her hair lightly in the water. The pond water was up to her waist, her hair was wet and hanging in front of her naked breasts. The sight was one to behold.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said earlier that we are all perverts. I know you very well, with your character, whether you return to Tang or go to the Wilderness like that idiot Long Qing, you will choose to cross the quagmire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThe quagmire isn\u2019t a real pond. This swamp is so huge, were you not afraid of missing us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu continued combing her hair as she looked at the black crows on the roof of the horse carriage and said calmly, \u201cHaotian\u2019s will would not let me miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que kept silent for a moment before saying with a serious expression, \u201cMust we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu used the comb to comb her wet hair to the top of her head and tied a simple bun. There were water droplets falling from her hair and they landed in the pool, giving off a monotonous sound that was exactly like her voice then.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs the judge, my mission is to judge the sins and evil of the world on behalf of Haotian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cBut we aren\u2019t guilty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu replied, \u201cYou had exceeded my expectations by escaping from Chaoyang City. It isn\u2019t hard to imagine that you have killed many people in this process.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIf anybody wants to kill me, I will kill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \u201cIf you ignore her, who would dare kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIdiot, she is my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu furrowed her brows and asked, \u201cEven if your wife is the Daughter of Yama?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cEven if she is the Daughter of Yama, she has not done anything evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \u201cI heard that Mr. First said the same thing at Lanke Temple. It seems like everyone from the second floor of the Academy is the same, do you not think you all are incredibly hypocritical?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cAlright, I am not Eldest Brother and I\u2019m not very persuasive when saying such things. However, she is still my wife and no matter how evil she is, can I not care about her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense, but that is your reason as a man, not the reason of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSacrificing one person to save the world, is that the reason of this world? I believe no matter it is the Chief Preaching Monk or Master Qi Mei, they are all willing to accompany Sangsang to die. But you are not someone like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \u201cIndeed, my existence is the most important thing. Whether your wife dies or not isn\u2019t enough for me to die together with her. If the Underworld really invades in the future, I will battle Yama for one round before dying. This cannot count as me wasting my life but it will not affect my attempt to kill her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is the Daughter of Yama, that is an original sin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat original sin? This is only about interest, involving the interest of most people, the interest of the whole world. Hence you all think it is an unforgivable sin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you only understand what is kind and evil, what is merit and sin now? This has nothing to do with virtues from the start, only interest. Those that are good for the world will be kind, those that have no use will be evil. The more people it benefits, the greater good it is, the more useless it is, the greater the evil it is. If it is good for no one, it is an unforgivable sin.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you have already become the Great Divine Priest of West-Hill, naturally you do not need to obey this rule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, we are the ones who create the rules, we are the shepherds. However, when someone threatens the herd of sheep or even the entire grassland, we will follow the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that is the case, how does the Haotian Taoism have the right to say the Academy is hypocritical?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at him peacefully and said, \u201cThe Haotian Taoism is hypocritical, I have never denied that. However, the Academy always thinks that you are not, this is why I say you all are hypocritical.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at her and said all of a sudden, \u201cAfter shepherding for 10,000 years and eating mutton in various ways, one will still get sick of it in the end. Have you tried living in another way? Like hunting in the mountains.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at him quietly and kept silent.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said again, \u201cThe Underworld Invasion will definitely be a sight to behold. Countless years have passed and only our generation will have the chance to witness it. Everlasting night will befall the world, do you not want to see that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \u201cI want to see it but I cannot go against Haotian\u2019s will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cPlease, you have never even heard Haotian speak before. For all you know, he might be lonely for tens of thousands of years in heaven and have always waited for Yama to come here and to have a good fight. If you kill me and Sangsang, Yama will never find the world and Haotian will die lonely, suffering bitterly.</p><br/><p>He knew the woman in the pond was very scary.</p><br/><p>The scariest part was that he was the same kind of person as her. However, Ye Hongyu\u2019s cultivation state had always suppressed his. In other words, Ning Que could only struggle with her but had no way of beating her.</p><br/><p>He would rather fight 3 rounds with Master Qi Mei or even another time with the Chief Preaching Monk than to fight against her. Hence, he had been trying to convince her to let him and Sangsang go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them ended their discussion quickly, almost as if they didn\u2019t think it through. In actual fact, he had used a lot of effort and it was one of the most complex and exciting persuasions in his life. Twice, Ye Hongyu\u2019s expression had changed obviously and was nearly persuaded by him.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t succeed in the end.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu walked towards the bank as the water droplets rolled down from her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are sure to not let Yama find the world, all the more reason you can\u2019t kill Sangsang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared at her naked figure. His eyes were bright and there were no signs of frustrations as he continued saying, \u201cTeacher said if anything happened to Sangsang, the imprint in her body will be released and Yama will know where the world is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu gently wiped her body, she didn\u2019t turn around and said directly, \u201cHeadmaster wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThese are the words that Teacher had asked Eldest Brother to pass on to the Chief Preaching Monk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu started wearing her clothes. Usually, beautiful ladies looked shabby while putting on their clothes but when it came to her, it still seemed incredibly pleasing. \u201cIf that is what the Headmaster thinks, he would have taken you and Sangsang back to the Academy or even to the edge of the skies a long time ago. Why would he still need Mr. First to run around tiringly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que had no idea that after leaving Chaoyang City, Eldest Brother and the Chief Preaching Monk from Xuankong Temple had a similar conversation in White Tower Temple. The Chief Preaching Monk\u2019s view was exactly the same as Ye Hongyu.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ye Hongyu\u2019s deduction now, his body trembled involuntarily. He had always assumed this was teacher\u2019s view and Sangsang\u2019s last hope.</p><br/><p>The blood-red robes that were spotted with mud returned on Ye Hongyu\u2019s body. The heavy divine crown slowly landed and the beautiful teenage girl playing around in the pond immediately became the terrifying Great Divine Priest of Justice.</p><br/><p>The black crows at the top of the horse carriage started cawing, it was sounded bad and unlucky.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s face turned ugly as he shouted, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black crows quietened immediately but continued again.</p><br/><p>Ning Que laughed to himself and shook his head. He ignored them as he hugged Sangsang tighter. Looking at the thick dark clouds in the skies, a tinge of sadness showed on his face.</p><br/><p>This sadness was faint but very real. It definitely wasn\u2019t faked.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked silently at the opposite bank, feeling his true fatigue, sadness, and frustration. She could subconsciously sympathize with him as she looks up at the dark clouds.</p><br/><p>However, just as she lifted her head, she suddenly felt something was amiss.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a warning.</p><br/><p>Her Taoist Heart didn\u2019t give out any warnings, that meant everything was as usual.</p><br/><p>However, there still was something wrong.</p><br/><p>She suddenly remembered that Ning Que was someone who would get sad but not before a battle. This was because any extra emotions weren\u2019t helpful to a battle and he should understand that.</p><br/><p>The most important thing was that self-depreciating smile.</p><br/><p>Even if he had gone through too much the past two years and could feel for and was hard to suppress his feelings, he shouldn\u2019t laugh at himself. This was because a mocking laugh and sadness together meant that he was going to give up.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu believed that she wouldn\u2019t be depressed no matter what happened. No matter how strong the enemy was, she wouldn\u2019t give up before the battle ended. That meant that he wouldn\u2019t too.</p><br/><p>This was where things felt wrong.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked back.</p><br/><p>Her gaze landed on the opposite bank.</p><br/><p>There was an extra metal bow in his hands that were empty previously.</p><br/><p>The bowstring was already tight and was rapidly loosening.</p><br/><p>The darkish iron arrow had just left the bow and the white rapids at the tail end were forming.</p><br/><p>Behind the metal bow, Ning Que\u2019s calm expression seemed exceptionally cold.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu knew that death was approaching and perhaps, even destined.</p><br/><p>Now, she truly understood that everything that Ning Que was doing wasn\u2019t his most complex persuasion or the one who put in the most effort in\u2026</p><br/><p>It was the most complicated, mind-consuming and exciting arrow in his life.</p>\n</div>"}

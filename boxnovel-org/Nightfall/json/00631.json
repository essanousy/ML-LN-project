Ning Que and Sangsang could hear them clearly. After a moment of silence, he took a step onto the Narrow Bridge and walked to the opposite shore. Quni Madi and Lu Chenjia were forced to follow him.</p><br/><p>As he walked on the Narrow Bridge, the conversations of those on the shore stopped once more, and all was silent again. Those who were standing at the end of the bridge became flustered and backed away. Some of them even fell down and were almost being trampled.</p><br/><p>Someone in the crowd yelled loudly, and the scolding and cursing rang in the air once more. Those who had retreated earlier rushed to the end of the bridge once more. Furthermore, probably due to their embarrassment of silence and retreating earlier, they cursed even more uncouthly, speaking all kinds of cruel methods they\u2019d use to kill the two. Those who have rushed to the bridge again were even more agitated and flushed. They almost broke through the barrier formed by the soldiers and cultivators of the Yuelun Kingdom.</p><br/><p>The foul language and intimidation continued to enter Ning Que\u2019s ears, but he ignored them and looked into the distance to the southwest of the White Tower Temple. He felt how the powerful aura that terrified him was approaching. The aura did not move fast from the western gates to the temple. But as long as it moved, it would eventually reach them.</p><br/><p>Sangsang clutched the handle of the big black umbrella tightly, her face was growing paler. After a silent moment of perceiving, she received the location and the speed of the aura.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s expression froze as he knew that he did not have much time left. He looked at the crowd that grew nearer and thought that the passionate residents had all gathered at White Tower Temple. Then as long as he could get past these people, he and Sangsang would have a chance to escape Chaoyang City. However, looking at the crowd, he could not even count how many people there were. Would it be easy to barge through the crowd?</p><br/><p>Master Qi Mei appeared in front of the Narrow Bridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave the crowd disperse. I will fight with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked into the eyes of the high monk from the Xuankong Temple, ignoring the ire of the surrounding crowd. He said calmly, \u201cIf you think that I\u2019m asking too much, you can get the cultivators from both Buddhism and Taoism sects to attack me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qi Mei said, \u201cYou know that the crowd cannot disperse now. If you insist on fighting with the Buddhism and Taoism sects here, then many people will die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIf you do not want to see people\u2019s blood flowing like a river in Chaoyang city today, then let us leave. The crowd might not listen to your orders, but the cultivators and soldiers will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was not even trying to probe, but had just said that casually. He had never thought that if Master Qi Mei would agree with it. However, unexpectedly, Master Qi Mei agreed without hesitation. He waved his hand, signaling to the archers on the end of the bridge to back off. The West-Hill Divine Guards and dozens of monks made way for him.</p><br/><p>Only the crowd made up of ordinary people were stopping Ning Que. They were regular folks who were looking at him with different expressions. They were fearful and uneasy, angry and hostile.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we make way for you, can you leave?\u201d Master Qi Mei asked calmly.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was silent, and he understood the intentions of the Buddhism Sect. Then, he noticed acutely that a monk had entered the crowd silently. Then, there was a sudden fuss and agitation with angry cries.</p><br/><p>The energy of the crowd earlier was like the sea\u2019s surface, rocking softly, with the occasional waves appearing from the sea slapping across reefs. However, the sea was in the midst of a storm, culminating in a disaster right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill the Daughter of Yama!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The yells of the crowd grew louder and more organized, which was increasingly powerful. The atmosphere grew more and more chaotic, like a house that had its beams cut down, and could collapse at any moment.</p><br/><p>Master Qi Mei chanted the name of Buddha. He calmly said, \u201cLook, it is not us who won\u2019t let you go. It\u2019s the crowd.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the middle-aged monk and said, \u201cIndeed, the Second Brother\u2019s assessment of the Buddhism Sect was right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qi Mei extremely wanted to know how the proud Jun Mo of the Academy thought of the Buddhism Sect. He asked, \u201cWhat did Mr. Second say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cSecond Brother said that all monks should die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qi Mei was enraged. Then, he heard the yelling of those around him. He looked at the passionate crowd shame-facedly. Then, he placed his palms together and did not speak again.</p><br/><p>Ning Que carried Sangsang across the Narrow Bridge. They finally arrived at the land across the lake.</p><br/><p>There was a mass of people in front of him, and he could not see the end of the sea of humans. Everyone glared at them with enmity and they yelled angrily, with shovels or rocks in their hands.</p><br/><p>Ning Que saw several faces. There were old men with faces full of wrinkles, children who looked extremely young, women with powdered faces and men with meaty features. They were all human faces.</p><br/><p>These people were terrified, or angry, or using anger to hide their fear, or using the anger to vent their dissatisfaction with the world. No matter what kind of emotions they had, they were all human, because these people were ordinary human beings.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cYou are the princess of the Yuelun Kingdom. Get them to make way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Chenjia did not speak. Quni Madi remained silent as well.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cYou guys are not ordinary folks and would not become like mad men just based on a few words from the Buddhism and Taoism Sects. I do not believe that you would die for the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Chenjia said, \u201cMy heart is already dead. I have enjoyed the offerings of the world for many years, but have never repaid them. If the world can continue to exist only through Sangsang\u2019s death, then at least I shouldn\u2019t hurt them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Quni Madi said coldly, \u201cI don\u2019t care what happens to the world. I don\u2019t care about death as long as you die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head after hearing this. Then, he took a few steps forward.</p><br/><p>The crowd backed up frantically.</p><br/><p>The chanting of a monk sounded from the crowd. The people looked around and discovered that it was the Reincarnation Scriptures they have studied since they were children. They picked up the chant subconsciously.</p><br/><p>Their soft voices reverberated in the White Tower Temple. The voices grew more and more tidy and strong. The chiming of a bell suddenly joined, and all was calm yet with majesty.</p><br/><p>Dozens of monks chanted the name of Buddha, showing compassionate and majestic looks.</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew that he must stop this. The residents of Chaoyang City were all believers of the Buddhism Sect. Once they were riled up, or perhaps hypnotized by the chanting, it would be troublesome for him.</p><br/><p>He looked up at the dark cloud above Chaoyang City and at the annoying circling black crows. He looked down at the ground his feet were planted on and saw a few ants crawling through the cracks in the mud. Then, he looked up at the approaching crowd and slowly grasped his hilt with his right hand.</p><br/><p>With a clanging sound, he unsheathed his podao.</p><br/><p>A man suddenly jumped on him, and then fell to the ground with his arm waving in the air and his blood gushing wildly, groaning miserably. A pious old woman clawed at Ning Que\u2019s face, and her arms suddenly broke.</p><br/><p>An agitated student tried to hit Sangsang who was on Ning Que\u2019s back with a wooden rod. The wooden rod broke mysteriously, then the student was tearing into two parts from the waist and abdomen.</p><br/><p>Ning Que carried Sangsang and walked into the crowd. He was stained with dark red blood, but his expression had not changed. He was just as calm as before, and his steps were just as steady.</p><br/><p>He walked past the man who was howling in a puddle of blood, clutching at his broken arm. He walked past the pious old woman who was kneeling in a puddle of blood, pale-faced, looking at her broken arms. He walked past the student who was writhing in pain in a pool of blood\u2026</p><br/><p>He was walking on the shore across the lake, a world filled with blood.</p>\n</div>"}

She was surprised when she found Ning Que was inside the room, but she had no time to catch up before she served the Second Brother to clean up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is so inconvenient to clean up and get dressed,\u201d said Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh Sister will help you.\u201d Ning Que answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same. There are always some inconvenient things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and said, \u201cAfter you get married, everything will be convenient.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one was talking while only the waterfall was beating down. Mu You lowered her head and felt embarrassed. Jun Mo coughed and asked, \u201cWhat else can I do for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling the embarrassment, Ning Que stopped smiling and said, \u201cActually, I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo said, \u201cBesides Eldest Brother and Yu Lian, only you can understand me, which means you did well in cultivation. Maybe your state is still unstable, but it will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not what I am going to talk about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que clapped and shouted, \u201cHey, you two, come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two young men entered the room, walking with sticks. Both of them were nervous\u2014the one in expansive clothes looked around slyly, playing cool and tough; the other one in simple clothes kept his head down, trembling, and may have been unable to walk if he was alone.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said to Second Brother, \u201cThey did well during the fight against the Abbey Dean. Judging from their recovery, they have a pretty good physical condition. I just don\u2019t know if they have potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want them to enter the Academy, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cIf you are available, you can take one as your disciple and leave me the other one. But you have to teach them for a while because I am out of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo said, \u201cSenior Brother has yet to name a successor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIf he\u2019s willing, I\u2019ll find him one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two teenagers were Zhang III and Li IV, who had been taught a lesson by their families after the battle. Thanks to their bad injuries, they hadn\u2019t been beaten and Li IV\u2019s family hadn\u2019t returned to their hometown. They had been living in Zhang III\u2019s house until the Chang\u2019an Local Government took them to the Academy today.</p><br/><p>The two teenagers had no idea about what had happened. They entered the Academy dazedly, then stepped directly onto the real Academy.</p><br/><p>For the Tangs, the Academy was the most honorable place, but it wasn\u2019t mysterious. On the other hand, the back of the Academy\u2019s mountain was a totally different world, and every detail made it seem like a fairyland.</p><br/><p>Entering the small courtyard where the sounds of the waterfall were echoing, and hearing the conversation between Ning Que and Jun Mo, they were aware of the lucky chance they had met and became more nervous. Even Zhang Nianzu didn\u2019t dare to look around, praying silently.</p><br/><p>Ning Que continued, \u201cI know they should be tested, but I really like them and I am concerned about whether they have no potential like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo answered, \u201cIf you can cultivate, they certainly can. No one can\u2019t be taught if the Academy wants to. If you want to keep them, then do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said a few words to the young ones before he left. The Seventh Sister sent him out and seemed to come across someone outside the gate.</p><br/><p>The two teenagers were in a state of shock and happiness and were unable to notice Ning Que\u2019s departure. They were both staring at the man standing in front of them and waiting.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the big white goose strode into the yard, familiarly came to the house. After clumsily stepping over the high threshold, it sat beside Jun Mo\u2019s feet and began reposing.</p><br/><p>It was hurt when the Hierarch came to the Academy and hadn\u2019t recovered yet, so it was too listless to notice that there were two strangers in their yard.</p><br/><p>Even so, the two teenagers were still startled by the big white goose who acted like a human.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first thing you should learn is how to be calm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo said to them, \u201cGo and stand in the courtyard, no crutches, no bending. Stay awake until the next morning, then you pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was nearly pecked by the big white goose when they ran into each other. He angrily said, \u201cSenior Sister, after you become the hostess of this yard, you should be strict with the big white goose. It is spoiled. I am disabled and it still dared to bite me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu You, who had been nervous, didn\u2019t know how to respond when hearing this. She asked in a low voice, \u201cDid you already know this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered with a smile, \u201cWe are not blind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu You twisted her handkerchief and whispered, \u201cHe started it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cNone of us will bother about it since Teacher is gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu You asked cautiously, \u201cHe would not disagree, would he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking toward the bright moon in the night, Ning Que was somehow pissed off and said, \u201cWho knows what kind of bullshit he would say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is bullshit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 the shit of a bull.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would he like to say bullshit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026 he used to be close to the old yellow bull?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoungest Brother, you are talking nonsense again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, he was unreliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, he indeed had been a little unreliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu You looked at the bright moon and smiled.</p><br/><p>Then she turned to Ning Que and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew that Ning Que took the two teenagers to the Academy as a way to distract his Senior Brother.</p><br/><p>That was what she thanked him for.</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled back and said nothing.</p><br/><p>The mountain behind the Academy was so huge that everyone could build their own small courtyard, which was either near the lake or near the mountain, including Tang Xiaotang. Since Song Qian and Eighth Brother liked to always play Go games under the pine tree while the scholar had been living in the library cavern, their houses were usually empty.</p><br/><p>Because of Sangsang, Ning Que had been the only one who didn\u2019t live in the mountain. He mostly lived in the Old Brush Pen Shop or in the house near Yanming Lake, and occasionally slept over in the mountain, but his house was always kept.</p><br/><p>He walked slowly along the mountain path with his crutch, heading to his own yard in the dark night.</p><br/><p>Sangsang was gone. The house near Yanming Lake had been ruined and the walls of the Old Brush Pen Shop had been destroyed. He had no reason to go back. The yard in the mountain would probably be his home in the future.</p><br/><p>It was located behind the dense forest where Beigong and Ximen used to play music. It was near the lake, quiet and secluded in the night.</p><br/><p>Someone was waiting for him in the room.</p><br/><p>Leaning against the mud wall, Tang Xiaotang kicked it sometimes, lowering her head and looking at her old small leather boots.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at her beautiful but sad face and asked, \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang looked up and asked, \u201cIs Sangsang really dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang had few good friends, but she was one of them.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Ning Que suddenly felt pain somewhere in his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cFew people mentioned Sangsang in front of me since I came back. They probably felt sorry, like my Senior Brothers and Sisters, but most of them have forgotten her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd yes, she is dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said peacefully, as if he were describing a common thing.</p><br/><p>Although that made it even more sorrowful.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang said, \u201cShe really was Haotian\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Ning Que answered, \u201cOr you could say, she was Haotian.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought of the traces left by Haotian in the God-stunning Array, the traces of Sangsang passing by in Chang\u2019an, their home and past. He suddenly laughed and said, \u201cI raised Haotian and married her. Am I legendary?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang suddenly felt sorry for him and she did not know how to comfort him.</p><br/><p>Because she felt sorry for herself as well.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at her and said, \u201cI know what you want to ask. Pipi has taken the Abbey Dean back to the Zhishou Abbey. I want to say, I owe him a lot. I owe him my life. If he needs me someday, I will try my best do do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang found her answer and said, \u201cThank you, Youngest Uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>They embraced in the chilly moonlight and gave each other warmth and courage.</p><br/><p>Ning Que once believed he owed nothing to the world and was owed by it instead, until he lived in the City of Wei, then as he came to Chang\u2019an and entered the Academy, he found he owed many people.</p><br/><p>He owed Chen Pipi his life and he owed Mo Shanshan for her love.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan didn\u2019t live in the Academy. She preferred the hotel in Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>She came for the Academy and the Tang Empire from the Great River Kingdom, leaving her sect behind.</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t know how to face her.</p><br/><p>They had something, but they didn\u2019t know what they should do.</p><br/><p>Not all men and women were like his Second Brother and Seventh Sister.</p><br/><p>Like him, who had a wife, but still slept alone.</p><br/><p>He hoped everything would pass after a sleep, but he was unable to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>He looked at the bright moon in the night.</p><br/><p>When they left the City of Wei, the stars were as cold and white as today.</p><br/><p>The wounds made by the Abbey Dean suddenly became more painful, as his heart.</p></div>\n</div>"}

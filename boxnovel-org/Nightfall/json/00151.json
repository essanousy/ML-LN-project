He had come to the opening as a representative of the royal family. However, his main motive for coming was to ensure that the agreement would be enforced. He had not expected any student from the Academy to beat Prince Long Qing. But he was slightly mad that no student of Tang nationality had stepped out bravely, but a monk in tattered robes had instead.</p><br/><p>\"Who is this monk?\" He asked the official from the Ministry of Rites beside him with furrowed brows.</p><br/><p>The official wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeves and replied softly, \"He is a traveling monk from the Dadu Monastery of Yuelun Kingdom. He had applied earlier and was granted entry to the Academy today.\"</p><br/><p>Lee Peiyan was startled. He looked as if he had something to say, but chose not to in the end.</p><br/><p>Unlike what was imagined by the masses, the opening of the Second floor was not meant for just the students of the Academy. The Academy welcomed every single contestant, regardless of their nationality or sect.</p><br/><p>Those who could enter the Second floor would have an opportunity to meet the Headmaster of the Academy and receive his teachings. This was practically like receiving dew from Haotian, or honey from bees. Nobody could resist a temptation like this.</p><br/><p>Ever since the first opening of the Second floor years ago, young talents from the South Jin Kingdom, Great River Kingdom, and the Yuelun Kingdom would make their way to the Academy and try their luck. What was amazing was that everyone including their sects and countries would keep silent about this matter.</p><br/><p>The reason for it was simple. They could not dispell the young talents' desire to enter the Second floor of the Academy. They believed that the Headmaster was the epitome of virtue and had a heart as clean as the white clouds in the sky and large like the mountains. They would not interfere with the internal matters of other sects. The most important reason was that they believed that the headmaster would treat all disciples of the Second floor equally and not show favoritism.</p><br/><p>Since this was so, if these young talents from South Jin and the Yuelun Kingdom could enter the Second floor, they would be able to learn the intricate skills of the Academy and build a close relationship between their sect and the Academy and might even align their countries with the Tang Empire and build closer ties. Why would they not keep silent then?</p><br/><p>It was a pity that there was no fixed date for the opening of the Second floor and the numbers chosen were few. Most of those allowed entry in the past few years were mostly students of the Academy. Only a lucky handful was from foreign lands. However, this did not stop young talents from all over the world from joining the opening ceremony.</p><br/><p>The young Yuelun monk in tattered robes and straw slippers was one of them.</p><br/><p>The West-Hill Divine Palace who viewed themselves as the only sect who practiced the correct cultivation method and the spokesperson of Haotian would not be like sects from other countries who would hide and laugh into their sleeves. Other than an unknown fat young lad that no one knew of, no one from the West-Hill had attempted to enter the Second floor until Prince Long Qing.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Other than Prince Lee Peiyan, the professor who was presiding over the opening ceremony also wore a face of displeasure. While the Divine Talisman master who was sequestered in a building within the Academy in cultivation may not know how this batch of students was faring in their studies of cultivation, he felt that no student of the Academy should cower like a frightened rabbit behind others.</p><br/><p>Three other young cultivators from foreign lands walked towards the hill bravely, followed by the hopeful gazes of their companions. The students of the Academy who was silent for a long time finally started moving. Many could not help but turn their sights towards Master Xiesan.</p><br/><p>Xie Chengyun looked upon the crowd from afar. He looked at the young prince who had stolen much attention from him ever since his arrival in Chang'an and could almost taste the bitterness in his mouth. He had been looking at him, paying attention to him, but the prince did not even notice him. How bitter this was.</p><br/><p>He had cultivated for so many years and given up on the position as Tanhua of South Jin to come forth to the Academy in hopes of entering the Second floor just to become a core disciple of the Headmaster of the Academy. However, all these were fading into foam and disappearing with the appearance of this young man of his age who was simply more outstanding.</p><br/><p>Young Master Xie, who was from a prominent family of South Jin Kingdom and was much loved suddenly thought of the two lectures he had received in the old library and in the study room. One was from the Princess of Tang and the other from Ning Que.</p><br/><p>He turned to look at his classmates from the Academy. He wanted to see Ning Que, but was disappointed that he did not.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, he thought of the twenty years he had spent studying and trying his best to cultivate and a look of stubbornness and relief appeared on his face. He stood up, took a deep breath and looked at his classmates and said, \"This is our Academy, are we going to be the last to ascend?\"</p><br/><p>A happy smile appeared on Wang Ying's young face. He held his hands together and said, \"Brother Xie, I shall go with you.\"</p><br/><p>The students of the Academy were excited and started cheering, sending off the six students from the course of magic skills who were about to ascend the mountain together.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The light bustle within the students of the Academy attracted only a few curious gazes. The envoys gathered under the umbrellas of the West-Hill Divine Palace and the Yan Kingdom did not bother looking. Their gazes, as well as gazes from many others not under the umbrellas, were fixed on Prince Long Qing who looked calm and beautiful like a cherry blossom in winter.</p><br/><p>Rumors had spread about the incident at Victory House. Many have heard of how Prince Longqing, who held much power in the Judicial Department of the Divine hall had lost to some ordinary student of the Academy. However, those who truly knew what had happened knew that this was a small matter that had to do with words and alcohol. It would not affect the place Prince Long Qing had in their hearts. As long as he had never been truly defeated, he was still a perfect god to them.</p><br/><p>There were several young cultivators who had walked towards the back of the Academy since the announcement. However, Prince Long Qing had kept silent and focused on the air before him.</p><br/><p>\"Long Qing, when have you ever been so affected by the common people?\"</p><br/><p>Prince Long Qing's mouth twitched upwards and muttered something in his heart. He turned his emotionless gaze towards a lad tucked in the corner outside of the crowd and stood up slowly.</p><br/><p>It was a simple movement but excited those around him. The conversations around him got louder.</p><br/><p>\"Prince Long Qing is about to ascend the mountain!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is he going to be the one to reach the highest spot?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course! He is one of the strongest in the Seethrough state. I believe he will reach the peak!\"</p><br/><p>\"He is already a bigwig in the Judicial Department of the Divine Hall and he still had to participate in the examination to enter the Second floor. The committee of the Academy really thinks too highly of themselves. Can't they just give him a place?\"</p><br/><p>\"I suspect the Academy and the Tang Empire would use this opportunity to shake up the West-Hill Divine Palace.\"</p><br/><p>\"There are so many eyes looking, would they dare try anything?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why would they try anything when the Headmaster of the Academy is accepting disciples?! Some people really are beyond stupid!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Prince Long Qing heard every conversation around him but did not reveal anything on his face as if he had heard nothing.</p><br/><p>Under the numerous gazes, he raised his right hand and tapped the middle of his forehead slightly before looking at the sun in the middle of the sky. The sincerity and benevolence on his face turned calm and he walked towards the back of the Academy.</p><br/><p>\"I don't like how you're trying to gain attention. Everyone knows you're strong and practically undefeatable. They want to see how you're going to do that. But you're waiting to go last when everyone has become impatient. You're going to stand up and make your way there slowly, flicking dust off your sleeves, pulling up your pants and posing with your sword. Do you think you're making your way to the bathroom?\"</p><br/><p>Chu Youxian appeared beside Ning Que and gave him a shock. Ning Que who was tickled by his sarcasm smiled and shook his head, \"This is too sour. Too sour.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you.\" Chu Youxian looked at him with a happy grin, \"I did not enter the Victory House the other day, but I heard of what happened. That was true sourness. I'm just being direct.\"</p><br/><p>\"There isn't much of a difference.\" Ning Que laughed and said.</p><br/><p>Chu Youxian looked at the disappearing backs of his classmates and Prince Long Qing before sighing, \"It's a pity that you cannot shame the prince further in a situation like his today... Our classmates are indeed narrow-minded. You've done much for the reputation of the Academy before the people of West-Hill and Yan Kingdom, but Zhong Dajun is still uttering nonsense. I think they're asking for it.\"</p><br/><p>\"It takes a form of courage to ascend the mountain together with Prince Long Qing.\" Ning Que looked at the bamboo forests at the foot of the mountain.</p><br/><p>The weather was good today, the air was especially clean and the skies were clear blue. One could clearly make out the path before him. The path on the large mountain behind the Academy could be clearly seen.</p><br/><p>Those staying in the Academy could see the people walking up the mountain path past the horizon. The young monk was leading and behind him, there were more people walking along the stone path. Xie Chengyun and the other six students of the course of magic skills were in the middle, followed by Prince Long Qing at the back.</p><br/><p>While the mountain was treacherous, there were no true obstacles to these young cultivators. This examination seemed simple to many, but in truth, the search for a disciple of the Headmaster of the Academy would not be simple. As such, the path up the mountain would not be easy.</p><br/><p>The young cultivators finally slowed down as they reached the steep mountain path. To those watching, they looked as if they were carrying an extremely heavy rock on their bodies. Every step they took was painful and toiling. It looked as if they were fighting against the entire world.</p><br/><p>The young monk from Yuelun Kingdom looked as if he was having an easier time. Only one person seemed not to be affected by the steep mountain path. He walked as if he was on flat ground and surpassed the others. With his sleeves slightly behind his back, he did not look as if he was participating in a difficult challenge but was admiring the scenery instead.</p><br/><p>That was Prince Long Qing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

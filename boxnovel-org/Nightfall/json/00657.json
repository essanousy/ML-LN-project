The two sides had enormous powers and it couldn\u2019t be called a confrontation.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s voice came from the black horse carriage, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you would be the first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing replied, \u201cI am now the owner of this Wilderness, you should have been able to puzzle it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cDo not tell me that until now, you still don\u2019t understand that the Divine Hall is using you as a dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be the dog of Haotian is better than being a ghost in the Underworld.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing paused for a while before continuing, \u201cOf course if I was forced, I would be able to accept being Yama\u2019s dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cYou are indeed ambitious. It seems like your appearance here isn\u2019t necessarily to kill us. Then why do you need to put on such a big show?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I believed in Haotian and was willing to give my life and soul to the light, she was the Daughter of Light. However, when I went through the toughest part of my life and decided to sacrifice to Yama, giving my life and soul to the darkness, she became the Daughter of Yama. Don\u2019t you find this interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing hid between the cliffs as he looked down and said, \u201cBack when I was drinking away in Chang\u2019an City, I lost to Miss Sangsang. This might be a confirmation from the other beings, and of course I wouldn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then started to smile brightly and said, \u201cHowever, I will kill you. Because I want to try becoming the Daughter of Yama\u2019s protector. If darkness really were to come, I might be able to get some benefits from it. If that doesn\u2019t work, I will naturally hand her over to Haotian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que lifted the carriage window curtains and looked somewhere towards the cliff. He heard the laughter but couldn\u2019t see Long Qing. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little at it, thinking to himself that this guy was becoming more and more cautious.</p><br/><p>He said while facing towards the cliff, \u201cNot everyone has the qualifications and strength to swing between light and darkness. Not many people can sit on the fence. If you continue like this, you will die miserably.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing\u2019s calm and confident voice came from between the cliffs, \u201cGrey is between black and white. This color is the most moderate and the safest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t want to discuss such philosophical questions with this person, not even the simplest of discussion. He said directly, \u201cIf you want to kill me, why aren\u2019t you out yet? What are you afraid of?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing said, \u201cYou are about to die, why should I come out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cWhen I die, she cannot survive either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing said, \u201cI know you are cold-blooded but I didn\u2019t expect you to be so heartless to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI only know that if I die, she wouldn\u2019t want to keep on living.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing\u2019s voice disappeared for a moment before sounding again with mixed feelings, \u201cWhen did you become so narcissistic? Is this the temperament of the Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not you. I was never narcissistic, only confident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the cliff and said, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t narcissistic, you shouldn\u2019t be saying so much trash. On the other hand, I am confident that so long as you stand in front of me, I can shoot you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing said, \u201cI am already in the Knowing Destiny state, my cultivation state is way above yours. Let\u2019s not talk about how hard it is to find an enemy, but how I can easily kill you. Where do you have the confidence to shoot me to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cWhen I was in the Seethrough Realm, I could already shoot you to death at the Red Lotus Temple. Now, I am already in the Knowing Destiny State. Even the bald donkeys at the Xuankong Temple do not dare face my arrows. Do you want to try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing\u2019s calm voice echoed between the cliffs, \u201cNo matter how sharp your words are, they are pointless. I am telling you this not because I want you to have a good time before you die. I only want the thousands of arrows to confirm your location. Now that you know this truth, do you regret having this conversation with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he said this, there was a dense humming noise from the Wilderness at the east exit of the Helan mountain range. They sounded like countless locusts flapping their wings and flying, looking extremely horrifying.</p><br/><p>The thousands of arrows shot towards the grey cloud layer and landed in an arc. They scattered all around the black horse carriage in the valley. The shrill sounds of the arrows sounded like thunders from the cloud.</p><br/><p>People like Ning Que and Long Qing wouldn\u2019t speak meaningless words before a battle. If they did say anything, it was definitely part of the battle. It might also be a psychological battle to wear down the other party\u2019s morale or to delay time in preparation for something.</p><br/><p>Prince Long Qing had made use of this time to inform the thousands of cavalry troops in the Wilderness outside the valley about the general location of the black horse carriage. This had formed the first wave of arrows attacking. Ning Que had not only delayed time, he had untied the bridle of the big black horse.</p><br/><p>The volley of arrows broke apart the skies like a torrential rain. Ning Que opened the front door of the carriage and the big black horse turned around rapidly. Its front hooves stepped onto the air while it kicked back its back hooves as it scurried into the carriage.</p><br/><p>Tuk, Tuk, Tuk, Tuk!</p><br/><p>Countless arrows landed on the black horse carriage as they plunged violently into the carriage\u2019s roof and the side walls. The clear ringing sound of the impacting arrows sounded continuously outside, almost as if it would never end.</p><br/><p>However, these arrows didn\u2019t do any damage to the horse carriage. The powerful arrows landed heavily on the horse carriage before breaking in two halves from the center. They landed down like rain but the sharp arrowhead couldn\u2019t pierce into the horse carriage at all. They didn\u2019t even leave a mark on the surface.</p><br/><p>However, the rain of arrows didn\u2019t stop and the sound of arrows falling continued. The sound of the arrows colliding against the walls of the horse carriage didn\u2019t stop echoing within. The clatter of arrows breaking could also be clearly heard.</p><br/><p>Within a short time, thousands of Left King\u2019s Palace cavalry troops in the Wilderness had shot out three waves of arrows. The range of the grassland cavalry\u2019s wooden bow was incredibly far and their shooting skills were even more incredible. From such a far distance, the area where the thousands of arrows landed were all controlled within a 20 square feet radius.</p><br/><p>That area of land was already filled with arrows. They were incredibly dense and were like weeds that were growing from a fertile patch of land. Some of them had even landed above the first layer of arrows, producing a ludicrous sight.</p><br/><p>The arrows beside the horse carriage were even denser. However, most of the arrows that had landed on the horse carriage had broken in half. Hence, it wasn\u2019t grass growing here but rather, it was like a pile of straw that was slowly flooding the horse carriage.</p><br/><p>The black horse carriage was fashioned out of steel and no matter how many arrows hit it, it wouldn\u2019t be able to destroy it. However, under such a dense torrent of arrows, one would still feel uneasy. Ning Que hugged Sangsang tightly in his embrace.</p><br/><p>The horse carriage was very wide and that was how the big black horse could go in. However, its body was incredibly big and it could only bend its hooves and bury its head like a dog. It leaned on Ning Que\u2019s knee, a little humiliated, almost like a pet.</p><br/><p>Sangsang was already a little confused when they chose to enter Helan City from the east. At this moment, she couldn\u2019t help but ask softly, \u201cWhy are we here? What do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The big black horse rested its head against the carriage board, looking a little uninterested and bored.</p><br/><p>Ning Que extended his hand and patted its mane before saying, \u201cI am taking a gamble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang raised her eyebrows slightly and asked, \u201cWhat are you betting on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cBetting that someone will come to save us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said directly, \u201cNo one will come to save us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que kept silent for a moment before saying, \u201cIndeed no one will come to save us, but I think some people will not be willing to miss this opportunity. We have spent so many arrows, those people should be more confident now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang could vaguely guess what he was thinking and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if they will come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, perhaps\u2026 they are already here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing knew that the black horse carriage was very sturdy but he still wanted to give it a try. By now, he had basically taken over control of the Left King\u2019s Palace and no one dared to question any of his decisions. Moreover, under the covert operations of the West-Hill Divine Palace, the Left King\u2019s palace had received a large number of weapons from the Central Plains. He had the power and could afford such wastage.</p><br/><p>Confirming that the rain of arrows couldn\u2019t cause any damage to the black horse carriage, he wasn\u2019t disappointed. This was because the thousands of cavalry soldiers had come to the front of the Helan mountain range under the cover of the rain of arrows. They started to charge.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo.\u201d He put on the silver mask again.</p><br/><p>More than a dozen fallen knight commanders acknowledged that before getting on their horses and charging down the cliff. Bringing with them thousands of grassland cavalry soldiers, they charged towards the black horse carriage in the valley.</p><br/><p>The hooves were like thunder and smoke was billowing; thousands of cavalry troops rushed into the Helan mountain range. There wasn\u2019t any congestion but rather, they rushed in like a black tide. Flowing back again, they easily flooded the black horse carriage.</p><br/><p>Long Qing was very clear that so long as the Tang Army from Helan City didn\u2019t help, Ning Que would die today. No matter how strong a cultivator was, he couldn\u2019t escape such an environment. Moreover, Helan City was more than 200 miles from here and the key was that the Tang Army from that city wouldn\u2019t be able to help Ning Que.</p><br/><p>He no longer looked at the battle at the isthmus, the result of the battle was determined and it couldn\u2019t interest him. Ning Que, who was about to die, would become a past enemy of his life in the eyes of the world.</p><br/><p>Long Qing looked towards the dark clouds in the skies and started thinking about how he could get the greatest benefit and avoid this patch of dark clouds after catching Sangsang. After much thought, he realized his mind was somewhat restless. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh at himself; he realized he still cared a lot about Ning Que\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>The dark clouds in the skies landed on his face and his snowy-white silver mask. The silver mask became a little dark, just like his eyes now. The next moment, the silver mask turned even darker.</p><br/><p>Long Qing\u2019s smile suddenly froze. With a loud shrill, he bounced off his horse and pounced towards the back of the cliff as quickly as lightning.</p><br/><p>The rumbling impact sounds were accompanied by the shrill cries of a horse. Countless rocks rolled down from between the cliffs and smashed into his horse which was sent flying into a ball of blood and flesh. The sight was unbearable.</p><br/><p>If his reaction wasn\u2019t quick, he would have become a wisp of spirit under the pile of rocks.</p><br/><p>Prince Long Qing suddenly turned around and looked between the cliffs that still had snow remaining there. However, he couldn\u2019t find any trace of the enemy.</p><br/><p>The silver mask on his face turned even darker. It wasn\u2019t because of the dark clouds landing on it or because of the rocks. It was because countless sharp and heavy axes flew past his head and aimed towards the cavalry troops in the valley.</p>\n</div>"}

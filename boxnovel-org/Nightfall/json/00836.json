Within the city, the Thin Lake had the best view. It was already summer, the lake surface with lotus leaves floating, looking as if it were a field. The willow trees by the lake provided some shade, and it was so exquisite it was beyond words.</p><br/><p>Just like the years before, the dance troupe of the House of Red Sleeves who were headed to the West-Hill Divine Palace to participate in the Light Sacrifice was staying in the Song Family Manor by the Thin Lake. And just like before, the atmosphere was just as depressing.</p><br/><p>As in the last time, the invitation was sent by the fourth steward of the Cui Family. The steward did not put his hand behind his back to hide his broken fingers. Instead, he calmly placed them in front of him, as if he wanted the girls from Chang\u2019an to clearly see what kind of injuries he had suffered because of them.</p><br/><p>Three years ago, the House of Red Sleeves went to the Lanke Temple to attend the Yue Laan Hungry Ghost Festival. It had coincided with old Master Cui\u2019s 100th birthday. The Cui Family had asked the House of Red Sleeves to present a song that had been lost in history. Ning Que wrote a letter, and the arrogant fourth steward had had several of his fingers broken and was severely thrashed.</p><br/><p>As time passed, many things had changed. Today\u2019s invitation from the Cui Family was to invite the House of Red Sleeves to the Cuiyuan Garden by the Fuchun River to celebrate the clan leader, Cui Shi\u2019s birthday. The invititation indicated that they should present the same song. Xiaocao, who could face it with silent pride before grew more and more solemn. Qinghe County was no longer part of the Tang Empire, and the Academy could not guarantee the safety of the girls.</p><br/><p>Xiaocao looked at the West-Hill Divine Palace priest beside her. He seemed to not have heard anything. Even though he was ordered to bring the House of Red Sleeves to the West-Hill Divine Kingdom in good condition, it did not mean that he did not want to see the proud Tang girls be humiliated in Qinghe County.</p><br/><p>The fourth steward of the Cui Family smiled contentedly as he watched the young girl in charge of the House of Red Sleeves accepting the invitation. He gently stroked his itchy severed finger and walked out of the Song Family courtyard with his head held high.</p><br/><p>When he came to the streets of Yangzhou City, noisy shouts could be heard through the little sedan chair with green curtains. The fourth steward frowned slightly and lifted the curtains. He asked softly, \u201cWhat is Young Master Tang doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que and Wang Jinglue returned to Yangzhou City. They wore straw hats and looked like ordinary people. They did not draw any attention or suspicion.</p><br/><p>While walking on the street, Ning Que stopped suddenly and looked up at the plaque with the writing \u2018Qinghe Post Office\u2019. He could not help but remember that this place used to be called \u2018Tang Empire Post Office\u2019, and it was here, where Sangsang had sent money to the City of Wei.</p><br/><p>Before he could sigh with emotion, his attention was drawn to the noise in the street. Ning Que and Wang Jinglue walked over and saw a crowd around several young people dressed up like scholars, one of whom was shouting something, while the others were glaring at the warlords\u2019 armed forces that kept order. After standing in the crowd and listening for a while, Ning Que found out that the young man who was talking loudly was a distant relative of the Cui Family.</p><br/><p>The young master Cui waved his arms around and looked at those Yan or South Jin Kingdom people on the streets who wore haughty looks on their faces and shouted angrily. \u201cWhy should we, the Tangs, allow foreigners to behave arrogantly on our land? Why has the Divine Hall deacon who injured the little girl last night been sent out of Yangzhou City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Those children of the warlords who were all holding sabers looked slightly uneasy. There were also some on the crowd who refuted the statement made by the man. The argument naturally evolved to one in which it was questioned whether the people of Qinghe River were Tangs.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat blasphemy against Haotian? This is just a one-sided argument of the West-Hill Divine Palace! Who can prove it? I, Cui Huasheng, have been a Tang since I was born. I have been proud for more than 20 years, but they now say that I am not a Tang and want me to be a dog like those people from the South Jin Kingdom and Yan. Why should I agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd gradually settled and Ning Que looked on coldly. He found that the young man named Cui Huasheng and those beside him were all sons of the warlords. This confirmed that there were still many people in Qinghe County who were loyal to the Tang Empire, especially those who had not been blinded by the moss walls.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the crowd gradually divided and a small sedan chair with green curtains entered. The fourth steward of the Cui family lifted the curtains and got off the sedan chair. He looked at Cui Huasheng and said coldly, Young master Tang, your cousin and uncle, and hundreds of people in Qinghe have died in our guildhall in Chang\u2019an city. Do you still want to call yourself a Tang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Huasheng was startled when he first saw the man. Then, he said mournfully, \u201cMy wife\u2019s family, the Qius, were killed by you last autumn. It was a family of more than 40. They were killed, and yet, no body was found. My nephew was not even four years old, and he was killed by you all. My brother was a prefectural magistrate, and yet, he was beaten to death by a rod by you all. According to you, steward, if I call myself a son of the Qinghe families, wouldn\u2019t I be ashamed to see them?\u201d</p><br/><p>The steward\u2019s face darkened and he said, \u201cYoung Master Tang, you should know that this is something that Qinghe County has dreamed of for a thousand years. There is no turning back regarding this matter, so why are you being so obstinate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Huasheng bellowed, \u201cI am obstinate, what can you do to me? Qinghe does not belong to any country now, and it has no laws. Can you condemn me to any crimes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth steward said coldly, \u201cThere are no laws, but there are clan rules. Come, tie Young Master Tang up and send him to the ancestral hall for his clan to deal with!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, several people emerged from the crowd and hit the young man until he fell to the ground. They tied him up tightly with hemp ropes onto a wooden rod and lifted him up, walking towards the ancestral hall outside the city.</p><br/><p>It was still the beautiful Fuchun River.</p><br/><p>Ning Que only discovered then that there were many bamboo cages on the river, which were probably used for drownings. One wondered how many young men and women were drowned to death in the beautiful Fuchun River over the years, and how many wretched souls there were in the tender and beautiful reeds.</p><br/><p>He stood by the river looking at the reeds, listening to the sounds of the rods and the cheering of the people that came from the Cui ancestral hall at the back. His expression did not change, and he turned away after a long time.</p><br/><p>The ancestral hall was surrounded by nearly a thousand people. Cui Huasheng was dressed in white, pale and covered in blood. He was hung on a pole outside the ancestral hall, on his dying breath. He seemed as if he would die at any moment.</p><br/><p>Wang Jinglue walked to his side.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIt does not mean that everyone agrees with how the Cuis have handled the matter just because they cheered. It is because Cui Huasheng is a high and mighty young master, but has been stripped and beaten up today. The people watching would naturally feel happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Jinglue paused and said, \u201cI have heard some news that Cui Huasheng is indeed a son of the Cui Family and married a woman from the Qiu family. She was the youngest daughter of the Qiu family from the Zhi State in Ruyang. The Qiu family was killed by the rebels on the day of the rebellion. His wife was at home that day and died on the spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThe people have to calm down first before we can gain their loyalty. The Cui Family has allowed their children to die in exchange for the silence of the people of Qinghe County.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Jinglue asked softly, \u201cIn that case, should we save him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThis man loves his wife very much, and it is also painful for him to stay alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Jinglue said, \u201cAt least he should not suffer while he is alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThere are still two cultivators in the Knowing Destiny States by the Fuchun River. I won\u2019t take risks for this person, of course\u2026 if he can survive this, he might be of some use in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Ning Que turned to leave the ancestral hall.</p><br/><p>He looked across the Fuchun River and sensed the faint fluctuations of the array intent in the manor. He thought it was indeed a place with a longer history than the Academy and that it should not be underestimated.</p><br/><p>There were two people on the banks of Fuchun River who were in the Knowing Destiny State. This would not make him feel afraid, but if he wanted to start working, there would be a lot of movement. Everyone would then know that he had left Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>He could not allow anyone to know that he had already left Chang\u2019an, at least not before he entered the West-Hill Divine Kingdom. Otherwise, cultivation powerhouses all over the world would try to kill him.</p><br/><p>After all, he had signed a peace treaty with the West-Hill Divine Palace to ensure the safety of Qinghe County. The Divine Hall would not endure it for too long if he killed too many people here. He had a lot of things he could not do until the Academy gets rid of the Drunkard and Butcher\u2014the two knives that had always hung over the Tang Empire\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>But there were some things that he could do and should do.</p><br/><p>Just like what Yang Erxi said, what else can the Tangs do now at Qinghe County other than killing people?</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not enter Yangzhou City this time.</p><br/><p>He stood in the woods outside the road silently and looked at the official riding a white horse.</p><br/><p>The official was very young and looked elegant and quiet. He had dozens of subordinates and guards with him. He did not forget to wave to the people of Qinghe County and drew cheers.</p><br/><p>To Ning Que, the young official was very funny, because the official uniform he was wearing was clearly in the Tang style with only some minor details changed. It seemed rather ludicrous.</p><br/><p>The reason why Ning Que always thought this person was funny was because he was called Zhong Da Jun.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the day of the rebellion, he made the greatest contribution. He is also the son of the city guard of Yangzhou, so he received plenty of boons after the incident. He is likely to be knighted if Qinghe County becomes an independent country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Jinglue looked at Zhong Dajun and said.</p><br/><p>The great meritorious service rendered during the rebellionnaturally meant that many Tangs were killed. The officials of all levels from Yangzhou City were all tricked into going to the Chatelain\u2019s Mansion and then, were ambushed and killed.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at Zhong Dajun\u2019s hands which were holding the reins and said, \u201cI will kill him before leaving. Make preparations in Yangzhou City. I\u2019ll be back in a month at most.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a rundown temple outside Yangcheng Prefecture. It was the only temple there.</p><br/><p>Two monks had suddenly come to the rundown temple, one of whom was dark, quiet and distinguished, while the other was blind, dejected and silent.</p><br/><p>Ning Que entered the rundown temple at dusk.</p><br/><p>He looked at the tanned monk and smiled, \u201cSenior Brother, long time no see.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monk was the abbot of Lanke Temple, Monk Guan Hai.</p><br/><p>The monk, Guan Hai, looked at him and sighed. \u201cEveryone in the world is waiting for you to leave Chang\u2019an so that you can be killed. Who would have thought that you\u2019d really leave the city?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que replied, \u201cSenior Brother, you\u2019ve been cultivating for all these years. Haven\u2019t you also left the temple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Guan Hai said, \u201cThe West-Hill Divine Palace is organizing the Light Sacrifice, and someone from the Tile Mountain has to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI want to go and watch the bustle as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monk Guan Hai only knew then that Ning Que was about to go to the West-Hill. He was shocked speechless.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the back of the temple and asked, \u201cHow has he been?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

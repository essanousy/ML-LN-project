They flew toward Liu Bai with the help of the Force of Nature, drawing lines in the air.</p><br/><p>The swords\u2019 whistles echoed in the wilderness, stirring the wind.</p><br/><p>Fighting against Ye Su had depleted Jun Mo. However, it had also caused Jun Mo\u2019s sword intent to reach its peak. He was stronger now than he had ever been.</p><br/><p>However, it was useless.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai held his sword horizontally. He was calm.</p><br/><p>His sword appeared to be stationary in front of him. No one could figure out if it had moved or if it had moved countless times.</p><br/><p>More than 200 swords were stuck in the air. They were so dense that they seemed to cover the sky, crowding and terrifying.</p><br/><p>It was shocking.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai put down his sword.</p><br/><p>The discarded swords suddenly fell to the ground with a series of clangs. They fell apart like a bundle of untied branches.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai turned to Jun Mo in silence.</p><br/><p>He no longer looked down on him.</p><br/><p>It was an attitude from a strong man to a weak man.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai had to admit that Jun Mo was qualified and capable of fighting with him equally. He respected him.</p><br/><p>Liubai\u2019s sword was his greatest respect for his enemy.</p><br/><p>However, he did not get the chance to draw his sword because Jun Mo already had.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo used the discarded swords again, instead of his sword</p><br/><p>The bundle of swords in front of Liu Bai suddenly began to bounce up.</p><br/><p>They turned into 200 sword lights. They flew up to the sky and rushed to the ground, aiming at Liu Bai.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai had to raise his sword again, frowning.</p><br/><p>The flying swords were operated by using the Psyche Power to control the Qi of Heaven and Earth. The more swords one wanted to operate, the higher the level of Psyche Power required.</p><br/><p>A Natal Item was so hard to obtain that few cultivators were able to cultivate with more than one at the same time. Even a Great Sword Master at the Seethrough Realm could only control his own Natal Sword.</p><br/><p>It was not a wise choice to forcibly control more flying swords.</p><br/><p>In the battle in the Spring Breeze Pavilion, Chao Xiaoshu had controlled five swords while at the Seethrough Realm. This had led to much discussion in the cultivation world. While everyone admired his talent, they were confused.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu was able to control more than five swords and had entered the Knowing Destiny State. But it was a martial taboo, so he seldom performed it.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Mo did today.</p><br/><p>The swords flew around like birds over the Verdant Canyon: they sped down, were blasted away by Liu Bai\u2019s barrier, and returned to the sky.</p><br/><p>They seemed to be alive. Some flew fast and straight like thunder; others drew circles in the air like soft pens; and others flew unpredictably from east to west like dragons.</p><br/><p>They flew and flashed between the heaven and earth, reflecting sunshine in all directions and lighting the whole sky.</p><br/><p>Compared to the fight against Ye Su, Jun Mo performed splendidly.</p><br/><p>His Psyche Power spouted out and expertly controlled all the discarded swords from hundreds of kilometers away, shocking everyone at the scene.</p><br/><p>Looking at the sword net over the wilderness, the West-Hill Divine Palace Coalition Army was speechless. The Sword Masters were particularly scared; they wondered if he was still human.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai\u2019s sword was stronger.</p><br/><p>He could take control of the flying swords from Jun Mo like he had done to the cultivators yesterday. Even if he failed to control all of them, at least, he could conquer most of them.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to be distracted. He was used to fighting with one sword. One was simple and more powerful than a thousand swords.</p><br/><p>He crossed his sword in front of him, ready to repeat his moves.</p><br/><p>The swords flying in the sky still could not penetrate his zone.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai was unsurprised at Jun Mo\u2019s amazing skills. In fact, he was confused about why he had to use so many swords, similar to Jun Mo questioning Ye Hongyu yesterday.</p><br/><p>Controlling multiple swords was no longer a burden once one reached a high state. Liu Bai believed Jun Mo knew the truth of simplicity and strength.</p><br/><p>All irrational actions must have reasons.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu had shot so many swords because she had been trying to set up a cage.</p><br/><p>What was Jun Mo trying to do? He wasn\u2019t trying to do anything. Maybe he just wanted to disturb Liu Bai by keeping him wondering.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai wasn\u2019t affected.</p><br/><p>He stepped forward, deliberately heading toward the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>As he was walked, his sword and the rest of the world was one foot around him.</p><br/><p>The whistles of the swords became more shrill. The swords kept shooting to the ground like birds. It sounded like dull thunder.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai continued to move forward.</p><br/><p>He was the Sage of Sword.</p><br/><p>He was the Number One powerhouse in the world.</p><br/><p>He looked like an ordinary middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>He carried a rusty sword.</p><br/><p>He looked ridiculous walking forward with his sword in front of him.</p><br/><p>Facing the flying swords, he responded clumsily but none of them could break through.</p><br/><p>Even if the Eldest Brother stood in the Verdant Canyon, he would only be able to dodge it; he could not break through either.</p><br/><p>He walked with his world. Anyone who entered his zone would die.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai walked toward the Verdant Canyon, step by step.</p><br/><p>He walked slowly and steadily, looking clumsy, indicating that he was very serious.</p><br/><p>The strongest man\u2019s clumsiness meant respect.</p><br/><p>He respected both the Academy and Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>Maybe he had a deeper intention in doing that.</p><br/><p>His world could not be broken, which meant that Jun Mo had to either dodge or retreat.</p><br/><p>It might be the last chance for the Academy to leave.</p><br/><p>If they chose to go, they would never have to face Liu Bai\u2019s world. They could do anything they wanted.</p><br/><p>However, Jun Mo did not retreat. He raised his iron sword.</p><br/><p>His choice had nothing to do with the Tang Empire or the Academy.</p><br/><p>He did this because he wanted to.</p><br/><p>When he wanted to do something, he did it.</p><br/><p>Nothing could stop him from fighting with Liu Bai.</p>\n</div>"}

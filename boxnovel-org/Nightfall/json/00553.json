They knew that the Calligraphy Addict was gentle, but rarely cared about the opposite sex. However, she chatted with the young man and they seemed to get along very well. As such, the cultivators began to whisper among themselves, speculating about the identity and origins of the young man.</p><br/><p>Those who had guessed Ning Que's identity were proven right by what they saw. Their shock grew into respect, and they did not know if they should salute the sublime being from the Academy or remain silent so that they would not annoy him.</p><br/><p>The nobleman from South Jin Kingdom sensed the change in the atmosphere and saw that the cultivators who had been trying to butter up to him were a little uneasy. He looked at the two figures by the stream from the corner of his eyes and his expression grew grave.</p><br/><p>He was of noble status and had personally come to the Lanke Temple to attend the Yue Laan Hungry Ghost Festival. Other than representing the royals of South Jin Kingdom in showing their respect for Master Qishan, who had done them a huge favor, the most important reason for his visit was because he knew that the Calligraphy Addict would come. He wanted to prove his sincerity through his actions and even secretly hoped that if he managed to get Master Qishan to solve his doubts, he would be able to get together with the girl in Wa Mountain.</p><br/><p>The royal family of South Jin Kingdom had privately probed about how the Calligraphy Addict felt about this but was rejected. The nobleman had written her several letters that went unanswered. He knew that Mo Shanshan was not an ordinary woman, and he had tried not to cause her displeasure by making her feel as if he was pestering her after entering the Wa Mountain. He had suppressed his desire to get close to her and pretended to be nonchalant so that he would leave a good impression on her.</p><br/><p>The nobleman shrugged and chatted warmly with the cultivators while wondering nervously whether Mo Shanshan was quietly looking at him in appreciation. Just as he thought he had succeeded, he suddenly realized that the girl he admired had not noticed him, but had gone to the stream to chat and laugh happily with a man who had appeared out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The surprised glances and whispered speculations of the cultivators beneath the tree caught Ning Que's attention and did not escape his sharp senses. The grave nobleman from the South Jin Kingdom he met yesterday morning at Lanke Temple did not escape his eyes either. He could not help but frown slightly.</p><br/><p>When he thought about that, he had to admit, that if he ignored the man's temperament and moral character, and simply judged the South Jin noble by his background; he would probably be the best match for the Calligraphy Addict in this world. And if he wanted to discuss temperament and moral character, Ning Que had none to speak of. However, he was somewhat unhappy when the thought occurred to him.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the South Jin noble beneath the tree and asked, \"Did you come with that guy?\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan shook her head.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Ning Que's displeasure was dispelled when he ascertained that she did not come to the Lanke Temple with the noble. He said smilingly, \"But I'm sure he followed you here.\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan did not know why he would say that.</p><br/><p>A chilly autumn breeze rose from the stream and blew towards the stone chessboard. The large green tree rustled. However, the leaves on the treetop were dense and did not allow any wind to pass. The wind lifted up the noble's robes, revealing his bright yellow belt.</p><br/><p>\"I know that he is the Crown Prince of the South Jin Kingdom,\" said Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan was slightly startled.</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and said, \"I met him at the Lanke Temple yesterday and we had a slight dispute. But you know how much more gentle I am now. So I didn't tell him anything no matter what he asked me. In my eyes, he isn't even anything. Because we have already crossed paths earlier. He had once wanted to buy my Chicken Soup Calligraphy to please you. I have already defeated him soundly then, so there isn't much fun I can glean off him now.\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan looked at the mountain stream beneath the cliff and smiled with her head down without saying anything.</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought that she did not know about what had happened at the auction of the goods stolen from the Old Brush Pen Shop, so he told her about it excitedly. \"Mr. Thirteen won't give the South Jin Crown Prince face. He just wants to give him a resounding slap.\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan looked up and asked with a slight smile, \"Are you pleased?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought about it and said, \"I was very pleased then, and I'm still quite pleased thinking about it now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then you must be really pleased.\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan nodded and said, \"Actually, I knew about this.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt awkward, thinking about how he had talked about it excitedly even though she already knew.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan looked into his eyes and said with an ambiguous smile, \"Should I thank you for chasing away one of my suitors? Or are you satisfied with having me pine for you all my life and die alone?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que stiffened, not knowing how to reply.</p><br/><p>\"The most troublesome thing is, everyone in the world knows about this. Then, how do you think the world will view me, and how will they view you and the way you treat me?\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan said with some shame and anger, \"Since we did not work out, then it is not right for you to behave like this.\"</p><br/><p>\"I was wrong. I was really wrong. I shouldn't have...\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que bowed deeply to her and apologized, \"I have made mistakes since then, and up till today. I hope that you can forgive me.\"</p><br/><p>His apology was sincere and rare.</p><br/><p>However, Mo Shanshan was not appeased. Her eyes, which were like bright lakes, shook in slight disappointment and bitterness. She smiled grudgingly, \"The Tao Addict was right, you are the most shameless person in the world. You admit your mistakes faster than anyone, so sincerely that you always make others feel as if they were the one in the wrong and you were the innocent one.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que stayed silent. He had only realized that even the most sophisticated woman was no different from other girls once they were troubled by certain things. They would always find countless reasons to get angry.</p><br/><p>Of course, he knew that he could only bear with it because he was indeed in the wrong. After a moment, he said seriously, \"In order to make my apology more sincere, I have decided to do something.\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan asked, \"What is it?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and said, \"Once Sangsang recovers, I will return to Chang'an as fast as possible. Then, I will get the Chicken Soup Calligraphy back from Grand Secretary Wang's manor and send it to you.\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan smiled slightly and said, \"There are already many of your calligraphy works in the study by the Ink Lake.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said with a little resignation, \"Then how can I make you happy?\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan looked into his eyes and said, \"The study by the Ink Lake is still devoid of memos you have written.\"</p><br/><p>This was a request that had been repeated so many times, Mo Shanshan even looked down on herself for it. Her face grew red with shame, but she stared at his eyes bravely and determinedly.</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not dare to look into her gaze. He turned toward the mountain stream without saying anything.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan sighed silently to herself and did not say anything else. She looked at the mountain stream calmly.</p><br/><p>The mountain scenery was extremely beautiful in autumn. There were crisp sounds of water rushing in the mountain stream yet everything seemed quiet by the river.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The speculations of the cultivators beneath the tree all pointed to one person.</p><br/><p>The puzzle was simple. In all the stories that the Calligraphy Addict had left in the world in her years outside her sect, there was only one man who could stand beside her and admire the scenery in silence.</p><br/><p>The speculations were confirmed as the person who had guessed Ning Que's identity spoke up. It was determined that the man standing beside the Calligraphy Addict was the legendary Mr. Thirteen of the Academy, Ning Que! Shouts of surprise rang in the crowd. No matter how hard they tried to control their reactions, they were not able to.</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince of the South Jin Kingdom glowered as he looked at the two figures by the stream. His hands, which were outside his sleeves shook with anger and jealousy. He could not control his emotions even though he wanted to keep cool.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, he could not stop himself any longer and walked towards the stream. Since someone had taken the lead, many people followed. The area beneath the large tree emptied out in a short time.</p><br/><p>The stone chessboard that had previously been crowded was suddenly silent. The competitor from the South Jin Kingdom sat on one side of the chessboard deep in thought and did not notice. Meanwhile, the yellow-clothed monk who was refereeing the match had sensed it. He raised his head in surprise and glanced at the stream.</p><br/><p>Ning Que sensed when the cultivator beneath the large green tree took his first step. Ning Que turned around and watched as the dozens of cultivators walked towards him. He couldn't help but freeze, and calculated at the fastest speed what he and Mo Shanshan should do when they rushed over in order to not fall into the mountain stream. Then, he looked at the black horse carriage and made sure that that the Big Black Horse was alert before he was put at ease.</p><br/><p>The cultivators did not really push Ning Que into the mountain stream. Instead, they all observed a sense of propriety and even treated him with respect. They all stopped in unison while they were still several feet away from the edge of the stream.</p><br/><p>\"Greetings, Mr. Thirteen. I am Taoist Lee from the Kingdom of Song.\"</p><br/><p>\"I am Lin Ruoyu. Greetings, senior from the Academy.\"</p><br/><p>\"I am Hua Yun. I am here to greet Sir Ning on behalf of my teacher.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone bowed graciously to Ning Que and saluted him. Their expressions were a mix of restraint and excitement. Some of their voices trembled, and some of their voices changed pitches in their excitement. One could sense that they were all very excited.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>This was the world of Haotian. The Haotian Taoism sect was naturally highly regarded. Most of the cultivators who had come to the Wa Mountain behind the Lanke Temple were Taoist cultivators.</p><br/><p>The vague rivalry between the Haotian Taoism sect and the Academy happened in the shadow of history and between powerful cultivators. It had nothing to do with these ordinary cultivators.</p><br/><p>They only knew that the back of the mountain of the Academy was a legendary Unknown Place.</p><br/><p>The core disciples of the Headmaster at the back of the mountain were legendary Unworldly Sublime Beings.</p><br/><p>To the cultivators in the world, these Unworldly Sublime Beings walked on clouds and rarely appeared in the mortal world. Most cultivators would not have the chance to encounter them.</p><br/><p>Amongst all other Unknown Places, the Academy was the only one linked to the secular world. But cultivators outside the Tang Empire would basically not have the chance to meet the disciples of the back of the mountain of the Academy.</p><br/><p>They have finally encountered one up close. They weren't watching the Unworldly Sublime Being waving his sword as he flew past them, and could even speak with him. How could they not be excited?</p><br/><p>Whether or not this Lucky Chance would benefit them on their long path to cultivation, they would at least be able to tell their descendants and disciples about what had happened one year at the Lanke Temple on Wa Mountain before their bodies failed and they returned to Haotian's divine light. They would be able to talk about how approachable Mr. Thirteen of the Academy was with pride.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Ning Que had never possessed the self-awareness of an Unworldly Sublime Being. After he had successfully entered the Second floor of the Academy, he continued drinking at the House of Red Sleeves and made conversations with his neighbors at the Lin 47th Street. He had interacted with many in the world when he brought the students from the Academy to the northern frontier fortress. However, he could clearly sense that the way he was treated had changed over the years. However, he did not care because he stayed in the mortal world and did not live in seclusion in the supermundane.</p><br/><p>This had something to do with his entering the human realm on behalf of the Academy, and also because of his experience. He could not completely cut off his ties with the secular world before he had taken his revenge. And even though he had killed Xia Hou, this had not changed.</p><br/><p>That was why Ning Que froze when he saw the respectful expressions of the cultivators from other countries and the excitement in their eyes. Then, he smiled warmly and returned their salutations calmly.</p><br/><p>While his expression was serene, his heart wasn't.</p><br/><p>He had always known of the Academy's standing in the cultivation world. However, when he had previously entered the human realm, the people he had interacted with were either mad or terrifyingly powerful perverted seniors in cultivation. That was why this was the first time he had felt the power of his sect, as well as the respect and admiration other cultivators had for the Academy.</p><br/><p>Whether it was respect or admiration, they both felt really good.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Even though this was Haotian's world and most cultivators cultivated in Taoism, the Tang Empire was still the strongest country in the world. Many were influenced by the Tang Empire and liked to think that they belonged to sects close to the Academy. A Sword Master from Great River Kingdom did not hesitate to kneel before Ning Que together with his Younger Brothers and bowed grandly to Ning Que. Then, he got up and stood at the spot closest to Mo Shanshan proudly.</p><br/><p>Such actions were rather laughable. However, most of the other cultivators did not laugh and felt that it was natural. If they were cultivators from the Great River Kingdom, they would be the fastest to kneel. The Calligraphy Addict was more charming than anyone else. Who would refuse to get close to her? Furthermore, they could get close to the sublime being from the Academy through her connections.</p><br/><p>However, someone could not bear to watch any longer. He laughed out loud and ruined the atmosphere by the mountain stream. The cultivators who were bowing in a frenzy turned around and wondered who was so brave to do that.</p><br/><p>The person who dared to laugh mockingly did not fear the Academy, or course. The West-Hill Divine Palace did not send anyone forth and the monks from the Lanke Temple were still on the mountain for some reason. The only person who was qualified to go against the Academy, or perhaps one should say, the only person who thought he was qualified to go against the Academy, was a disciple of the Sword Garret of the South Jin Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Ever since the Sword Sage, Liu Bai, appeared and was recognized as the strongest powerhouse in the world, the South Jin Kingdom, who touted themselves as the second strongest country in the world grew proud. Sometimes, they even looked down on the Tang Empire. Liu Bai's disciples at the Sword Garret also traversed the cultivation world proudly.</p><br/><p>However, many misunderstood. Even disciples from the Sword Garret dared not disrespect someone from the Academy. Even if they hated the Academy because they had caused Liu Yiqing's blindness, their hate was respectful.</p><br/><p>The person who had laughed mockingly was indeed someone the from South Jin Kingdom.</p><br/><p>But it wasn't a disciple of the Sword Garret who had laughed. It was the Crown Prince of the South Jin Kingdom.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince of the South Jin Kingdom had grown angry after ascertaining Ning Que's identity. He shot hateful glares at them because of his jealousy. He knew what the Academy meant to the Tang Empire, and that he should not stir up trouble. Even so, he could not help himself after seeing the cultivators behave so spinelessly before Ning Que.</p><br/><p>The crowd split to reveal the South Jin Crown Prince.</p><br/><p>His expression softened when he saw Mo Shanshan. He said softly, \"How can someone so heartless stand beside the Hill Master? The chess master I brought with me is a national rank player in our palace. He would be able to solve the chessboard in seconds. You can head up the mountain with us later.\"</p><br/><p>All was silent by the mountain stream. The expressions on the cultivators' faces were complex. Many wanted to laugh but dared not, and their faces twisted oddly, making the whole scene entertaining.</p><br/><p>Over the years, the most famous love story spread in the world was no longer about the childhood sweethearts, Yuelun Kingdom's Flower Addict and Prince Long Qing. Instead, it was the love triangle between the Academy's Ning Que, the Calligraphy Addict from the Great River Kingdom and the little handmaiden, Sangsang. This story had spread across several countries and gained popularity amongst the masses.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, the descriptions about Sangsang were rather bland. No one knew who the handmaiden was and could not understand why Ning Que insisted on choosing her and disappointing the Calligraphy Addict. That was why everyone supported the Calligraphy Addict and raged on her behalf.</p><br/><p>As time passed, several secrets were unearthed. The cultivation world finally knew that the handmaiden, Sangsang was the only successor of the previous Great Divine Priest of Light. The situation changed, especially when the West-Hill Divine Palace officially granted her status as the Lady of Light several months ago.</p><br/><p>To many, the little handmaiden, Sangsang was finally equal to the Calligraphy Addict in this story. As such, the story became more interesting.</p><br/><p>The cultivators present all thought of the famous story when they heard the South Jin Crown Prince's admonishment. Then, they naturally thought of the rumors that the Lady of Light would always be by Ning Que's side.</p><br/><p>Then, they remembered that there was a black horse carriage by the stone chessboard.</p><br/><p>Everyone turned to look at the black horse carriage, the look in their eyes changed. They were even more reserved as compared to when they saw Ning Que. The respect and fear in their eyes grew stronger.</p><br/><p>One of them finally regained awareness, and hurried to kneel before the black horse carriage.</p><br/><p>As mentioned earlier, all cultivators respected the West-Hill Divine Palace, and the same was true by the mountain stream. The cultivators hurried to the black horse carriage and kneeled before it.</p><br/><p>They all said piously, \"Welcome, Lady of Light, to the world.\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang's calm voice emerged from the carriage. \"Rise, all of you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled. He didn't expect that the girl's voice could carry so much power.</p><br/><p>The cultivators all got up, as if relieved of their burdens. However, they remained in their respectful poses. No one dared to wipe off the dirt and grass on their knees.</p><br/><p>The South Jin Crown Prince's expression grew ugly when he saw that. He had only realized then, that even those around Ning Que were highly regarded as well. If the handmaiden on the horse carriage becomes the Great Divine Priest of Light, then her status would be higher than his father, the King!</p><br/><p>He could not imagine that what happened next would make him cross and resigned.</p><br/><p>Sangsang's voice rang from the horse carriage once more. \"Miss Calligraphy Addict, would you accompany me up the mountain?\"</p><br/><p>The expression of the South Jin Crown Prince changed drastically.</p><br/><p>The cultivators' expressions grew excited.</p><br/><p>Ning Que grew anxious.</p><br/><p>He understood Sangsang, and he knew that Sangsang's address of Mo Shanshan as the Hill Master earlier, and calling her Miss Calligraphy Addict now held different connotations. Even though it was not malicious, he did not know if it would cause the other girl displeasure.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan was not displeased, however, her smile looked a little forced.</p><br/><p>She could vaguely guess why Sangsang had invited her on the horse carriage and journey together.</p><br/><p>It was probably because of what the South Jin Crown Prince had said.</p><br/><p>The South Jin Crown Prince had said that Ning Que was heartless.</p><br/><p>Sangsang wanted to prove that it had nothing to do with Ning Que.</p><br/><p>This was between the two women.</p><br/><p>The South Jin Crown Prince had invited the Calligraphy Addict up the mountain.</p><br/><p>Sangsang could invite the Calligraphy Addict up as well.</p><br/><p>She would invite the Calligraphy Addict and use it to slap the Crown Prince's face at the same time.</p><br/><p>Sangsang was willing to do many things in order to get revenge for her young master, and to allow him to maintain his image and glamor before the other cultivators. That included this invitation that she did not really want to extend.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan sighed softly and thought about how Sangsang cared for Ning Que at all times. She would do anything to make Ning Que happy, which was something hard to imagine. Could she do the same if she was Sangsang?</p><br/><p>The consideration took a split second.</p><br/><p>Sangsang had already done so much for Ning Que's sake.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan thought, \"How hard could it be to walk to the horse carriage?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The crowd watched as the Calligraphy Addict boarded the black horse carriage. The glances they gave Ning Que had changed once more. Amongst the respectful glances, was also envy. Ning Que knew that the truth was otherwise. The two women in the horse carriage did not mean anything. However, he did not explain, but patted the Big Black Horse to signify that they should leave.</p><br/><p>The black horse carriage began to move slowly.</p><br/><p>Ning Que sat on the soft cushion in front of the carriage. He looked at the South Jin Crown Prince's grave and twisted expression and was suddenly gleeful. However, this glee was not sufficient.</p><br/><p>That was because he had come to cure Sangsang's illness. He did not wish to stir up trouble. That was why he had not reacted during his meeting and verbal conflict at the Lanke Temple yesterday morning with the Crown Prince, or when he was ridiculed and rebuked by the man earlier. He remained muted and silent, unlike his usual self.</p><br/><p>However, he was still dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>The black horse carriage suddenly stopped as it passed the South Jin Crown Prince.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked Crown Prince's pained expression and lamented, \"You nosy parker.\"</p><br/><p>Laughter rang in the air when he said that.</p><br/><p>Even though cultivators who were wary of the South Jin Kingdom forced themselves not to laugh, their expressions twisted from the effort.</p><br/><p>After all, it was someone else's business. The Lady of Light had asked the Calligraphy Addict to board the horse carriage. Even if he was the Crown Prince of South Jin, what right did he have to interfere? He liked the Calligraphy Addict, but she didn't like him. How dare he pick at the relationship between the Calligraphy Addict and Mr. Thirteen of the Academy, if even the Lady of Light didn't say anything?</p><br/><p>He was really being a nosy-parker, poking his nose into things that had nothing to do with him.</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince's servants and disciples of the Sword Garret did not laugh. However, they did not grow angry. Instead, they looked down shamefully. To them, the Crown Prince deserved the humiliation.</p><br/><p>The black horse carriage continued on and passed the Crown Prince slowly. Then, Ning Que continued, \"It's none of your business.\"</p><br/><p>The South Jin Crown Prince trembled in anger. When he heard that, everything grew dark and he almost fainted.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Ning Que lifted the curtains and saw that Sangsang's color did look good, so he was not worried. However, he grew anxious when he saw that she and Shanshan were sitting across each other in silence.</p><br/><p>He consoled himself, thinking that he would worry about it after they found Master Qishan. He kicked the Big Black Horse lightly, signaling it to move faster. However, the horse carriage was stopped at the Jumping Tiger stream before it even crossed the bridge.</p><br/><p>It wasn't the South Jin Crown Prince who stopped the horse carriage, but a coldly spoken sentence.</p><br/><p>\"Even though you are a disciple of the Academy, you can't disregard the rules. Is this how the Headmaster teaches his student?\"</p><br/><p>The yellow-clothed old monk who was sitting by the chessboard under the large tree slowly lifted his head and said softly.</p><br/><p>The black horse carriage stopped before the bridge.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was silent for a moment.</p><br/><p>He hated hearing such self-important words that were spoken by the elderly. This was especially so when the old monk used his teacher against him. However, he did not reveal his vexation because he wanted to ask the Lanke Temple to heal Sangsang.</p><br/><p>He looked at the old monk and asked, \"What rules?\"</p><br/><p>The yellow-garbed monk slowly stood up and said,\"You can only cross the bridge after solving this game.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \"Rules are dead, and we are alive.\"</p><br/><p>He had said this to the Calligraphy Addict earlier.</p><br/><p>The yellow-garbed old monk said, \"Man are only alive if we live by these rules.\"</p><br/><p>There was a certain philosophy in his words. However, Ning Que did not know if the old monk knew that he had brought Sangsang to the mountain to cure her illness and was using it to threaten him.</p><br/><p>He frowned slightly and said, \"If my teacher came, would you ask him to solve the game before meeting Master Qishan?\"</p><br/><p>The yellow-garbed old monk said unflinchingly, \"If the Headmaster comes personally, Senior Brother Qishan would have come to welcome him. Only the Headmaster can ignore all rules in this world. As his disciple, you do not have the same rights.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked into the old monk's eyes and suddenly said, \"The Buddhism Sect values all lives as equal no matter whether they are pigs or dogs. Even if the difference between my teacher and I are that of a dumb pig or dog and a human, my teacher and I are equal. If my teacher does not have to observe the rules, then why should I?\"</p><br/><p>The yellow-garbed old monk said indifferently, \"The disciple from the Academy does have a glib tongue indeed. However, I shall not listen if I do not wish to.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \"So it comes down to whose fists are harder. Your temple rules are there to stop those who do not have the ability to break them.\"</p><br/><p>The yellow-garbed old monk frowned slightly and said, \"Does Mr. Thirteen think that he has the ability to break the rules of the world?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \"I wish to try.\"</p><br/><p>With that, he stuck his hand into the horse carriage.</p><br/><p>Sangsang had long opened the arrow box and assembled his iron bow.</p><br/><p>Ning Que took the bow and stuck an arrow on it. He pulled the string back and pointed it at the yellow-garbed monk beside the chessboard.</p><br/><p>Then, he said, \"Do you wish to try?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>-</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As a result, he placed all his focus on earthly luxuries and forcefully went against his ferocious wife to marry several concubines. Now and then, he would visit the popular brothel in the Chang'an city to indulge in the pleasures.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, to indulge in such great pleasures without any limit, one would need both silvers and status, and Zhang Yiqi did not wish to be caught in a trap. Since it was a big matter for a censor to fool around with prostitutes, should this matter spread to the royals, His Majesty would definitely punish him heavily and strip him of his official rank. Due to these reasons, the censor would be extremely cautious every time he was out to seek for pleasure, as though he was a thief.</p><br/><p>Without exaggerating, Zhang Yiqi was indeed the most prudent person among the officers that visited the brothel, and he was also tough to be tracked. As such, Zhuo Er could never discover his whereabouts and daily itinerary. Ning Que had also spent several days and more than ten silvers before he finally obtained some information.</p><br/><p>A horse carriage stopped outside the side door of House of Red-Sleeves. Censor Zhang Yiqi, who was dressed up like a normal-looking wealthy man walked out of the horse carriage and waved his hand behind him. His personal bodyguard, who was already familiar with his itinerary, went off into the alley in search of an eating house, where he would wait patiently for his master.</p><br/><p>After Zhang Yiqi had entered the brothel, he tried to signal the manservant to leave as he walked along the stone pathway that was hidden by the row of green bamboos and headed towards the courtyard near the small stream. At the instance, the responsible censor had turned into a regular customer of the brothel. His face of seriousness and concerns for the citizens were gone an and was replaced by a uniquely relaxed and pleased expression.</p><br/><p>Since he was the regular customer, he would not need any manservant to guide him the way. Moreover, he was afraid that others would notice his presence. The building within House of Red-Sleeves was made up of individual small courtyard, making them highly private and confidential. Also, he would always make an appointment before visiting, to avoid any embarrassing situation such as full house.</p><br/><p>As for safety, he was rest assured. Law and order in the Chang'an city was always good. Other than those brainless men who loved to get themselves into meaningless fights, and the extremely low chances of murder cases that occurred in the north, south and west sides of the city, no one dared to create trouble in the building of House of Red-Sleeves.</p><br/><p>That's because everyone knew that this building was related to Chang'an Local Government, and that Mistress Jian was supported by a woman with the strongest authority in the world, which was the empress. Though the fourth princess had already returned from the grassland, other than her, who would dare to cause trouble for Mistress Jian?</p><br/><p>Mistress Jian was indeed an amazing person. Initially, she was being forcefully brought to Chang'an from South Jin Kingdom by the previous emperor and was asked to build up the reputation of House of Red-Sleeves as the world's no. 1 song-and-dance troupe. For these years, she had managed to train numerous top courtesans and obtained a glorious result in the industry. What made Zhang Yiqi impressed was that as the boss of a brothel, she could actually enter in and out of the palace without any restrictions. There were even rumors spreading that the relationship between the empress and her was as close as sisters!</p><br/><p>As Zhang Yiqi walked on the stone pathway and stared at the small courtyard that was getting closer to him, his mind was filled with the amazing legends of Mistress Jian. He silently confessed that should anyone be able to obtain her favor, that person's life must be plain sailing. In fact, if not for his own pride, he would have pounced himself onto her.</p><br/><p>Never did the censor know that just a few days ago, a lad that had reached Chang'an recently had attracted Mistress Jian's attention. Though he was not yet her favorite, he had, afterall, met her in person. What he could never expect was that this lad was half-leaning on the railings on the third floor, and was staring at his own back with a faint smile on the face.</p><br/><p>A rough plan was designed for the mission tonight, so it was unlikely that this mission would involve Dewdrop. However, to play safe, Ning Que had reached House of Red-Sleeves in the afternoon today. Unlike the past few days where he would visit Dewdrop and linger around at her small courtyard, he had headed directly to the main room to chat with the maidservant Xiaocao. This had shocked Xiaocao as she shyly teased him for walking into the wrong room.</p><br/><p>The moment when Zhang Yiqi had entered the brothel through the side door, Ning Que had already noticed him. Afterall, he had been following this censor for the past few days, how could he ever forget the look of the censor's back? He leaned on the railing and smiled faintly as he saw the back view disappearing into the bamboo forest. He did not move, for he did not wish to drag Dewdrop into such matters. Since he had chosen not to visit that courtyard today, he naturally could not execute his plan at that courtyard.</p><br/><p>\"I'll let you, this old thing, to enjoy for the last time.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at his target's backview, and he suddenly recalled Dewdrop's words that night. He imagined the dirty look of the old censor and could not help but shiver at the thought of it. He then murmured, \"Guess this is considered your last chance to be served by a lady as well?\"</p><br/><p>As the maidservant, Xiaocao, was too busy serving Mistress Jian, she happily took the box of honey dates handed over by Ning Que and left. Ning Que grinned at her as he continued to lean on the railing and looked around the brothel.</p><br/><p>Thinking that it was almost the time, he familiarly walked to the staircase at the back and made his way to the side door by walking in the shadow. He then discovered the horse carriage with the marking he had made previously. As he casually walked over to the horse carriage, he exerted a force using his palm at the shaft.</p><br/><p>The horse that stood in front of the shaft turned and looked at him in doubt as it snorted loudly. Ning Que had lived in the City of Wei for many years and had been an experienced robber in the grassland. Hence, he was an expert in handling horses. He casually slapped the horse's butt once and that horse immediately became tamed as it comfortably tapped its hind legs on the ground.</p><br/><p>The bodyguard, who was waiting at the eating house in the alley, subconsciously looked at the direction of the horse carriage. When he saw no one, he continued to lower his head and enjoyed his meal with the remaining dishes on the plates.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Every courtyard came with a wooden bathtub, but whenever Zhang Yiqi was done with business, he would head over to the sauna house beside the side door for a bath due to a sense of inferiority from within. Scrubbing of his back would make him feel energized again, and the individual room in the sauna house made him feel safe. Moreover, it was convenient since he could board his horse carriage at the doorstep the moment he was done with the bath.</p><br/><p>His plan for today was the same. After a bath, the censor wore a pair of silk trousers and lay on the bed wrapped with cotton cloth as he habitually waited for the old lady to scrub his back.</p><br/><p>Since the scrubbing of back required refined salt, milk and wood oil, the old lady would need some time to prepare for them. Hence, Ning Que was fully prepared and was only waiting for the right time to launch his attack. While waiting, he could not help but recall the beautiful scenarios he saw at the small courtyard. He then thought of Dewdrop's delicate skin and he started to feel warm again, just at that time, there was a hatred and evil expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Today, Dewdrop had once again rejected Zhang Yiqi's request of serving him alone, which made him feel terrible as he scolded softly. \"She's just a rotten bitch played by many men, how dare she arrogantly reject me? I've spent lots of silvers on you and yet you don't even appreciate at all. What a heartless woman.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is she despising me for my rank? Women are indeed dumb. As a censor of Sixth Rank, should I be relocated to any of the department, I would definitely be promoted to the Fourth Rank. No! I would be of the Third Rank!\"</p><br/><p>Just then, the door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>A person entered the room with soft footsteps, heading towards the side of the bed.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yiqi stopped his cursing as he shut his eyes and prepared to enjoy the scrubbing. As a warm towel was spread out and placed on his back, he could not help but moan in relaxation.</p><br/><p>Then he instantly stopped moaning.</p><br/><p>This was because another hot towel was squeezed directly into his mouth as both his hands and legs were tied tightly to the small bed.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

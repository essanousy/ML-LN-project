Once he ascertained that there were no problems, he folded the paper carefully and stuck it back into where he first found it in the book.</p><br/><p>He rose and stuck the book into its place before walking to the east windows. He bowed deeply and politely to the female lecturer who nodded in return.</p><br/><p>He should have gone down the stairs after that, but a sudden thought struck him. The female professor had been writing in the old library for many years. She must be Somebody in the Academy. She was so quiet and friendly, if the person who had left him a message was willing to give him some pointers, who is it to say that she wouldn't?</p><br/><p>As a poor lad who has over 2000 taels but still has to count his pennies over a simple breakfast, he figured he must grab hold of this opportunity. After a momentary pause, he said respectfully, \"Teacher, I forced myself to forget the shape of the words and have gained a little knowledge. I was wondering if this method is a good one?\"</p><br/><p>The female professor looked. There was a long stretch of silence before her mouth cracked into a soft smile. \"According to the rules of the Academy, even students from the Magic course who have yet to enter the Second floor can only depend on themselves to read and come to understand the books here. You have no potential for cultivation, and yet, you understood all these through sheer determination. While what you've understood might not be completely right, it is still laudable. I cannot break the rules of the Academy, so I can only say this.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que bowed deeply and said politely, \"Thank you for the pointers, teacher.\"</p><br/><p>The female professor looked at the lower case script that she had been writing for countless years and said calmly, \"Forgetting the shape of the character while reading intentionally. Being intentionally unintentional is a form of psyche.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew that he had yet to attain the stage of reading the character but forgetting its shape. What he was doing now was simply dismantling the character. It was far from that stage. He did not know what intentional meant in this case and could not help but shake his head. He muttered what the professor had said under his breath repeatedly and walked down the stairs.</p><br/><p>It was late at night and there were not many people on the first floor of the old library as usual, however, it was unexpectedly rowdy. Situ Yilan brought Jin Wucai to the very front while Chu Youxian stood at the side of the stairs. Near the shelves further away, stood Xie Chengyun and Zhong Dajun.</p><br/><p>Was this entourage waiting for him? Ning Que looked at his peers downstairs, stupefied. He asked Chu Youxian who was beside him, \"what's going on?\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 you made it down yourself?\" Situ Yilan looked at him in surprise.</p><br/><p>Ning Que laid out his hands helplessly, \"I think I managed to walk down the last time too.\"</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan smiled. \"The rules of the Academy stated that freshmen will be separated into different groups when they enter the Academy. There are always those from other states or countries who have never been to Chang'an. The meeting today is to bring everyone out to shop, drink and talk. Our group wanted to get together. Wucai and I grew up in Chang'an, so we are responsible for leading you guys around today. This gathering was supposed to happen days ago, but we pushed it back since you were on medical leave. We didn't want to bother you upstairs, so we waited here.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the teen beside her to find that she had already shed her student robes and changed into a light purple dress. She did not look as strong or fierce as she did in her archery robes but rather feminine instead.</p><br/><p>While he was impatient to hurry back to Lin 47th Street to tell Sangsang all about his wondrous experience today, he knew that he could not avoid this gathering. What more, his classmates from Classroom three had waited and pushed back the gathering date for him. He had to participate no matter what. He said, \"No problem.\"</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan laughed refreshingly, \"Your candidness is great. You're not like Chen Zixian who ran off with the excuse that he has got something on at home. We all know that he's hanging out at a gambling den.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que stiffened slightly upon hearing Chen Zixian's name. He knew she was talking about their classmate who was the son of a rich businessman and not the old man who could not shut his eyes beside a stack of firewood.</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan looked at the students around her and called out clearly, \"Does anyone have anywhere they want to go specifically? Or any Chang'an delicacy that you want to try? If not, I'm going to make the decisions.\"</p><br/><p>The foreign students laughed and pronounced that they had no objections to that. Her shiny dark eyes turned and looked at Ning Que. \"Shall we go for a drink?\"</p><br/><p>\"I have no objections.\", he said.</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan looked at his face and teased, \"Chu Youxian said you didn't have to pay to visit the House of Red-Sleeves. Why don't we go there? I believe you don't have any objections to that.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que was startled. He had wanted to say that he did object to that, but she had already turned to announce their destination. The excitement of the crowd rose visibly upon hearing that.</p><br/><p>A student from Gushan commandery shook his head and declared, \"It isn't easy to witness the best song-and-dance troupe in the world. This journey to study in Chang'an is indeed worth it!\"</p><br/><p>A student from the Capital of Great River Kingdom said seriously, \"Not bad at all, I must see the favorite dance group of the Tang Emperor.\"</p><br/><p>A former captain from the Hangu said, \"of course, everyone must write some good phrases to commemorate this event.\"</p><br/><p>All the students nodded in agreement. They all looked like artistic young men and women, but everyone knows that these students were not really interested in the songs and dance, but the famed scarlet women. They were not thinking about writing poetry, but wanted to tangle in the sheets of the brothel. While they cannot let themselves go, what with Situ Yilan and other ladies from prominent households tagging along, hanging around the seducing scent of perfume and powder was nothing to scoff at.</p><br/><p>Ning Que clutched at Chu Youxian and exclaimed, \"Can women\u2026 enter brothels?\"</p><br/><p>\"There is nowhere that these women cannot visit in Chang'an. The House of Red-Sleeves is a dance troupe accredited by the palace. Nobody can say anything if they want to watch the songs and dance. \" Che Youxian explained.</p><br/><p>A hand darted out through the hollows of the shelf. A slender student clambered out slowly. It was the acclaimed genius, Wang Ying. He looked at the crowd and asked timidly, \"Can I go with you?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the young boy of 14 before looking at each other. Situ Yilan chewed on her lips and her eyes darted around before saying, \"Wang Ying, you can't go. You're from classroom four.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The great Tang has always wavered between simplicity and strength and liberality and romance. To be more accurate, the people lived on the lines between the two. Those who have grown up in Chang'an talked about their country affairs with simple strength and were liberal and romantic in talking about literature. There were never any conflicts between the two. The most serious official of the imperial court can visit a bar to play a song for a blind girl after court. The women talking in the alleys can wipe their tears away after talking about the war on the frontiers.</p><br/><p>That was why the brothels in Chang'an was different compared to any other brothel out there. It was not promiscuous, for there are times where people could indulge in politics, war, dance, and music all at the same time. Other than officials who thumb their noses and live their life criticising others, it was a perfectly appropriate place to hang out for any government official or rich businessman.</p><br/><p>Speaking of brothels, one must, of course, talk about the House of Red-Sleeves. The bamboo courtyard had never had a signboard, but everyone from Chang'an and the Tang empire knew that the place was a signboard by itself. It would always be known for the secret love affair between the previous emperor and his wife. Its glorious past shining through the silent facade of the building. The House of Red-Sleeves was as resplendent as always. Tonight, it was romantic, the songs and dance were fanciful. Tonight, no one will sleep, seduced by the atmosphere of the place. Tonight\u2026 the place became a slightly messy.</p><br/><p>When the twenty over students of both genders from the academy filtered into the brothel, some shyly, some with pride, the expressions of the patrons made up of rich businessmen and court officials froze slightly. They left hurriedly after recognizing some of the female students who had cross-dressed.</p><br/><p>It was not uncommon for girls to cross-dress in the liberal city of Chang'an. Neither was it uncommon for father and son to patronize the same women. But to have the two generations gathered in the same place was awkward. However, what was interesting was, even in the awkwardness, the elder generation will always make way for the younger generation. Like right now.</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan gathered everyone around a seat. She watched the figure hurrying out of the door who closely resembled her fourth uncle and had to bite her lips to stop the laughter from welling out. She gathered her skirts and sat down, calling for the manager. \"I know we cannot reserve the place, but it should be alright if we all sat in the front hall to watch the songs and dance, right?\"</p><br/><p>The manager had long recognized her for who she was and dared not offend her. He smiled bitterly, \"Miss Situ\u2026 or would you like me to call you young master? It will be done as you say.\"</p><br/><p>\"You're an interesting fellow.\" Situ Yilan's eyes rolled over him and tossed him a gold leaf, all the while saying, \"Bring the wine, fruits and food. A wealthy man will foot the bill today. Also, get Miss Lu Xue to come accompany me. You said she'd entered the palace when I visited last year. She can't be here today as well, no?\"</p><br/><p>The manager could not hide the look of inconvenience on his face and smiled with great difficulty, \"She is not in the palace today, but His Majesty had planned a great feast to celebrate the princess's return. The ladies are tired from the practice. Miss Lu Xue is the lead dancer and have been given a one month break. It's really up to her if she wants to come down or not.\"</p><br/><p>Dewdrop was one of the best ladies of The House of Red-Sleeves. But Lu Xue's status was very much different. She was the lead dancer in the song-and-dance troupe and it was rumoured that the Empress had once praised her. Nobody can make her drink with the patrons downstairs if she didn't want to.</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan was but just a young girl. She was simply curious about drinking and making merry in brothels and did not want the company of girls who were indiscriminate about the company some of the girls kept. Lu Xue was different, so she was slightly upset upon hearing that she was on a break.</p><br/><p>Ning Que lowered his head and entered The House of Red-Sleeves with everyone else. He and Che Youxian maneuvered themselves into the most obscure spot and eavesdropped on Situ Yilan and the manager while ruminating over who was going to settle the bill that night. He looked at Che Youxian compassionately after a while and said, \"She said a wealthy man will foot the bill today. It seems like you're going to have to pay today. It's your job as the wealthiest man and landlord of Chang'an.\"</p><br/><p>Che Youxian flicked his fan open and said sarcastically, \" It's obvious, the wealthy man paying tonight bears the surname Ning.\"</p><br/><p>He stood up after saying that and yelled at the manager jokingly, \"Huashao, don't look down on us, look at who's sitting beside me. Why don't you hurry up and get Lu Xue and Dewdrop here.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She bit hard on her lips so as to clear her mind and trembled, \u201cWhat are you doing? Will you turn to Buddhism?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo just washed his head by the well. Clear well water fell off his head and damped his clothes. Upon hearing Mu You\u2019s words, he replied without turning back, \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in reading some Buddhist scriptures.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu You\u2019s voice was still trembling. \u201cAs much as you respected Eldest Brother, you didn\u2019t care when he told you to consult with Buddhist scriptures. They were just two kids who are ignorant about cultivation. Why did you take them seriously?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo looked at the hair scattered around the well, and spoke again after a moment of silence, \u201cI hated Buddhism throughout my life. However, it recently occurred to me that I might have missed something there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu You replied sadly, \u201cIn order to find a way in Buddhism, you have to be a monk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo turned to her, looked at the tears on her face and said, \u201cWhen did I say I would become a monk? I hate Buddhism because those monks do not produce anything nor take care of their parents. How could I become a monk? I meant to read some Buddhism scriptures and see if I can find some peace there.\u201d</p><br/><p>His explanation made Mu You even more heartbroken. She replied in tears, \u201cYou\u2019ve shaved your head. How could you still be lying to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo explained awkwardly, \u201cI just thought the grey hair was ugly, and gave you more troubles every morning. So I shaved it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu You could not believe him. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo nodded and came to her. \u201cYou will get used to it in a few days. Please don\u2019t be sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good I shaved. Maybe the newly grown hair will become black again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu You smiled through tears, and subconsciously reached out to touch Jun Mo\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo was very particular about etiquette and usually would not let anyone touch his body, let alone his head. But he did not avoid her this time.</p><br/><p>Yet, he was obviously stiff and uneasy.</p><br/><p>Mu You gently touched his bare head. Suddenly she realized something and reminded him, \u201cI know you hate Buddhism. But from now on you cannot make fun of the monks for their bare heads.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo frowned, \u201cReading some Buddhist scriptures does not necessarily mean I would worship Buddha. I would still scold him if the Buddha himself showed up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu You could not help laughing. \u201cWhatever. You can no longer mock their bare heads.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A guest arrived at the Sword Garret. He was dressed in an indigo gown and carrying a long sword. He was middle-aged, yet he was still charming and elegant.</p><br/><p>As a powerful man of the Knowing Destiny State, he certainly deserved great courtesy. However, the students at the Sword Garret showed him exceptional respect not because of his high stage, but because the Sage of Sword had ordered them to. This was not only because of his unique background, but also because this man was worthy of respect.</p><br/><p>They admired him for his courage, daring to come here despite having been seriously wounded in the eyes by the Sage of Sword years ago, or the fact that he was already a national enemy of the Great Tang.</p><br/><p>Cheng Ziqing looked at him and said, \u201cPlease come in, Mr. Chao.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in the indigo gown was Chao Xiaoshu, also known as Old Chao from the Spring Breeze Pavilion.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Sword Garret was built between sword-like cliffs.</p><br/><p>In the mountain behind these cliffs, there was a huge cave with a hidden tranquil pond in it. Only a small hole at the top of the cave allowed some light to filter through. Liu Bai, the Sage of Sword lived in a cottage by the pond.</p><br/><p>When Chao Xiaoshu entered the cave, Liu Bai was not at home but fishing by the pond. Fishes were swimming in the chilling pond water. And there was no hook at the end of his thread.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu came to Liu Bai and bowed.</p><br/><p>Without turning to him, Liu Bai said, \u201cIt was said that great men never use hooks when fishing. I was trying to see if it works. I didn\u2019t manage to catch any fish, but there you came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu replied, \u201cAs the Sage of Sword, why do you need to learn from others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai put his pole aside, shook his head and said, \u201cEveryone should learn from others. Even the Headmaster of the Academy once learnt from the farmers, not to mention ordinary people like us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu agreed, \u201cIndeed. So here I am, to learn from you, Sage of Sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indifferent as he was, Liu Bai replied, \u201cA few years ago, you reached the State of Knowing Destiny merely by observing the lake in the imperial palace in Chang\u2019an. Then you came to me via the South Jin Kingdom, inviting me to show off my skills. For the sake of the Tang emperor, I agreed to your request, which caused you to become blind for months. Even if you have improved over the years, how could you stand up to me? If only you were enrolled to the Second Floor of the Academy back then, you might have had the slightest chance of winning. But how dare you come to me again now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour skills are as massive as a roaring river, while mine is as weak as a murmuring creek. How could I match up to you? Still, just as water always flows downstream, some things have to be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu smiled and continued, \u201cI understand that I\u2019m far from qualified to challenge you. But I am about to go on an assignment, which might cause me to lose something very important. I want to leave with no regret. Over the years, I have found friendship, brotherhood, a family, and aging but still healthy parents. I was able to rebuke the Abbot in the City of Chang\u2019an and have not spent my years idling around. I did have some accomplishments throughout my life, not huge ones, but I was happy. I did have a few missed opportunities, but I do not regret it. I never lacked courage when encountering powerful enemies and I have never failed to stay calm. I\u2019ve led a fruitful life for the past decades.</p><br/><p>His calm and gentle voice resounded through the tranquil cave, and it became firmer when it echoed back from the rocky cliffs, as if it was metal clanging against each other.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai\u2019s eyes lit up as he found this man to be increasingly interesting. He stated, \u201cNow I know why you are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu put on a slightly ashamed smile and confirmed, \u201cMy life\u2019s greatest regret is being unable to take even one strike from you back then. Therefore, would you please grant me one more strike from your sword? But please do not kill me as I have something to fulfill, something that\u2019s even more important than my own life. I know it is an absurd request, but I wish you would honor it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai laughed and said, \u201cHow could I not satisfy such a ridiculous request!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was noon. The sunlight finally began to filter into the cave from the hole above, shining upon the cold pond. Fish hidden in the water plants came out to take advantage of a moment of warmth.</p><br/><p>However, they quickly hid back among the plants not long later, startled. The fearsome sword strikes created a pressure that suppressed the light, and the fierce sword intent that emanated threatened to cut the water into countless pieces.</p><br/><p>Four distinct, sharp sounds rang out, before the cave descended back into silence.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai was sitting by the pond, as if he had never moved.</p><br/><p>His ancient sword was back into the sheath, as though it had not been drawn out.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu was holding only half of his sword, with four broken pieces scattered in front of him. He had attempted to transform his single sword into five, intending to use four to withstand the four strikes from Liu Bai. But he lost again.</p><br/><p>As pale as he was, Chao Xiaoshu\u2019s eyes got brighter. Wearing the blood stained gown, he seemed very satisfied. After all, he was able to withstand four strikes from Liu Bai. He had no more regret.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai stared at him and asked, \u201cAre people from the Tang Empire all so cruel to themselves?</p><br/><p>Liu Bai was the world\u2019s most powerful man. Throughout the years, he had several chances to go beyond that threshold and reach a higher level than the Five States. But he had been suppressing his power by staying in the cave, until the fight in the Verdant Canyon where he was forced by Jun Mo to release his strongest sword strike. And thus, he had reached the superior state he had been reluctant to step into. At this stage, he was more sensitive to the subtle changes in earthly matters.</p><br/><p>When his sword was getting close to Chao Xiaoshu, he immediately comprehended the minds of the Tang people.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu replied with a gentle smile, \u201cThere are lots of Tang people like me. If the South Jin Kingdom seeks an alliance with the Great Tang, and the Sword Garret fights alongside the Academy, we might even shake the heavens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Bai remained silent.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu rose and bowed, then stepped out of the Sword Garret. The autumn breeze lifted a piece of his broken gown, and revealed a bloodied sword wound, a gash that looked so long it might reach the sky.</p><br/><p>His Ocean of Qi and Mountain of Snow was completely destroyed. He could no longer continue cultivating but only live as a commoner. However, he felt so refreshed and relieved as he stood in the mellow breeze.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu left the South Jin Kingdom and came to a small town between the border of the Song and Yan Kingdoms. He leased a place in the market, built a small house, and set up his business of painting and calligraphy.</p><br/><p>After a short while, two lads from afar arrived at the town. He hired them as helpers and his business picked up pretty quickly. It was not long before everyone found out about this businessman of fine taste, including those celebrities in town. People knew that he came from the City of Chang\u2019an, and he was elegant but not arrogant. He was capable but did not show off and was courteous to everyone including the poor and low. Neither did he try to extort the poor. He was as refreshing as a mellow breeze.</p><br/><p>He was always nice to the poor and low. When beggars came to him, Chao Xiaoshu gave them money and served them tea. However, as kindly as Chao Xiaoshu treated them, even the most desperate beggars would not bother him too much knowing that they were not the appropriate guests for such a business of fine arts. The Butcher, greasy as he was, showed no interest to these paintings and calligraphy. A butcher\u2019s business was, after all, about meat.</p><br/><p>Paintings and calligraphy were always associated with tea and liquor. Not the game for the Butcher, but they were full of attractions to the Drunkard. When the Drunkard found about Chao Xiaoshu\u2019s talented tastes, he never left the store again with only exceptions of his daily meals.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When Chao Xiaoshu arrived at the little town, Liu Bai left the Sword Garret and went to Linkang City.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai and his sword had always been the pride and honor of South Jin Kingdom. He should have been welcomed anywhere like a god. Yet when he entered Linkang City, no one paid him any attention.</p><br/><p>After all, no one would have believed that most common-looking figure could be the Sage of Sword. They would be even more appalled if they knew that such a figure was walking through the mud-choked streets to the east of the city.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai came to that worn-out cottage and turned to look at Ye Su who was teaching a class to children. When Ye Su raised his head and saw Liu Bai, he helplessly shook his head, saying to the children, \u201cLet\u2019s call it a day now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

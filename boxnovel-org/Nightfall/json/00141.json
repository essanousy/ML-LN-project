It was unknown where that news came from. However, according to the instructors' response, it had basically been determined to open the Second Floor the day after tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that to enter the Second Floor of the Academy was difficult, even more difficult than climbing into the sky. Those students were clear that they probably would not encounter such a lucky thing as being blessed by Haotian. So, the people who could enter the Second Floor should be Xie Chengyun or the other five students in the course of magic skills. Therefore, after school, some people began to appear to encourage them.</p><br/><p>This matter actually had nothing to do with Ning Que. As a classmate, he was forgotten by the Academy students and became a nobody marginalized by the others. No one could expect that his entire mind was focused on the Second Floor. After class, he intended to go to the old library for the suggestions of Professor Yu or Chen Pipi because he wanted to know whether he could enter the Second Floor at his current level and state. But before leaving, he was forced by Situ Yilan out of the Academy.</p><br/><p>In Miss Situ's words, for this kind of collective activity, he needed to participate in it no matter how unsocial he was, even if he was marginalized by his classmates. If he often appeared and no longer walked alone in the woods and meadows like a ghost, then there would be a day when their resentment for him was resolved.</p><br/><p>Ning Que never thought that he needed to try so hard to fit into the social circle of his Academy classmates, exchanging that attitude to get friendly circumstances, but Situ Yilan was extremely kind to him in daily life. Thus, after a moment of thought, he also left the Academy for Chang'an City with the students.</p><br/><p>The students selected a gathering place in Southern Chang'an, which was a restaurant that had been rebuilt from an elegant and expensive mansion just beside a lake. There was a plaque hanging above the restaurant, on which was its name written by the Libationer: Victory House.</p><br/><p>The Victory House was the topmost elegant restaurant in Chang'an City, which covered a huge area and had extremely refined luxurious decorations and furniture. Its guests were the officials of the Imperial Court and the wealthy people from the four cities. If the Academy had not been famous enough, it would have been extremely difficult for them to book a table in the open air.</p><br/><p>Now, the spring was warm and the grass was growing taller. There were several layers of veil-like leaves in the mahogany tree outside the mansion that danced with the spring breeze, which was extremely beautiful. Over 100 young men and women smiled beside the bar or happily circled the lake or lifted the veils to walk through, suddenly making it the best place for them to have fun.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stood in a common corner, holding a small teapot in his hand and calmly watching his joyful classmates in the spring breeze. He thought that he would probably not see any enthusiastic faces later on during the feast. So, he sat in a corner in a daze and decided to leave early. As a result, he summoned the manservant from the Victory House and gave him some money to call for someone to take a message to Lin 47th Street. Therefore, Sangsang could bring the horse carriage here and wait for him outside.</p><br/><p>After a long period of time, the prodigal students chose the most comfortable table beside the bar. Those student couples who were lovers went off somewhere peaceful behind the veil into the bamboo forest. Not until then did the large lakeside terrace become gradually quiet. Situ Yilan acted as the leader of the Chang'an ladies army and stood up to generously say a few words, which were nothing but a blessing for the six people in the course of magic skills to achieve good results in the coming days as well as a wish for all classmates to make academic progress and the like.</p><br/><p>After this, all kinds of nuts and delicate food were served. The students started drinking and enjoying themselves. In the liveliest place, one could clearly hear the flattery and blessing of the students toward those six people, including Xie Chengyun.</p><br/><p>\"I heard that the Second Floor would only recruit one person this time.\" The child-like Linchuan Wang Ying looked at those big brothers and sisters around, and then turned to the side and asked, \"Did they have the same rule before?\"</p><br/><p>Xie Chengyun smiled and looked at all his classmates around him. He calmly answered, \"Every time the Second Floor opens, the rule is different. This time, it's possible to recruit only one person. Though it's pretty difficult, I will try my best to meet the expectations of my classmates and pay back the teachers' cultivation.\"</p><br/><p>Zhong Dajun opened a fan with a snap and said with a laugh, \"Chengyun, you are now in the No Doubts State. And even Professor Cao called you the most skilled person in the course of magic skills and believes that you can go to the Second Floor. If you don't have the confidence, then who else can enter the Second Floor this year?\"</p><br/><p>Linchuan Wang Ying thought about it and could not help looking slightly gloomy. He swiftly showed an admiration for Xie Chengyun on his young face and then said, \"Brother Xie, if you do enter the Second Floor later, please remember to tell us exactly what it looks like in there. I'm really curious about it.\"</p><br/><p>Xie Chengyun gently patted the shoulders of this lad and said, \"You are still young. Even if you can't get into the Second Floor this time, you'll make it next time. You'll see it for yourself.\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, a rushing of hoof beats resounded outside the Victory House. The students drinking beside the lake did not care about it because there were often some cavalries galloping in Chang'an City every day. Only Ning Que, who quietly sat in the corner, looked up to see where the hoof beats had come from, for he knew these cavalries were not the Yulin Royal Guards but the border army soldiers, who had truly experienced the bloody battlefield.</p><br/><p>A moment later, a young dusty general in a military uniform went over to the lakeside terrace led by a few subordinates. He looked at those students drinking in the spring breeze and could not help slightly frowning, lifting up the veil to go directly somewhere much quieter inside the house.</p><br/><p>The feeling of blood and iron carried by several Tang soldiers was extremely different from the relaxed, casual atmosphere at the lakeside terrace. When they appeared, the Academy students subconsciously lowered their voices. The officers, dressed in military vests and light armor, marched forward with long easy steps and looked very powerful. However, they turned several tables askew, which brought about some unhappiness in the Academy students.</p><br/><p>The Tangs valued military exploits the most and the border guards were their most beloved ones. If it was on a weekday, even the ministers of the Imperial Court would not care about the slightly reckless movements of these officers. However, here at the lakeside terrace party, those Academy students were extremely young, and more or less kind of arrogant in nature. Therefore, some students did not hold the anger in their hearts but sneered toward the backs of a few officers, and then said, \"Even if Xu Shi were to come here personally, he wouldn't dare to disrespect our Academy even a little bit. But these military soldiers are actually acting so supercilious.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Shi was the Defender-general of the State, certainly the topmost of the Imperial Army. But in those proud Academy students' eyes, he seemed to not be particularly powerful. Those Tang officers, who had been striding forward, suddenly stopped upon hearing those words. The young general turned his head and coldly looked at the Academy students.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, the young general said in a faint tone of irony, \"It turns out to be the Academy students. In the spring, you don't go hunting in the mountains but hang around together in the city. Our successive generation is really getting worse.\"</p><br/><p>The Academy students on the terrace could not tolerate that, so they all got up and wanted to argue with him. Unexpectedly, the young general did not retreat and seriously continued, \"When I read in the Academy, the proud one had to have true ability. Now you guys have only learned a little superficial knowledge but begin to show off with your comical talent...\"</p><br/><p>Not until hearing those words did all the students know that the young general was actually a Senior Brother from the Academy. They could not help keeping silent and did not know what to say. But the young general did not let them off and reprimanded them. \"Even if Xu Shi were to come here personally, he wouldn't dare to disrespect the Academy even a little bit? You are right indeed. But you must remember that General Xu respects the dean and the instructors, not useless students like you!</p><br/><p>\"In the future, behave yourselves outside. If you let me hear that the Academy students are making some arrogant comments again, don't blame me for beating you based on the Academy rules!\"</p><br/><p>The first lesson of the Academy was about etiquette, which was also their rule. The Academy's rule was that whoever had more power or a higher status was in the right. It was the teaching that all students had long kept in mind. At this time, they heard that this Academy predecessor was about to take out the Academy rules, so naturally, no one dared to randomly retort.</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan opened the veil, looking at the situation there. Then, she could not help suddenly laughing and said when looking at the young general, \"Brother Hua, you're a dignified Senior Captain of the Gushan Commandery. Why are you angry with these little sisters and brothers?\"</p><br/><p>Listening to these words, the students looked at the young general with even more different eyes. The Gushan Commandery Senior Captain, Hua Shanyue... was a famous character of this young generation in the Tang military. No wonder that he behaved so powerfully just now.</p><br/><p>Hua Shanyue looked at Situ Yilan, who had come from behind the veil, and sighed as he shook his head. He said, \"I forgot that you were still studying in the Academy. There is something urgent today. I'll go to greet the general tomorrow evening.\"</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan glanced around at this most-secluded backyard of the Victory House and figured out who he was here to see after anxiously coming back from the Gushan Commandery. With a slight smile, she said, \"Later, I'll go inside to pay my respects.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course you can.\" Hua Shanyue faintly glanced at the Academy students around him and suddenly saw some familiar faces in the corner. He slightly hesitated but did not say anything as he continued with a smile, \"You can take Wucai. But don't bring any other unrelated people.\"</p><br/><p>\"The best students of the Academy are here.\" Situ Yilan gave him an untraceable reminder with a smile.</p><br/><p>Hua Shanyue gratefully smiled and understood what she wanted to say. Then, he quickly left after making a bow with his hands folded in front.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>When everyone was drunk, the lively place became even more lively and the desolate one even more desolate. Situ Yilan unexpectedly avoided the eyes of the other students and quietly went to the most common corner behind the veil. She looked at Ning Que, who was stretching half of his body to look for a frog, and frowned while saying, \"Why don't you want to talk to them?\"</p><br/><p>\"They look repulsive and make boring speeches.\" Ning Que saw a water reptile on the moss of the lake sneak into the dark and he regretfully sighed. He turned around and looked at her to say, \"This is probably how I appear in their eyes, so why should I have to get close to affect their appetites?\"</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan seriously looked at him and said, \"You've been wandering like a ghost in recent months. I really don't understand it. Don't you want to clear your name by telling them that you didn't avoid the semester exam bet?\"</p><br/><p>\"The semester exam bet is really such a boring matter. Of course, I'm not used to being wronged. But since I have been wronged, I'll look weak, diffident, and disgusting if I were to join them again.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered with a smile, \"Of course, I'll clear my name.\"</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan asked, \"When?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought for a moment and then uncertainly replied, \"Maybe... the day after tomorrow?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

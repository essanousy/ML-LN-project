Papal Cavalrymen, are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Academy had a high reputation. But the old general of the Yan Kingdom felt no pressure because countless wars in human history had proved that facing the charge of an armored cavalry and arrow shower, even the strongest cultivator in the Knowing Destiny State could not survive. No one was able to survive an arrow shower unless he had entered the Limitless State.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that the Second Brother was powerful, but no one knew just how powerful he was. During the fight in Lanke Temple last autumn, even though he successively fought against Ye Su and Qi Nian, he had not tried his best. However, everyone knew that because he had not gone beyond the Five States, he was not invincible and looked ridiculous wanting to stop the mighty army on his own.</p><br/><p>Sounds of hoofbeats and neighs gradually arose.</p><br/><p>400 armored cavalrymen charged toward the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>These powerful cavalrymen and horses were so heavily armored that their every step left a deep hole, kicking up dust and smoke.</p><br/><p>The entire wilderness began to shake.</p><br/><p>The friction and impact combined together, sounding like a frightening tsunami.</p><br/><p>The heavily armored cavalry was the strongest weapon for the cultivators on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Their armor was covered with magical lines carved by the Talisman Masters, which were difficult for a flying sword or other Natal Items to break through.</p><br/><p>Once the strong armored cavalry crashed into the weak cultivators at a high speed, they could kill them by smashing their bones.</p><br/><p>In the past battles, every country had killed many cultivators in this way and they never failed. Even facing the Academy\u2019s disciples, they were still confident.</p><br/><p>Anyway, they believed that the disciples were unable to resolve the situation. Facing their simple, crude, and direct charge, even if he was very powerful, Jun Mo was only a man after all.</p><br/><p>Looking at the Verdant Canyon through the carriage, Ye Hongyu looked very calm, but in fact, she was contemplating and confused.</p><br/><p>She had another thought that was different from the others of the coalition. She believed that the disciples would not give up so easily, so she expected nothing from the hundreds of riders.</p><br/><p>However, she still had not figured out what else Jun Mo could do aside from stop them with his wonderful Sword Taoism. And once he really started doing that, she could be sure that he would lose today.</p><br/><p>Even if he was so powerful that he could kill all the armored cavalrymen with his sword in the wilderness, he would be exhausted. And even if he was not exhausted, he was going to face the 200,000 soldiers of the West-Hill Divine Palace.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to stop the mighty army outside of the gorge on his own. Even Mr. Ke could not, let alone him.</p><br/><p>After they crossed over the wilderness and approached the Verdant Canyon, they began to speed up, sounding like a storm with thunder and raising dust.</p><br/><p>The situation became more serious as the dust was raised.</p><br/><p>To their surprise, the disciples at the entrance of the gorge did not look at the terrifying armored cavalry, but ignored them.</p><br/><p>The Sixth Brother was building a stove while the Fourth Brother was driving a nail into the ground, preparing something. Beigong Weiyang and Ximen Buhuo were sitting face to face, plucking the strings and covering the holes of their musical instruments.</p><br/><p>Only the Seventh Sister was worrying. She was trying to calm down by doing embroidery, but kept focusing on the Second Brother instead of the frame.</p><br/><p>The sunshine fell on the Second Brother and was reflected by his armor, shining and looking beautiful and magnificent.</p><br/><p>The 400 riders seemed not too many, but visually, they did create great pressure.</p><br/><p>Especially the armored cavalry.</p><br/><p>How wide a charge would be was not decided by the one doing the charging. The disciples were guarding at the entrance, and the war zone only allowed 10 riders abreast, even though thousands of cavalrymen were charging at the same time.</p><br/><p>The armored cavalry of the Divine Hall had an excellent tactical understanding. As the charge began, they gradually stood in a charging formation without being ordered to.</p><br/><p>However, they suddenly changed the formation once again when they were 2,000 feet away from the entrance. The front 200 riders turned to the east and detoured, rushing toward the Verdant Canyon and making way for the 200 riders behind them.</p><br/><p>This kind of charging tactic could effectively keep up the pressure and avoid the influence and interference of the impact in a small battlefield.</p><br/><p>The change strengthened the charge instead of weakening it.</p><br/><p>The sound of their hoofs was like thunder.</p><br/><p>Smoke and dust were billowing. They were now so close that the disciples could see the gorgeous details of the soldiers\u2019 armor.</p><br/><p>Looking at the charging riders, the Second Brother remained calm, stably holding the sword in his hand.</p><br/><p>The Seventh Sister\u2019s face turned pale. Squeezing an embroidery needle, she became worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Beigong Weiyang slightly raised his eyebrows. Moving his wrist and elegantly waving his sleeves, he took his fingers off the strings.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the battlefield, the mighty army, and the Second Brother, he just focused on playing the qin.</p><br/><p>As he removed his fingers from the strings, they began to vibrate and create a sound.</p><br/><p>He lifted up his left hand, which had been resting peacefully on his knee, and then put it on the trembling strings and exquisitely began to play.</p><br/><p>Ever since he began learning the qin, he had repeated this many times, so it looked so natural and skillful.</p><br/><p>Aside from Ximen Buhuo, no one was able to see the rich details and meaning within his simple movements.</p><br/><p>The strings trembled intensely, but the extent of their fluctuation was forcibly confined to a small area, which created louder and sharper notes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The small boulders on the ground began to shake and rustle.</p><br/><p>The music spread around and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Then the boulders stopped shaking.</p><br/><p>Thus, a circle was created centered on the qin with a diameter of more than 100 feet.</p><br/><p>When he heard that sound, Ximen Buhuo covered his painful ears because his hearing was the best.</p><br/><p>Wang Chi frowned uncomfortably.</p><br/><p>The Seventh Sister\u2019s fingers trembled a little.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the Second Brother had not moved a muscle.</p><br/><p>The sound within the area became sharp and painful.</p><br/><p>The sound outside the area vanished, making everyone wonder.</p><br/><p>However, the sound still existed.</p><br/><p>Not being able to hear it did not mean that there was no sound.</p><br/><p>There are so many kinds of sounds that people cannot perceive, but other creatures can.</p><br/><p>Horses, for example.</p><br/><p>The headmost cavalryman suddenly disappeared, creating a dull sound of impact and raising up dust.</p><br/><p>That was because the forelegs of the horse under the cavalryman had suddenly gone limp, which was fatal in this situation.</p><br/><p>Then, another cavalryman disappeared, whose horse fell heavily to the ground, followed by more cavalrymen falling down.</p><br/><p>As these falls happened in succession, their aggressive charge was quickly developing into a tragic crash. Dozens of horses fell down heavily, neighing, breaking bones, and spattering blood.</p><br/><p>In a short time, the charging cavalrymen piled up into a horrible hill of flesh and armor in front of the entrance.</p><br/><p>Inside the carriage in the south, the Great Divine Priest of Revelation opened his eyes and looked toward the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>His wise, experienced eyes revealed a complicated expression of vigilance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a beautiful sound can\u2019t be heard\u2026 why pluck the strings?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation\u2019s lips moved, making no sound.</p><br/><p>The beautiful sound could not be heard.</p><br/><p>Beigong Weiyang\u2019s music was the beautiful sounds, so the horses were frightened.</p><br/><p>The Great Divine Priest of Revelation\u2019s words were the beautiful sounds as well, so it spread toward the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>It became truly silent when the inaudible music met the inaudible words.</p><br/><p>The charging cavalrymen suddenly relaxed. Urging their horses, they bypassed the companions\u2019 corpses and started their last charge.</p><br/><p>Beigong Weiyang\u2019s fingers were blasted away from the qin, bleeding.</p><br/><p>He turned toward Ximen Buhuo.</p><br/><p>Ximen Buhuo put the vertical bamboo flute near his mouth. The wind blew through the flute, creating no sound.</p><br/><p>Beigong Weiyang happily smiled and continued playing.</p><br/><p>Outside the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>The hoofbeats resounded.</p><br/><p>The horses neighed.</p><br/><p>The soldiers shouted.</p><br/><p>They kept falling down.</p><br/><p>They kept dying.</p><br/><p>The two disciples were engrossed in their playing, but no sound was heard.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the silence was their best weapon.</p>\n</div>"}

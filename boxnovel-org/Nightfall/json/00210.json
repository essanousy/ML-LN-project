Who did not believe the legend of Son of Yama? Who could let Divine Hall make a sharp turn on attitude? Who could make the Tang Empire suppress the anger and calmly wait? Who could put Great Divine Priest of Light into the dust by saying a word?</p><br/><p>A view of a quiet mountain and an old abbey emerged in Li Qingshan's mind. His body suddenly became stiff. Many years ago, when West-Hill Divine Palace had granted him the rank of Great Divine Priest, he had visited that old abbey. It was only once in his life, but it was unforgettable for a lifetime. When he thought of it, he seemed to see that fluttering thin figure beside the cliff, feeling slightly cold all over his body.</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light said, \"I don't know what exactly the abbey dean has thought. I respected him from my heart, but I still stuck to my own ideas.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan silently looked at his old cheeks. Then Li Qingshan realized it was actually Taoist in indigo who personally had imprisoned Great Divine Priest of Light. Soon he thought of Great Divine Priest of Light was still able to adhere to his own ideas in front of Taoist in indigo and could not help feeling a great sense of admiration.</p><br/><p>\"Because I insist, I will not give up.\"</p><br/><p>The luster in the eyes of Great Divine Priest of Light was quiet and deep. He slowly said, \"I have not stopped using both eyes to see the world in these years after being imprisoned in the back of The Peach Mountain. In a certain year, I had once tried it.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan frowned and said, \"Yan territory murder?\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light did not give an positive answer, but indifferently said, \"Unfortunately, I still couldn't kill that person. I clearly see that shadow of the night is still floating in the world, sometimes thick or thin, disappearing or appearing from time to time. But in these two years, the shadow became more and more solidified, showing that person became more and more powerful.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan solemnly asked, \"Who on earth did you see? Is this person in Chang'an City?\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light gave a very difficult obscure answer. \"My eyes can only see him there, not see his existence. One day I saw him appear in Chang'an City. So I was so anxious to come to Chang'an City.\"</p><br/><p>Although he said he was anxious, the old man still looked calm on his face, no sense of anxiety at all.</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan kept silent for a long time, as if to keep thinking in his heart to judge these words. Eventually he slowly but firmly shook his head and said, \"The legend is just a legend. No one has discovered Underworld from the ancient time to today. Headmaster of Academy has travelled around the world for years. I heard that the abbey dean is also floating in the South. Presumably they are looking for the Underworld. If even the two of them failed to find the Underworld for so many years, then the Underworld inevitably is not a real existence. If there is no Underworld, there is naturally no Yama. Without Yama, there is naturally no Son of Yama.\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light said, \"Of course there is Underworld, there is naturally Yama.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan stared at his eyes across the winter wind in the lane and asked, \"Then where is that Underworld?\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light said quietly, \"I don't know.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan said, \"Then why are you sure there is Underworld?\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light replied. \"Because it exists.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan suddenly felt like he returned to Scent Workshop of many years ago and met the crown prince who was more shameless than himself. Except beating the opposite, there was no way for him to carry on a normal conversation.</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light looked at him and said smilingly, \"There are records of Underworld invasion and Invariant Yama's existence in \"Ming\" Handscroll. But they were lost millenary years ago, for that ancestor took \"Ming\" Handscroll into the Wilderness. Thus no one has seen it, so it was gradually forgotten and even turned into an unreal legend.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan frowned and said, \"However, you have never seen 'Ming' Handscroll.\"</p><br/><p>\"I really didn't have the Lucky Chance to see the authentic 'Ming' Handscroll. But you must not forget that both that ancestor and I were Great Divine Priests of Light, and the inheritance of some narratives persisted in an unspeakable way.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan looked at him and shook his head. He sighed and said, \"God, have you ever thought that you just gave up all to be against the whole world because of your illusion and an unreal legend?\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light shook his head and said, \"My Taoist Heart is clear. What you see is what you believe. Then you naturally believe what you have seen. As long as you believe, then the illusion is often real.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan moved forward one step after a moment of silence. When his grass shoes fell on the ground, a very light airflow splashed upwards, as if a stone fell into a calm lake causing circles of ripples.</p><br/><p>\"Only the Haotian can see all the world and all realities by one glance. Although you have a God tittle under the sky, you're a human being rather than God and Haotian.\"</p><br/><p>The eyesight of Great Divine Priest of Light fell on the top of his right foot moving forward. There was no trace of mood change in his voice. He calmly said, \"Because I am not God or Haotian, you don't believe me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan's right hand was exposed outside his sleeves and looked very delicate. It was in the air shaking slightly, as if holding a dragon body that was constantly struggling to bounce. And his sword in the sheath behind him uttered a buzz, like a dragon who was about to go out.</p><br/><p>\"Even if you are God, there is a God-stunning Array in Chang'an City.\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light shook his head and said, \"God-stunning Array would not be interested in an old man like me.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan took a step forward. The more stringent buzz the long sword in the sheath uttered, the more strongly his right hand was shaking.</p><br/><p>He looked at the old face of Great Divine Priest of Light, and said in a low voice, \"I know you will come here to see. So I let the South Gate put an Encircling Array Tactical around. I want to try to keep you here.\"</p><br/><p>\"You can't.\" Great Divine Priest of Light said, \" Even the Confinement of Priest of Judge couldn't trap me, let alone the Escape-proof Net.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan said, \"Escape-proof Net was granted by Haotian. Can't it compare with Judge God's confinement?\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light replied. \"Confinement cages the heart and Escape-proof Net cages the body. It's naturally more difficult for the heart to get out of the cage than the body.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan turned to be silent, showing his agreement with this judgment. Then he said, \"God-stunning Array will not arise for you. But if you have to get out of it, you're bound to use all the aura of your state. Then the big array tactical will have its own way to suppress you.\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light quietly said, \"I am just an ordinary old man in Chang'an City.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan said, \"I'm here. You can't always pretend to be an ordinary old man.\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light looked at Master of Tang Nation who was slowly walking towards him and smiled to say, \"Qingshan, you are a person with a great Lucky Chance. When you were young, you got to know the Emperor of the Tang Empire. You were respected in the secular world and also chosen by the elderly Taoist on the abbey so as to easily enter Knowing Destiny State and be much favored by his Majesty. But it is also because of your good Lucky Chance, you have never experienced the great fear between life and death in your lifetime. So how can you threaten me now?\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan was so despised by him, but did not show any anger on his face. He smiled and said, \"As I said earlier, if I were not your opponent, which was also a natural matter of course, I never expected to keep you here by myself.\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light's eyes in his sockets became deeper and deeper in color, gradually becoming a pair of stark dark gems. He looked at the most subtle changes in Qi of Heaven and Earth in the street and alley and perceived increasingly dense breathing sounds around. Then he indifferently said.</p><br/><p>\"I have also said before that you had a good Lucky Chance, too powerful but too little experience. When you first became Master of Nation, Liu Bai decided to challenge you and was stopped by Yan Se. So in your life, you have never fought with the most powerful men in the world. You don't understand that the number of enemies does not make much sense for people like you and me, unless it is so huge that it can make the earthly ground sink.\"</p><br/><p>After those words were finished, the dead leaves were floating above the streets again and dozens of crossbowmen appeared in the streets and alleys. Their sharp crossbow arrows reflected the coldness of chill and tight crossbow machines clearly gave off strong implied strength. Dressed in black official uniforms, Imperial Center Administration's cultivation strongmen also gradually gathered around. In some farther workshops' rooms, Array Tactical Masters of the Tang Empire, responsible for the launch of Encircling Array Tactical, were constantly perfusing Psyche Power to the array eye.</p><br/><p>Hoof sounds started like a thunder. The armored black cavalry of the Tang Empire, invincible in the world, began to assemble here in a fast speed. Their huge weight made the street ground shake up fiercely, as if the ground was about to sink at any time.</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan looked away from the mottled walls of General's Mansion. He looked at Great Divine Priest of Light's face and said with a deadpan expression, \"Although you're God, your flesh is still mortal, fragile and vulnerable. Today in front of General's Mansion, I'll let you die. It can be considered to retrieve some late lights for those innocent people who have died in General's Mansion.\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light said, \"I am the light.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan micro-satirically said, \"I did not expect you had changed from keeping the law to being so proud after being imprisoned for fourteen years.\"</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light calmly replied, \"What you said makes sense. Pride is contrary to the teaching law. More accurately, it should be said that since Headmaster of Academy is not in Chang'an, then I am the light.\"</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan kept silent.</p><br/><p>With the momentum of the Dragon and Tiger to step into the streets, this Master of Tang Nation and Great Divine Priest of Light had so many interpellations, whose content was amazing but said in a calm tone, as if it was like tea competition. They hid all those fightings and aggressions in the wrist turning and the spoon picking-up. They observed each other's Taoist Heart and fought with their Taoist Hearts. When this conversation was over, it seemed that there was no outcome. However, it could also be said that Great Divine Priest of Light has won the victory. Therefore, there was no need to talk about it again.</p><br/><p>Strong sounds of machine spring were heard and sharp crossbow arrows were darted like a heavy rain. The sharp sound of arrows darting to the air made the ears painful and caged Great Divine Priest of Light's body from all directions, not leaving any gaps.</p><br/><p>Almost at the same time, the Tang Empire's Array Tactical Masters, hidden in the faraway workshops in the distance, started the Encircling Array Tactical. In the streets outside General's Mansion, Qi of Heaven and Earth was experiencing a drastic change. Countless turbulences of primordial Qi turned into unmanageable primordial Qi locks, forcibly locking all the space around Great Divine Priest of Light.</p><br/><p>After a clear dragon buzz, the long sword behind Li Qingshan was humming and shattering the sheath. Then it flew like a lightning and became a Blue Dragon in the air. Within a short instant, it flew across half of the streets, bursting into Great Divine Priest of Light's old cheeks with the dragon-like hissing.</p><br/><p>This was a long-planned slaughter of the Tang Empire. Because its target was the horrifying Great Divine Priest of Light, they had well prepared for it. There were many follow-up arrangements in addition to these mighty attacks on the streets.</p><br/><p>Whereas, the opposite's response was very simple.</p><br/><p>In the face of torrential arrow-rain, Encircling Array Tactical locking heaven and earth, and that flying sword turning into a Blue Dragon, a straight light came out from the old man's deep eyes. And then the second, third, thousands of, innumerable lights.</p><br/><p>Great Divine Priest of Light gave off countless lights.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Long Qing looked at the thin pamphlet and wanted to say something. When he finally uttered his words, it was far from what he originally wanted to say. \u201cThe Verdant Canyon is still blocked. It is very hard for the Tang people to get to the south. With Qinghe Prefecture to its North, the South Jin Kingdom is now on its own. The Sword Garret has lost Liu Bai. There\u2019s no one to protect Linkang. If you want him killed, I can do that any time.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cNo need to hurry. Let\u2019s work on the more important matter now.\u201d The Abbey Dean said, \u201cWe are expecting a very important guest today. You wait here and don\u2019t waste any opportunity to gain some insight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Qing was a bit surprised. He wondered, with the Headmaster gone, Liu Bai dead and the Chief Monk of Scripture never leaving the Xuankong Temple, who else could be treated as a very important guest by the Abbey Dean?</p><br/><p>Right then someone knocked at the door of the stone cottage. He knocked carelessly, with no rhythm at all. It seemed like he had not been used to being a guest or he was seriously drunk.</p><br/><p>Long Qing opened the door. A refreshing wind rushed in upon an annoying squeak, together with some charming smell of liquor and a middle-aged man wearing an ordinary cloth gown.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man seemed nothing special. He had some wrinkles and grey hair but did not seem like he was old because his skin was fairer and softer than those of a young girl and his black hair was darker than that of a newborn.</p><br/><p>It was hard to tell his age. Or rather, he was a man of no age.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Long Qing was stunned. He suddenly realized something and his pupils constricted. The peach blossom started blooming in the hole in his chest and he was ready for a fatal strike.</p><br/><p>He was not from the Divine Halls of West-Hill yet he had come atop Peach Mountain to the plateau. No one from the Divine Halls was able to sense him, including Long Qing. This could only mean one thing.</p><br/><p>He was Distanceless!</p><br/><p>The next moment, Long Qing regained his calm and recollected his furious psyche back to the Ocean of Consciousness. The peach blossom in the hole in his chest stopped blooming and closed slowly.</p><br/><p>The middle aged man had loosened the flagon from his belt and started drinking. He kept boozing like a tornado on the sea. He never put the flagon down and liquor kept coming out of it.</p><br/><p>He was Immeasurable!</p><br/><p>The States of Distantless and Immeasurable were both great Divine Abilities above the Five States of cultivation. Throughout the history of thousands of years in Taoism, the Abbey Dean was only one to reach both states. Today Long Qing met the second one.</p><br/><p>In front of such a high ranking cultivator, Long Qing realized there was no point for him to stand up. Therefore he calmed down and reasoned this must be the very important guest his master had mentioned.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cSir, please come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Drunkard walked into the stone cottage with one hand holding his flagon and the other behind his back. He looked around the stone cottage and mocked, \u201cIt has been so long. I didn\u2019t know the West-Hill was on such a decline.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice sounded elderly, like antique bricks and bronze rubbing against each other. It pierced right into everyone\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Long Qing turned pale. He felt his Ocean of Qi and Mountain of Snow shaking or even collapsing upon those words. He tried hard to take a deep breath and applied his extremely firm psyche to barely keep his Taoist Heart, his Ocean of Qi, and Mountain of Snow.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard turned to Long Qing. It was to his surprise that this young priest was able to calm down himself. He said, \u201cI take back my previous comments. The young people in Taoism were better than I had expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean was already paralyzed but he was never affected by the Drunkard\u2019s voice. He looked at Long Qing and smiled with content. \u201cHe have made great progress these years.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard looked to the middle-aged priest behind the wheelchair and praised, \u201cYou are even better.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest smiled and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The middle-aged priest looked too ordinary for anyone to remember. He was easily drowned in the darkness and had no fame at all in Taoism or in the world. The Hierarch and Long Qing were only aware that he was a disciple of the Abbey Dean and already reached the state of Knowing Destiny. They did not even know his name.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be a nobody. However, since the Abbey Dean was forced by the Headmaster to stay away from the land and confined to the South Sea, he was the one who actually ran the Zhishou Abbey or even Taoism. He had done so much quietly and calmly throughout the years. How could he be ordinary? Others could not tell the difference, but for someone like the Drunkard, he was obviously extraordinary.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest did not care about worldly fame, but being a cultivator, how could he truly be freed from vanity? Therefore, he was very pleased by the praise from the Drunkard.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you are still the best.\u201d The Drunkard turned to the Abbey Dean in the wheelchair and said, \u201cI have to admit if you were still in your full glory, the Butcher and myself together would barely be your match.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean smiled at that. \u201cThose are all gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the Drunkard suddenly turned the conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t understand. You are a wastrel now, so how dare you to invite me here? Aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019m going to kill you?</p><br/><p>Although he had praised Long Qing and the middle-aged priest standing in the darkness, that was nothing but compliment. He could still easily the three of them as long as he wanted to. \u201cIf I am not wrong, Haotian should have visited the two of you in the small town. That was why you showed up outside the City of Chang\u2019an. That was also why we, Taoism, had a break. We are grateful for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean looked at him with a smile, \u201cThen why would you kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He put it clearly. Both of us are working for Haotian now, so why would you kill me?</p><br/><p>The Drunkard looked into his eyes and said, \u201cIf you were not a wastrel today, you probably would be of equal importance. However, you are nobody now. Why would Haotian even care if I were to kill all of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean said calmly, \u201cIf the gate to the Divine Kingdom could not be reopened, you will eventually be a nobody too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard was slightly shocked. He did not expect that a wastrel like the Abbey Dean would be aware of such a secret. He said with a cold voice, \u201cSomeone like you can contribute nothing to those heavenly matters.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The Abbey Dean said, \u201cIt was said when the Chief Monk gave the preaching, there were countless ants flying up as they bathed in the sunlight. Although they couldn\u2019t reach the sky, they became countless flaming spots as if that was the gate to Nirvana.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chief Monk he mentioned was definitely the Chief Monk of Scripture of the Xuankong Temple. The Drunkard understood what he meant and frowned. \u201cYou are so conceited. How could Haotian considered you pious?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean answered, \u201cHaotian\u2019s perception of human beings would never change no matter what we do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cI\u2019m not Haotian and I do change. Now I want to kill you even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean asked, \u201cWhy do you want to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cBecause your conceit makes me afraid. I\u2019m the Drunkard. Do I even need a reason to kill?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean continued calmly, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to pretend to be mad. That\u2019s not going to work with me. I know you are neither Ke Haoran nor Liu Bai. You are just addicted to alcohol.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard was a bit stunned and said, \u201cSo what kind of person do you think I am?</p><br/><p>\u201cAddiction to alcohol is indulgence, and addiction to meat is greed. The two of you have been cultivating on human desires. The human desires are overwhelming and indestructible. You survived the previous Ever Night just because you cultivated on these desires. Therefore, you are cowards. The stronger your desire for survival is, the more fearful of death you become.\u201d The Abbey Dean said to him with a smile, \u201cYou said previously you have not been to West-Hill for a long while. I know that was a lie. Actually you\u2019ve never come to West-Hill because you are afraid. You are afraid of being found by Haotian.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard became stern.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The Abbey Dean continued, \u201cIn the teaching of our Haotian Taoism, the human desires are our original sins. You and the Butcher are steeped in your sins. Now that Haotian has promised to cleanse your sins, I suppose you should no longer be as cowardly as you used to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cBut what you are going to do is against her will.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean shook his head and said, \u201cYou are wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard asked, \u201cWhy am I wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking the human desires and the cause and effect concept taught by Buddhism into consideration, we would be able to see through truth of most things and what every human being actually desire for. Xiong Chumo sought for glory, magnificence, and the worldly fame. Therefore he cared nothing but his power.\u201d He glanced at Long Qing and turned back to the Drunkard, \u201cYou and the Butcher want immortality, while Haotian wants to return to the Divine Kingdom. She might forget that, but we, as her followers, should constantly remind her. If she could no longer remember it, then we have to find a way to send her back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard asked, \u201cSo that\u2019s not against her will?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean answered, \u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard kept quiet for a long while. Then he looked at the wise Abbey Dean and sighed. \u201cI never met anyone as weird as you. Please excuse me for not going to keep your company.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean said calmly, \u201cYou have to stay on my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard mocked, \u201cThroughout these years, the Taoists dared not to mess with me. Now it has changed, huh?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The Abbey Dean asked, \u201cHow about Haotian?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cHer telling me that in person is completely different from you speculating her thoughts. Not to mention that your speculation is probably against her will.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean said, \u201cYou could go take a look and help me send a message.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard frowned and asked, \u201cSend a message to whom?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean explained slowly, \u201cI can\u2019t travel much now. The way to the west is too long. I can only rely on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard finally confirmed what he had speculated. He turned dramatically and shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s extremely audacious! There\u2019s no chance to win! Even if she is much weaker now, she is after all Haotian. Throughout the cyclic existence of the human world, all those who dared to disobey Heaven all died. Even the Headmaster lost to her. How could someone like you and me win?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are wrong. This is not disobeying. It is \u2026\u201d The Abbey Dean said calmly, \u201cTo proceed on behalf of Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>To proceed on behalf of Heaven \u2014 what if Heaven would not speak or approve? In that case, how could they proceed? By floating on the sea?</p><br/><p>Yet none of those would be the Abbey Dean\u2019s choice.</p><br/><p>He was extremely firm. If Heaven could not do this, then I will proceed on behalf of Heaven. As long as I pursue and execute Heaven\u2019s Rules, no one could claim me wrong, not even Heaven.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div></div>\n</div>"}

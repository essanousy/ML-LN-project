The initial Awareness State was the first glimpse of the cultivation world that ordinary folks would see when they started cultivating. What cultivators could see at that time would determine how far they would go in the cultivation career. The Knowing destiny State gave rise to the possibility of departing from the mortal world. It was the beginning of cultivators leaving the secular world. As such, when cultivators crossed the threshold in Haotian Taoism, they would often be able to see the future that they couldn't see before and also sense some mysterious signs.</p><br/><p>Long Qing was now a Grand Cultivator after having fallen off the cliff when fleeing the Zhishou Abbey. He had meditated in the valley's poisonous mist and received Tao enlightenment, breaking the realm and entering the Knowing Destiny State. His cultivation state had long surpassed that of the past, but unlike what was stated in the classics of the West-Hill, he had not sensed the future or gained any premonitions when he entered the Knowing Destiny State like his predecessors. He had only vaguely sensed something when he heard the cries from Zi Mo and the others, as he stood on the edge of the cliff, watching the setting sun.</p><br/><p>The sun was about to set and the world was about to be plunged into darkness. His actions were a direct defiance of his teachers and sect. Long Qing's heart was cold. Could all the things that have happened be like what the abbey dean had said, that they happened because it was the will of Haotian? Or was he just deceiving himself? Had he already turned his back on the light and joined the darkness, becoming a follower of Yama?</p><br/><p>Long Qing looked at the setting sun that was about to be swallowed by the mountain. He smiled, self-mockingly, for he was unable to ascertain any of his speculations; they were still not something that he could yet reach.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo and other people felt extremely cold as they listened to Long Qing. However, the coldness did not last long because they had seen too many deaths as they fled. They had endured too much shame and they knew that compared to the cold glances and the autumn wind of the world, the true darkness of night was much safer and warmer.</p><br/><p>They kowtowed to Long Qing again, showing their loyalty.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo knelt before Long Qing and said, \"My lord, I do not dare to keep this from you... When we fled from the Peach Mountain, we lost all our cultivation powers. We only have more experience than ordinary folks do. I do not know why you have appeared in the world once more, but you must come back here to accomplish great things. I am worried that we can't help, and we might even hold you back.\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing looked at him and said serenely, \"What I need, is your absolute loyalty. As for your cultivation powers, or lack thereof, it is not important. I heard that you are now called the fallen knights. Then I shall ask you all to get stronger and fall further with me, to the very end of the abyss.\"</p><br/><p>With that, he took out a medicine box.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo could sense the pure medicinal powers exuding from the medicine box. He could not help but tremble, as he could not believe his eyes. He said shakily, \"My lord, this is...\"</p><br/><p>He and the other fallen knights have had their cultivation powers taken away by the West-Hill Divine Palace's Judicial Department. However, they still had their Snow Mountain and Ocean of Qi. Their Snow Mountain accupoints were locked by Haotian Taoism. If they wanted to regain their powers, they would need three powerhouses who were on the same level as the Great Divine Priests to release the blockage. Otherwise, they would need to have many amazing encounters like Ning Que had years ago.</p><br/><p>The fallen knights had never hoped that they would regain their powers, because they knew that they wouldn't encounter three powerhouses at the peak of the Knowing Destiny State to help them. Furthermore, there weren't many chances for amazing encounters in the world.</p><br/><p>Until they met their direct superior on the edge of the cliff\u2014Prince Long Qing.</p><br/><p>The box in Prince Long Qing's hand contained Earth Pills.</p><br/><p>The Earth Pill was not a sacred medicine of Haotian Taoism, but from the Buddhism Sect. These pills could not revive the dead or extend life like the Heavenly Power Pill, but they could clear accupoints and hearts. It was not hard for them to clear blocked accupoints.</p><br/><p>The fallen knights received the pills from Long Qing with shaking hands. They took them, then shut their eyes and sat down with their knees crossed.</p><br/><p>The pills were called Earth Pills because Buddha had achieved enlightenment when he sat on the ground. The fallen knights sat on the ground. However, even if they recovered their cultivation powers, they would not become Buddhas, but devils.</p><br/><p>It was getting dark on the cliff, inching closer to complete darkness.</p><br/><p>Long Qing, who was dressed in a black Taoist robe seemed to blend into the night.</p><br/><p>His expression was serene as he watched his subordinates sit on the ground and use the medicinal power to break the blocks on their Snow Mountain accupoints. He did not think that it was a waste to use his painstakingly cultivated Earth Pills like this. And he did not worry about whether his subordinates would not be completely loyal to him after they regained their powers.</p><br/><p>He had been the Priest of the Judicial Department of the West-Hill Divine Palace in the past years. He was the third most powerful figure in that black Divine Hall. He was in charge of the Divine Hall's cavalry and the matters of the hall because Ye Hongyu was obsessed with cultivation. He trusted the commanders of the cavalry.</p><br/><p>After Ye Hongyu became the Great Divine Priest of Judgment, she had severly punished the cavalry commanders because of ludicrous reasons. Other than trying to use this to demonstrate her power, she had also wanted to eliminate all of Long Qing's influence.</p><br/><p>Long Qing naturally trusted the fallen knights because of what had happened in the past. And the crux of the matter was, the Earth Pill contained the blood from his heart. When the fallen knights took the Earth Pill, they became Long Qing heart's blood, which meant they could not hide anything from him.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>As an important part of the Haotian Taoism sect, the Tianshi sect of the Mountain Dragon-Tiger was the most ardent follower of the West-Hill Divine Palace. They had quite a few believers in the relatively remote Kingdom of Qi. Master Zhang was as revered as the Nation Master there. The Taoist temple on the Mountain Dragon-Tiger was resplendent. There were green trees planted around it, whose colors were untouched by autumn. They waved gently in the breeze; all of it looked like a piece of heaven.</p><br/><p>However, Mountain Dragon Tiger did not look like heaven today. Instead, it seemed to have become the legendary Underworld. Numerous bodies of Taoists were scattered on the stone tiles. Broken limbs hung on treetops and the metallic scent of blood permeated the air. Blood flowed out between the cracks of the tightly closed temple doors and the blood then congealed like glue.</p><br/><p>Master Zhang, who dressed in yellow Taoist robes, stood inside the temple as he watched the Taoists in black. His face was pale and he held his last Fu paper in his fingers. All of the disciples in the Tianshi sect were dead. He was the only one left alive, but he did not know for how long he would remain so.</p><br/><p>Master Zhang had cultivated in talismans and was already at the peak of the Seethrough State. He was just a step away from the Knowing destiny State. The Hierarch Lord of the West-Hill Divine Palace felt that he would break through the realm within 30 years and become a precious Divine Talisman Master. That was why he was always highly respected when he went to the West-Hill Divine Palace.</p><br/><p>However, none of the black-clothed Taoists respected him. They did not even treat him like an enemy. The black-clothed Taoists looked at him indifferently, as if they were looking at a dead person.</p><br/><p>\"You sinners... Didn't Great Divine Priest remove all your powers...? What happened?\"</p><br/><p>Master Zhang said with a pale face, in a hoarse voice which was filled with terror. He could recognize many of the Taoists clothed in black. He knew that they were the fallen knights expelled by the West-Hill Divine Palace. However, he had only heard a few days ago that these fallen knights had been killed by the South Jin Kingdom army and the Taoism sect. Why did they suddenly come to Mountain Dragon-Tiger? And how had they regained their powers and become even more powerful?</p><br/><p>The 16 Taoists dressed in black had all entered the Seethrough realm. Five of them were once cavalry commanders of the Divine Hall. Their flaring aura showed that they were already at the peak of the Seethrough state, especially Commander Zimo, who was about to break through to enter the Knowing Destiny State.</p><br/><p>Apart from powerful countries like the Tang Empire and the South Jin Kingdom, were there any other countries in the world who could gather so many powerhouses? The Mountain Dragon-Tiger's disciples were no match for the powerful black-clothed Taoists. Furthermore, the black-clothed Taoists were extremely bloodthirsty and cruel in the battle earlier, making them even more terrifying.</p><br/><p>Master Zhang was both afraid and perplexed. He did not know what had happened. The sinners of Haotian had not died but instead had grown extremely powerful.</p><br/><p>None of the Taoists in black answered his questions. They stood silently in the temple and looked at him as if they were looking at a corpse. It seemed as if they were waiting for someone.</p><br/><p>Long Qing appeared in the temple. He wore a black Taoist Robe with a golden belt sewn on the side. It was an image of the sun nestled in black clouds.</p><br/><p>Master Zhang looked at Long Qing and said incredulously, \"You... Prince Long Qing... You're alive!\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing said placidly, \"If you had experienced the last two years of my life, you would know that seeking death is also difficult.\"</p><br/><p>Master Zhang suddenly realized everything. He looked at the black-clothed Taoists and bellowed, \"You did this! You madman! Are you not afraid that you will be abandoned by Haotian?!\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing said, \"Perhaps you, Master, are the one who was abandoned by Haotian.\"</p><br/><p>Master Zhang said in despair, \"If that is the case, do it now.\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing did not say anything, but just looked at the man silently.</p><br/><p>Master Zhang suddenly realized that Long Qing's eyes had changed. The lines between his black pupils and the white of his eyes had blurred. A faint grey emerged.</p><br/><p>He did not know what would happen next.</p><br/><p>But he could guess that it must be terrible.</p><br/><p>With a loud roar, he crushed the last talisman in his hand.</p><br/><p>A wall of fire appeared, circling around him as if it was about to burn him to ashes.</p><br/><p>Master Zhang glared at Long Qing and bellowed from behind the fire wall, \"You devil! No way!\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing's expression remained the same. After a moment, he appeared within the wall of fire.</p><br/><p>A black peach blossom bloomed on his back.</p><br/><p>A frigid aura grew in the Taoist temple.</p><br/><p>The wall of fire was suddenly extinguished.</p><br/><p>Long Qing's eyes had turned grey and dark.</p><br/><p>Master Zhang felt as if his Psyche Power was being sucked out rapidly. Fear grew in his eyes as he looked at Long Qing's beautiful face. He cursed bitterly, \"You will die worse than me.\"</p><br/><p>There was a resounding slap as Master Zhang's withered body fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Long Qing shut his eyes for a second. When he opened them again, everything had returned to normal.</p><br/><p>He walked out of the temple.</p><br/><p>Zi Mo led the 16 black-clothed Taoists as they followed behind Long Qing. Their steps and aura were all secretly matching Long Qing's.</p><br/><p>Gradually they became one, and then faded in the darkness.</p><br/><p>The heavy temple doors slowly opened.</p><br/><p>The mountain breeze in autumn blew gently and fluttered Long Qing's robes.</p><br/><p>He felt that he had grown stronger.</p><br/><p>It was a great feeling.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

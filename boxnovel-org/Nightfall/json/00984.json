Traces of the former war were being washed away by time. Only the limping soldiers at tea houses reminded people of the grief from time to time.</p><br/><p>Sangsang came to this city of memories, but still looked calm. It seemed as if they had never left. She held her hands behind her back and strolled through the familiar streets.</p><br/><p>Entering from the south gate, they turned west to the casino first. She did not collect her wins but silently watched the gamblers as they became extremely happy or desperate.</p><br/><p>Then Sangsang went to the House of Red Sleeves. Ning Que followed her very closely and did not pay a visit to Mistress Jian. They found Xiaocao by a quiet corner in the backyard.</p><br/><p>Xiaocao looked at Sangsang, feeling confused. She vaguely remember this lofty figure she once saw in the Divine Hall of Light behind the layers of gauze. Before she could think of something to say, she found a cup of tea placed in front of her.</p><br/><p>Sangsang ordered, \u201cFinish the tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaocao felt even more confused and wondered why she wanted her to finish the tea.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cDrink it. She won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaocao took the cup and finished it, but could not even taste it. Then she found her body becoming lighter. It felt warm and cozy, and she fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared at Xiaocao who was probably enjoying a sweet dream, and asked unbelievably, \u201cIs that immortality?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang did not answer. She left the House of Red Sleeves and headed for the Grand Secretary Mansion.</p><br/><p>It was either because she did not want to meet them or that she did want want to see her tears again that Sangsang put Zeng Jing and his wife to sleep and asked Ning Que to pour the tea she made into her mouth.</p><br/><p>Ning Que held the teacup and asked, \u201cNow that your mother is immortal, how about your father? When he dies, your mother wouldn\u2019t be happy to live alone. That won\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang thought for a moment and asked, \u201cThen shall I take back the tea?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cCan\u2019t you be a bit more generous? Why not make some tea for your father too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang replied, \u201cFirst of all, I am Haotian. They are not my parents but rather the previous dwelling of my human body. Secondly, not everyone is eligible for my tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared at her in silence.</p><br/><p>She made another tea.</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled to her and poured the tea into the mouth of Zeng Jing, the Grand Secretary.</p><br/><p>Getting out of the Grand Secretary Mansion he asked seriously, \u201cIs that tea really going to make people immortal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang answered, \u201cI said I would grant them immortality.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cThen who else are you giving it to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cSince Jun Mo was reluctant, I won\u2019t force him to take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que sighed helplessly and asked for himself, \u201cHow about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cYou were never fond of tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que seemed irritated and said, \u201cWho would mind drinking some tea in exchange for immortality?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cI\u2019ve told you it is not meant for everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que became seriously angry and said, \u201cYou are my wife. Who else would be eligible for your tea if not me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang did not answer and walked eastward.</p><br/><p>Ning Que hurried to follow her and kept asking, \u201cIt\u2019s just a cup of tea. How can you be so stingy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang still did not answer.</p><br/><p>Ning Que begged, \u201cPlease, spare a cup for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang kept silent.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was enraged and shouted, \u201cIf you don\u2019t make it for me, then I won\u2019t cook for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He begged, threatened, kept talking by himself and became embarrassed along the way, until they arrived at Lin 47th Street.</p><br/><p>They pushed open the door of the Old Brush Pen Shop and stepped into the courtyard. The house was dust-free. The old cat on the windowsill was scared away upon their entrance. Sangsang went into the kitchen and then back to the front house. She sat down by the table and knocked on it.</p><br/><p>Ning Que understand what that meant. He went to the market and bought some supplies, made two vegetable dishes and two meat dishes, then two bowls of appetizing rice.</p><br/><p>It was always Sangsang who cooked the meals, except for once when she ran away from home. Now she was Haotian. How could she do such things again? Ever since they were in the Divine Hall of Light, Ning Que had already gotten used to his new position in the house.</p><br/><p>After they finished the meal, Ning Que washed the dishes, and Sangsang walked out of the Old Brush Pen Shop to visit their neighbor.</p><br/><p>For certain reasons the businesses on Lin 47th Street had been very poor. Many shops had closed throughout the years. However, after the Old Brush Pen Shop was closed, the shops recently reopened one after another.</p><br/><p>The next-door neighbor was still the antique shop that sold fake antiques.</p><br/><p>Sangsang entered the back antique shop and told the owner Mr. Wu, \u201cYou can take a concubine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon saying that, she turned and left.</p><br/><p>Mr. Wu held his teapot, sat on the old wooden armchair and looked at the empty shop. He wondered whether or not it was just an illusion. What did she just say? He did not hear her clearly but someone else did.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Wu rushed in from the backyard with a piece of wet rag in her hand. She questioned Mr. Wu with her eyes wide open, \u201cWhat the hell is going on? Are you taking a concubine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mr. Wu was still confused and asked, \u201cDid she talk about taking a concubine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mrs. Wu was filled with tears and said with trembling voice, \u201cI heard that clearly back there. Yet you are still lying to me. Let\u2019s straighten it up. Who are you taking in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mr. Wu looked innocent and said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know that woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mrs. Wu became even more angry and her voice turned ugly, \u201cHow dare you take in some woman you don\u2019t even know?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mr. Wu also got angry and exclaimed, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about! I have no idea what that is about!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mrs. Wu held Mr. Wu\u2019s collar in her left hand, and threw the wet rag onto his face. She cursed, \u201cHow dare you, Wu?! Since you have a little fortune and have been running your shop in Chang\u2019an for several years, you think you are some big shot now! If it was not because of my dowry back then, you would still be nothing but a hoodlum in the East County. How dare you take a concubine now? You have my word! There\u2019s no way!\u201d</p><br/><p>A typical family drama was taking place in the antique shop on Lin 47th Street. It was even as dramatic as operas. Screaming and sounds of falling furnitures were heard continuously.</p><br/><p>Sangsang had no idea what happened there, neither would she care. In her opinion, since Ning Que had be the king for the Great River Kingdom for one day, they had to honor the bet they made years ago. As for whether or not Mr. Wu would make it, it was his own business.</p><br/><p>Right now, she was strolling with Ning Que in Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>They went to Chenjinji Cosmetics Store but did not buy any cosmetics. They went to the market in the eastern part of the city but did not buy any vegetables. They went to the Scent Workshop but did not buy any paper or brush pens. They also went to Restaurant Songhe but did not made any reservations.</p><br/><p>She traveled throughout Chang\u2019an without leaving a trace. She just walked through all the streets she used to visit and replaced her old footprints with new ones.</p><br/><p>The City of Chang\u2019an had the God-Stunning Array. She lived here for a long time many years ago and her energy had made a great influence on the God-Stunning Array. This time, she walked through the city just to restore the array.</p><br/><p>The following day she and Ning Que returned to their courtyard house by Yanming Lake.</p><br/><p>She went to the lakeside, sat by the dam and watched the tranquil lake and the lotus blossoms. She pondered for a while and then picked several tender willow branches. In a wink, she finished weaving a dozen of small things with the branches.</p><br/><p>She had made a basket, a set of table and chairs, and a frog. Upon finishing them, she threw them into Yanming Lake instead of giving them to Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared silently at the floating and drowning objects. When the woven frog sank to the bottom of the lake, he said, \u201cThe Buddha is not the frog, neither am I the prince. Indeed there are no fairy tales in the real world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang went back to Chang\u2019an to honor their past and pay back her debts. Previously in the Divine Hall of Light she had decided to cut her bonds with the human world in this way. And so she did, which meant she was still determined to leave the human world for her Divine Kingdom.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany years ago by the campfire at the North Mountain Road of Min Mountain, you told me that fairy tales are lies. The ugly duckling turned into a swan not because of its hard work, but that it had always been a swan. I am Haotian, therefore I cannot stay. No matter how hard you try, it won\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que paused for a long while then said, \u201cYou know I have many more tricks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at the lotus blossoms and said, \u201cYes. You could activate the God-Stunning Array against me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cYou know I won\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cThat\u2019s only because you know you would never defeat me even if the God-Stunning Array were to be restored.\u201d Sangsang continued, \u201cWhy? You\u2019ve been planning it ever since you tried to get me back to Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cMy only wish is for the God-Stunning Array to cut your bond with the Divine Kingdom. None of us in the Academy ever wanted you dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang recalled Li Manman\u2019s words at the Back Hill of the Academy, and asked after a pause, \u201cWhy? I killed Ke Haoran, and will kill your Master eventually.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI\u2019ve explained this to you. The one who killed the Youngest Uncle was the previous Haotian, not you. Now you are a living person instead of some ruthless universal rules. As for our Master, he never wanted to kill you either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at him calmly and said, \u201cI have no idea what he was thinking, but I know you are lying. The Academy knows that the Headmaster will eventually fail. That\u2019s why you want me to restore the God-Stunning Array so badly. Because only when the array is restored would the Academy be able to stand against the Divine Kingdom and help your Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said nothing further.</p><br/><p>Sangsang smiled and left the lakeside.</p><br/><p>Spring glory fell on the city walls. She got up onto the wall.</p><br/><p>She stared to the mountain with peach blossoms to the far south, and asked, \u201cAre you aware of your sins?\u201d</p><br/><p>Atop the Peach Mountain were the Divine Halls of West-Hill.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of divine priests and thousands of deacons, together with numerous pious followers of Haotian were holding a magnificent sacrificial ceremony. It was kicked off upon the first thunder of spring and had lasted for many days. They never stopped the rituals even during the continuous spring rain. And their pious chanting never ceased.</p><br/><p>However, their prayer stopped today.</p><br/><p>Because a thundering voice was heard from above in the sky. It was invincibly powerful and profoundly awe-inspiring. It seemed as if the Heaven was rebuking on human beings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you aware of your sins?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

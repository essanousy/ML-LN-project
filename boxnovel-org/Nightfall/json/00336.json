If anything were to happen, it would have happened hundreds of years ago. They wouldn't leave it just for our generation.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Shi said, \"That's because we only had a Headmaster of the Academy for the last millennium. Only he could have taught those students with abilities to shake the foundation of the Tang empire.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Jinglue thought of the young chubby lad in the Chang'an Local Government who could use the Natural Stream Magical Finger with ease. He lowered his head and fell silent.</p><br/><p>Xu Shi said coldly, \"Birth, aging, illness, and death are all parts of life that Haotian has arranged for humanity. If the Headmaster of the Academy didn't die, we would not need to worry. However, if he does, we cannot entrust the safety of Chang'an and the empire in Ning Que's hands. I don't care what methods you all use, but you have to steal the array eye from him.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Jinglue kept silent. He Mingchi's yellow oiled-paper umbrella had not stopped him from listening to the conversation and he had already known beforehand what the Imperial Center Administration had wanted from the little handmaiden.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you so persistent?\" He could not help asking.</p><br/><p>Xu Shi reminisced about the past with narrowed eyes. The deep wrinkles on his face were like grooves on the ground washed away by rain. He said hoarsely, \"That's because there once was a Crazy Ke from the Academy. I do not want the appearance of a Crazy Ning. Any crazy man could take the entire Tang empire down with them.\"</p><br/><p>With that, the old general started coughing. His painful coughs reverberated in the empty room like the sound of war drums on the battlefield. It was a long time before he finally straightened up with difficulty.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Emperor Li Zhongyi sitting on the couch, quietly looking at his brother, seriously listen to his explanation. Suddenly his brow furrowed painfully, and he hastily covered his lips with a handkerchief to his chest.</p><br/><p>\"I'm not sure why the old general was so angry. Even if it might be because of his close ties with Master Yan Se back then, it's still rather odd. However, the Imperial Center Administration and the Southern Gate Temple approaching the little maidservant have nothing to do with Ning Que or the Academy. What is involved is too important, so it can't be outside the palace.\"</p><br/><p>Prince Li Peiyan did not notice the look of pain on the emperor's face. However, he felt slightly anxious when he did not receive any response from the couch after his explanation. He continued, \"The maidservant was a little odd. There is something odd about the whole situation since the Divine Priest of Light has stayed in the Old Brush Pen Shop with her for so long.\"</p><br/><p>He raised his head and looked at His Majesty solemnly. \"After a scolding from my royal brother, I have now repented. I understand the foundation of our Tang empire. I have answered to the West-Hill's invitation to enter the palace and pass on the message, but I have other thoughts. The Divine Hall's invitation to the maidservant to the Peach Mountain does not seem to bear any ill intent. According to the reports to the Imperial Center Administration, the Divine Hall intends for the little maidservant to inherit the place of the Divine Priest of Light. She is a citizen of Tang, and is also Ning Que's handmaiden. It would be beneficial to the empire if she were to inherit the position of Great Divine Priest of Light in the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"It depends on whether that rascal Ning Que is willing.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor thought about it for a silent moment before shaking his head. He waved his hand, indicating for Li Peiyan to step out.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The dim light of winter sky reflected on the smooth gold bricks on the ground, reflecting the beautiful furnishings in the secluded palace and forming hundreds of beautiful dark frames.</p><br/><p>The Emperor looked down at the vase of plum blossoms in a gold brick in front of the couch. A hint of laughter appeared on his lips before he bent over and started coughing violently. The Prince had already left the palace and there was no one around him. The leader of the nation no longer had to suppress his cough, and it sounded painful as he coughed to his heart's content.</p><br/><p>The golden curtain swayed slightly, and the Empress came in with a bowl of medicine. She sat down slowly beside him and patted him on the back with a plump arm. She said gently, \"Have the medicine.\"</p><br/><p>The couple in the Tang Palace was the strangest amongst all the emperors and empress in over a millennium. They loved each other deeply and had never lived apart since the first empress had died. There were no other concubines in the palace, and the couple stuck to each other like newly-weds no matter what. The eunuches and palace maids in the palace had long been accustomed to the way they got along, and had already left the two alone at this medicine-feeding time.</p><br/><p>The Emperor took the bowl and looked at the dark-colored medicine in it. He frowned and said, \"I'm so sick of it after drinking it for so many years.\"</p><br/><p>The Empress coaxed him, \"The infirmary master had ordered so. You have to drink it.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor sighed helplessly and drained the bowl. Then, he wiped his mouth messily with a handkerchief.</p><br/><p>The Empress took the handkerchief from him and tucked it into her sleeves. When she pulled out her hand from the sleeves once more, there was a candy in her palms. She fed it to the Emperor in a well-practiced action, as if she had rewarded the Emperor in this manner many times over the years.</p><br/><p>The Emperor sucked on the refreshing candy and leaned into the Empress' embrace. He closed his eyes blissfully and said, \"Days like these are really good. I wouldn't trade it for the throne.\"</p><br/><p>The Empress sniggered. \"Your words are like a commoner's.\"</p><br/><p>She hit the Emperor lightly as she spoke, and then, she patted his back to help with the cough.</p><br/><p>The Emperor smiled. \"Can't I speak like this? That's why I said I wouldn't trade it for the throne.\"</p><br/><p>He thought about Li Peiyan's report and then, raised his brows and laughed. \"In fact, I am a little jealous of Ning Que. He was luckier than I am to be able to learn from the Headmaster of the Academy. And he can speak freely. Even the little maidservant by his side is stronger than the woman by mine. At least she doesn't force him to drink medicine every day.\"</p><br/><p>The Empress was speechless when she heard Ning Que's name.</p><br/><p>The Emperor sat up and said, \"Even though I hate that old goat, Wei Guangming, but I still respect him for his abilities. Ning Que's maidservant had the Lucky Chance to become his successor. That was really shocking. When you have the chance, invite her to the palace and see if there's anything special about her and placate her while you are at it. After all, they must have been surprised by the events of today. Ning Que wouldn't say much, but I'm sure he's thinking of something deep in his heart.\"</p><br/><p>The Empress nodded and said softly, \"I'll arrange it.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor looked at her gentle features and suddenly said, \"Let Zhuge resign on his own.\"</p><br/><p>The Empress patted his back softly, her hand pausing when she heard that. She had always trusted Zhuge Wuren of the Imperial Center Administration. It was no secret in the palace. Then, she continued patting his back and said calmly, \"Alright.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor looked at her eyes. After a moment of silence, he continued, \"As for Tuyang City, the imperial court has issued a warning edict. It is a sin to move the army without an imperial edict. I wonder how Xia Hou will explain that to me.\"</p><br/><p>Empress's lashes fluttered. Her brother was involved in the incident and she did not know what else she could do but only stay silent.</p><br/><p>The Emperor looked at her tightly pursed mouth and sighed softly. \"The Devil's Doctrine believed in power. They have remained silent in the world and not meet with Haotian and are the most stubborn of them all. You have always been this stubborn, not to mention him. I'm just afraid that Xia Hou would not give in this time.\"</p><br/><p>The Empress raised her head and looked at him calmly in the eye. \"I will write a letter to convince him.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor nodded. \"Very good.\"</p><br/><p>The Empress suddenly said, \"The prince said that he could not understand why the military was furious. But in my opinion, I think that there are many who are worried about the Academy and how it would be when the Headmaster of the Academy leaves. You should pay attention to all these undercurrents.\"</p><br/><p>Before the Imperial Astronomer had read about the unrest in the country in the stars at night, one would often see the Empress reading reports on behalf of His Majesty in the imperial study. However, after that, the betrothal between Princess Lee Yu and the Chanyu of the Golden in the grassland as well as the rumors had made the Empress silent. She never did bother with the country's affairs anymore. However, when she was alone with the Emperor, she would still occasionally express her views as she had done many years ago.</p><br/><p>The Emperor respected his wife's opinion because he knew that she was capable. He shook his head and said, \"I will not guard against the Academy. In my opinion, any citizen of Tang who cannot learn to trust the Academy completely would not be not qualified to sit in the upper echelons of the Tang Empire. This is because it shows that they do not understand why the Great Tang is so.\"</p><br/><p>\"As for Xu Shi...\" The Emperor furrowed his brows. He did not have any suitable ways to deal with this general who had worked hard and performed valuable services to the country. \"He is loyal to the country and has performed many valuable services. It is just that he is a little cold and quick to anger. Furthermore, his lung ailment had gotten more serious. We don't know how long he will live for. Those who are on the brink of death usually view the world in darker shades. It is normal for him to be more vigilant.\"</p><br/><p>The Empress made a move to speak but stopped herself. Worry was evident in her eyes.</p><br/><p>The Emperor held her hand and smiled. \"You are still young, and our children are young. You should not be so gloomy. You have to remember, that we would not have been able to be together if not for the Headmaster of the Academy and the Academy. The Academy is as important to the Tang Empire as it is to us. I will not doubt or worry about it.\"</p><br/><p>The Empress smiled and turned away slightly. She checked the handkerchief she had tucked away earlier surreptitiously for traces of blood while the Emperor was otherwise distracted. She only became slightly happier when she discovered no signs of blood on it.</p><br/><p>She was once the Saintess of Diabolism and was the current Empress of Tang. However, she only viewed herself as an ordinary woman and did not wish to think about other things. She just wanted her husband and son to be safe and happy.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Many will be uneasy and guard against the Academy entering the human realm. The generals who guard the Tang Empire with their lives would. That's because this is the first time for them to discover that there is a threat that cannot be gotten rid of with martial strength.\"</p><br/><p>\"However, to some others in Chang'an City, this is a great opportunity. They can use the Academy's power, or stand, to gain some things.\"</p><br/><p>There was a copper brazier on a pedestal beneath the canopy of the Princess's Mansion. Lee Yu looked at the fire in the brazier and began to tell the Prince, Li Huiyuan, about a story that was yet to happen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

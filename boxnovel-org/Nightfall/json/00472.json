Thus, the soldiers standing at one end of the bridge didn't know the man with a high hat who was cross-legged in the snow.</p><br/><p>Listening to his extremely disrespectful and arrogant attitude towards General Xu Shi, the Yulin Royal Guards felt wrathful immediately. Their hairs stood on end angrily, as if they were about to pierce the armors. The soldiers wanted to directly rush to the snow bridge with swords and then kill the man on the spot.</p><br/><p>Xu Shi raised his right hand expressionlessly, and then the turmoil and impulsion behind him were suddenly suppressed. Looking seriously at the man sitting in the snow, he said, \"Does the Academy really want to break its promise?\"</p><br/><p>Looking at Xu Shi below the bridge, Second Brother said, \"The Academy neither opposes Xia Hou's retirement, nor the challenge Younger Brother issued to Xia Hou, because there's no way we can oppose them.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Shi said with a frown, \"You know I disagree with it.\"</p><br/><p>Second Brother said, \"I am opposed to your disagreement.\"</p><br/><p>Looking silently at the man on the snow bridge for a long time, Xu Shi said in a slightly hoarse voice, \"Is it the Headmaster's order?\"</p><br/><p>Second Brother said, \"No, it's my own idea.\"</p><br/><p>With his eyes slightly squinting, Xu Shi said, \"So you're stopping me on the snow bridge.\"</p><br/><p>Second Brother sat straight in the snow. His robe, like the stiff pine in the Snow-capped Peak, kept still in the wind. His behavior was extremely similar to that marvelous figure of the Academy that year.</p><br/><p>Staring at Xu Shi under the snow bridge and other cavalries of the Yulin Royal Guards, he said without any expression, \"I won't step in because I respect my Younger Brother, but I hope he can have a fair battle.\"</p><br/><p>Inside the imperial study of the palace, rage, reproach and severe arguments could be heard. 'Idiot' naming and all kinds of vulgarities began to spread around, as if they were floating and dancing snowflakes.</p><br/><p>After leaving the Academy, the Nation Master Li Qingshan entered Chang'an at the fastest speed and arrived at a small newly-renovated Taoist temple. Because of the heavy snow, the celebration for the new temple had already finished in haste. After listening to the matters that occurred around the palace, Ye Su laughed and then disappeared into the blizzard.</p><br/><p>In the streets and alleys outside the palace, there were many carriages coming. All forces from different parties sent representatives to collect information, including the envoys of other countries and the earthly representatives of the West-Hill Divine Palace.</p><br/><p>In the snow pavilion on the moat, Ye Hongyu, wearing a green taoist robe, was looking towards the direction of the palace. She just kept silent when looking at that floating bloody flag and that striking big black umbrella.</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi came from the other side of the snow street with Tang Xiaotang. Due to Tang Xiaotang's identity, Chen Pipi didn't take her along to the palace. Instead, he turned around and then walked into a closed shop in the south street.</p><br/><p>After borrowing a chair in the shop, he, with his fat and round body, moved from the snow street to the front of the palace. He looked at Ning Que and said, \"Save some strength before fighting.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \"Thank you, Senior Brother.\"</p><br/><p>His followers had already carried a table and chair and even a bowl of hot tea for Xia Hou. In front of the blood flag, he relaxingly sipped the tea in the blizzard, appearing natural and peaceful.</p><br/><p>Catching sight of Chen Pipi, Xia Hou slightly frowned but soon ignored him.</p><br/><p>Ning Que sat on the chair, and Sangsang held the big black umbrella behind the chair. Chen Pipi wanted to bandage Ning Que's bleeding left palm, but Ning Que shook his head.</p><br/><p>In front of the palace gate, the blood flag and the black umbrella were in the wind and snow. The general was sipping hot tea, and Ning Que was resting. The scene was very strange, and even a little absurd, but very terrifying.</p><br/><p>Many carriages hid in the streets and alleys in front of the palace. Besides, many people weren't on the spot, but they were also waiting for the final result with mixed feelings at their own mansions.</p><br/><p>\"The appearance of Mr. Second on the snow bridge represents the attitude of the Academy, which means that the Academy agrees on Ning Que's challenge to Xia Hou. Thus, the military of Tang can't prevent the battle either.\"</p><br/><p>The third minister of Offerings from Qinghe County took back his attention from the floating snowflakes in front of the Princess' mansion. Looking at the pair of noble royal siblings, he smilingly said, \"Congratulations to your Highness.\"</p><br/><p>The expression on Li Yu's face was very peaceful, but anxiousness hid deep within her eyes.</p><br/><p>Xia Hou was the best assistant of Her Majesty, so his retirement was a piece of good news for the princess and Li Hunyuan. Ning Que's challenge to Xia Hou even meant a better situation for them. No matter who won the battle and even though the Academy kept silent on this matter, it would also give birth to some abhorrence toward Her Majesty's camp.</p><br/><p>However, Li Yu wasn't happy, because she, as other people in the world, though it impossible for Ning Que to fight against Xia Hou. In other words, Ning Que would definitely die today.</p><br/><p>Looking at He Mingchi, who sat and kept silence on the other side, Li Yu slightly frowned and asked, \"What's Ye Su's opinion as the Nation Master met him in the small temple?\"</p><br/><p>He Mingchi shook his head and said, \"Even for the West-Hill Divine Palace, it's impossible to prevent the battle in Chang'an, because the Academy has agreed with the challenge.\"</p><br/><p>The third Minister of Offerings coldly said, \"If Your Highness is still worried about it, maybe I can, by using some measures, provoke another dissension between the West-Hill Divine Palace and the Academy on this matter.\"</p><br/><p>After listening to his words, Li Yu felt a little angry. With her eyes slightly squinting, she warned, \"Don't try to provoke the Academy by any method, because neither you nor I have the ability to withstand it.\"</p><br/><p>The third Minister of Offerings was highly respected in Qinghe County, just like a venerable ancestor. Compared with Her Highness, he had to be lower in rank, but he still felt a little uncomfortable upon hearing the words.</p><br/><p>\"Your Highness is right, and I'm going to assess the situation.\" He said expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>After gently waving his sleeves and walking out of the terrace, he left the Princess' mansion and then walked towards the Yanming Lake against the wind and snow.</p><br/><p>The snow became heavier and heavier, falling on Chang'an ceaselessly.</p><br/><p>No matter how light the snow was, it would fall on the ground eventually or would be swept into the gutters. Also, it might accumulate until next year and then become water after being shone by the sun in spring. Later, it would completely disappear in dust and dead leaves.</p><br/><p>This was a principle of the world.</p><br/><p>Something had to be done and someone would definitely appear. Many people, accompanied by the wind and snow, had arrived in Chang'an. Among them was a monk.</p><br/><p>The monk wore a worn-out bamboo hat and a shabby cotton kasaya. The expression, which was exposed outside the shadow of the bamboo hat, looked very common, but it was naturally full of determination and firmness.</p><br/><p>Through the west city gate, the monk entered Chang'an and stood on the long street in wind and snow. Maybe he didn't know the way, so he just turned around and then walked to a porridge shop. After taking off his bamboo hat, he began asking for directions.</p><br/><p>With his bamboo hat taken off, his new black-green sharp stubble could be seen, which was as resolute as his expression. However, the smile on his face looked so kind and gentle when he was asking for directions.</p><br/><p>The words 'asking for directions' weren't accurate, because the monk kept his mouth closed throughout his inquiry. When he grinned occasionally, the remains his cut tongue could be seen. So, he was a mute.</p><br/><p>For Ning Que and Xia Hou who was sitting in the wind and snow, the two hours were very long, because their bodies had already become hot, no matter how cold the wind and snow were.</p><br/><p>For the emperor in the palace and Xu Shi on the other side of the snow bridge, the two hours were very short, because the Academy's attitude stopped them from intervening the battle in time.</p><br/><p>When the time was almost up, the imperial court finally came up with an idea. With the palace gate open, Li Qingshan, the Nation Master of Tang, and Zeng Jing, the Grand Secretary of the Imperial Library, escorted by dozens of eunuchs, arrived at the scene in a hurry and then began announcing the decree of His Majesty.</p><br/><p>Prince Li Peiyan walked behind the crowd in silence.</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing ranked last among all cabinet members of Tang, but he had a special identity being the biological father of Sangsang. The Nation Master Li Qingshan was a cultivator and he usually didn't deal with state affairs. However, there were some connections between Ning Que and him. Besides, Ning Que should call him uncle due to their relations with Master Yan Se.</p><br/><p>His Majesty's ordering the two to deliver his decree was, of course, due to their relationship with Ning Que.</p><br/><p>As expected, Ning Que had to stand up to salute at the sight of them.</p><br/><p>The Grand Secretary Zeng Jing coughed and then wiped away a snowflake that fell on the imperial edict. After a while, he said, \"Here comes the edict of His Majesty.\"</p><br/><p>All people in front of the palace held their breath and kept silent.</p><br/><p>After having a look at the Prince Li Peiyan, Zeng Jing gently sighed and then raucously said, \"Please Li Peiyan, the Prince of Tang, resign your rank as a result of the previous case in the first year of Tianqi era.\"</p><br/><p>Silence filled up the whole scene. The people in front of the palace couldn't suppress their shock and looked at the Prince.</p><br/><p>That noble crown of Li Peiyan's, which was still on the snowfield between Ning Que and Xia Hou, had gradually been covered by the snow. With his hair in slight disarray, he looked kind of dispirited, but the expression on his face was still of extreme indifference.</p><br/><p>Without paying attention to others' reaction, Zeng Jing held the decree and continued announcing in a slightly trembling voice, \"Today, the treason case of Lin Guangyuan, the former Xuanwei General, is officially revoked due to the lack of evidence...\"</p><br/><p>Through the Grand Secretary's slightly trembling voice, those names on the decree were announced one by one. They floated in the wind and snow, and then struck against the vermilion wall.</p><br/><p>\"Xuanwei General Lin Guangyuan...\"</p><br/><p>\"Mrs. Lin Guangyuan...\"</p><br/><p>\"Deputy General Sha Gang...\"</p><br/><p>\"Captain Cheng Xinzheng...\"</p><br/><p>\"Secretary Lin Hai...\"</p><br/><p>\"Officer Hu Hua...\"</p><br/><p>Listening to these names, which had long disappeared in history, and the imperial orders, which recovered and improved their ranks, the people before the palace fell into absolute silence.</p><br/><p>The decree of His Majesty didn't mention rejudging the case. However, the Prince had to resign his rank, and all generals and soldiers involved were rehabilitated. Was...the result any different from reversing the verdict?</p><br/><p>People finally understood what the palace meant.</p><br/><p>His Majesty once wanted to reverse the treason verdict for the Xuanwei General. However, he failed because of the imperial situation, the West-Hill Divine Palace and the lack of evidence.</p><br/><p>Today, the Academy acquiesced Ning Que's challenge to Xia Hou, which brought a tricky problem to the imperial court. However, His Majesty still couldn't reverse the verdict when there wasn't evidence. Thus, he chose such a way.</p><br/><p>It wasn't a reversal of the verdict, but, it actually equaled to reversing.</p><br/><p>At least, it could give an explanation to those who unjustly suffered and today's Ning Que.</p><br/><p>When the announcement began, Xia Hou stood up from his chair. The decree didn't mention him, but his brows gradually frowned and then slowly sat down.</p><br/><p>Those names were still floating in the wind and snow.</p><br/><p>Xia Hou knew those names and even met those people.</p><br/><p>Over a decade ago, he once witnessed their deaths. He saw those mountains of heads with closed eyes, open eyes, despairing eyes and angry eyes.</p><br/><p>Those names were mentioned again after more than ten years, and then went into his ears in front of the palace. He became more and more silent, with his expression more and more livid. Besides, he held the chair armrests tighter and tighter.</p><br/><p>He felt neither guilty nor dejected.</p><br/><p>He was just enraged.</p><br/><p>The armchairs were crumbled into powder, and then, through his fingers, fell on the snowfield with anger.</p><br/><p>No one paid attention to the current emotions of General Xia Hou.</p><br/><p>Because the decree of His Majesty didn't mention him.</p><br/><p>From a legal perspective, Xia Hou wasn't a General anymore.</p><br/><p>What he needed to do was to accept it peacefully and then leave Chang'an in earnest.</p><br/><p>Everyone's eyes fell on Ning Que.</p><br/><p>They knew who the decree of His Majesty was for.</p><br/><p>If the palace wanted to stop the life-and-death battle, they could only hope Ning Que would withdraw the challenge invitation.</p><br/><p>His Majesty reversed the case for Lin Guangyuan and rewarded his generations today. All that he did was just for one aim.</p><br/><p>Looking at Ning Que under the black umbrella, the people before the palace thought this matter had come to an end.</p><br/><p>From the moment when he heard the three words 'Lin Guang Yuan', Ning Que lowered his head and attentively looked at the thick snow under his feet. He intently listened to those names which appeared one by one.</p><br/><p>He had never heard those names, so he listened very carefully today. However, his facial expressions were very complex, relieved, disappointed and self-mocking.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the names on the imperial edict were all announced.</p><br/><p>The Grand Secretary Zeng Jing and the Nation Master Li Qingshan walked toward him, and then solemnly passed the imperial edict to him.</p><br/><p>Ning Que took it and kept silent.</p><br/><p>With a serious expression, Li Qingshan said, \"His Majesty said he can grant you amnesty as long as you admit to previous murder cases, because you indeed have a forgivable reason. Besides, if you think the resignation of the Prince isn't enough to appease your anger, His Majesty and Her Majesty will, on behalf of General Xia Hou, apologize to you and compensate for it.\"</p><br/><p>The Nation Master said in a very low voice and the sound was covered by the wind and snow. Except Ning Que and him, no one else could hear of it, but others also knew what he was talking about with Ning Que.</p><br/><p>However, Ning Que made an unexpected decision, when all people thought that things would end here and were gradually starting to feel relieved.</p><br/><p>After putting the imperial edict on the chair behind him, Ning Que raised his palms and laughed as he looked at Li Qingshan, Zeng Jing and people in front of the palace.</p><br/><p>Ning Que started to applaud.</p><br/><p>His movement was very gentle at the beginning, but then it became stronger and stronger. The strength was so powerful that it sounded as if it was flapping against a wall. The wound on his palms split again, with blood gruesomely flowing.</p><br/><p>\"Clap! Clap!\"</p><br/><p>\"Clap! Clap! Clap!\"</p><br/><p>\"Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!\"</p><br/><p>With the sound of clapping becoming louder and louder, the blood kept coming out his palms. It fell on his body, then to his legs, and lastly to the snow in the ground.</p><br/><p>Looking at this scene, the people before the palace sensed a feeling of cold and terror again. They gradually felt chilly along with the wind and snow.</p><br/><p>\"His Majesty is very clement and the law of Tang Empire does work a little. I'm relieved and satisfied as those names on the imperial edict can be heard in Chang'an again.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said with emotion, \"But eventually, it's a pity that some names have been forgotten. I feel very sorry.\"</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing nervously asked, \"Who's been omitted? I'll tell His Majesty immediately.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que smilingly said, \"Many names in the General's Mansion have been omitted, such as grooms, cooks, maidservants and...my parents.\"</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing said with puzzlement, \"The general and his wife are conferred first...\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the snow by his feet and the blood spot on the snow, Ning Que said after long silence, \"The general and his wife aren't my parents.\"</p><br/><p>The wind and snow suddenly stopped as the words were uttered.</p><br/><p>-</p><br/>\n</div>"}

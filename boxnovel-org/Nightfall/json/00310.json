It was kind of mysterious to most people. Few people knew what it looked like or who stayed there because, since Ke Haoran, people from the Academy hardly ever showed up in the secular world.</p><br/><p>Not to mention the people in the secular world and the West-Hill Divine Palace, but even the Zhishou Abbey, Xuankong Temple, and Devil's Doctrine knew very little about the back of the mountain of the Academy. All they knew was that there were 13 core disciples studying there with unfathomable abilities.</p><br/><p>Second Brother Jun Mo and Chen Pipi were the most famous ones among all the core disciples in the upper circle of the cultivation world. Second Brother was famous for his pride and confidence while Chen Pipi was famous for his reputation as an unrivaled cultivation genius and was recognized by Zhishou Abbey when he was born.</p><br/><p>As for the Eldest Brother of the Academy, people only knew that he was a scholar with a book in his hand and a water ladle on his waist who traveled with the Headmaster of the Academy all the time. Few saw him face to face and no one had ever fought against him.</p><br/><p>However, he was never looked down upon.</p><br/><p>That was because he was the only one who was qualified to travel with the Headmaster of Academy, and proud Jun Mo talked about him with indubitable respect as well.</p><br/><p>There were so many powerful and proud men in the world, including that middle-aged man, but no one could say he was more proud and more confident than the self-assured Jun Mo. So no one would try to challenge the Eldest Brother unless he was totally crazy.</p><br/><p>So when the scholar showed up in front of Ning Que, that fist, which contained decades of killing intent and was not able to be stopped even by thousands of mountains, had to stop.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man never had a chance to meet the Eldest Brother, but when he saw the book and the water ladle, he knew for sure that he was the Eldest Brother of the Academy.</p><br/><p>Whether the Eldest Brother was sitting in an oxcart with a book in his hand or taking water from a stream, once you saw him, you knew immediately that he was the Eldest Brother.</p><br/><p>There was only one Academy in the world and there was also only one Eldest Brother in the Academy.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>That middle-aged man had struggled in the world for fame and fortune for years. He had been pondering aside the Hulan Sea and trying to cut off the past but he still had to stop his fist because he was afraid to lose. Ye Su was different from him.</p><br/><p>Standing on the peak of the Snow-capped Peak, Ye Su was trying to challenge the Eldest Brother of Academy.</p><br/><p>He was the successor of the Zhishou Abbey and the most powerful World Wayfarer of Haotian Taoism. When he was young, he was just as proud as Mr. Ke and Second Brother. So if Jun Mo had a great deal of respect for the scholar, then Ye Su thought the scholar must be an honorable man.</p><br/><p>But he would never miss the opportunity to challenge the Eldest Brother of the Academy now that he had finally turned his pride and confidence into silence and solitude.</p><br/><p>He knew clearly that he was more powerful than before, but he was trying to regain what he had lost, so he had to meet that man.</p><br/><p>This idea even became a kind of desire, the more profound he cultivated and the clearer he understood the world, the stronger the desire.</p><br/><p>Stronger than the sunshine on top of the Snow-capped Peak.</p><br/><p>Now 14 years later, he had finally met the scholar and got an opportunity to challenge him.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man tried to eliminate Ning Que on the lake for a section of the Tomes of Arcane. If the scholar did not want to watch Ning Que die, then he would have to do something.</p><br/><p>If the scholar did not take action, Ye Su was not confident that he could make him move. But now that he showed up to save Ning Que, Ye Su could force him to have a fight.</p><br/><p>A thin wooden sword was floating above the Snow-capped Peak.</p><br/><p>The sun was so bright.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the wooden sword changed into a golden sword.</p><br/><p>A strong but pure aura from the Taoist Sword had completely covered that small pool in the middle of the mountain.</p><br/><p>The snow on the Snow-capped Peak was compressed by that power into hard ice-boulders, which refracted the sunshine into colorful lights, making it look like jewelry.</p><br/><p>The movement of the powerful Taoist Sword was the best that Ye Su could do in his whole life. It had an ultimate killing intent that was inspired by his life-threatening moment during his penance in Zhishou Abbey.</p><br/><p>When seeing the Taoist Sword fly so fast and fall by the side of the pool, Ye Su sighed inside. Even he was surprised by its perfection and purity.</p><br/><p>The scholar beside the pool was a little surprised and took a glance toward the Snow-capped Peak. His old coat was covered with dust and had the evidence of travel, but it still gave one the impression that he was extremely clean.</p><br/><p>It was unknown how much time had passed, a long time or just in the blink of the scholar's eye.</p><br/><p>The ice boulders melted and turned into small streams.</p><br/><p>Standing on the snow cliff, Ye Su watched the ponding under his feet with a poker face.</p><br/><p>The powerful and pure killing intent could compress snow into ice, but now the ice was melting. It meant that the sword style was giving way.</p><br/><p>And the thin wooden sword returned to his hand unconsciously.</p><br/><p>The scholar beside the pool disappeared.</p><br/><p>Ye Su gave a mocking smile as he spat blood from his mouth.</p><br/><p>He was laughing at himself.</p><br/><p>He had known about him for a long time and been eager to meet him for years. But when they finally met, Ye Su tried his best to show the most powerful Taoist Sword and could not hold him any longer.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The most powerful successor of Zhishou Abbey could not keep the scholar from leaving.</p><br/><p>The scholar showed up beside Ning Que and asked the man at Peak State of Martial Arts to stop.</p><br/><p>Chang'an had an Academy and the Academy had an Eldest Brother. Second Brother, who was known for his pride, said, \"The reason that the Eldest Brother is always the Eldest Brother is that he is No.1 in the Academy.\"</p><br/><p>He was the No.1 in cultivation, chess, music, painting, embroidering, and cooking.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>-</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The officials loyal to the Empress who had laid low earlier on now stood straight, staring at the throne behind the bead curtain.</p><br/><p>The Tang Empire governor, Her Highness, Princess Li Yu was behind the bead curtain.</p><br/><p>The officials did not bother to hide the anger in their eyes. The deaths of almost all soldiers in the elite Tang Northeast Border Military was a rare incident that had never happened. How could the prideful Tangs accept this?</p><br/><p>Everyone on the streets of Chang\u2019an was talking about this, berating the new Emperor and the Princess for it. Xian Zhilang was elevated as General of the North under the direction of His Majesty. And His Majesty was also the one who had planned for the alliance between the Tangs and the Yans. Now that they have lost so miserably, who else but the Emperor was to take responsibility for it?</p><br/><p>Li Huiyuan, the Emperor of the Tang Empire, looked at the expressions and eyes of the officials. He was so angry that he almost broke the handle of the throne that he was gripping. He wanted to have the Yulin Royal Guards throw them out so badly. However, he could only forcefully temper his anger when he thought of how his Royal Sister had instructed him before he went to court. Then, he looked at the Grand Secretary of Hua Hall, Mo Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yan imperial palace was burned down and the Yan emperor was put to death\u2026 I don\u2019t want to defend General Xian Zhilang and the Northeast Border Military, I just want to say that they did not embarrass the Tang Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han said with a gloomy expression. \u201cIf there are any ministers who want to make accusations against the heroic soldiers who died for the country, please forgive me for insulting them and their families.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words were crass but straight to the point.</p><br/><p>On private occasions, the officials in the Queen\u2019s faction might scold and put down Xian Zhilang and the Northeast Border Military, thinking they were no better than beasts, but they did not dare to say anything in the Royal Court.</p><br/><p>No one would dare to tarnish the reputations of those who died for noble causes.</p><br/><p>Those soldiers had died for their country. However, there were still people who were alive and had to bear responsibility.</p><br/><p>The Minister of Rites came out from his spot and bowed with his hands together at the bead curtain. He said calmly and straightforwardly, \u201cI think that Your Majesty is responsible for the war in Capital Cheng. What does Your Majesty think?\u201d</p><br/><p>All was silent in the court hall.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that the Queen\u2019s faction would not miss this opportunity. However, there were not many, including the officials in the Queen\u2019s faction who would think that the Minister of Rites would speak so directly and not give the Emperor nor the Princess any chance to defend themselves.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Li Yu\u2019s voice emerged from behind the bead curtain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am responsible for everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will pay for this war with my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut before that, I ask of all ministers to think of what is the most pressing matter in the Tang Empire right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the defeat, especially since there were many Tangs who had never witnessed such a disastrous defeat, the atmosphere in Chang\u2019an city was very depressing. People might not be that gloomy, but were angry instead, when speaking about the subject. All in all, most people were not in the mood to drink and make merry.</p><br/><p>However, the Building of Pines and Cranes was brightly lit because a rich guest had booked the entire building a few days ago. After the court meeting ended, the guests would gradually arrive and the bustle would pick up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the painful defeat at Chengjing City, the soldiers of the Northeast Border Military are currently fighting hard at a foreign country. But we are meeting in a wine house. Even though we don\u2019t need to fear gossip because we have done nothing wrong, we can drink in remembrance of those who have fought valiantly and died. But we cannot touch the ladies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Lord Zeng Jing still refusing to come? This is such a crucial moment, how could he still feel relaxed enough to tend to his garden at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone has different goals in life. Do not force him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Queen\u2019s faction was having a meeting at the Building of Pines and Cranes tonight. They thought that they were not doing anything wrong and had nothing that they were unwilling to share, so the meeting was held openly.</p><br/><p>The Minister of Rites looked at everyone present and frowned slightly, saying, \u201cThe meeting today is for us to discuss the matters on the Eastern Border. I wonder what your opinions are of what Her Highness had said during the court meeting earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>An official laughed coldly and said, \u201cPay with her life? How are her words any different from the women swearing on their lives in the markets? Her Highness stayed in the Wilderness with barbarians for so long. Where did she learn that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Minister of Rites scolded, \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? Shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The official apologized but refused to let the matter rest. He continued, \u201cI would like to ask everyone here, in the history of the Tang Empire, were there any Emperors or Governors who paid with their lives due to a defeat at war? Since there weren\u2019t any, then what did her Highness mean? Did she say that just to shut everyone up? When the war is over, will we really force her to acknowledge her crimes and condemn her to death? This is so absurd!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taichang Temple\u2019s secretary stroked his beard and said after a moment of reflection, \u201cBut by doing so, Her Highness can dispel the resentment of the soldiers\u2026The country is in critical condition right now. The measures taken by His Majesty and Her Highness are appropriate. It is alright to move the troops of the Gushan Commandery and the Northern Military Camp to the east.\u201d</p><br/><p>The official who had spoken earlier sneered, \u201cThis is simply trying to cure the problems without curing the root of it. Is there anyone who doesn\u2019t know how to do this? I say that the Eastern Border is uninhabited right now. We can deploy the Southern troops. We all know that Her Highness is determined to use the Gushan Commandery because she hopes that Hua Shanyue can defeat the Yan army and earn her some respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Minister of Rites frowned even harder when he heard that. He said, \u201cThe Southern troops are still at the forest borders and are separated from the Qinghe County by mountains. They can only travel via the southern mountain path. The journey is long. By the time the Southern troops head to the Eastern Border to take up the posts left behind by the Northeast Border Military, the Yan army would have already attacked Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>The official was stunned when he heard that and did not say anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Li said something earlier that I think is the main point. Our nation is in a critical situation and all disputes should be settled within the court sessions. We are the ministers of the Tang Empire and should face the issue with a united front.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Minister of Rites looked at everyone and said that earnestly.</p><br/><p>Someone said worriedly, \u201cBut when will the Empress and the Sixth Prince return to Chang\u2019an?\u201d</p><br/><p>The meeting at the Building of Pines and Cranes ended quickly. The officials from the Queen\u2019s faction finally decided to stay calm for the time being. They would discuss all other things after the danger passed.</p><br/><p>However, it was evident that everyone, from the Emperor to the officials, to the citizens all felt that the Tang Empire would not fail even though they were sad and angry at the defeat at Capital Cheng. This could be seen from the attitudes of the officials, arrangements made by the imperial court to fill the gaps in the Eastern Border defense, as well as the anger of the citizens in Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren had resigned from his position as director of the Imperial Center Administration. He had also attended the gathering at the Building of Pines and Cranes. However, he was usually sinister and cruel in his dealings, so many were unwilling to deal with him. Now that he had resigned from his position, he had only been invited because of his relationship with the Empress. Who else would say anything more to him?</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren knew clearly how the other officials thought of him. He did not show any anger but was more silent than usual.</p><br/><p>To him, the other officials only knew how to boast, and they did not know what was truly important.</p><br/><p>Why did the Tang Army fail? How did the nation fall into such a dangerous state?</p><br/><p>It was because of the stupid pair of siblings in the palace who had ascended the throne through deplorable means. If they could welcome the Queen and the Sixth Prince back to the Tang Empire, the empire would enjoy peace once more and every problem would be solved.</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren did not return home after leaving the Building of Pines and Cranes. Instead, he went towards the royal city. He knew that the cultivators from the Southern Gate Temple were still following him after he had resigned. That was why he had not deliberately tried to hide his tracks. Furthermore, not everyone could enter where he was going anyway.</p><br/><p>He was going to the palace\u2019s Bodyguard Office.</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan was now the head of the Tang Empire\u2019s Bodyguard office. The calm old man who had crossed paths many times with Ning Que was just as affable as before until he saw Zhuge Wuren\u2019s face which was like that of a poisonous snake.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhuge, isn\u2019t it inappropriate for you to appear here now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan said to Zhuge Wuren, his expression heavily guarded.</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren replied, \u201cI thought, that no matter how inappropriate it is, it wouldn\u2019t be as inappropriate as your presence here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan frowned and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what nonsense you\u2019re babbling about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren smiled and replied, \u201cI\u2019m saying, there\u2019s nothing weirder than a Devil\u2019s Doctrine powerhouse being the director of the Bodyguard Office in the Tang palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan squinted slightly as a trace of coldness flashed in them.</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren walked to a chair and sat down as if he had not seen the other man\u2019s reaction. He swept the dust off the front of his robe and said calmly, \u201cSometimes, when I think about it, I can\u2019t help but admire you guys. You have plainly cultivated in the powers of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, how have you all managed to hide it from so many and become a powerhouse in Martial Arts cultivation? General Xia Hou seemed to have gained a certain power from the West-Hill Divine Palace back then. Have you learned that too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan had calmed down by then. He poured a cup of tea and drank it slowly, ignoring the other man.</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren looked at him and continued his exaltation, \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Doctrine is really impressive. They\u2019ve been trashed by Mr. Ke, and then hunted down by the West-Hill Divine Palace around the world. Yet, so many of them have managed to survive\u2026The person who had crafted this plan must have been the legendary Divine Lord Lotus. Gee, if this bigwig could have lived until now, or if General Xia Hou hadn\u2019t been killed by Ning Que, then wouldn\u2019t the Tang palace be completely controlled by you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan smiled lightly and said, \u201cYou know that no one in Chang\u2019an would believe you no matter what you say now. So you can just tell me why you came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren slowly gathered his smile, stood up, stared into Xu Chongshan\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the Empress has to do with the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, but I am sure that both you and Xiahou are loyal to her. And I am also loyal to her, so we should work together to do something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan said, after a moment of silence, \u201cWhat is it that you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren replied, \u201cSince you are loyal to the Empress, then\u2026you should know what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan said softly, \u201cYou want me to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuge Wuren replied, \u201cThe Desolate are about to go extinct. If the Tang Empire goes down, then there will be nowhere else in the world that will harbor those from the Devil\u2019s Doctrine. Since you have to die anyway, why not go down meaningfully?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shixiang stood on the wall and watched the skies.</p><br/><p>The sky in the wilderness was very gloomy. It had been like this for many days, as if it was about to rain. However, it never did.</p><br/><p>The reports of the Northeast Border Military\u2019s downfall at the Yan border had long spread to the City of Wei. The coffin of the deceased emperor was still in Helan city while it was unknown when the Empress and the little prince would return to Chang\u2019an. The entire Tang Empire was enshrouded in dark clouds, and like the City of Wei, it was unknown when the storm would arrive.</p><br/><p>Ma Shixiang looked grave, but it was not because of the difficult situation that the Tang Empire was facing. He was no one but just one of the most ordinary and lowest-ranking generals at the frontier fortress. He was not qualified and had no reason to worry about the empire.</p><br/><p>He was ordered to stay in the City of Wei, so all he needed to worry about was the City of Wei.</p>\n</div>"}

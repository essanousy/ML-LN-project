Due to his thinness, his turquoise robe looked like it was hung on a bamboo pole, uttering constant sounds every time the night wind came.</p><br/><p>One would feel terribly uncomfortable on stuffy summer nights in Chang'an. In some rich families, maidservants made masters cool with fans, and ice cubes could also lower the temperature inside the house. For the common families, they could only open the door and then half-nakedly lay on their bamboo beds in the alleyway. It was known that the higher you went, the cooler the night wind was. However, the really high Tang palace and grand city wall were certainly inaccessible to the masses.</p><br/><p>But the lanky man in a turquoise robe could stand on the city wall because he was Qi IV, the new leader of the Fish-dragon Gang in Chang'an.</p><br/><p>Cruel Qi IV was well-known in the Jianghu World. But actually, among all top executives in the Fish-dragon Gang in the past, he was the most ineffectual one. However, Spring Breeze Pavilion Old Chao had left Chang'an, and other buddies like Chang III, whose identities had been uncovered, worked for the Imperial Court. In such circumstances, he naturally became the leader of the Fish-dragon Gang.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, his one order was able to summon 3,000 brave and loyal men in indigo robes. In addition, official organizations would treat him well, because now all people had known that the Fish-dragon Gang was actually a fish that the emperor delegated to the Jianghu World in the past. Without a doubt, Mr. Qi was the only leader in Chang'an gangdom, so it was easy for him to have a view from the city gate tower.</p><br/><p>However, Qi IV, who was holding a jug of wine in the night wind, had not a bit of pride on his face. Instead, some bleakness and paleness could be seen on it, while each sip of wine was accompanied by a sighing sound. He had successfully become an art-gang leader from an ordinary gang leader.</p><br/><p>He missed Chao Xiaoshu and his other buddies very much. But now Chao Xiaoshu had gone traveling far, and it was also inconvenient to meet other brothers like Chang III and Chen VI due to their official identities. The wonderful memory of enjoying wine and meat in the past made Mr. Qi feel eager to return back to those times when he was under the leadership of other brothers, although now he had become a well-known figure in Chang'an.</p><br/><p>Just then, a man rushed from the direction of the city wall. After greeting the city gate soldier, he hurriedly ran toward Mr. Qi and then shamefully said a few words by Mr. Qi's ear with his head lowered.</p><br/><p>Mr. Qi spouted a mouthful of wine with a \"Pu!\" sound. The wine, like some mist, fell to the ground outside the city wall from a great height, which might startle the eagles nesting on the city wall. He stared and asked, \"Are you sure?\"</p><br/><p>\"Absolutely! I have sent someone to Yin'gou and got the specific information. That lad had won more than 1,000 taels of silver at Yin'gou Casino before.\"</p><br/><p>Still in disbelief, Mr. Qi touched the back of his head and said with hesitation, \"A cultivator illegally made money at the casino? Is there such a shameful person? I still feel kind of strange and confused.\"</p><br/><p>The subordinate helplessly said, \"Nobody would believe it. At the beginning, the manager of Yin'gou Casino also doubted it, but finally, he had no choice but to deliver the silver and then immediately inform us.\"</p><br/><p>Knowing that his subordinate did not dare to cheat him, Mr. Qi was certain that an extremely shameless cultivator was making money from his casino. He became furious at once when he thought of Chao Xiaoshu's previous instructions. Throwing away the little wine pot into the night darkness outside the city wall, Mr. Qi cruelly said, \"Force him to spit out all the silver, or let our fellows directly chop him into pieces! What the fuck! You aren't so powerful like those Seethrough sublime beings. You think I won't kill you just because of your so-called tricks?\"</p><br/><p>The words were true, but he could not do it directly. The Fish-dragon Gang was always disciplined and cruel. If Qi IV was forced to order his 3,000 fellows in indigo robes to hew a cultivator, he certainly could do it. However, what mattered was that there must be a sect or a master behind the cultivator. He had to look where the cultivator was from before making a decision.</p><br/><p>The city wall of Chang'an was very high, so it was not an easy job to climb up or run down. When Mr. Qi ran back to the casino from the city gate, he had already felt tired and breathless. During that time, that shameless cultivator had won more silver.</p><br/><p>Hearing the news, Mr. Qi became angrier and was in a worse mood. However, when the pushed the door open and looked at the guy, his mood and face turned extremely weird. He wanted to laugh and to cry, but he failed to squeeze any tears. He was thinking, \"What the fuck is this?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Hearing the words \"Mr. Qi\", Ning Que's face also instantly became very colorful when he saw the thin man in an indigo robe come into the room. He felt kind of embarrassed because he was making illegal money at an acquaintance's domain. However, he still said, \"Indeed we are friends... in fact not so close... How about this? Considering the face of Chao Xiaoshu, I offer you a 50 percent discount on all previous accounts.\"</p><br/><p>His reaction was very fast. The words contained three levels of meaning: First, if he behaved like they were close friends, it was embarrassing to get this silver; second, if he coldly acted like they were unacquainted, he was also worried that Mr. Qi would turn hostile; and third, he knew the Fish-dragon Gang was powerful, so he mentioned Chao Xiaoshu finally.</p><br/><p>Mr. Qi was kind of stunned by Ning Que's words and almost uttered laughter due to his anger. Then he stared at him and said testily, \"Are you sure that you want the silver of this casino?\"</p><br/><p>In Ning Que's view, they were indeed acquainted, but had met just twice. In such a situation, did he not feel embarrassed if he refused to offer the silver? If the account was small, he did not mind acting like a heroic and generous buddy in front of Qi IV. However, he had won more than 70,000 taels of silver before...</p><br/><p>For the over 70,000 taels of silver, he was willing to act like a dead body and then let Sangsang feignedly bury him, let alone disposing of the old friendship and so-called generosity. He looked at Qi IV and said after two sounds of gentle coughing, \"Mr. Qi, I remember that when we first met, you said that as long as you live, I can do anything in Eastern City.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is Western City!\" Mr. Qi replied snappily. Then he stood up and got several land titles and contracts authenticated by the government from a locked box, and he threw these papers on the table in front of Ning Que, saying, \"Anyhow, the casino belongs to you. If you enjoy such games, it is up to you.\"</p><br/><p>Feeling that he seemingly had heard some information by mistake, Ning Que rubbed his ears and then asked, \"Whose casino?\"</p><br/><p>Pouring a cup of tea, Mr. Qi said in anger, \"I said that it was your casino.\"</p><br/><p>Picking up those several contracts on the table and having a glance, Ning Que saw his own name at the bottom of the paper. He was petrified on the spot immediately, and then raised his head to look at Mr. Qi, with eyes full of shock and confusion.</p><br/><p>\"Elder brother Chao Xiaosho ordered many things before going traveling the world, and one of them was about you.\"</p><br/><p>\"What was it?\"</p><br/><p>\"He said you have been so poor these years for so long that you are eager to escape from poverty. During that night, for only just 500 taels, you followed him to kill people regardless of anything. It was really very terrible... How could an outstanding figure be subservient for just a little food? Besides, he was afraid that you are stupid enough to become a killer due to poverty, so he had prepared some assets for you.\"</p><br/><p>As if looking at a ghost, Mr. Qi stared at Ning Que who was shocked and speechless, and then angrily sighed, \"Elder brother's worry was really a hell of a foresight. A dignified cultivator illegally makes money at the casino! What the hell is this! I dare say you have become crazy due to poverty these years, right?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

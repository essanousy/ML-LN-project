It did not dare to bray, but kept shaking his head back and forth. Its hooves sounded especially brisk, and his mane, wet by the dew, danced incessantly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, it sensed that it was being watched. It turned around to look and saw the tall fat figure in the depths of the Divine Hall. It sweated buckets, washing the dew off its body cleanly.</p><br/><p>Sangsang did not punish it for its disloyalty. She placed her hands behind her back and walked to the railings at the balcony behind the hall. She looked at the young man who was slowly falling down the precipice like a leaf and did not speak.</p><br/><p>There were clouds covering the moon in the recent nights. The colors of the mountain ranges in the West-Hill Divine Kingdom had all turned darker and it was especially quiet. There was only the occasional shuffle at the precipice below the Divine Hall.</p><br/><p>No one else but her could hear the sounds.</p><br/><p>She had been standing by the railing, quietly watching since the first night. She watched as he jumped from the peach blossoms to the cliff and watched him fall dangerously. She watched as he climbed up with difficulty and watched while he waited by the eastern side of the stables every night. She watched as he returned to the bottom of the precipice silently before the sun rose.</p><br/><p>She did not do anything but only watched silently until tonight, when she saw the man on the precipice looking up, looking towards the Divine Hall where she stood.</p><br/><p>She knew he was looking at her and knew that he could not see her. She could see what was in his eyes\u2014Indifference. It wasn\u2019t an indifference where he did not care, but was one where he sent his thoughts out. In other words, he was projecting his missing her to the balcony of the Divine Hall of Light.</p><br/><p>She was the one he missed. She was Haotian, and not even mankind, which amounted to ants, had any right to miss her. That was why she felt that this was a great disrespect to her and should even be called blasphemy.</p><br/><p>The hatred and anger in her subconscious burst forth once more as she found them hard to repress.</p><br/><p>Just like how the thoughts in the man\u2019s eyes had burst forth, unable to be repressed.</p><br/><p>A crazy wind started above the seas, several thousand miles away in the Kingdom of Song, whistling in the high and distant night dome. It caused the clouds above the Kingdom of God to shake uneasily, as if they were bouncing pieces of cotton below a string which could be torn apart any time.</p><br/><p>The peach blossoms in the mountains shook and hundreds and thousands of petals fell in the wind. The countless Divine Halls on the Peach Mountain had roofs made of gold and jade, and they started to issue howling and crying sounds.</p><br/><p>The Divine Hall of Light was high up at the peak and no matter how good Ning Que\u2019s eyesight was, he would not be able to see it clearly. And even if he could, he would not be able to see the tall and plump woman standing at the railings of the balcony. Furthermore, in his imagination, if he were Romeo, the precipice would have been the area beneath the balcony and the girl standing by the railings should be thin and tanned.</p><br/><p>He looked at the spot and smiled, tossing his thoughts and his sense of loss regarding his unknown fate into the depths of his sense of perception. He calmed himself down and continued his descent down the precipice.</p><br/><p>It was then when a gust of crazy wind blew from the mountains, bringing with it the heavy stench of sea water and colliding onto him. His face felt damp and cold, and when mixed with the vague sense of light he had felt earlier on, it broke the Dhyana State that he had been maintaining.</p><br/><p>Since the Dhyana State had been broken, Ning Que naturally released his Emblematic Gesture. What was even more terrifying was that, no matter how calm he was during the danger and how he had tried to return to the Dhyana State, he was unable to make the gesture again.</p><br/><p>The wind was simply too cold and strong. It whipped around his body, howling. And everytime he wanted to make the Emblematic Gesture, it would dissipate it.</p><br/><p>Unable to use the Emblematic Gesture of the Buddhism Sect, Ning Que no longer had any connection with the precipice. He was blown by the strong winds towards the deep abyss. He was no longer falling like a leaf, but like a rock.</p><br/><p>The fall this time was even more frightening than the first night. He had only just breathed and had already fallen several hundred feet down the precipice. His speed was growing faster and faster!</p><br/><p>He fell into the deep night fog, and Haotian no longer cared for him. He might be forced out by the precipice at the next moment and could find nowhere to place his hands. He would break through the fog and fall to his death.</p><br/><p>Ning Que made the strongest and fastest response in in such a dire situation. He harrumphed and the Great Spirit in his body burst out. He stretched out his hands forcefully like two sharp blades and pierced them into the hard rock walls of the cliff. There were two cracking sounds, and his steel-like hands had broken two holes two feet deep into the wall, stopping his descent and allowing him to stop on the precipice.</p><br/><p>He had not gotten out of danger, even though he was clinging on tightly to the precipice. He was no longer able to maintain the Buddhism Sect\u2019s Dhyana State and the Isolated Array on the precipice began to attack his eyes and his sense of perception. He could only bear the pain in his eyes and the waves in his sense of perception, clinging tightly to the icy cold walls.</p><br/><p>Something even more bizarre happened. The forces he once noticed in the cloud and mist on the precipice swam up like snakes and filled his body surface in a very short time.</p><br/><p>Ning Que endured the pain in his sense of perception and released his Psyche Power to sense it. He could not ascertain what those wisps of power were, and when he looked with his naked eye, he found that they were just wisps of fog.</p><br/><p>The fog swirling between the Peach Mountain and the precipice was responsible for sealing the You Prison. It was naturally not a simple fog. Those wisps of fog had mysteriously seeped through his clothing and into his body. He did not bleed, butfelt a clear pain and a cutting feeling that entered with the fog. He felt as if he was being cut by countless sharp knives.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ning Que respected the Abbey Dean whom he fought with in Chang\u2019an. It was because he had finally understood how it felt like to be cut by hundreds and thousands of blades.</p><br/><p>What followed was even more incredible. As Ning Que\u2019s hands dug deep into the precipice, the precipice that had never moved over the past hundreds and thousands of years suddenly moved.</p><br/><p>No one could see the precipice shaking, and not even Ning Que who was very near it could. Nobody could hear the rumbling movement of the precipice. Ning Que\u2019s ears could not hear it, but his heart could.</p><br/><p>The precipice vibrated with a soothing rhythm. The vibration spread down his arms, which were stuck in the wall to his body, moving further to his sense of perception and finally to his heart.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s body began to shake uncontrollably. His clothes shook with him, casting shadows. An earthquake seemed to have occurred in the depths of his sense of perception, and the waves on the sea grew even more violent. What was most terrifying was that his heart started beating with extreme strength, as if it might tear and shatter into countless pieces at any moment.</p><br/><p>The precipice on the Peach Mountain had turned into a large war drum. As the auras in heaven and earth shook, Ning Que, who was perched on the drum would definitely be shattered into pieces by the vibrations on the drum, no matter whether he was a falling leaf or a rock.</p><br/><p>There were two arrays on the precipice where the You Prison was located. One was called \u2018isolated\u2019 while the other was \u2018shocking\u2019. When put together, it would truly shock and kill its enemies with their attack.</p><br/><p>Ning Que sensed then, as if there were hundreds and thousands of swords stabbing at his eyes incessantly, and that there was a drum beating within him. His heart might shatter at any time!</p><br/><p>If not for the experiences he had had over the past few nights, he might not even last until this moment. If not for his body that was as hard as stone both inside and out, he would have long vomited blood and died!</p><br/><p>By then, his face had turned extraordinarily pale. His pain was indescribable, and what truly made it unbearable for him were the wisps of fog surrounding him and invading him.</p><br/><p>The fog was not made from the condensation of the Qi of Heaven and Earth. Instead, Haotian Taoism had used their skills to gather the hatred of the prisoners confined in the You Prison who had died and made it into a tactical array that guarded the prison.</p><br/><p>Many of the prisoners who were eligible to be held in the You Prison were strong with great mystical powers. How powerful were their Psyche Power and resentment before their deaths? After dying, the two were merged and cultivated by Haotian Taoism. Every wisp of fog was a sharp sword full of all kinds of negative emotions in the world such as resentment and hatred. It was extremely powerful. Otherwise, how could they have imprisoned someone as powerful as Wei Guangming for several decades?</p><br/><p>No matter how strong Ning Que\u2019s willpower was to be able to endure the gruesome pain of the arrays, he would not be able to endure the cutting of those tens and thousands of blades filled with rage. After all, he was not the powerful and invincible Abbey Dean.</p><br/><p>His heart beat faster and faster and the precipice before his eyes grew more and more blurry. The blood that flowed from his lips grew and his perception gradually dulled, but the pain was just as clear.</p><br/><p>He could not hold on any longer.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to pull his hands out of the cliff, preferring to die from falling off the cliff than to stay on the terrifying precipice and in the fog, a sudden patch of bright light appeared in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>He thought that he was hallucinating, but realized that he was not at the next moment. The dark and cold precipice in front of him had really brightened up!</p><br/><p>The clouds over the Peach Mountain had been blown apart by the wind from the Sea of Storm several thousand miles away, revealing the round moon. The silver moonlight shone on the mountain ranges, and onto the precipice and himself.</p><br/><p>Sangsang put her hands together on the balcony of the Divine Hall of Light and looked at the moon in the night sky. Her face seemed especially pale, and one wondered whether it was caused by weakness.</p><br/><p>The moonlight had no heat, but when it fell on Ning Que, he felt a warmth seeping into his body. Even his wildly beating heart had become quieter.</p><br/><p>The fog between the precipices was dispersed by the moonlight. Ning Que took advantage of this fleeting moment to calm down and re-enter the Dhyana State. He made an Indifference Emblematic Gesture with his right hand and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>Just at that moment, he suddenly saw the stone window on the precipice beside him.</p><br/><p>He had seen this stone window from the opposite precipice the other day. However, he had not studied it carefully since there were the occasional wisps of clouds on the precipice and it was shrouded by a tactical array. Now that the clouds were dispersed by the moonlight, and he had re-entered the Dhyana State, he could see the stone window and the person inside it.</p><br/><p>Ning Que should take the opportunity to leave the terrifying precipice at a time like this. However, he knew that he could not leave when he looked at the stone window.</p><br/><p>Because there was a young fat person inside the window.</p><br/><p>The person\u2019s face, which had become thinner, grew round again, perhaps because of the good food in the You Prison.</p><br/><p>He looked at Ning Que who was outside the stone window and was shocked speechless.</p><br/><p>His eyes were just as clean as before and his expression just as amiable. When he was surprised, his mouth opened so widely it could fit Tang Xiaotang\u2019s fist, just like before.</p></div>\n</div>"}

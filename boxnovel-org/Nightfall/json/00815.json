His eyebrows were like the lake cast by the shadow of willows, so peaceful.</p><br/><p>The straight and broad iron sword was slowly shoved back into the sheath.</p><br/><p>He saluted the man by the carriage again and went back to his own carriage.</p><br/><p>The carriage drove into Chang\u2019an City and stopped by Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo looked at him and said, \u201cIf you insist on talking, make it a nice one. Though the Headmaster has left the mortal world, we still have the Academy supporting us. Cowards like them are no trouble to us at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que saluted and said calmly, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the dirty carriage outside the city gate, the dust on it blown away by the spring breeze, and he looked at those familiar runes; he then turned to the man standing by the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Brother is the only one in the world qualified to call this man a coward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was muted and thinking to himself because he seemed to know the man ignoring the rule of time. The man had once been noted by the Headmaster, and had shown up in one of his dreams.</p><br/><p>He once had a dream in which he was in the Wilderness. All the people on the Wilderness were looking at the sky where light and darkness had a clear boundary. He saw the Headmaster in the sky, as well as the Drunkard and the Butcher. Later he had a dream again in which the Headmaster grabbed the Drunkard\u2019s wine bag and sipped, then he bit the pork leg on the Butcher\u2019s bag.</p><br/><p>The Headmaser once mentioned two powerful cultivators who had survived the last Everlasting Night. They were no one else but the two breaking into his dreams, the Drunkard and the Butcher.</p><br/><p>When he took Sangsang to the Wilderness on the black carriage last year, he ran into the fierce battle between the West-Hill Coalition Army and the Desolate, and that was when he had realized he was actually at the place that was once in his dreams.</p><br/><p>When dreams became reality, behind the clouds in the black and white sky, Ning Que saw the Kingdom of God, the giant Golden Dragon\u2019s head and the Headmaster who was as tall as he had expected. He hadn\u2019t seen the Drunkard or the Butcher until this day.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard and the Butcher had pulled through the Everlasting Night and lived a near-eternal life under Haotian\u2019s watch. That meant they knew ways to encounter Haotian, or as the Headmaster once said, cultivation is all about living longer, which was to say that the two had reached a state that ordinary people could hardly imagine.</p><br/><p>As in the Headmaster\u2019s words, the two were no longer mortal.</p><br/><p>Among those Ning Que had known, nobody else had met the Drunkard and the Butcher except the Headmaster. So the only one who was able to find them was the Headmaster. They had turned into legends for as long as they lived.</p><br/><p>The man might have a flagon, but he had no pork leg on his back. He was not the Butcher.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was no ordinary person, yet he was still shocked and cautious when seeing the man. It took him a while before he calmed down and asked, \u201cSir. Drunkard, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard looked at him and said with a hoarse voice, \u201cI was sent here by someone else to give something back to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was still not likable. Every word of his carried the touch of the ancient emperors\u2019 tomb and the smell of silk rotting on corpses.</p><br/><p>Ning Que frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>He quit asking because Second Brother had asked enough questions. Watching the carriage that had accompanied him for years and the traces behind it reminded him of what had happened by the Sishui River.</p><br/><p>Sangsang showed her identity as a real god by the Sishui River. She was the dark night walking in the light with her lotus-like feet. She asked the Headmaster to ascend to heaven, to enter the Kingdom of Haotian. At that time flowers showered and the whole world shook.</p><br/><p>The Headmaster and Sangsang then left him by the Sishui River, so did the big black horse, the black carriage, including the Primordial Thirteen Arrows and the Big Black Umbrella in it.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had sent people there to look for the two. By the windy riverside, there wasn\u2019t a single trace of the Big Black Horse, the black carriage, or those things in the carriage.</p><br/><p>Finally, one thing had come back from Heaven to the mortal world today. Then, where were the other things and people? The Arrows, the Umbrella, the funny horse, the Headmaster and Sangsang?</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt uneasy. It took him long to calm down and concentrate on what was really happening. Who was keeping his stuff? Who was able to find the Drunkard and let him send the message?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d He looked at the drunkard and asked directly.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard\u2019s answer was direct. He did not answer at all. The Headmaster was no longer in the mortal world, so if he didn\u2019t want to talk, nobody could force him to.</p><br/><p>Spring breeze blew in Ning Que\u2019s face, bringing him not a bit of warmth. It felt chilly, or he felt cold, inside and outside, which cooled down the spring breeze passing by him.</p><br/><p>By the Sishui River, he saw the Headmaster and Sangsang ascend to Heaven and explode into shooting stars shimmering all over the sky. He was sure that Sangsang had died, or she had gone to the Kingdom of Haotian; either way, she was no longer in the mortal world now because if she were, he would\u2019ve felt it.</p><br/><p><em>\u201cThen who has taken away the Big Black Horse? Who picked up the Arrows? Who\u2019s holding the Big Black Umbrella now? Who\u2019s giving the carriage back to him? Why is the carriage in the Drunkard\u2019s hands?\u201d</em></p><br/><p>Ning Que was trying to figure it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose perturbing me shall be left behind.\u201d He chinned up and looked to the dim sun hanging in the spring sky. He fell into silence for a moment and continued, \u201cThose leaving me shall be forgotten.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the Drunkard and said, \u201cPlease come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The quiet southern gate turned tense after his welcoming. The tension flooded at the foot of the city wall and burst high into the sky.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard watched the magnificent city wall of Chang\u2019an and asked, \u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cEvery guest should be introduced inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cNot if he was an unwelcomed one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cBeing welcome or not, he is, after all, a guest, and a guest has to agree with the host.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard found him interesting, so he said with a smile, \u201cThen I am no guest at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled but inside he felt the contrary.</p><br/><p>Because one could either be a guest, or an enemy.</p><br/><p>He looked at the Drunkard and asked with sincerity, \u201cHow can you give my things back to me if you don\u2019t come inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard looked at him as if he were looking at a naughty kid, and he said, \u201cI am an old man. I\u2019ve already walked so far, do you really want me to finish the last a few steps all by myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cEven if it\u2019s only a few steps away, you still haven\u2019t come.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cYou can come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said with a smile, \u201cYou can come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The drunkard looked at the mottled city wall of Chang\u2019an and fell in silence for a moment, then he said, \u201cMaybe someday in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que responded immediately upon hearing those words, and he said, \u201cHow about today?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was an invite as well as a gamble. Or to be specific, he was gambling with his life, with the future or Chang\u2019an, with the vicissitudes of the Empire, and with the destiny of the mortal world.</p></div>\n</div>"}

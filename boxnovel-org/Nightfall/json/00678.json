In his mind, he was not the Headmaster who was qualified to fight against Heaven. He had been familiar with the joy and anger during the battles for survival.</p><br/><p>Traveling in spring, peaceful and happy, they finally got rid of death and separation. When they relaxed, they began to complain: the students complained about their teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy had you done nothing all these years? Were things too boring? If you had helped Eldest Brother, he should not have been exhausted and many people would still be alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster took up the teacup, smelling the fragrance. Looking at Sangsang, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t care how many people have died. I just don\u2019t know how to choose what is the best for the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cSince you don\u2019t care for people, why do you care for the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>His teacher answered, \u201cIf a tael of silver falls in front of you, would you pick it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at Sangsang and found the same answer in her eyes. He said, \u201cOf course I would.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the Headmaster almost sprayed the tea out of his mouth. Facing Ning Que, his designed courses were useless because Ning Que wasn\u2019t an ordinary man. He got pissed off and said, \u201cSay you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que could tell he was a little unhappy and said at once, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster added, \u201cIf a note of 10 thousand taels of silver falls, I would definitely pick it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que understood his meaning, but he thought that an attitude of clearly calculating life and interests was really cold. He sighed and said, \u201cI know I am extremely cold-blooded, but I didn\u2019t expect you were the same kind of person as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cI\u2019m not cold-blooded. I just feel numb. Anything, if you have experienced it so many times, it would numb you. I have been alive for such a long time and have lost so many people, so I take life lightly. It is just the end of nature, so sooner or later doesn\u2019t make a difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThen why have you hesitated for so long and still decided to fight against Haotian?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaning on the couch, the Headmaster looked at the sky and clouds through the windows and said, \u201cBecause\u2026 in the end, I found I didn\u2019t like Haotian at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought inwardly, <em>\u201cIn this world, only you are qualified to not like Haotian.\u201d</em></p><br/><p>The Headmaster turned to Ning Que and said, \u201cOf course, you were one reason that I decided to take action as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was touched, even though he still didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>How could the Headmaster not see his real feelings? He said discontentedly, \u201cI am seldom brave like this. Can\u2019t you feel touched? Do you have to hold it in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at him and sincerely said, \u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking of his words, Ning Que asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you enjoyed fighting against Heaven? Was it your first time to fight back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you mean real fighting\u2026 Yes, it was the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cYou can battle in many ways, and beating him was only one of them. I have been trying every possible way to fight against Haotian for a thousand years. Only you and your Youngest Uncle were always thinking to fight with force. He never ever thought of what would happen if he failed.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said it with emotion, sounding sad and regretful.</p><br/><p>Ning Que filled his cup with hot tea and took a towel, trying to wipe the tea from his beard. He smiled and said, \u201cYou won today, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster waved his hand away and said loudly, \u201cI just beat a few incarnations, not Haotian. If I can beat Haotian so easily, how could your Youngest Uncle die? If he heard you, he would jump out of his coffin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shamelessly answered, \u201cI\u2019m stupid. That is why you are my teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Giant Golden Dragon and the General of Light on the Golden Chariot were all the eidolons of the Haotian Divine Light. They just looked scary, but they were not strong enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster dipped his finger into the tea and flicked it to the air.</p><br/><p>The tea drop floated in the air, reflecting the sunshine, and forming a tiny golden dragon.</p><br/><p>Looking at the scene and feeling the power of the golden dragon, Ning Que was shocked.</p><br/><p>Then he confirmed that his teacher was right. The Giant Golden Dragon and the general were able to kill most cultivators in the world. However, Eldest Brother, who was the fastest man in the world, or the invincible Chief Preaching Monk could beat them as well, or not lose too fast.</p><br/><p>The carriage was traveling in the Wilderness, crushing the grass and flowers. As the breeze blew through the window, Sangsang slightly coughed. Ning Que worriedly asked, \u201cTeacher, what shall we do next? How about Sangsang\u2019s illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster flicked his finger once again and the vivid dragon disappeared in an instant. It returned to the tea drop and fell on the floor, like a morning dew.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe light is the existence while the darkness is the non-existence. Using the existence to dissolve the non-existence is like asking directions to a blind man. You can\u2019t expect the Haotian Divine Light to suppress her Yama Imprint. The Buddha dharma pursues self-enlightenment which is still a self-deception and can\u2019t cure her, either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Sangsang, he said, \u201cI have thought it over. I will try to remove the Yama Imprint out of your body and keep it in the light which can\u2019t be noticed by Yama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe human world is the hottest, messiest, and the truest place. It can dirty the pureness, warm the coldness, as well as turn the fire into smoke. It is a process of creating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought of it for a long time until he felt he was unable to comprehend these words with his attainments and understanding, so he sincerely asked, \u201cTeacher, what is the power of human beings? What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do? I have already done it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cI killed the dragon and suppressed the Yama Imprint with the Haotian Divine Light, filling it with the power of human beings. What else would you like me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que opened his eyes and asked, \u201cWhat is the power of humanity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am. My strength is the power of humanity.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster looked at Sangsang, happily smiling.</p><br/><p>Ning Que laughed as well and looked a little silly.</p><br/><p>Looking at them who were happily laughing, Sangsang burst into laughter as well, but hers was somehow weird.</p><br/><p>The smile on her face was very silly and cute.</p><br/><p>While her eyes were indifferent.</p><br/><p>She was one person with two kinds of smiles.</p><br/><p>She was sitting by the window, but seemed as if she were sitting in the sky, overseeing the world.</p>\n</div>"}

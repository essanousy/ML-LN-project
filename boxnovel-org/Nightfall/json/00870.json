They had been surprised too many times today, due to the shocking scenes they had witnessed.</p><br/><p>Little Yu turned to Chen Pipi and said, \u201cHang on, cousin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the Hierarch knew about Chen Pipi\u2019s connection to the South Sea branch, other people were surprised when Little Yu previously called him her man. Then, hearing what she said to Chen Pipi, they figured out that he was the young cultivator who had reached Knowing Destiny State she talked about previously.</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi was also surprised upon her words. He looked at the bowl of water and nodded subconsciously, but immediately realized he should not have done so. Did father choose a wife for me even before I was born?</p><br/><p>The battle between the West-Hill Divine Halls and South Sea branch had just began. Originally, they were not planning to fight against each other. After all they both belonged to Taoism. It was the Academy that should be their common enemy.</p><br/><p>However, at this point, only the Hierarch could put an end to the battle. Since Zhishou Abbey had been abandoned by Haotian, the Hierarch was the only leader of Haotian Taoism.</p><br/><p>But the Hierarch had been acting weird. Even till now, he had not said a single word. Unlike the rumors, he did not seem as irritable as what people had said about him.</p><br/><p>No one knew that this was because he thought he was no longer his former self.</p><br/><p>Years ago when Xiong Chumo was not yet the Hierarch but rather a regular divine priest, he went preaching in the Wilderness together with his former teacher. There he met the first enemy of his life \u2013 Lin Wu, the head of Devil\u2019s Doctrine. At that time, he was seriously wounded by Lin Wu on his lower abdomen, and thus lost his sexual organ.</p><br/><p>Losing one\u2019s sexual abilities was not necessarily a bad thing for the cultivators. Ever since then, Xiong Chumo had been freed from any human desires and had devoted himself solely to cultivation. Thus, he was able to enter Taoism with heavenly discipline, made tremendous accomplishments, and eventually became the Hierarch. His lifetime enemy Lin Wu had then been practicing the Twenty-Three-Year Cicada and became the Senior Sister of the Academy.</p><br/><p>However, that wound was indeed influential on his characteristic. Although he was freed from human desires because of his impotence, he could still feel those desires deep inside. It tortured him throughout the years and made him increasingly irritable.</p><br/><p>Xiong Chumo enjoyed his high ranking and being powerful, but he did not like that irritable part of himself.</p><br/><p>As the Hierarch, he met many strongest cultivators such as the three Great Divine Priests and Liu Bai. As great masters they all shared a common character of gracefulness. He wanted to become like them but had always failed because of the imprisoned flame of desire in his under abdomen.</p><br/><p>It was not until recently that he had acquired some gracefulness because of Haotian\u2019s appearance. He was blessed, supported by the Heaven and hence became unbeatable. Since then, he felt that he should carry himself with a calm demeanor.</p><br/><p>Although the arrival of the group from the South Sea was not expected, he did not care at all. Even if they were surely sent by the Abbey Dean, they were still not qualified to make him worried. If they dared to stand up against Haotian and try to destroy the Rite to Light, he would definitely suppress them.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he had been very calm and quiet thus far.</p><br/><p>The purpose of the Rite to Light was to lead a path to Haotian\u2019s Divine Kingdom. However, he did not care even if this failed. He devoutly wished he would always be able to kiss the ground in front of Haotian.</p><br/><p>What he cared more about was to destroy the Academy in the Rite to Light. He was eager to see his own victory against Lin Wu and shake up the human world.</p><br/><p>But he was disappointed. What if no one from the Academy ever showed up? That damned Lin Wu, being my lifetime enemy how could you not come to me on such an important occasion?</p><br/><p>As the Hierarch sat inside his sacred sedan, he looked out of the gauze curtains toward the mountains afar. He saw the beautiful autumn leaves in yellow and red colors, and felt an indescribable sadness.</p><br/><p>He uttered his first sentence of the day.</p><br/><p>His thundering voice came out from behind the gauze curtains with undisguised contempt and a hint of loneliness, echoing through the valleys at the Peach Mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Academy is worthless now.\u201d</p><br/><p>They all knew what he meant.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the human world was aware that the Rite to Light was a trap for the Academy set by the West-Hill. Since the Headmaster left for the Heaven by the Sishui River, the Academy and West-Hill had been fighting non-stop, from the Verdant Canyon to the City of Chang\u2019an, as well as in many other places around the world. Both powerful forces had taken great losses. Knowing that this Rite to Light was a trap, how could the Academy tackle it?</p><br/><p>If only the Headmaster or Ke Haoran were still here, they would never have watched their disciples being executed, even if they did not possess the strongest might.</p><br/><p>The Hierarch\u2019s comment of them being worthless was not because the Academy had been badly defeated. Rather with their Headmaster and Ke Haoran gone, no one from the Academy was courageous enough to challenge the Peach Mountain.</p><br/><p>Inside her blood-colored sacred sedan, Ye Hongyu had been restoring her spirit with her eyes closed.</p><br/><p>The fierce debate between Zhao Nanhai and the head of Revelation Institute had not caught her attention. She spared a mocking smile when Little Yu talked about Chen Pipi as her man. When the Hierarch said that the Academy was worthless, she sniggered even more.</p><br/><p>She knew that Ning Que had been there all the time and he would definitely make his move. But she did not know where he was nor to whom he would be take out first.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, she opened her beautiful eyes, which were still shining with starry light. The descendants of the Great Divine Priest of South Sea were not strong enough to capture her interest. Then who was it this time? Is Ning Que finally here?</p><br/><p>While Ye Hongyu opened her eyes inside the sacred sedan, from outside the Peach Mountain came the sounds of people approaching in a rush. It seemed that people were rushing over, and there were heavy sounds of clashing metal.</p><br/><p>The followers at the front yard turned back to see a cloud of dust being kicked up. As this was happening, the ranks of the gathered Papal Cavalrymen were somewhat disrupted.</p><br/><p>Then, the sounds became clearer as the intruder broke through the numerous Papal Cavalrymen. The clashing sounds were from their weapons.</p><br/><p>Deacons of the Divine Halls cried out, \u201cAn intruder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those strong cultivators and noble guests around the altar frowned. They were amazed that anyone would dare to invade the Peach Mountain.</p><br/><p>Situated high up in the Peach Mountain, the West-Hill Divine Halls were home to numerous powerful figures. The Papal Cavalrymen and divine guards would have killed all intruders. Except for the former Headmaster of the Academy, who else had the audacity to confront the Peach Mountain?</p><br/><p>The divine priests of the South Sea were accepted because they were a branch of Taoism returning home. It was granted by Haotian. Yet, who was this other intruder?</p><br/><p>There was a thick cloud of dust at the back of the mountain. The clashing sounds had yet to cease, but instead got even more frequent. On the other hand, the people could no longer hear the invader\u2019s footsteps rushing forward. It seemed like that person had been caught up in a tough fight.</p></div>\n</div>"}

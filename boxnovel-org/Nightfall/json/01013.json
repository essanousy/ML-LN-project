He was having some subtle sentiments as if he had been drinking too much and found himself amidst an ocean of stars. He was either too drunk or unwilling to look for a way out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it will indeed be beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stared at the stars and suddenly seemed scared. He was like a kid who had been exposed to a whole new world out of his mountain village, and he was filled with fear and restlessness. His voice trembled, \u201cYet also scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sweetest candy was probably the most poisonous drug. The best hope was sometimes the worst fear. It could be alluring to be free, but dreadful to be independent. It was just a matter of choice.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother sighed gently, as he knew the Drunkard was already sober and had made up his mind.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard turned to him and said solemnly, \u201cTo me, being alive is always more important than anything else. I can give up a lot for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cIt\u2019s not conflicting to be alive and to pursue.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cBut the pursuit of the Academy is conflicting with Haotian\u2019s will.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother asked, \u201cWhy does Haotian\u2019s will matter to you and me in terms of being alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cThe reason for me being able to survive throughout these years is because I would never fight for a losing battle. Your Headmaster could not defeat Haotian. How could I?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother pondered for a long while then asked suddenly, \u201cWhat about the Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother looked into his eyes calmly and said, \u201cIf you won\u2019t stand against Haotian, then you will be against the Academy. You lack the confidence to defeat Haotian, then are you sure you can defeat the Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard frowned further and his eyebrows seemed like two steady strokes in the dark wind.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cIf I cannot talk you into treachery, then we will have to fight against you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard asked, \u201cWhat will the Academy do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cThe Academy \u2026 we will fight with our lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Years ago in Lanke Temple, the Academy fought with their lives in the autumn rain. Later in Chang\u2019an, in the Verdant Canyon and the Wilderness, they fought with their lives too. They fought desperately to kill their enemies. Everyone in the Academy was proud, or even narcissistic. Their lives and the lives of their fellows were the most important to them. Therefore whenever they fight with their lives, it must be a desperate situation and they would definitely bring about an unimaginable power.</p><br/><p>It did not matter if it was Liu Bai, the Sage of Sword, the Chief Monk of Scripture, or the Abbey Dean. The Academy had defeated every one of their most powerful enemies by fighting with their lives even it was Heaven.</p><br/><p>Would the Drunkard and the Butcher be exceptions?</p><br/><p>\u201cInterestingly, in the Academy those who would fight with their lives cannot catch up with me, such as Lin Wu, Jun Mo or even Ning Que. The one who could catch up with me won\u2019t fight with his life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard looked at him and said calmly, \u201cIf the Academy were to fight against me, then you are probably the only match. We are both Distanceless. We walk the same way and see the same sceneries. Being able to catch up is the premise. But are you sure you know how to fight with your life?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cEverything can be learned. And I\u2019m a good learner.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cWhen we were at Xuankong Temple, I said that you have made a lot progress. You are much stronger than when you fought against the Abbey Dean\u2026 To be enlightened overnight, you are indeed the best student of the Headmaster, and you are indeed good at learning, much better than Jun Mo or Lin Wu. But are you sure you can learn to fight with your life?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to risk one\u2019s own life instead of the ones of others.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I proved last night. You\u2019ve learned to fight, and you took over the cudgel. However\u2026 you still cannot kill because it\u2019s not in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll bring someone who can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could carry a Bodhi tree back to the Academy from thousands of miles away. But you could never carry a man for thousands of miles to a fight. When you carried Jun Mo, how far did you make?\u201d The Drunkard continued, \u201cThat was actually what scares me. If you could really carry Lin Wu for a thousand miles to kill me, then what can I do except for to head back to my little town and stay with the Butcher?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said bitterly, \u201cIf you were to go back to the little town, then so my Youngest Brother\u2019s arrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard was slightly shocked. He realized that the Academy had planned for such a possibility but it was never executed. That was why they could talk about it right now. The autumn wind arose and raindrops fell from the leaves while he disappeared.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother was slightly angry. The raindrops fell intensively on his cotton-padded gown as if they were falling on a sandy beach. The gown was slightly wet but became dry immediately.</p><br/><p>The raindrops fell on the ground. They could not penetrate into the rocky ground and formed a shallow puddle in front of him. An ant was struggling in the puddle. He looked at the puddle silently and flipped a golden leaf onto the puddle. Within a short while the ant managed to climb onto the edge of the leaf and was saved.</p><br/><p>The surface of the puddle shivered when a shadow appeared above it.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard was back to the woods. He covered the starlights and seemed gloomy.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother raised to ask, \u201cWhy did you kill again?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no new blood on the Drunkard\u2019s gown, but someone had indeed been killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you. The Academy should not try to kill me, or even come up with the slightest attempt because that will make me afraid and suffer. When I suffer, I will make sure you suffer and fear even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho \u2026 was it this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea. Probably an ordinary?\u201d The Drunkard said emotionlessly, \u201cPerhaps it was a Tang soldier, or someone from Yan. I just kill. I do not pick. Perhaps next time I will kill someone from the Wilderness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said nothing.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard looked at him sympathetically and said, \u201cThe virtuous has compassion. You do not want to kill, or see me kill. If you cannot fight with your life, then you have to learn to accept it. From now on, the Academy should stay quiet. When the Divine Halls have burned the tens of thousands of followers of the New Stream, and cleared every region around the Tang Empire, they will come for the Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother gazed at him and asked, \u201cWhat does killing mean to you? Are you seeing yourself as a divine existence so it never bothered you? Or are you even enjoying it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me indeed. But I do not enjoy it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard walked to the cliff and looked at the human world in the darkness. He watched the very few lights in Linkang and said calmly, \u201cI don\u2019t like to kill blindly. But to me, all human beings are merely animals\u2026 If I were crazy, I might find it interesting to kill my own kind. But since I\u2019m killing some animals like fish or chickens, why should I feel excited?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother came to his side and looked at the human world in the darkness. He watched the lights and shades in Linkang, and put his right hand on the cudgel quietly. \u201cIs it impossible to change anything?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>The night lasted long, but disappeared in a blink. The warm red sun jumped out of the horizon and brightened the mountains in the autumn rain.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard said, \u201cThe sun will rise again and the daytime will never be dark. It\u2019s Haotian\u2019s world. No one but Haotian is eternal. You can never change the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cWe, Tang people, never give up. Neither will the Academy. I might not be able to change the rules of this world or you, but I can change myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard looked at the cudgel in his right hand and asked, \u201cYou want to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cI cannot kill you. But I can kill someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard frowned and asked, \u201cYou want to make a change, even if it\u2019s a disgrace?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother answered, \u201cYes. Even if it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard asked after a pause, \u201cWho are you planning to kill?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother said, \u201cI will go to the little town and find the girl who sells liquor. I\u2019ll see if she is pretty and ask for the age of the liquor she sells, and that if you ever owed her any money.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard paused for a while then said, \u201cDo as you wish.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

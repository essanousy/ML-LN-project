The dark world was engulfed in light instantly.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu was stunned speechless. She had never imagined that Sangsang would still have such pure Haotian Divine Light in her body even though she was already the Daughter of Yama. What was happening?</p><br/><p>She was the Great Divine Priest of Judgment and was well-skilled in West-Hill Divine Skill. Accordingly, Haotian Divine Light should not have such a strong impact on her. However, the Haotian Divine Light that burst forth from the big black umbrella did not land directly on her. Instead, it entered the sky above the pool and into the talisman storm before reflecting everywhere.</p><br/><p>There seemed to be several mirrors in the dark pool. Each mirror was a talisman, reflecting the countless rays of light. The light grew stronger and stronger, and when it finally reached Ye Hongyu\u2019s eyes, its power had grown tremendously powerful.</p><br/><p>If Ye Hongyu still had the Light of Haotian deep in her eyes, she could have easily used the same power to bear Sangsang\u2019s Haotian Divine Light. However, the Light of Haotian in her eyes had already been consumed when she fought against the Primordial Thirteen Arrows. She could only watch helplessly as the Divine Light assaulted her body.</p><br/><p>A clear sound emitted from her lips. Flames licked out from beneath her divine robe. The flames were black and not hot. It was the legendary Blaze of Judgment!</p><br/><p>The clash between Haotian Divine Light and Blaze of Judgment resulted in a thunderous clang. The two forces clashed in the air above the pool. Ye Hongyu was thrown into the air toward the opposite shore. The blood red color of her Divine Robe hung in the air like a flag. As it crossed the talisman, numerous tears appeared on them, causing blood to flow.</p><br/><p>Beside the pool, Sangsang held the handle of the big black umbrella, her eyes tightly shut and her face extremely pale. When she was certain that Ye Hongyu had been blasted back, she relaxed. There was a light puff, and she spat out a mouthful of thick black blood.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was too preoccupied to worry about her. He did not even have time to pick up his bow from the shore. He stepped heavily on the mud at the bottom of the pool and was splattered by water, leaping towards Ye Hongyu who was falling from above.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu fell into the swamp behind the pool, making a large splash in the dirty waters. She slid down the wet moss for a few feet before stopping, blood staining the ground red.</p><br/><p>Ning Que landed after her, not waiting for her to stand. Like a hunting tiger, he was calm and composed and he pressed her down violently, not giving her any chance to react.</p><br/><p>Ning Que hugged her back and swept his legs through the muddied grounds of the swamp, hooking his legs into her knees. He hugged her tightly in an intimate gesture, and then, he pressed down forcefully.</p><br/><p>He was not Ye Hongyu\u2019s match in both Taoists Law or in cultivation states. He was only physically stronger. That was why he chose to use his strength to pulverize her bones.</p><br/><p>This was a gory method that was often seen in the cultivation world. For example, when a martial cultivator went against a Sword Master, he would use this method when on the brink of death. Back when the Devil\u2019s Doctrine was flourishing, many powerhouses in Haotian Taoism had died in the embrace of powerhouses from the Devil\u2019s Doctrine through this terrifying method.</p><br/><p>There were no problems with the method Ning Que chose. However, his opponent today was Ye Hongyu.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu studied in the Revelation Institute for a short period of time after leaving Zhishou Abbey. She then entered the Judicial Department of West-Hill Divine Palace where she spent most of her life.</p><br/><p>The Judicial Department judged on the sins of the world. They went after the remnants of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine. She had once been the Grand Master of the Judicial Department and was now the Great Divine Priest of Judgment. She was very familiar with the methods of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine and would naturally have a way to counter it.</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly felt as if the girl in his embrace had become a smooth, scaleless fish. And no matter where he placed his limbs, they would slide off. Furthermore, her body suddenly became extremely bouncy and tight. No matter how much pressure he exerted, it would just bounce or slide off.</p><br/><p>Knowing that the method would not work, Ning Que changed his plans. He held on tightly to the collar of her robe with his left hand and lifted his left knee, kneeing her viciously in her groin. However, Ye Hongyu\u2019s reaction was like lightning. She rolled in the swamp, and her robe loosened, sliding out of Ning Que\u2019s control and avoiding his knee. She prodded with her fingers, and two sharp sword styles emerged from the air, piercing into Ning Que\u2019s weakest spot- his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ning Que lowered his head, using his forehead to bear the piercing swords. He wedged his feet deep into the mud in the swamp and pushed forward. The podao, which had been hanging off a string on his right wrist swung, cut into Ye Hongyu\u2019s throat mercilessly.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu\u2019s wedged her hand into the mud and pushed off with her left hand. She rolled, causing her divine robe to spread open. She wrapped the blade into her robe at the speed of lightning. Then, she pulled out a handful of mud with her right hand, imbuing it with aura and smashing it into Ning Que\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Ning Que avoided the fistful of mud and pressed forward with the blade.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu called forth her Taoist Sword, piercing it into the back of his head.</p><br/><p>In the swamp, the two grappled with each other and exchanged numerous blows within seconds.</p><br/><p>The swamp was full of soft mud, which affected the two seriously. Ning Que attacked, relying on his physical strength while Ye Hongyu displayed her battle prowess perfectly. She did not miss out on any opportunities and used all kinds of Haotian Taoism skills to try to kill him.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu\u2019s divine robe fell off, having long been torn into shreds. Ning Que\u2019s shirt had been torn into pieces by the Taoist Sword. The two naked bodies writhed and twisted, separating and coming closer together again, looking rather erotic. However, they were both bleeding and covered in filthy pungent mud. Anyone of them could die at any moment as they crossed swords and it was not sensual at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have Sangsang with you and you would not dare to die with me. You\u2019re bound to die today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even wear underwear but you remembered to bring your comb! You still care about your physical shell, so you\u2019re not strong enough. At least you\u2019re not strong enough to make me lose hope!\u201d</p><br/><p>Deep in the swamp, the fog came quietly, then panicked and scattered. In the mosses submerged in shallow water, the two mud-covered people continued fighting and shouting, like two Capybaras fighting a bloody battle.</p><br/><p>A water mirror suddenly appeared in front of Ning Que. The material of the water mirror came from the ground. The filthy water mixed with crushed moss splashed on his face, obstructing his five senses for a moment.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu used the moment to insert two slender fingers coldly into Ning Que\u2019s left chest. They pierced right through the hole caused by her Taoist Sword earlier and activated the sword style!</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt a sharp pain in his chest. He felt as if his heart would split open the next moment. Howling in pain, he broke the water mirror on his face and smashed his right fist imbued with the Great Spirit toward the front.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu\u2019s left hand seemed to wave casually but it held the secrets of the Cloud Hand which originated from the Cloud Taoist Temple of the Kingdom of Song.</p><br/><p>Having experienced a long battle which was dangerous and difficult, Ye Hongyu finally had the opportunity to kill Ning Que. How would she be unprepared against Ning Que\u2019s dying blow?</p><br/><p>However, she had forgotten an important matter at this crucial moment. The strongest power of the Cloud Hand Taoists Law from Cloud Taoist Temple of the Kingdom of Song should be hidden in one\u2019s sleeves. It was called Cloud Sleeves.</p><br/><p>She was completely naked, so where would she find sleeves?</p><br/><p>In principle, Ye Hongyu\u2019s rich combat experience meant that she should not make such low-level mistakes. However, she had never had the experience of fighting like a child in a quagmire without any clothes on.</p><br/><p>Without the wind hidden in her sleeves, the powers of Cloud Hands of the Cloud Taoist Temple were weakened by half.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s right fist, which was imbued with the Great Spirit broke through her left Cloud Hand pose. While it was slightly weaker, it still landed squarely on the left side of her chest.</p><br/><p>His fist fell on her chest, and mud went flying, revealing her pale skin and tender and full chest. It was crushed like paper, and blood started to ooze from the sides, the sounds of cracking ribs rang in the air!</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu moaned angrily and painfully. The sword style in her fingers which were wedged in Ning Que\u2019s wounded chest grew and tunneled deeper. Fresh blood oozed from the corners where her fingers were wedged.</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt as if his heart had been struck by lightning. His face paled suddenly and he felt his strength draining. He clutched Ye Hongyu\u2019s right wrist tightly in his left hand and curled up his right hand tightly, swiping angrily at her chest. He held her tightly in her chest and lowered his head, biting down into her mud covered neck.</p><br/><p>After the slightly fishy taste of the swamp water was the metallic but sweet taste of blood.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu\u2019s left hand fell with the wind, almost landing on the top of his head.</p><br/><p>He would die once that happens.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu felt the clear tearing at her neck. She could even feel her blood being drained. She thought of their meeting many years ago at the Front Gate of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine. Her face suddenly paled considerably, and her fear, which had been repressed for many years, bloomed once more before her eyes and quickly took over her entire being.</p><br/><p>Accompanying the pain at her neck was her weakening sense of perception and body. She finally believed that Ning Que was not using this method to frighten her, but that he would really use the evil Devil\u2019s Doctrine skill.</p><br/><p>However, the fear in her eyes suddenly switched into absolute calmness. They were as bright as jewels.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu\u2019s fingers on her right hand were wedged into Ning Que\u2019s chest. They were merely half an inch away from his heart. Her right hand landed on his head as if caressing him. Ning Que\u2019s right hand held onto her left bosom tightly and erotically. His head was pressed against her neck as if he was kissing it. The entire scene was intimate. It was an intimate act with Yama.</p><br/><p>Ning Que could sense the change in her aura. He thought that the terrifying woman would forcefully lower her state without hesitation, just like she had many years ago, to obtain a chance for herself and for her opponent to die.</p><br/><p>That was why he stopped sucking the blood. He said in a muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019m not Lotus. There\u2019s no need for you to lower your state just to kill me. Shall we stop fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu\u2019s face was devoid of any emotions. She said indifferently, \u201cYou have learned the Practice of Tao Tie. There is no reason for me to let you live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought about what happened in autumn before the Red Lotus Temple and of how he had learned Tao Tie. He smiled bitterly and mumbled, \u201cBut I have never used it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, his lips left her neck slowly and he straightened up.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu\u2019s fingers drifted away from his heart slowly.</p><br/><p>Ning Que fell backward into the swamp tiredly and scooted back about half a feet. He looked at her and said, \u201cI admit that I am indeed no match for you. Let\u2019s fight again after I rest a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was mud, blood, and a thin golden thread between his lips.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at him and said, \u201cIf you had continued to bite down, you\u2019d have been dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her fingers flicked lightly, and the golden thread on Ning Que\u2019s lips fell to the ground and disappeared into the ground with a poof.</p><br/><p>Ning Que only noticed then, that there were many almost invisible golden threads on her wounds. He was extremely surprised, and asked, \u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu answered, \u201cAfter returning from the Wilderness, I buried 72 golden threads in my body. Each golden thread is a sword. If anyone tries to take a bite of my flesh, he would definitely regret it.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

He had never kneeled much other than the Great Meet. In fact, he had never kneeled for so long either.</p><br/><p>He wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead surreptitiously. His back felt like it was about to break. He stole a furtive look at his sides, trying to find a silver of solidarity and comfort in his current position, and indeed felt better seeing the looks of dejection on the other officials from the Military Ministry around him. It still made his legs feel like jelly upon thinking back, and he was very thankful that nothing had happened to him so far.</p><br/><p>The main reason of the conflict seemed to be that the shipping government wanted the land on Lin 47th Street. But that was just as excuse. I knew what was happening, but I chose not to interfere. Yet, the Military Ministry has probed too deeply in this. I heard that over 20 elite members of the Yulin Royal Guards and a Psyche Master who had entered Seethrough State were killed that rainy night. How can His Majesty let you off lightly in this situation?</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man on the throne was both sarcastic and angry, and it showed in his ringing voice. His rant ended in a sigh. \"I formed a sect like this all those years ago to become the ears and eyes in the masses. It was such hard work keeping it a secret for more than ten years and look at what happened? You imbeciles looking for small gains have forced them into the light. How am I going to use them now? Am I wrong to call you imbeciles?\"</p><br/><p>The emperor sighed in despair while his subjects sighed regretfully. They now knew whom the Fish-dragon sect belonged to. It was indeed a product of His Majesty when he was strolling around the streets of Chang'an during his days as the crown prince. They thought to themselves, \" This is just your plaything, why do you have so much to say about it? \"</p><br/><p>At this time, the emperor's voice turned incredibly frigid, devoid of any trace of sarcasm as he stared at his subjects intently. \"The question is, were you all doing this for small gains? I know what you're all thinking, but how can my family and I tolerate the challenge that you imbeciles are issuing? \" \"You tout the empress' and princess' name, creating trouble throughout Chang'an. But you don't know that my empress has always been aware of the sect's relationship to the palace. I've brought Yu'er to the Spring Breeze Pavilion myself!\"</p><br/><p>The officials in the palace could not withstand the waves of ludicrous claims. Huai Hua General from the Military Ministry and the Emperor's valet felt their legs give beneath them as they collapsed fearfully on the ground.</p><br/><p>The emperor looked at the both of them coldly and said, \"The responsibility of the army of Tang is to protect the land and expand our frontiers. They should not be helping gangs to steal land! And what's even more disgraceful is that they didn't even win! Since this is so, commanding officer, you shall train the armies for me in Changning for three to five years. You can only come back when the armies under your supervision can defeat the gangs of Chang'an.\"</p><br/><p>Changning was to the south-west of the empire. It was hot and humid in summer and damp and cold in winter. There were much illness and many poisonous objects in the forested mountains in the area. It was usually viewed as a dangerous journey to the officials of Tang. As to defeat the gangs of Chang'an in three or five years\u2026 Everything the emperor said was the truth. How could one return if he decided that you had been defeated?</p><br/><p>With just a word from the emperor, a high ranking official of the army was sent to great sufferings. It was likely he would never return to a central position. It was a harsh punishment indeed. The other officials in the palace grew more fearful. The commanding officer was just grateful to have kept his head on his neck and kowtowed loudly proclaiming his thanks.</p><br/><p>The emperor had grown tired after scolding the imbeciles throughout the day. He looked at the officials who dared not retort and grew even wearier. He drank deeply from the tea that Lee Yu offered before waving for a eunuch.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Lin appeared beside the emperor's bed in a flash, his bony hands opening up the royal edict. \"On the thirteenth year of Tianqi, the Minister of Revenue, Xing Chengyu is to stay home and reflect for three months. His Majesty will await your defense.\"</p><br/><p>The defense was just a facade. His Majesty was giving his subjects the change to resign and return to his hometown. Xing Chengyu raised his head in response, thinking that his officialdom had ended just because of a small issue like this. His hands which were supporting his body shook with the thought of the Chang'an gangs that had ended his career.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Lin continued reading the edict. An assistant minister had been sent to jail, and the Logistics of the Ministry of Revenue had been cleaned out entirely. A number of officials had been removed from Chang'an Local Government. Mayor of Capital was sent to Tin Shui Wei, and the emperor's valet was found guilty after a trial. The Military Department suffered the heaviest bow. General Xiahou sent an angry demand for an explanation for the death of his best subordinate, Zhuo Er, so the emperor sent seven men from the military to the gallows to appease the general. Or perhaps, one could say that this was done for Chao Xiaoshu.</p><br/><p>During the reading of the edict and trials, the emperor remained silent no matter how much his subjects bled, cried loudly proclaiming their innocence or sniveled in gratitude. It was only when a replacement was sought for Mayor of Capital that he furrowed his brows and thought of a name.</p><br/><p>\"The Chang'an Judicial Military Supervisor. What's that person called? Something Shangguan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shangguan Yuyang,\" the minister of archives answered. He looked at the emperor and was able to guess what he was thinking. Coughing slightly, he continued, \"He has always scored well in the official exams, and he was a scholar from the imperial exams. It's just that he doesn't look really good. So\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What I need is someone who can care for my subjects. I'm not choosing a concubine.\" The Emperor waved his hand impatiently and said, \"He shall serve as the replacement.\"</p><br/><p>The Palace of Counsel gradually emptied out as the officials were either sent away or left. The prince who had sat silently throughout the whole procedure could not stay still any longer. He stood up from where he was sitting, walked towards the emperor's bed, lifted his robes and kneeled down with a resounding slap.</p><br/><p>The Royal Family of Tang, especially this emperor had always placed much importance on kinship. There rarely were incidences of fighting for power within the palace unlike that in history. The emperor trusted his only brother very much and would never put him down before the officials. The prince knew that the respect given to him was earned by himself. If he wanted it today, his brother, the emperor would lose it.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the emperor did not ask for him to rise up as usual, but watched him coldly from above. He evaluated how much of the pain and regret was an act on his brother's face before the anger bled out of his face. He said, \"Raise your head and look at me.\"</p><br/><p>The prince lifted his head slowly before staring into the piercing gaze of his brother.</p><br/><p>\"Are you sponsoring Wang Jinglue?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you think it's a pity that I sent him to serve in the military?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't dare.\"</p><br/><p>\"It was for his own good that I sent him to train with Xu Shi.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Shi was the greatest general in Tang. Wang Jinglue was a genius in cultivation. Under the guidance of Xu Shi, he would have improved greatly. The prince was startled for a moment before thanking the emperor profusely.</p><br/><p>\"Don't thank me. At least, don't thank me on his behalf.\"</p><br/><p>The emperor looked at his brother and said frigidly, \" It was no easy feat for Tang to have talent like him. That's why I wanted to protect him. However, the talent of Tang can only serve Tang and not any wealthy individuals. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>These were words that hit home. The prince felt his heart contract and sweat ran down his back, wetting his royal robes. He did not know how to answer that question, and could only lower his head, praying for forgiveness in a position of humility.</p><br/><p>\"I've given you some good things over the years. The royal coffers are a little empty these days. You should offer some tribute. I'll remember your gesture of goodwill.\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't dare.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is there anything in the world that you dare not do?\"</p><br/><p>The emperor said smilingly, \"You're a prince, and yet you allowed your steward to run a brothel. If Mistress Jian were not the childhood friend of the empress, how long would you hide this from me?\"</p><br/><p>Even though the emperor did not sneer, and nor was there any trace of sarcasm in his speech, the prince felt that the immeasurable pressure on him raised yet another notch. The sweat on his back trickled down quickly as he waited for the emperor's edict. However, he did not hear any after waiting for a long time and started getting suspicious.</p><br/><p>The smile on the emperor's face faded slowly as he looked upon the prince. \"I shan't punish you heavily, only because the man who watched the people at the House of Red Sleeves on behalf of your steward said that you were loyal only to me,\" said the emperor.</p><br/><p>It suddenly dawned upon the prince, that his valet had reported Cui Delu's report after Chao Xiaoshu visited the House of Red Sleeves. While he had admitted that he was loyal only to the man on the throne, he did not wish for his subordinates to say too much about it. He felt the blood drain from his face, and thanked his lucky stars that he had mentioned his allegiance to that person.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>All had been smooth sailing for Tang since the first year of Tianqi. There were few large criminal issues, of which, one was the issue with the imperial astronomer, and the other was the most recent incident, which they now call the Spring Breeze Pavilion Incident.</p><br/><p>There were over 10 officials who were stripped of their positions and seven from the Military Department were sent to the gallows openly in this incident. However, in the bowels of the palace where secrets lay, it was known that several key figures in key positions were completely overhauled. It was only because these positions were important to the palace's security that the news was kept secret.</p><br/><p>In that rainy spring night, the Deputy General of the Yulin Royal Guards, Cao Ning, welcomed Eunuch Lin as well as his own death. Chang Siwei and Fei Jingwei who were previously imprisoned had killed him after they received the imperial edict written personally by the emperor. Cao Ning was reported to have died from an illness after that.</p><br/><p>In that same night, Liu Si from the Fish-dragon Sect fulfilled their orders from the emperor and got their long-awaited revenge as they rode their horses wielding spears, killing the Deputy Commander of the Valiant Cavalry Battalion, Chu Ren who had framed them 10 years ago.</p><br/><p>It was after this spring rain when the senior officials of the Tang found out about Old Chao from the Spring Wind Pavilion. Or perhaps, one could say, they finally began to take this name seriously. They wanted to know who the masked young man from the Yuelun Kingdom who had killed beside him was.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu stood at the edge of the lake in the imperial gardens. He stared at the lake, which was called the leaving sea silently. His indigo robes moving gently in the slight breeze.</p><br/><p>The eunuchs and palace maids who walked by him would turn away humbly. Now that everyone knew who he was, and knew what he would become, they could not hold back the envy, curiosity, and respect in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu seemed not to notice, and the cold-blooded look in his face that he had the previous night had dissipated. Neither could one see the look of nervousness those from the Jianghu world usually display when they entered the palace. His face was completely calm and he seemed to be at ease.</p><br/><p>A goldfish jumped up from the leaving sea, jumping over the dragon gate that the palace maids had weaved using flowers before entering the waters again happily.</p><br/><p>To many people, Chao Xiaoshu was like the fish at this moment. He was about to rise through several ranks and become a key figure in the palace.</p><br/><p>But yet, Chao Xiaoshu did not wish for that to happen.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Scattered away on the field, they would inevitably be made captives by the Tang army cavalry. Some unlucky ones may even be taken away by horse thieves.</p><br/><p>This terrified him.</p><br/><p>This moment, he was made king over all of humanity. The next, he was shot through his cheeks by an arrow on the path to his coronation. Blood flowed everywhere grotesquely \u2014 no one could accept this truth easily \u2014 his confidence and might were crushed and shattered into particles that cannot be shattered any further.</p><br/><p>This terrified him.</p><br/><p>To him, the most terrifying of all was when he saw ten thousands of wild horses galloping from the rosy clouds of dawn afar. Witnessing the miraculous things that transpired before him, he just realized that all his triumph, his dream of galloping on the Central Plains, were all in fact a trick \u2014 a trick of the Academy, and a trick of that person.</p><br/><p>Several years ago, there was a peace talk between the Divine Halls of West-Hill and the Tang. The Golden Tribe was the biggest beneficiary from that negotiation. The annexation of Xiangwan Plains and the coercion to hand over their troops were like a leash around Tang\u2019s neck, no matter how one looked at it. But now, it was apparent that the Tang had intentionally showed their weakness to bait the Royal Court into this risky campaign down south.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Que, Ning Que, Ning Que\u2026\u201d He silently repeated the name, again and again, each call seeped deep into his bones.</p><br/><p>He did not understand. The Academy\u2019s scheme was quite risky. If there were any miscalculations, the plain cavalry could just rush south and take over the Central Plains, so why did the Academy go with it anyway?</p><br/><p>Other than ending the bloodline of the Golden Tribe, what else was worth such a risk for the Tang? When did the Academy turn so cold blooded? What type of deep vengeance did that Mr. Thirteen had with himself?</p><br/><p>After contemplating silently for a long time, Chanyu\u2019s emotions gradually calmed down.</p><br/><p>He had the talent and ambitions. He was defeated by the Tang beyond Guhe, and he had even seen the actual scenery of the Abyss\u2019s destruction. But as an extraordinary great man, how could he accept this willingly?</p><br/><p>Regaining his composure, he decided to go for another adventure.</p><br/><p>The Tang had set up a trap, and waited patiently for three years, taking a risk to complete an impossible feat. Since they could do it, why couldn\u2019t he risk it too, why wouldn\u2019t he succeed?</p><br/><p>He believed that Tengri has not abandoned him yet.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the most respected elders of the tribe, A Da, General Lebu, and the high priest, representing the national master, all came into his room. They stared at Chanyu\u2019s silent back while he looked at the sand table.</p><br/><p>Chanyu pointed at an inconspicuous city on the sand table and said calmly, \u201cI know the Tang and the people of the tribe have thought that this war is over and that the battle on the other day was the decisive one. But I do not think so. This dusty city is underneath our feet, it is also the final battleground that I have chosen.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one understood what he meant. The Royal Court was far from a match of the Tang. Even if they wanted a decisive battle, how would the Tang allow them the chance? In other words, did the Royal Court even deserve this battle?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Tang\u2026 or should I say the Academy\u2019s aim is to exterminate our tribe. They want to kill every single one of us. Our goal now is to escape their pursuit and return to our homeland.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have no supplies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have some stored in Qicheng Village, I have sent Su Yong to move them here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose won\u2019t be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot enough for a hundred thousand, but if we take thirty thousand troops, it would suffice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Tang will be behind our backs all the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why we need a victory, a decisive victory that could cause chaos among the Tang. Only then can we preserve the final flame of our tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chanyu looked at the empty plains on the sand table, and the seven distant strongholds. After a moment of silence he said, \u201cIf Xu Chi wants to kill us all, his troops can only push north in a line, their formation will be thin. If ten thousand Duoer Cavalry broke through their centerline, and rushed straight to the North Battalion, or even further south\u2026 don\u2019t you think the Tang would be shaken? How would the academy react?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Tang\u2019s main forces can battle from dawn to midnight, Xu Chi would never make a mistake like this,\u201d General Lebu replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cA general whose defenses are the best in the world will not make a mistake like this. Just like before\u2026 I would not make the mistake of pouring all my forces into the fray at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chanyu shook his head and said, \u201cI did not see the trap set up by the Academy, and Xu Chi could only follow the Academy\u2019s instructions. Since the Academy wants all of us dead, he could only execute accordingly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The room fell silent, everyone was doubtful. Chanyu\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t just a risky move, but a crazy bet \u2014 no, not even a bet \u2014 it was more like turning back to face the abyss of desperation and letting out a furious, helpless cry. Even if Xu Chi really pulled his formation too thinly, even if the Duoer Cavalry truly had penetrated to the south, they wouldn\u2019t be able to turn the tables.</p><br/><p>A Da\u2019s eyes lit up. He completely understood Chanyu\u2019s intentions. Chanyu wasn\u2019t hoping to win. He just wanted to get away with twenty thousand elite cavalry. He will lose the war, but the Tang\u2019s wish will not be gratified. When they have rested up, and secured the south with Taoism, they might try to conquer the entire human realm again.</p><br/><p>Lebu was quiet for a moment before nominating himself, \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one argued with him because this was neither an opportunity for honour, nor a sacrifice for the Royal Court, but a decision born from the hard, cold consideration of reality. Neither A Da nor the priests had the capability to command a large army.</p><br/><p>The high priest proposed, \u201cThe national master will follow us, and escort Chanyu back to the plains.\u201d</p><br/><p>A Da did not say anything because he knew the role he has to play. When the Duoer Cavalry would be able to break through the Tang\u2019s defenses, and when they start to kill and pillage around the North Battalion at the moment when everyone least expected, the Tang army will pursue the Royal Court where Chanyu was in with their quickest pace. The quickest pace demands the shortest route, and the shortest route is a straight line, which seemed to be a teaching of the Academy.</p><br/><p>The Royal Court will return north through the City of Wei, so the Tangs shall pursue them there.</p><br/><p>His task was to guard the only street in the City of Wei.</p><br/><p>A Da bowed to Chanyu and turned away. He walked to the street, and pushed the door of an old store. He sat down at a table beside, and he never left.</p><br/><p>The rest quickly left the room, and began to prepare the escape and the mission to the south.</p><br/><p>After the national master knew of Chanyu\u2019s plans, he naturally had to make appropriate arrangements.</p><br/><p>His room was empty again, Chanyu turned toward the window, and looked at the moon that hung in the night sky. From its warm and gentle radiance, he felt like he gained a certain power.</p><br/><p>After the massacre of Wei, many houses became uninhabitable. The people of the plains were more accustomed to tents pitched outside of the city, anyway. His stay tonight was at a rather secluded small courtyard.</p><br/><p>He did not know whom this courtyard belonged to, or who belonged to this City of Wei. So, he did not understand why did that person wanted to kill him. If he knew Tengri had lived here for many years, too, he might have had more different ideas.</p><br/><p>****************************************************************************************************</p><br/><p>The battle that happened on the plains beyond Guhe, was the most epic and the most terrible cavalry war in a thousand years, after the Tang defeated the Wild people.</p><br/><p>The Golden Tribe Royal Court Cavalry that participated in this war outnumbered the Tang. Besides, over the years, the Tang Cavalry was lacking in training in terms of riding. Theoretically, the Royal Court should have an advantage. However, the Tang army was the final victor, especially before the two hidden Northern Battlefront army brigades appeared, the vanguard battalion had forcibly stopped the Royal Court Cavalry that came like a rushing tide. That was because the Tang army had something the Royal Court lacked.</p><br/><p>It was valiant. The Tang army was valiant, even the horses they rode on were valiant. In the spring winds, on the plains, the Tang soldiers brandished their Pudaos, quietly killing one enemy after another. The horses stepped on the wild flowers and grass as they galloped with abandon. They imitated their riders, terribly bullying the grassland horses of the Royal Court.</p><br/><p>The Battle of Guhe was destined to be painted on the epic and beautiful painting known as history. In hindsight, this could not be considered as the most important battle in the realm of man, but it was definitely one of the most important battles.</p><br/><p>After obtaining victory, even if the Golden Tribe Royal Court could fight again, they could not threaten the foundations of the Tang any further. To be straight to the point, from that day onward, if even the Royal Court had given everything they had, they could have never destroyed the Tang.</p><br/><p>For the entire human realm, the more important thing was the Tang had finished their greatest enemies for many years in the north. Now the ministers in Chang\u2019an could spend all their energy and resources on the south. If they launch and attack before Taoism could solve their internal strife, Peach Mountain will face an insurmountable pressure.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Situ Yilan led the cavalry of the vanguard camp to the frontlines at Qicheng Village. At that time, she and the whole Tang army were surely winning, but they were vying for a bigger victory.</p><br/><p>During this time, the bodyguards of the Northern Battalion and a part of the West Conquering army that were moved here from the Cong Ridge braved huge sacrifices while they bit the Royal Court Cavalry like a wolf. They were ferocious, not letting go even when its whole body was soaked in blood. The Royal Court Cavalry, known for their mobility, was forced into a sluggish retreat to the north. The day before, when only half of their forces had just entered the Qicheng Village line, the Tang main force was already right behind them.</p><br/><p>In this situation, the grassland cavalry that have retreated to Qicheng Village did not dare to depart further into the plains. It was because that would mean leaving their backs to the terrifying Tang \u2014 not even the Duoer Cavalry dared to do so \u2014 as that would mean complete destruction.</p><br/><p>The remaining hundred thousand or so grassland cavalry camped at Qicheng Village in an attempt to stabilize the situation. After forcing a stalemate, they would try to retreat behind the lines to shake off the Tang army\u2019s pursuit, escaping deep into the plains.</p><br/><p>But some of the tribes that only hoped to be lucky did not know that Chanyu had made a cold blooded yet the only correct decision. He wanted to use the tribes as a bait for the Tang\u2019s main force, pulling their frontlines thin. Then, he will send out ten thousand elite Duoer Cavalry, forcing his way south without anyone anticipating it!</p><br/><p>These arrangements required the sacrifice of more than a hundred thousand grassland cavalry soldiers. If everything went well, twenty thousand Duoer Cavalry and important people like Chanyu could retreat deep into the plains successfully.</p><br/><p>This was a cruel and seemingly unprofitable exchange, but it was necessary. Now that the Tang army had horses, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for the Royal Court to retreat to the plains. Especially now when the Tang army was apparently in a frenzy. They were a pack of wolves more ferocious than the grasslander. If the Tang army pursued them with all they have, the Royal Court wouldn\u2019t dare to turn around and intercept them. Before they could go more than 300 miles, they would have been exterminated.</p><br/><p>When Chanyu was doing his final preparations, the Tang army surrounded the Qicheng Village. \u201cSurrounding\u201d was inaccurate, because the northern plains seemed wide and borderless, accessible to them at anytime. It was the way out, purposely reserved for the Royal Court Cavalry by the Tang army, and was in fact, a dead end.</p><br/><p>The Northern Battlefront army main force formed a stalemate against the cavalry of every tribe in Qicheng Village. But this situation did not last for long. Without any warning, the two sides began to fight fiercely again, killing each other for a time that seemed to last eternally. Both sides continued to reap each others\u2019 lives, and there was chaos everywhere.</p><br/><p>Three days later, the imperial flag waved in the air, smoke filled the sky, and the Tang army\u2019s Commander\u2019s Barracks arrived at the south of Wei.</p><br/><p>The Subjugation General of Great Tang, Xu Chi, has finally arrived at the frontlines. He was not late. As long as he was able to arrive before the war ended, to witness the end of the Golden Tribe, he would not be considered as late.</p><br/><p>The surprising thing was, neither Xu Chi nor Chanyu, who was in the City of Wei, issued any direct orders on the bloody battlefield that spanned several hundred miles on the north of the continent. They watched quietly as the cavalry on both sides continued to kill, die, and wait for reinforcements from Kaiping and other strongholds.</p><br/><p>This was a war between nations to begin with. It was impossible to end it in a day. Before the end, there would be no time for breathing. I can only live if you die, that was the essence.</p><br/><p>So Xu Chi did not do anything. Nor did Chanyu, but they threw their young men into the fray one after another, and they will kill or be killed. Especially for the Tang army, they have already achieved a winning condition. They only wanted to cut down their enemies\u2019 remaining strength, to destroy their bloodline and country completely, which was also the essence of this war.</p><br/><p>A few lines would not capture the bloodshed on the Qicheng Village frontlines. They would not be enough to describe the pressure on the remaining Golden Tribe troops, or the sacrifice offered by the Tang army. People would only remember that this siege that lasted a short few days have taken more lives than those on the Plains of Guhe.</p><br/><p>Unlike the other strongholds like Kaiping and Qu City, the City of Wei, supposedly the true battlefield, was peaceful, void of the scent of blood, or the killing rush of cavalry, not even a single sound of a horse\u2019s hoof.</p><br/><p>The Golden Tribe Royal Court was here, and so was the Tang army Commander\u2019s Barracks, but their battle seemed so far away.</p><br/><p>Xu Chi looked at the ashen dusty city from telescope before frowning subtly and falling silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who still can fight are thirty thousand Duoer.\u201d An advisor explained unceasingly, \u201cFrom our calculations, at least ten thousand Duoer remain around the perimeter of Wei. Is Chanyu really planning to guard the city?\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the Qicheng Village, the City of Wei was the smallest dusty city. There was a saying that grasslander are bad at guarding cities. The small city could never accommodate twenty thousand cavalry. Now the Duoer Cavalry camped at the plains north of the city, but did not retreat before the Tang army arrived. Did they really plan to fight to their deaths here?</p><br/><p>Xu Chi looked at the Dusty City, and suddenly said, \u201cThey are going south again,\u201d</p><br/><p>The officers in the Commander\u2019s Barracks all looked up in surprise when they heard this.</p><br/><p>Right after experiencing a traumatic defeat, would the grasslander calvary dare to go south again? Even if the Duoer Cavalry were to penetrate the defenses of the main force, what could they do after they reach Xiangwan Plains? Could they be aiming at Chang\u2019an?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone noticed a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Commander\u2019s Barracks\u2019 defenses are too thin, we should call General Situ as backup!\u201d An advisor said hurriedly, \u201cIf the Duoer really attacked us, the safety of the Commander\u2019s Barracks would be a big concern. Moreover, once chaos ensues, we might just let Chanyu escape! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have no need of such unnecessary acts.\u201d Xu Chi looked at the dusty city, and thought of that person\u2019s promise. He asked, \u201cWhere do you think the Duoer will attack from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they circled around the city, it would be a waste of the horses\u2019 strength, and it would be easy for our arbalesters to shoot them down. If I were Chanyu, I would choose to come through the city if I wanted to create a chaotic situation and head south.</p><br/><p>Xu Chi said nothing more as he turned his back and walked to the camp to take a short nap. He had not slept a wink in a few days, so he was completely exhausted.</p><br/><p>As for Chanyu\u2019s plot or long-term plan, and his admirable decisiveness and vigor. Since he had already seen through he, he did not feel worried, because that person had promised that there will be no problem.</p><br/><p>Xu Chi slept well that night. When he woke up, the sky was not fully lit yet. It was the darkest hour before the dawn. He arose and washed up, and emptied a bowl of horse milk. Then he wore his armor and brought his horse to the higher elevated meadow beside the camp perimeter. He took down the telescope from the saddle, and looked at the dusty city again.</p><br/><p>It was dawn, and the world was silent.</p><br/><p>The city gates were shut tight. There was no light in there, as if it was a haunted city.</p><br/><p>But Xu Chi knew that Chanyu\u2019s strongest men will soon burst forth from those very gates.</p><br/><p>He appeared very calm before his men, but he was actually a little anxious. Else he would not have come here to scout his enemies so early in the morning, to sooner determine the time his foes will arrive.</p><br/><p>The Cavalry of the Northern Battlefront army main force have been diverted to other battlefields like Kaiping, and Qu City. The Commander\u2019s Barracks stood alone against the Golden Tribe Royal Court. How would they stand against the attack of ten thousand Duoer Cavalry?</p><br/><p>Xu Chi had always thought he could completely trust that person. But as he looked at the dusty city before the quiet dawn, he felt uneasy.</p><br/><p>The city walls were low, the archers platform above the gate was 30 feet away from the ground. When the morning light came, those with better eyesight could even clearly see the hardy grass growing from the cracks in between the dirt.</p><br/><p>When Xu Chi was watching the dusty city, there was someone watching him from the city walls.</p><br/><p>The Golden Tribe national master stared at the camps of the Tang army Commander\u2019s Barracks on the meadow afar. He looked on as the war horses were feeding on straws while bowing their heads. He confirmed the information relayed by the Royal Court Cavalry, and his aged face did not regain its peace.</p><br/><p>The Tang camp was quiet. As the battle at other strongholds continued bitterly, the Royal Court Cavalry were defending on their last legs. Joining the dots, he could tell that Xu Chi had already known Chanyu\u2019s intentions. Why was he still so compliant?</p><br/><p>The national master did not want to calculate the success rate of Chanyu\u2019s risky tactics.</p><br/><p>Since the Royal Court had their backs forced to the Abyss by the Tang, they had to struggle a little instead of just giving up like that. Wasn\u2019t the last choice the best choice?</p><br/><p>Yes, he knew these words were from the Academy.</p><br/><p>Xu Chi\u2019s confidence was mostly based on the Academy.</p><br/><p>From the beginning of the battle until now, the Academy had yet to truly act.</p><br/><p>The true aces had yet to act.</p><br/><p>In the silent dawn, the national master looked at the sky, awaiting the presence of some people.</p></div>\n</div>"}

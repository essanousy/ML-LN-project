Even if I had broken through beyond the Five States, it wouldn\u2019t have been something to be proud of. Just like what you said, it is difficult to think that you are the special one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que laughed and said, \u201cYou sound a little arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan was stunned and asked, \u201cHow is it arrogant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThe Five States separate man and heaven. Those who can break the Five States would attain the legendary Sage state. No Sages have come forward in the cultivation world for years. But you said that it isn\u2019t anything to be proud of, is that not arrogance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan shook his head and said, \u201cBreaking the Five States might be difficult, but there aren\u2019t many in the cultivation world who have the opportunity. Furthermore, even if one broke the Five States, how can one be called a Sage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not understand. He said, \u201cWhy have I never heard of anyone who could break the Five States?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan looked at him and asked, \u201cWhat is the current state of Mr. Second of the Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que considered his question and said, \u201cSecond Brother should be at the Peak of the Knowing Destiny State. But\u2026 you know how he is, he might break through into the next state if he really got mad.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan did not laugh because he did not understand.</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s laughter tapered off awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cSince Mr. Second is already at the Peak of the Knowing Destiny State, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the Master extended a finger and pointed up.</p><br/><p>Ning Que came to a sudden realization. Second Brother was already at the peak of Knowing Destiny State. Eldest Brother must be close to breaking the Five States or he might have already done so. As for teacher\u2026 well, they were talking about regular humans; it had nothing to do with his teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I admit that there might be people who have already broken the Five States.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, Liu Bai had once fought with Master Yan Se. Strong wind blasted at the Eastern Seas then. Everyone thought that he was most likely to break the Five States. I think that he could have long broken through the Five States, but he just hasn\u2019t taken the step yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cYounger Brother Lotus was extraordinary then. He studied both Taoism and Buddism and had a grounding in diabolism. If he wanted to, breaking the Five States wouldn\u2019t have been anything difficult. He just didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que had heard Lotus say the same thing at the Front Gate of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine. Back then, he hadn\u2019t really believed Lotus because he felt that he was just a bigwig boasting before his death.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked in confusion, \u201cWhy have these people chosen not to take the last step?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreaking the Five states would mean that the cultivator would leave the secular world. They would not only be able to grasp the inherent rules of the Heaven and Earth\u2019s aura, and understand the rules of the world, they could even create new rules. However, this is Haotian\u2019s world; the rules of the larger world cannot be challenged. Battle would still be done in accordance to the rules of the larger world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cThat is the reason why, to the small number of true powerhouses, the largest difference between staying at the peak of Knowing Destiny State and breaking the Five States is their understanding of the source of the world. It does not do much in respect of boosting their powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que could not understand. He said, \u201cBeing able to scale up would still be good. Who could resist such temptation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan sighed, and he looked at the grey skies. He said, \u201cYou are very right, this temptation is too great. And because of this great temptation, these people do not dare to take that step.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know of any other states above the Five States?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTianqi, Limitless State\u2026 I have only heard of these two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered. This was what he had heard from Lyu Qingchen on his journey to Chang\u2019an from the City of Wei. Back then, he had yet been unable to cultivate. Now, he was already a Grand Cultivator in the Knowing Destiny State. However, his understanding of the states above the five remained at the same standard.</p><br/><p>He had once asked about it at the back of the mountain of Academy. His Senior Brothers thought that his question was too boring and did not bother answering him. Now that it seemed that the master was able to solve his doubts, so he could not help but feel excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the Classics, is stated that there are many states above that of the mortal realm. You talked about Tianqi, the West-Hill teachings mentioned it a lot. Limitless State, means knowing in Buddhism. Other than that, the Classics also mention the Buddhist Boundlessness and Nirvana. There is also the Divine Demon Realm of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, the Tranquility of Haotian Taoism\u2026 These states are all above the Five States, and are all interesting in their own right. There is no one state that is stronger or better than the other.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a long pause.</p><br/><p>\u201cLegend says that there are other states above all these states. It is not recorded even in the oldest Classics. It is passed down by word of mouth in a Buddhist Temple, a Taoist Temple, and the Second floor of a sect. That is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Immortal State of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNirvana of the Buddhism Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAscension to heaven and becoming immortal of Haotian Taoism.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Academy\u2019s Transcending the Worldly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The autumn rain grew heavier, and the front of the temple grew colder.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan tightly pulled his cotton shirt around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Devil\u2019s Doctrine only started a millennia ago, I have never heard of anyone cultivating to the Immortal State. When Buddha entered Parinirvana, the skies gave a sign, that should be Nirvana. Ascension to Heaven is more common, those are the legends of deities in the secular world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que seemed to understand something.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan lamented, \u201cIn the past millennium, there might have been one person who could slowly walk to the end of the cultivation path. There might have been one person who could reach the shore astride, and one who could achieve living forever. Then, they would return to Haotian\u2019s embrace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the stone steps that were wet by the rain. He asked, stunned, \u201cWould that be death or eternal life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan seemed a bit lost. He said, \u201cBuddha cannot come back and tell us. Our Taoist seniors who have ascended into heaven and become immortals cannot tell us either. This is the greatest temptation and fear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked up at the master and asked, \u201cIs that why both Liu Bai and Lotus did not dare to take that step?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan answered, \u201cThis should be the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is still a large distance between the point where one breaks the Five States and reaching those states. However, once you get a taste of it, you\u2019d want to do it again. After experiencing creating their own rules, cultivators would find it hard to control their desire to continue forth. That is why unless they truly believe that their talent can only bring them just past the threshold of Haotian Taoism, they would not dare to take another step.\u201d</p><br/><p>The master shook his head slowly and said, \u201cHowever, those who can break the Five States are impressive characters like Liu Bai and Younger Brother Lotus. They are very confident in their own talents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly said, \u201cThe Headmaster\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. Decades ago, the Headmaster himself said that he was not a Sage. If you want me to guess, I would guess that he has cultivated to the State of Peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and said, \u201cHe is so noisy, how could he be peaceful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cThe peace is in his heart and that is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que reached out and caught hold of the rain outside the temple. He rubbed it between his fingers, and after a long pause, he asked, \u201cIs there no one who is capable of ascending to the heavens?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cIs there anyone who can escape the cycle of nature?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que retracted his hand and wiped it on his Academy uniform. He said, \u201cTeacher never told me about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cThat\u2019s because the Headmaster believed that you would definitely reach the Peak of Knowing Destiny State. When you see the separation between man and heaven, you would know then, the fear and temptations on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Above the Earth was the Firmament.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked up at the skies in the autumn rain and realized that it was bleak.</p><br/><p>He felt a little cold.</p><br/><p>Heaven\u2019s Way was indeed ruthless.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

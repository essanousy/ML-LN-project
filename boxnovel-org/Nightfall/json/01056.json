They knew the general was right. The Northern Battlefront Army was indeed facing great difficulties. But the Tang Empire was also sieged by various parties. Furthermore, both the Southern Battlefront Army and the Northeast Battlefront Army were engaged in important battles and could not come to help.</p><br/><p>Guhe was a very tiny spot throughout Tang\u2019s vast territory that located two thousands away from Chang\u2019an. But currently it was the last defense line outside the capital. Therefore Xu Chi had decided to defend it to the very last. Even the General\u2019s Mansion had to be relocated to the north.</p><br/><p>No one said a word in a long while. There was only silence and falling snowflakes in the valley. The temperature as well as the atmosphere was frozen. Although they echoed Xu Chi\u2019s judgment, they were also aware that to give up their previous plan and stay to defend Guhe would only lead to further serious casualties. Moreover, would they really be able to win?</p><br/><p>They knew it better than the soldiers that the imperial court had tried their best. From the imperial family to ordinary people, everyone had been living on lowest expenses so as to provide the Northern Battlefront Army with constant and abundant supplies. That was why they could still have fresh pork after such a severe winter, not to mention sufficient armor and weapons.</p><br/><p>However, the terrain around Guhe meant that if the Northern Battlefront Army had to stop the Golden Tribe Royal Court at that point, they must defeat over ten thousands of elite cavalrymen from the grasslands a field battle, which was exactly the least desirable for the Northern Battlefront Army at the moment! ( .c om )</p><br/><p>The Northern Battlefront Army used to be unbeatable in the north and never worried about getting in or out of the grassland. Even the most ordinary soldiers in the army were very good at riding and shooting. How could they ever be worried about field battles? But now they were trying their best to avoid confronting the enemies in the fields. Because there was a fatal disadvantage: they were lacking warhorses.</p><br/><p>Hua Ying broke the silence and came to kneel down in front of Xu Chi. He stated calmly and resolutely, \u201cWe\u2019ll die defending the country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi stared at the grey hair on his temples and and the weather-worn face, and felt loaded with sensations. But instead of showing his sensations, he commanded, \u201cNo. You will defend the country even if you are dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua Ying replied with no hesitation, \u201cAs you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi lifted him up and stared at him for a long while. He could no longer hide his emotions and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve done great these years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua Ying smiled and said nothing further.</p><br/><p>Ever since the war was launched against the Golden Tribe Royal Court, he had been fighting in the very front of Tang\u2019s northern territory. He took the most important role as well as the heaviest burden. Although he was in charge of the only cavalrymen left in the Northern Battlefront Army, the situation was still very unfavorable. If it was not because of his high attainments in martial arts and the Tang army\u2019s intensive defense, he would have been killed several times by the assassins from the grassland. But Hua Ying never complained. When Xu Chi proposed to relocate him to the North Battalion for a break, he refused resolutely.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the Northern Battlefront Army understood why. Even the nobles in the imperial palace and those in the Military Ministry back in Chang\u2019an were aware of the reason. Hua Ying\u2019s family name was Hua, the same as Hua Shanyue. They were both from the Hua family.</p><br/><p>Hua Shanyue helped Li Yu in the rebellion and died upon their failure. The military officers who followed him had defected from Gushan Commandery and returned secretly to Chang\u2019an. Ning Que sent them all to the North Battalion to make up and win their honor back. But most of them had died throughout the years. Because of this, formerly celebrated Hua family declined immediately. Nowadays Hua Ying was the only one who still held an important position in the military. Therefore Hua Ying served desperately. He wanted to sacrifice himself in order to prove that the Hua family was indefectible, always vigorous and glorious.</p><br/><p>Xu Chi said, \u201cDon\u2019t risk your life. It\u2019s better to be alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua Ying did not answer directly. Instead he said, \u201cWe will win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was the end of spring in the sixth year of Zhengshi of the Tang Empire, and the three thousand four hundred and fifty-fifth year of Dazhi of the West-Hill.</p><br/><p>( .c om ) The vanguard of Tang\u2019s Northern Battlefront Army confronted the cavalrymen of the Golden Tribe Royal Court a hundred and seventy miles to the south of Wei, and fought for over ten days with ups and downs on both sides. Then all of the principal force of the Northern Battlefront Army came to the north and stationed at Guhe.</p><br/><p>The two most powerful military forces fought for another dozen days, again with ups and downs on both sides. But Guhe was still under the protection of the Northern Battlefront Army and the cavalry of Golden Tribe could not push even one step further to the south.</p><br/><p>Then they took a short break during the stalemate. But both sides knew that they could no longer hang on for dozens of days or even years. Their stalemate could only last at most for two days before the battle would be relaunched.</p><br/><p>In order to keep the cavalry of the Golden Tribe to the north of Guhe, the Northern Battlefront Army had paid great prices because they were in lack of warhorses. Even the most experienced and skillful soldiers at riding and shooting could only hold their Podaos and stay on the sides, instead of participating in the real fight.</p><br/><p>The most powerful cavalrymen of the Northern Battlefront Army could only serve as infantrymen because of the lack of warhorses. Everyone knew it was a waste. But who could change the situation now?</p><br/><p>Ever since the Divine Halls of West-Hill forced Tang to sign the treaty to cede Xiangwan Plain, and from the day that the warhorses were handed over, they were doomed to be helpless and inferior.</p><br/><p>The morning sun rose again in the east. Those with better sight as well as Xu Chi, who stayed in the General\u2019s Mansion, could see vaguely the outline of Min Mountain under the bloody morning glow.</p><br/><p>The cavalry of Golden Tribe Royal Court retreated yesterday to Kaipingji for a break as well as preparation for a final attack. The Tang army was very resolute and the organization of their infantry was flawless. But the Chanyu of the Golden Tribe Royal Court could no longer be satisfied with the minor victories in the fields and got obviously anxious with time passing by. The coming field battle would be the most brutal one that the Northern Battlefront Army had ever confronted.</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan stood by the meadow, held the saber on his waist and stared at the barracks of the cavalry of the Golden Tribe Royal Court. On her dust stained face there was nothing but calmness and alert. Her squinted eyes shone chillingly, even colder than her blade.</p><br/><p>As a student of the Academy and a descendent of a former famous general, she had always been outstanding in the Northern Battlefront Army and became the youngest leader long ago. Now she was already the deputy-general to Hua Ying and widely respected by the soldiers and officers.</p><br/><p>During the over ten days of fighting, especially in the past few days, the Northern Battlefront Army was under overwhelming pressures and paid great prices. Their surgeons did not sleep for three days and nights.</p><br/><p>While thinking of that, Situ Yilan seemed very calm so as not to worry her guards. But the problem was always there, pressing on her heart like a heavy rock.</p><br/><p>The Golden Tribe Royal Court was taking a break rather than retreat. The general had commanded to guard Guhe to the very last and could not take one step backward. It seemed that the fields here were going to become the graveyard for tens of thousands of soldiers. But who was going to win eventually and write epitaphs on their gravestones as the victor?</p><br/><p>She ranked high in the Northern Battlefront Army and knew a lot of information that was kept secret from ordinary soldiers. Some reinforcements tried to sneak attack a troop of the Golden Tribe via the Min Mountain. But the enemy saw through their plan and called troops back to the Royal Court immediately. Therefore the Northern Battlefront Army had lost a best chance to upset their enemy\u2019s foundation.</p><br/><p>Then what could they do next?</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan stared at the sand table for a long while. She tried to compare what she learned from the Academy and her experience in the military, but could never find out any solution.</p><br/><p>Only General Xu Chi was qualified to make military decisions for the Northern Battlefront Army. Or perhaps so could the siblings in the imperial palace as well as the seniors from the Academy. But she did want to help.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Apart from the rock pressing on her heart, Situ Yilan had many other doubts.</p><br/><p>General Xu Chi\u2019s strategy was never wrong, from the retreat at the beginning to the command of defending right now. The former was meant to obtain more time and exhaust the enemy, while the latter was to maintain the morale and stay seemingly superior. They had to be absolutely resolute and ruthless in order to defend the northern territory of Tang. But it seemed there should have been some better, more flexible or less desperate strategy.</p><br/><p>General Xu Chi\u2019s current strategy was to attract all the troops of Golden Tribe Royal Court to the battlefields at Guhe. If only they would win there would be no chance even for the enemy\u2019s best cavalry to escape. Because throughout the hundreds of years of war between Tang and the Golden Tribe Royal Court, the most annoying part for the Tang was that the Royal Court was so good at escaping. Even if the Tang army were to win, the cavalry of the Royal Court could always retreat swiftly to the heart of the grassland and make it impossible for the Tang to wipe out their principal force.</p><br/><p>It was a very wise military strategy. But in order for this plan to be executed, the Tang army would have to win the battle in the first place. Otherwise how could they ever think of wiping out the principal force of the Golden Tribe?</p><br/><p>But how could they win the battle? Situ Yilan could not think of any solution. She did not believe that General Xu Chi would have a better answer either. Therefore she could not understand what the general or the imperial court was thinking about.</p><br/><p>She was not a pessimist or a defeatist. Like her guards and the soldiers in the Tang barracks, she was never afraid of the cavalry of the Golden Tribe Royal Court. Yet her senses were reminding her that a victory was indeed illusionary.</p><br/><p>The Northern Battlefront Army was very well trained and they had a pretty favorable location with Guhe behind them. Although they might not have the best timing or morale, it should not be so desperate. However, there had always been the everlasting problem.</p><br/><p>No horses. No warhorses. The Northern Battlefront Army was in a great need of warhorses.</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan led her guards back to the barracks. Soldiers along the way saluted to her. She could still tell the difference from their postures that seemed almost exactly the same. Those new soldiers who had been in the Northern Battlefront Army less than two years had much clearer eyes and seemed a bit shy. Whereas the veterans seemed indifferent. And their eyes\u2026 seemed frivolous when they glanced at her. She could feel it distinctively even with the slightest glance.</p><br/><p>The veterans reminded her of a person she had not met for years. He used to be her classmate, and later on the so-called mister, who had made his way to the top of the world.</p></div>\n</div>"}

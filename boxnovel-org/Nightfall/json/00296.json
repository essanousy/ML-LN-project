The game had been on since daytime, but it wasn't even halfway through in the late night. Thus, the situation indeed made him impatient.</p><br/><p>Monk Huang Yang helpless smiled and replied, \"His Majesty, the men like the Divine Priest of Light and Master Yan Se, are considered supermundane figures. No matter how we are wary of and respond to it, few things will change there.\"</p><br/><p>The atmosphere of Chang'an this evening was nervous and depressive. Other than the shop in Lin 47th Street, the imperial palace was naturally the most heavily guarded place. In accordance with the rules, since the Nation Master Li Qingshan wasn't by the emperor now, Monk Huang Yang, the younger brother of the emperor, would accompany His Majesty at every moment.</p><br/><p>His Majesty scattered the chess pieces in front of him with his hand and walked out of the imperial study. He stood beside the trees, flowers, and snow. As he quietly looked at the city under darkness, he suddenly said, \"Do you believe the tale about the invasion of Underworld?\"</p><br/><p>Monk Huang Yang put his palms together in silence and shook his head.</p><br/><p>After a gust of night wind, His Majesty began coughing and the sound became louder and louder. At last, the emperor painfully bent his waist due to the continuous coughing. He waved his hand and drove away the eunuchs and palace maids who came to him because of his coughing. After gently rubbing the corners of his mouth with a handkerchief, he looked at the darkness and said, \"I only hope it will come earlier if it isn't just a tale.\"</p><br/><p>Monk Huang Yang recognized the ominous meaning hidden behind the emperor's words. Both his statement and the previous coughing made him frown. He looked at the emperor's and worriedly said, \"His Majesty is suffering from a cold disease now, so it's better to go back to the room.\"</p><br/><p>The emperor slowly shook his head and said, \"The Headmaster of Academy once said the cold disease inside my body isn't very serious. As long as I can suppress it, it's unable to threaten me. If I fail, that will be my fate.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Yang was the Younger brother of emperor of Tang dynasty, but he wasn't like the Nation Master Li Qingshan, who had been with His Majesty for so many years. Thus, he didn't know those old stories. For example, he didn't know the story between the emperor of Tang and the young girl of Devil's Doctrine. Listening to the emperor's words, he felt worried and confused. Could it be that even the Headmaster of Academy was incapable of completely curing the cold disease inside the emperor's body?</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>When Chen Pipi walked out of the door, the burning color in the Lin 47th Street instantly disappeared, leaving behind only a tall ancient hat left. Covering his head, he just walked in that direction and politely stood behind the owner of the hat.</p><br/><p>Looking at the closed door of Old Brush Pen Shop, Second Brother's expression was aloof and peaceful. However, his eyes were loomingly full of exciting fire, just like his tall hat that looked as if it was burning in the dusk.</p><br/><p>There was no one in the alley, and the doors of that fake antique shop and grocery store were all closed. A square stool somehow appeared by the grey-white wall below the winter tree. Second Brother seated stiffly on it, as steady as a pine on the cliff. What's more, that young and cute little boy was quietly accompanying him on one side, just like a white stone below the pine.</p><br/><p>Looking at the closed door, Second Brother suddenly asked, \"They still haven't fought yet?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi lowered his head and politely replied, \"They are reminiscing their old days.\"</p><br/><p>There were some unpleasant expressions appearing on Second Brother's serious face. He said, \"Old men always conduct things in a dilatory way. Since both of them insist on their own standpoints, the result will depend on their fists and strength in the end. There's no need to spend such a long time reminiscing. They don't deserve to be called \"Gentlemen\" due to their dilatory style.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi rubbed his cold sweat left on his forehead and daren't say a word.</p><br/><p>Second Brother's absolutely straight eyebrow suddenly frowned. He gently raised the front part of his gown and then flapped it. After adjusting his ancient hat which actually didn't move a bit, he said, \"They still aren't fighting. Do I have to wait the entire night for it?\"</p><br/><p>Noticing Second Brother's movement, Chen Pipi knew that his impatient Second Brother wouldn't like to spend time on the meaningless wait and was ready to enter Old Brush Pen Shop. Chen Pipi was instantly shocked and sweat immediately wet his clothes again.</p><br/><p>In the Old Brush Pen Shop at present, two terrific figures, Great Divine Priest of Light and Master Yan Se, were at a deadlock. If Second Brother were to join in, who would know what the fight destructions would occur and what it would do to damage the street?</p><br/><p>Thinking about the situation, Chen Pipi, regardless of his regular reverence to Second Brother and Second Brother's habit of keeping dressing neat, grasped Second Brother's sleeve tightly. With a trembling and slightly hoarse voice, he sincerely begged, \"Senior Brother, please don't enter there.\"</p><br/><p>Having a glance at his crumpled sleeve corner, Second Brother asked expressionlessly, \"Those two men can enter, why can't I?\"</p><br/><p>According to the real thought in Chen Pipi's deep heart, wind, rain, light, and color could enter Old Brush Pen Shop, but Second Brother couldn't. The reason was very simple. Though the two elders in the shop had ever killed many people, at least the current situation was peaceful. Chang'an would be in a peaceful state if they could think twice before making a decision. However, if Second Brother entered Old Brush Pen Shop, he, who was inflexible in etiquette and raring for a fight, an earth-shaking battle would definitely happen in the shop!</p><br/><p>Besides, Chen Pipi had witnessed the excitingly burning fire in Second Brother's eyes, though Second Brother pretended to be serious and solemn. Actually, Second Brother had gathered a lot of desire to fight inside his body, because he was suppressed by Headmaster of Academy and Eldest Brother all the time and he had to preside over affairs of the Academy these two years. Today, the God of Light was a matched opponent for him, so how could he let the great opportunity escape?</p><br/><p>However, what Chen Pipi thought and knew wasn't important. He knew that if he advised Second Brother in this way, he would definitely be heavily bullied and Second Brother would still enter Old Brush Pen Shop in the end. Therefore, with his cute flesh on the face shaking, Chen Pipi advised in earnest, \"Dilatoriness isn't a fault. When Eldest Brother does something slowly, we still have no choice but to wait.\"</p><br/><p>Second Brother unhappily said, \"How could other people compete with our Senior Brother?\"</p><br/><p>Noticing that the mention of Eldest Brother still didn't work, Chen Pipi heavily and tightly grasped Second Brother's sleeve and said two sentences in a low voice. (Notes)</p><br/><p>Second Brother slightly frowned and waved his hand signalizing his cute serving boy, who was silently waiting beside him all the time, to return to the Academy. After adjusting his ancient hat and clothes, he just closed his eyes and peacefully waited in silence on the stool below the tree.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>From dusk to midnight, many people came outside the Lin 47th Street.</p><br/><p>General Huaihua, who looked impressive and strong, came representing the representing Tang's military ministry. A tough-looking Censor, on behalf of the imperial court, was on the spot. In addition, the Nation Master Li Qingshan, whose face was a little pale, also arrived.</p><br/><p>These figures representing different forces of Tang Empire gathered here only for one purpose. In other words, they came here for the rickety old man in Old Brush Pen Shop, for those bloody cases in Chang'an and Yan territory caused by the old man that year, as well as for the treason case of Xuanwei General many years ago.</p><br/><p>For more than ten years, the empire didn't delve deeply into that thing because its involvement was too deep and wide. It was relative to the prince and General Xiahou, even to the West-Hill Divine Palace and some more mysterious origins.</p><br/><p>However, the Divine Priest of Light, who schemed the plan that year, had betrayed the Divine Hall now and arrived in Chang'an in person. How could the emperor and officials of Tang allow him to leave Chang'an safely?</p><br/><p>In the big occasion like today, the men of Chang'an Local Government and Fish-dragon Gang even had no right to appear.</p><br/><p>These big figures and their own subordinates all expressionlessly sat under big umbrellas at the entrance and end of the alley. No one knew the situation inside Old Brush Pen Shop, so no one went towards the shop.</p><br/><p>Some people had long noticed that a freak in a tall hat was sitting and a very fat young man was standing beside that grey wall. However, after knowing their identities, no one dared question it.</p><br/><p>The time was flowing little by little and stars filled the night sky. Li Qingshan slowly walked from the entrance of the alley and greeted a bow with hands folded in front to both of them. After that, he, like the two men, just silently looked at the closed door of Old Brush Pen Shop too.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Sangsang didn't know there were so many supermundane mighty people and secular bigwigs surrounding Old Brush Pen Shop. On one hand, she just closed her eyes or wanted to sleep, because she thought falling asleep could relieve her. On the other hand, she thought if her young master knew the main culprit who should be responsible for the death of his whole family was sitting in the courtyard of the shop, would he be very sad?</p><br/><p>Sangsang just thought of it between waking and dreaming, and then she saw her birth parents in a dream.</p><br/><p>Sangsang had no idea who her parents were, and she was very curious about or missed the feeling. After all, Ning Que was just four years older than her, so it was hard to completely replace the role of parents.</p><br/><p>Finally, she encountered an old man in Chang'an, whose cotton-padded jacket was tinged with Hot and sour noodle slice soup. She felt the old man was naturally close to her. She could see the unreasonable and unconditional love in his eyes, just like Ning Que's love for her. Therefore, she thought she met the same existence as parents. Later, she began calling him teacher.</p><br/><p>Sangsang woke up with a start and her cheeks were a little wet.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Silence occupied the whole night, just like a gradually-dying oil lamp. Outside the shop door, the morning light was getting brighter.</p><br/><p>\"The Divine Hall didn't dispatch people here, and you know the Tang Empire's work style.\"</p><br/><p>Master Yan Se said with a sigh, \"We can't kill you by the cavalry troop in the city. If people like us wield our strength, it will only cause many innocent deaths and sufferings to others. However, it's impossible for the imperial court to let you leave, so it's a deadlock now.\"</p><br/><p>The old man kept silent. He clearly knew that since he was found by Tang Empire today, it definitely wouldn't allow him to escape again. He was the miraculous and powerful Divine Priest of Light. However, he would still be trapped at last, if the strong empire used its all strength to hunt him and he didn't resort to the protection of the city and its mass.</p><br/><p>\"That year, I heard you said you had ever made a bet in that shabby abbey in the Kingdom of Song.\"</p><br/><p>Master Yan Se looked at him and peacefully said, \"Make a bet for life or death one more time. If you win, you can continue to look for the shadow of Nightfall. If you lose, you should leave your life in Chang'an, which is also a conclusion to the old thing that year and a consolation to those nearly one thousand innocent people who tragically died because of you.\"</p><br/><p>The old man still kept silent.</p><br/><p>Master Yan Se looked at his eyes and suddenly said, \"Just bet with me for that female student of yours.\"</p><br/><p>After a deep thought, the old man stood up and said, \"Reasonable, admirable and worthy.\"</p><br/><p>There were three words in this sentence. The word 'admirable' was for Yan Se, who, in order to seek a chance to battle against him, was willing to give up the backup of Chang'an, a God-stunning tactical Array. In fact, as the controller of the array, Yan Se couldn't be beaten as long as he was in Chang'an. No matter how mighty his opponent was, the array could at least ensure his safety.</p><br/><p>The word 'worthy' referred to Sangsang. The winning or losing of the bet was relative to his life or death, but it was still worth accepting as long as it was for Sangsang. As for the word 'reasonable', it was actually the note for the word 'worthy': the old man was the light and he wanted to leave the light in Sangsang's world, so he should make a last but real luciferous choice.</p><br/><p>In a word, all of this was for Sangsang. It might seem unreasonable for many people, but in this old man's eyes, it was very reasonable. Many people would think it unworthy, but in his eyes, it was very worthy.</p><br/><p>Sangsang was a little handmaiden with black skin and yellowish hair. She wasn't good-looking, not to mention pretty. In addition, she looked very unimpressive and her character wasn't loved by others too.</p><br/><p>People who didn't appreciate her would just consider her as a stalk of swinging barnyard grass which might die in the cold wind at any time. However, those that could really appreciate her would treat her like treasure. So far, only two people in the world, her young master Ning Que and her teacher the Great Divine Priest of Light, had been able to really appreciate her.</p><br/><p>Therefore, after Prince Long Qing smilingly threatened her safety, Ning Que worriedly and silently tried to break the realm by Daming Lake, and then directly shot one arrow at this young and dignitary figure of the West-Hill and crippled him.</p><br/><p>When Wu Dao made her unhappy and tried to harass her, the Great Divine Priest of Light, who gave up the yellow croaker on the table and went to the alley without any hesitation, directly and easily blinded the monk from Unknown Place.</p><br/><p>The morning light came to Chang'an and then fell on Old Brush Pen Shop in Lin 47th Street.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Master Yan Se and the Great Divine Priest of Light terminated their reminiscence and negotiation hidden in the word. They decided to break the deadlock by a simple way, which was also a conclusion to that history of over ten years.</p><br/><p>The old hand slowly pushed the shop door. When the old man looked back, he found that Sangsang had been behind him.</p><br/><p>She hovered between waking and dreaming the whole night. She had awakened immediately when she heard the slight sounds from the courtyard and had hurried over.</p><br/><p>The old man silently looked at her and then suddenly asked, \"Want to have a look?\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang nodded frantically.</p><br/><p>The old man glanced at Master Yan Se.</p><br/><p>Master Yan Se laughed and said, \"To be honest, she's indeed the most suitable eyewitness.\"</p><br/><p>Looking at Sangsang' s little face, the old man smilingly said after a short pause, \"Bring that new urn. It hadn't been used for chicken tonic soup yet and isn't greasy, so it should be suitable for containing cremains.\"</p><br/><p>Listening to his words, Master Yan Se said, \"If you have an old urn, carry it too. You've earned a lot of taels of silver with my Chicken Soup Calligraphy, but I haven't even drunk the chicken soup you made yet.\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang lowered her head and said in a low voice, \"If both of you don't go outside, I will stew chicken soup for you today.\"</p><br/><p>The old man tenderly looked at her and shook his head. Later he looked at Yan Se and said, \"There's oil in the old urn, so the cremains would easily adhere to the wall.\"</p><br/><p>Master Yan Se gently waved his sleeves and walked out of Old Brush Pen Shop with loud laughter, \"My taoist robe is always stained with greasy dirt in my whole life, but I never avoid it. Do you think I will care about the thing that my cremains may be contaminated by greasy dirt after death?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>- --</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This directly caused the palace cavalry to harass and attack the southern part of Central Plains. In order to manage the unprecedented crisis, the West-Hill Divine Palace announced an edict to gather all believers of Haotian Taoism and allies to assist Yan Kingdom in fighting against the barbarians.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Tang Empire would send an army from the West Road to fight along with Yan Kingdom and assist Yan soldiers in all ways.</p><br/><p>When the relief troop arrived, the border of the cavalry from the Left-Tent palace seemed more tame, especially when the vanguard of Tang relief troop came to the wilderness located at the northern part of Yan via the east of Min Mountain. Chanyu from the Left-Tent palace then strengthened his supervision he had for each tribe. There was no sight of any barbarian riding horses in the wild as the winter wind howled loudly.</p><br/><p>The reason why barbarian cavalries were tough to deal with was due to the wide grassland which they owned behind them. As long as they sensed danger, they would hide themselves in the tall grasses so there was no way one could chase after them. Unless the rulers of every country were as ambitious and courageous as Taizu (Founder of the Tang Dynasty) in the past, there would be no way for them to remove this threat completely.</p><br/><p>Hence, when the barbarian cavalries softened down their attacks toward Yan territory and Left-Tent palace sent their messengers over, the army at the northern part of Central Plains in Yan territory stopped proceeding upwards. Instead, they chose to camp at that area and focused on defending their frontier fortress, thus calming the situation in that area.</p><br/><p>As for the ten thousand over soldiers that were stationed outside of Yan territory, they had called themselves as the Central Plains National Allied Forces. In fact, other than the young cultivators from South Jin Kingdom, it was basically made up of Yan Kingdom soldiers and Tang relief troops for Yan Kingdom.</p><br/><p>By relief troops for Yan Kingdom, it was referring to the elite troop led by General Xia Hou, which had conquered the West Road of the Empire. This heartless and powerful army had managed to consecutively conquered the 11 cities within Yan Kingdom 10 years ago, leaving a very painful memory for the Yan commoners. Hence, as compared to the barbarian cavalries from the grassland, these relief troops from Tang were much scarier and hateful.</p><br/><p>Due to the contrast between the strong hatred feelings and the weak military strength, all the soldiers in Yan Kingdom were very cautious towards the Tang relief troops in the west. Though on the surface they were being kind by sending meat and staples over as a form of respect, in reality, the Yan army kept its distance away from Tang troops, with each staying on the east and the west regions of the Northern Yan Border. They did not bother one another but were wary of each other's actions.</p><br/><p>Those young cultivators that came due to the West-Hill Divine Palace's edict were naturally on Yan Kingdom's side, whereas those practical students from Chang'an Academy were obviously under Tang Military camp.</p><br/><p>By the end of autumn, the temperature in the north of the wilderness started to drop till one could see his own breath and the grass started to turn pale yellow.</p><br/><p>Outside the Military camp at frontier fortress located somewhere in Northern Yan, there was a meadow. On the meadow, there were a few bleak trees, where one could easily see through them to view the clear wide sky and scenery at the backdrop. From there, one could see something burning as black smoke were churned out from the wilderness at the far end, and faint moaning sounds were heard from the injured soldiers lying on the horse carriage.</p><br/><p>Now that the situation at the frontier fortress was quietened down, there was a possibility that a peace talk might be held. However, deep within the wilderness, small battles between the Tang cavalries and the grassland cavalries were still going on. Every now and then, bodies and injured men were sent back.</p><br/><p>Ning Que sat by the meadow where he gazed in the north-west direction, as he slowly touched the small plate with his hands that were placed on his knees. The material of the plate was strange. It was neither made of gold, jade, stone nor wood, but it was very solid. The plate was given by Senior Sister Yu Lian before he left the Academy to start on his journey. At that time, he did not take much notice of it. It was only half way through his journey that he recalled it and took out to touch it. This was to satisfy his curiosity towards the purpose of this plate, as well as to prevent himself from missing Chang'an too much.</p><br/><p>Viewing down from the firmament in north-west direction, there was a faint black line, though it was not obvious. However, he had been there and he knew how majestic those mountain ranges were. Suddenly, he felt speechless as he realized how boundless the firmament and the wilderness were.</p><br/><p>That faint black line was the majestic-looking Min Mountain ranges that separated the northern region of the mainland into two. Both Sangsang and him had spent their young days in Min Mountain trying to survive through scraps. It was only 10 years ago that they left there from the west cliff and came across Zhuo Er, whose homeland had been destroyed. Though these happened long time ago, the memories were still vivid in his mind.</p><br/><p>Since he had been there in the past, he remembered that up in the further north, between the Min Mountain ranges, there was an opening formed by the Mother Nature. With the Min Mountain ranges stretching miles across the mainland that split the northern part of the wilderness into two, it had also separated Tang and Yan Kingdom. If the troops did not wish to go round the northern part of the wilderness, they would need to pass through that opening.</p><br/><p>Such important military ground was naturally in the hands of the Tang Empire. The elite troops from the Tang North Road was sent to camp at the ground, not for the purpose of protecting it nor to threaten either the Left-Tent palace from the eastern part of the grassland or Yan Kingdom. What truly worried the Tang Empire was the strongest Golden palace in the wilderness, a place that Princess Lee Yu was married to.</p><br/><p>The military camp in City of Wei which Ning Que had lived in for many years was one of the seven city military camps. The seven city military camps belonged to the most unconspicuous frontier fortress of the elite troops in North Road. Looking at it in the north-west direction now, Ning Que felt as though he could see the City of Wei behind at Min Mountain, a place both Sangsang and him truly called home. This somewhat made him recall the past memories and as he started to miss the warmth provided by that city.</p><br/><p>He wondered how his old friends were doing at the City of Wei, whether General Ma was feeling better and whether had they receive the cash notes which he have instructed the horse carriage to send over in spring? If they knew that he have managed to lead a better life in the city of Chang'an, how much wine would they drink to rejoice for him? Also, when should Sangsang and him return to visit them?</p><br/><p>\"I've been on standby here for more than a month, yet all we did was to sent cavalries out to investigate the situation. When can we do some real battles? It will be winter soon and if we choose to enter the wilderness then, the soldiers are going to suffer even more.\"</p><br/><p>A young officer wearing a polished armor sat beside Ning Que. He stared at the broad wilderness in front of him and the injured soldiers on the horse carriage, as he frowned and grumbled angrily, \"I seriously don't understand what the people at the General's Mansion is thinking. Heard that General Xia Hou is still at his house in Tuyang City and has not even entered Yan Kingdom. This is ridiculous.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que took a glance at him and smiled before saying, \"Why would they need to use a butcher's knife to slaughter a chicken? To defeat Left-Tent palace's cavalries, why would General Xia Hou do it by himself? By sending half of the West Road troop, the imperial court is already leaving some respect for the Left-Tent. The reason why General Xia Hou stays in Tuyang City instead of coming to the frontier fortress himself is because he knew that there will not be any battle. Since there's no need to infiltrate the wilderness, what's the point of him coming?\"</p><br/><p>This young officer was Chang Zhengming, a student of the Academy. With his outstanding results in riding and archery skills, he was trained by the Military Ministry and had served under Yulin Royal Guards. When he was asked to be in the front line for the relief troops and was sent to the most dangerous North troops, he had no opinions. In fact, he was so excited about the arrangement as he yearned to lead the cavalries to infiltrate the wilderness, just like how his ancestors had did it to help the Empire and made a name for themselves. He had never thought that he would be on standby for more than a month, and there was no intention of attacking at all.</p><br/><p>He was already very disappointed and upset by the situation. Upon hearing what Ning Que had said, he rebutted, \"There were so much rackets in the Central Plains. The Divine Hall sent out the edict and the Empire sent out relief troops. Just the expenses used to feed those soldiers' and horses' mouths could have been a large sum. How can there be no battles after spending so much money and effort to gather everyone here?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and replied, \"Look. Do you think there'll be a battle?\"</p><br/><p>Chang Zhengming pointed at the horse carriage below the meadow and commented, \"Small battles are going on continuously. I don't think they are not fighting. There is already a tension between the two parties, so I believe they are just unsure when to spark off a large-scale battle.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \"The small battles will continue because they are still negotiating with the Left-Tent palace. You gonna understand what's the final goal of gathering over 200 thousand soldiers at the southern side of the wilderness. Once you get it, you'll know why a large-scale battle is impossible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why is that so?\" Chang Zhengming frowned as he questioned.</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \"Any idea why Left-Tent palace wanna keep attacking the border?\"</p><br/><p>Without thinking much, Chang Zhengming answered, \"Because the barbarians are cruel and greedy.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que replied sacrastically, \"Nonsense...everyone is greedy in this world.\"</p><br/><p>Chang Zhengming hesitated and said, \"Then is it because the Desolute Men are moving south?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the young officer and explained, \"The Left-Tent palace's only enemy is the Desolate Man Tribe behind them. The purpose of the West-Hill Divine Palace's edict is also to warn the Desolate Men that moving south may result in the revival of the Devil's Doctrine. As for Tang Empire...the Desolate Man was defeated by us that time, so obviously, Tang got to be wary of their revenge should they revive again. So all in all, the one that everyone is worry of are those Desolate Man warriors far away.</p><br/><p>The Desolate Man had left the wilderness thousands of years ago. To those people in the Central Plains, they are legends that were long forgotten. On the way to the frontier fortress, the Academy summarized and recalled what had happened for them, thus letting them understand the history between the two. For the commoners in the Central Plains as well as them, this tribe had remained as a mystery.</p><br/><p>\"But I've heard that the Desolate Man tribe is only left with 100 thousand people. Even if all of them decided to fight for their tribe, it'll not cause a threat to the Central Plains. On the other hand, should the Left-Tent palace sent all their cavalries, they will be like locust swarm attacking south...\"</p><br/><p>\"In you eyes, the strong Left-Tent palace, whose grassland was being snatched over forcefully by the Desolate Man, was being chased to the south and was forced to go over the line which we Tangs had drawn. This was something that can be accomplished with only a 100 thousand of those Desolate Men, who are the born-warriors. Now, why aren't you afraid of them since we have given them sufficient time in the North to build up their foundation and grow stronger? Why both West-Hill Divine Palace and imperial court are not nervous as well?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and answered, \" Do not forget, with adequate food and drinks, it's easy to give birth and build families.\"</p><br/><p>Chang Zhengming kept silent for a long while before questioning again, \"Then what should we do?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared at the distant black smoke in the wilderness and thought for a while before he said, \"Looking at the situation right now, I suppose West-Hill Divine Palace and imperial court have the same thinking, which is to force the Left-Tent palace Chanyu to have a battle with the Desolate Man Tribe. We are in charge of providing him with weapons and food, they are in charge of fighting the war.\"</p><br/><p>Chang Zhengming was confused and asked, \"They lost to the Desolate Man and was forced to move south. Why would the Left-Tent palace be so dumb to return to battle against them again?\"</p><br/><p>\"And that's why we are here...The Divine Hall and imperial court are clear of their decision when they gave Chanyu the right to choose. Either he joins them in the battle, or he fight with the Desolate Men with their support. For the former, he would definitely die, but for the latter, he might still have a chance to survive. After all, there's a difference between 'definitely' and 'might'.\"</p><br/><p>Chang Zhengming was stunned, for he never thought that things would be so complicated. He sighed as he commented, \"This is a tough decision indeed.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que patted on his shoulder and added, \"Chanyu thought so too.\"</p><br/><p>Just then, numerous cavalries from the West Road troops appeared behind the meadow. The captain who was leading the troops looked at Ning Que with a worry face. It seemed like he wish to approach him yet he dare not.</p><br/><p>Chang Zhengming gazed at the nervous-looking cavalries below the meadow and recognized them as the General's Mansion's direct cavalries at once. He was slightly taken aback and subconsciously took a glance at Ning Que, who was beside him.</p><br/><p>The Tang captain below the meadow looked up at Ning Que and said with distress, \"Mr.Thirteen, we're too close to the battle ground and it's really dangerous. Shall we return to the military camp?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mr.Thirteen?\" Chang Zhengming stared at Ning Que and asked questioningly.</p><br/><p>Ning Que glanced at the nervous -looking cavalries below the meadow as he sighed reluctantly, patted off the dust from his buttock and stood up. He then explained to Chang Zhengming, \"They don't know my real identity, only know that I am ranked 13.\"</p><br/><p>Chang Zhengming followed and stood up.</p><br/><p>\"I'm the lead for the Academy. Though I'm not responsible for your life and death, but I would still need to be concerned about what you guys are up to.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared at him and said, \"Today, I'm just here to understand more about your situation. But since I'm being rushed by someone, I gonna take my leave first. I'll head over to the Blue Water Battalion tomorrow. Situ Yilan and Wang Ying are there.\"</p><br/><p>\"Take care then.\" Chang Zhengming added with a serious note.</p><br/><p>\"I'm just an ambassador going round to do checking and going round to eat, drink and spread my name. What's there to take care of?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que self-mocked before he waved his hand to gesture that there was no need to send him off. He then patted the dust from his buttock and went down the meadow.</p><br/><p>When he reached the bottom of the meadow, he looked at the captain who had been with him for the whole month, and the nervous-looking soldiers who were looking around, afraid that the grassland cavalry could attack them any moment. He said reluctantly,</p><br/><p>\"We're still within our Tang Military camp, why are u guys so nervous? Are all of you going to follow me everyday?\"</p><br/><p>The captain replied with a stern tone, \"This is an order from the top. We must ensure your safety.\"</p><br/><p>Upon recalling the freedom yet boring life at the frontier fortress for the past one month, Ning Que could not help but shook his head and remarked, \"I am just an average practial student, yet I am surrounded by over ten elite cavalries everyday. How can I accept this? I am not General Xia Hou, I should not have such luxury.\"</p><br/><p>The captain remained polite and respectful as he explained, \"Mr.Thirteen, though we do not know your real identity, but the order from the General's Mansion is clear. Your safety is much more important than the General's safety.\"</p><br/><p>This was indeed a truthful answer.</p><br/><p>Not many soldiers from the West Road knew about Ning Que's true identity. The reason why the General's Mansion was so concerned over his safety was also not because General Xia Hou knew about his identity as a secret guard and understood that he was on the order of the Emperor to spy on them, so he purposely distant him from his army. It was only for one simple reason.</p><br/><p>There were over ten students from the Academy that were sent to the front line for practice. It was the Tang rule that these students must undergo real battles and fight in order to be trained up to standard. Thus, from the officials in the palace, to the generals in the frontier fortress, all of them would only treat these youngsters as average soldiers. However, Ning Que was not an average Academy student, he was a student from the Second floor of the Academy.</p><br/><p>For all these years, no one from the Second floor of the Academy joined the troops for practice, except for Ning Que. As the core disciple of the Headmaster of Academy, if he were to get into trouble in the front line, or even if he were to just suffer from a small cut, everyone would be in deep trouble.</p><br/><p>General Xia Hou might be spared from his Majesty, but wouldn't have the courage to face with the Headmaster of Academy's disappointment in him.</p><br/><p>As such, from Chang'an to the frontier fortress at the wildness near the north of Yan Kingdom, Ning Que was not as free as he used to be in the field riding on the horse, instead, he was escorted by the West Road troops like an important person.</p><br/><p>The Military camp was carefully taking care of his needs and ensuring his safety, and whether it's wine or meat, they would do their best to satisfy all his wants...except that they would never allow him to be near any danger. Hence, other than going around the frontier fortress to every military camp and showering his concerns to the Academy students like Chang Zhengming, he had nothing to do.</p><br/><p>Looking at the cavalries that treated him in an attitude of respect, Ning Que couldn't help but sighed again and put his finger in his mouth to make a whistle. In the next moment, a big black horse came galloping from behind the meadow. Though there was a heap of luggage on its back, it was still able to gallop at a fast speed and its mouth was busily chewing. Though no one was sure what it was chewing that made it so happy since the grasses here on the meadow were all covered with frost.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

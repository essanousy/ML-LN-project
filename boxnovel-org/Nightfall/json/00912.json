Ning Que was shocked and admired him at the same time. The the Sage of Calligraphy was indeed at the peak of the human world.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, Sang Sang didn\u2019t favor him. She liked the means that the the Sage of Calligraphy used to collect clouds, but she thought the clouds were dirty.</p><br/><p>Looking at Sangsang\u2019s tall figure, the Sage of Calligraphy was extremely shocked and turned especially pale. Then he wept bitterly, diluting the blood on his robe.</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy was a visiting minister of the Divine Hall of West Hill and follower of Haotian. After knowing that Haotian came to the world, he was desperate to meet her, and he couldn\u2019t believe that Haotian suddenly appeared before him.</p><br/><p>How did Ning Que escape from the Peach Mountain and ignore the Splash-Ink? The Sage of Calligraphy knew the answer instantly and even had a better understanding of some other things.</p><br/><p>Standing on the opposite side of Haotian, he was doomed to lose. His failure was Heaven\u2019s Rules. Thinking of this, his mind shook and his the Ocean of Qi and Mountain of Snow were not stable. Then he began spitting blood again.</p><br/><p>Standing before him, Sangsang ignored the change of his mind and just looked at the sky full of ink clouds quietly with her hands behind her back. As her eyes turned downcast, the crack in the clouds that Ning Que had chopped with his sword previously was expanded instantly and spread around the heaven and the earth. The expanded crack disappeared without a trace in a moment, revealing the blue sky.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>With the ink clouds scattered and the sunlight revealed again, the Palace of the Great River Kingdom was restored to clear and bright. People whose sights had been blocked saw the picture of the Sage of Calligraphy sitting in a pool of blood now, crying out in alarm.</p><br/><p>Sangsang walked to the main hall, and the tall and thick door opened by itself even though there was no wind. The big black horse walked from the middle of the square, and Ning Que put the iron sword to the sheath and reattached it to the side of the saddle. Both of them followed Sangsang to the hall.</p><br/><p>More than a hundred guards in the main hall were undoubtedly the most heroic men in the Great River Kingdom. However, no one dared to stop Sangsang from entering the hall.</p><br/><p>The guards did not know who the woman in light cyan was but they remembered the unbelievable scene that happened at the main entrance of the Imperial City previously and knew that even the Sage of Calligraphy was no match for her.</p><br/><p>Sangsang walked in the quiet palace without footsteps. Countless guards and eunuchs shielded the monarch behind them and kept stepping back, which was quite a weird scene.</p><br/><p>There was a beautiful and luxurious chair on the high platform, which was a square in the deepest part of the hall. It was the throne of the Great River Kingdom. She walked on the carpet on the floor and approached the throne, sitting on it very casually.</p><br/><p>Things about the human world hardly interested her and she only walked into the palace for the matter today was related to Ning Que. She had no interest in the position of the monarch of the Great River Kingdom. At this time, the reason she sat on the throne was very simple: this was the highest and most central position in the hall. She was Haotian and supposed to sit in the position.</p><br/><p>For the people of the Great River Kingdom in the hall, it was definitely not that simple. They didn\u2019t know what the woman in light cyan was thinking and only knew that she sat on the throne that belonged to the monarch!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>What Sangsang did was rebellion and the biggest insult to the people of the Great River Kingdom, which was impossible to be forgiven. However, the people crowded in the hall turned pale, but still did nothing to stop her. They looked like in great pain.</p><br/><p>Leading the big black horse to the throne, Ning Que looked up and asked her, \u201cWhy are you sitting there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang flicked her sleeves slightly, and flowers bloomed in the throne. Then she answered calmly, \u201cBecause I like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was a little helpless. He looked toward the crowd and asked, \u201cMay I know which of you is the monarch?\u201d</p><br/><p>The monarch was the king of a country. He reached out to separate the eunuchs and guards in front of him and looked at Ning Que, \u201cMr. Thirteen, what\u2019s your intention to intrude my palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the monarch, Ning Que said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, Your Majesty. I just want to ask for a favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monarch looked at Ning Que\u2019s expression and felt like he saw a wild cat who was playing with a dying mouse. He said with a sullen smile, \u201cYour motherland has a great relationship with my Great River Kingdom for generations. You really want to ignore all that and kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \u201cYou worry too much, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monarch turned pale. Looking at the women sitting on the throne, he said bitterly, \u201cYou took my throne. You expect me to pretend like nothing happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang felt that Ning Que was extremely hypocritical. After Ning Que had made a scene at the palace and bullied the monarch, it surprised her that Ning Que was too shy to ask for what he wanted.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>She had seen all the flower trees in the palace and found what she wanted, so she didn\u2019t want to delay any more time. Staring at the monarch, she said, \u201cCancel the engagement.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monarch and people of the Great River Kingdom in the hall were not surprised to hear the answer. The only reason why Ning Que disregarded the great relationship between the Tang and the Great River Kingdom to intrude the palace was that he wanted the wedding to be canceled. However, they did not understand who the woman sitting on the throne was and why she was helping Ning Que. It appeared to them that she was the one who was really in charge.</p><br/><p>Courage didn\u2019t make much sense when facing an unimaginable strength gap, but canceling the engagement was one of the two most humiliating things for men. Ning Que was able to bear one, but it didn\u2019t mean that other men could bear the other like Ning Que did.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the man was the king of a country.</p><br/><p>The monarch said, \u201cIf I were to cancel the engagement, then how could I ever gain the trust of my people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang thought that the problem was very simple. Humans always make problems much more complicated than they should be. She was a little irritated and said to the monarch, \u201cSince the engagement was between the monarch and Mo Shanshan, you could resign.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monarch stood in amazement. The monarch is not a normal official position, how could I just resign?</p><br/><p>Sangsang looked at him and said, \u201cDie or give up the throne. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>For the monarch, there was no difference between death and abdication, and giving up the throne was not an option. He turned very pale instantly, revealing a desperate air in his eyes.</p><br/><p>If fighting wouldn\u2019t change the result, then some people might just give up and suffer in silence. However, the Tang people and the people of the Great River Kingdom were different. They thought that it was better to the bitter end.</p><br/><p>Seeing the look on the monarch\u2019s face, the guards in the hall went silent. Then they clutched their hilts, ready for the final battle.</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was a rush of sound of hooves outside the hall, followed by a flustered reputation. A sergeant with an air of fatigue rode straight to the front of the hall and fell to the ground.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThe cavalry of the Divine Hall of West Hill is going south. The vanguard has already crossed the Great River and entered the North Prefecture!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The hall suddenly went silent, and the courage and fighting heart that the monarch and the guards gathered up moments ago suddenly disappeared. It was because the cavalry of the Divine Hall of West Hill was about to arrive.</p><br/><p>The Great River Kingdom had a great relationship with Great Tang for generations, hence its relationship with the the Divine Hall of West Hill was quite distant. Additionally, the Great River Kingdom bore deep grudges against the South Jin Kingdom and Yuelun Kingdom. The reason why Great River Kingdom was able to be in smooth water all these years was that it showed great respect to the Divine Hall of West Hill and the awe-inspiring reputation of the Great Tang.</p><br/><p>The cavalry of the Divine Hall of West Hill has already crossed the Great River? Why are they coming here? What do they want?</p><br/><p>The Great River Kingdom was definitely not the able to fight against the Divine Hall of West Hill. The Divine Hall might have feared the Sage of Calligraphy before, but the latter had been defeated and severely injured, impossible to fight again. Then who could resist the cavalry?</p><br/><p>In the past, the Great River Kingdom would definitely seek help from the Great Tang, hoping that the power and influence of the Great Tang would frighten the enemy away. Looking at the young man leading a big black horse, people in the hall know that it was a dead end now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, please abdicate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy came in. His footsteps were extraordinarily heavy, and his face was paler than his disheveled hair. His expression was even more frightening and complicated.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The monarch was angry and stared at him in confusion. Even if I were to die today, I won\u2019t surrender to the enemy.</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy coughed twice in pain and dared not to look at the woman sitting on the throne. He said with a melancholy expression, \u201cIf Your Majesty doesn\u2019t want the Great River Kingdom to disappear, then it\u2019s best to listen to the distinguished guest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haotian left the Divine Kingdom and came to the human world. She was of course the distinguished guest.</p><br/><p>Looking at the Sage of Calligraphy, the monarch suddenly understood many things and lost all his strength for an instant.</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy kneeled down in front of the throne and said, \u201cPlease instruct us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cAbdicate and cancel the engagement. What more instructions do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy answered in a trembling voice, \u201cWho should succeed the throne?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang went silent for a moment and found that this was indeed a problem.</p><br/><p>She looked around the hall and only saw one acquaintance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHim.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Ning Que pointed to his own nose in shock and cried, \u201cYou want me to be the monarch of the Great River Kingdom?\u201d</p><br/><p>hte Sage of Calligraphy was in shock too. He looked up and said, \u201cBut he is from the Great Tang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cThe Great Tang or the Great River Kingdom, no difference to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy dared not to say anything more.</p><br/><p>The people in the hall were too shocked to make a sound.</p><br/><p>Sangsang stood up and walked outside of the hall.</p><br/><p>Enduring the great pain caused by the injury, the Sage of Calligraphy bent down and walked behind her.</p><br/><p>Outside the hall, Sangsang stopped and looked back at him, \u201cI had some interest in you before. I thought you must be different since you are the Sage of Calligraphy, but you have disappointed me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy dared not to argue with her and answered with a humble expression, \u201cPlease enlighten me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cLiu Bai drew his sword to fight against me once, but you dared not to attack me. He was the Sage of Sword. Why do you deserve the title of the Sage of Calligraphy? From now on, your name is Calligraphy Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy changed his name to Calligraphy Wang.</p><br/><p>Simply because Haotian had said so.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Que led the big black horse and headed outside the palace behind Sangsang. There was a big parcel on the back of the big black horse. From the faint smell the parcel gave off, it should be something like cosmetics.</p><br/><p>There were many flower trees in the palace, so their clothes smelt like fragrance of flowers all the way through the flower trees. Looking at the back of Sangsang and thinking about what happened before, Ning Que couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Sage of Calligraphy is just a honorific title and he has a real name. If you don\u2019t think he deserved the title, just say so. It\u2019s ridiculous that you made him change the name to Calligraphy Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang stopped but didn\u2019t turn around. She said in an indifferent voice, \u201cI think the more ridiculous thing is that you said you make the important decisions in your family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt a little unsettled and his body became a bit stiff. He pulled out a smile and explained, \u201cI have to protect my honor in public but you know that I can only handle the trivial matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cBut it seems to me that you have a lot of things to manage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que walked behind her and said, \u201cJust trivial matters, trivial matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang turned around and stared at him, \u201cThen what are the important matters? What are the trivial matters?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cYou are Haotian. All the things on earth are trivial in your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang thought about it and felt that it made sense yet made no sense.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

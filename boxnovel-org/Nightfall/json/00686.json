She would hear things about a ring and a bottle but she wasn\u2019t interested in them.</p><br/><p>After a while, Ning Que stopped mentioning them and she had slowly forgotten about them. However, Ning Que would still mention the word moon from time to time. She thought they were nonsense until tonight. As she stood beside the Headmaster and kept silent while hearing about all these, she realized they weren\u2019t nonsense but rather, dream talk.</p><br/><p>She raised her head as she tucked her hair, which had been blown into a mess by the wind, behind her temples. She followed the Headmaster\u2019s and Ning Que\u2019s gaze to the night sky. She thought to herself that if there was a bright thing there, it would be very pretty.</p><br/><p>The Southern sea that was under the stars was incredibly quiet and calm. The sea breeze was warm as the waves rose gently. It seemed to be shaking the ship like a baby in a cradle. It was a sea of quiet by the side of the ship.</p><br/><p>From the north of the Wilderness, they had traveled further north to the south of the world. They had seen too much and eaten too much over the ten over days. They have heard teacher talking too much and Ning Que couldn\u2019t help but feel something was amiss.</p><br/><p>His eyes suddenly turned bright and said, \u201cI feel like I have seen this somewhere\u2026 It is called what world?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster was slightly shocked as he asked, \u2018What world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \u201cI have forgotten where I have seen it and I have forgotten the name too. I only remember that that world is fake and the hero of the story was trying his best to steer the boat to the side\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of the memories from that world has become vague. He tried everything he could to recall it and to recount all the details to the Headmaster.</p><br/><p>After the Headmaster finished listening, he thought in silence for a while before taking out a short wooden rod from his sleeve and banged it heavily on Ning Que\u2019s head before chiding, \u201cFool, do you think we are acting for others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que first saw the Headmaster on the Building of Pines and Cranes in Chang\u2019an City. Back then, he was knocked unconsciousness with this rod. He was hit in the head with this rod again and he couldn\u2019t help but lose his temper.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t understand where teacher usually hid this rod but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to find out now. He pointed to the night skies above his head and said, \u201cPerhaps Haotian is watching a show from above. This could be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Headmaster said, \u201cWe are in a world that doesn\u2019t have the physical boundaries that you speak of. The internal structure of the world is definitely incredibly balanced. Just like the entropy that you speak of and the laws of thermodynamics. They seem to be ineffective here. Hence according to your logic, our world must be an independent world and doesn\u2019t communicate with anything outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que nodded.</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u2018Such deduction is based on the idea that the Haotian world is the only world. If there is another sky outside of our skies, will there still be a real world outside the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIt is possible. The Haotian world would then be an independent world that is floating in the orbit of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster shook his head and said, \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked perplexedly, \u201cWhy is it impossible?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster said, \u201cBecause that would be too boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was speechless. He thought to himself that such a righteous tone was indeed the temperament of those from the Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there is a sky above the skies and a world besides the Haotian world, or perhaps that the Haotian world is in another bigger world, why would it not be able to communicate with the outside world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Headmaster continued saying as he extended a finger and pointed at the night sky. Some starlight landed on his long fingernails before condensing slowly and forming a dim light bubble.</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on the theories that you have mentioned the past few days, I guess the person of great wisdom in your dream would think that we are living in a bubble if he knew the real situation of the Haotian world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA bubble?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr perhaps fragments of space? No, a bubble is more appropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA bubble that is floating in the outside world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe phrase \u2018floating\u2019 isn\u2019t accurate. it is within the space of the outside world but not in it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, anyway I do not understand. Please continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor some reason, this bubble isn\u2019t connected to the outside world. it is stable, self-sustainable and independent. It can even be described as perfect and can survive like this forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only want to prove to you that your earlier guess is wrong. There are no observers in the Haotian world. This is because Haotian is also a participant. If we are acting, he must be one of the actors too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf any intelligent lifeform were to observe this bubble from the outside world, there would be a link between the inside of the bubble and the outside world. Every observation will affect the state of the thing being observed. Wasn\u2019t this the logic that you have been talking about the past few days? If that is the case, our world will no longer be perfect and stable. Since something like that hasn\u2019t happened, this must mean that there are no observers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que had no idea what else to say. He had told the Headmaster whatever remaining knowledge that he could remember. How would he have expected the Headmaster to remember this much and to easily deduce so many things? Even though he still had no idea if these deductions were correct or not, they seem to be correct.</p><br/><p>The light bubble that was plated with silver on the fingertips of the Headmaster disappeared into thin air. He tapped Ning Que\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cI know what you are afraid of. You are afraid that all these is just a dream or a game. Such a situation would indeed leave one frustrated. However, you do not need to worry about such a situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cBecause of your deduction?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only that.\u201d The Headmaster said, \u201cNo matter what kind of world we are in, so long as we are real, that world will be real.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the Headmaster and complimented sincerely, \u201cTeacher, if you were to live in the world of my dreams, you would be the best philosopher, scientist, connoisseur and revolutionist.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster stoked his beard lightly and said with pride, \u201cIt turns out no matter where I live in, it isn\u2019t that bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and said, \u201cIt is not only not bad, it is strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster brows trembled lightly as he couldn\u2019t suppress his joy and said, \u201cThe rest might be hard to say but I definitely am qualified to be a connoisseur.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the early morning, the fishes in the sea were woken up by the red morning sun. After eating the oyster porridge prepared by Sangsang, Headmaster brought Ning Que to the front of the ship to enjoy the sea breeze and return to sleep.</p><br/><p>Ning Que leaned against the soft chair and pulled the blanket. He cocked his head and took a sip of the coconut juice. He felt such a life was blissful to the maximum and if they could continue like this without going on shore, it would be better.</p><br/><p>However, they were bound to go ashore at the end of the day. As the ship continued going north, they could see the black coastline vaguely in the distance. There was even the illusion of the smell of the harbor.</p><br/><p>They would return to the mortal world when they go ashore and they could face many things. Especially when he kept thinking of the uneasiness that was hanging over him, Ning Que\u2019s emotions became a little strange.</p><br/><p>Listening to the sound of waves hitting against the front of the ship and looking at the floating clouds in the blue skies, he kept silent for a long time. Thinking back to the battle in the Wilderness and the image of the Giant Golden Dragon sucking that Qi of Heaven and Earth from the corpses of the Desolate Man, the image of Haotian in his heart became increasingly greedy.</p><br/><p>Ning Que furrowed his brows and thought, \u201cBecause it is a closed world, the energy can only flow continuously within it and would eventually tend to destruction. Haotian wouldn\u2019t understand this. Why then did he not break this world and find new sources of energy from the wider world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirstly, Haotian is the rule of this world. If this world is shattered or if it connects with the outside world, it could be directly destroyed. Secondly, I think it is afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster laid on his chair, playing with the colorful shells in his hand.</p><br/><p>Ning Que passed the coconut over and squatted on the chair while he asked in confusion, \u201cIf it is so afraid, what is it scared of?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Headmaster took over the coconut and peeled a small piece of coconut meat from the hard shell and put it into his mouth. He slowly chewed as he sighed and said, \u201cWhen one chews the coconut longer, it tastes better than peanuts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was waiting patiently for his teacher\u2019s answer and he didn\u2019t expect to hear something like this. He gave a bitter laugh and said, \u201cHowever, no one has said this before and no one has taken coconut flesh as peanuts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Headmaster put down the coconut and said, \u201cYou asked what Haotian was afraid of? It is afraid of the unknown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnknown?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans are afraid of the unknown too. Just like how many people hadn\u2019t eaten the flesh of coconut before and throw them away like trash. Many people hadn\u2019t eaten chili before and think it is the devil. However, humans also yearn for the unknown and hence, there will be the first person to eat the crab. there would be someone like me who loves eating the flesh of coconuts and there are those who see chili as their life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will never be a lack of those who are courageous enough to try when it comes to facing the unknown. Because humans are fearful, they are curious too. Unknown and curiosity are 2 concepts that are linked. They are the most defining characteristic of humans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like what I told you that night. When one sees a mountain, one would want to know what is on the other side of the mountain. When one sees the ocean, one would want to know what is underneath it. When one sees the skies, one would want to know what is above it. Because of curiosity, humans will continuously forge ahead and become stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world is constantly spinning and the beginning is the end. This is really meaningless. Humans\u2019 curiosity towards the unknown has been decided by nature. We cannot live peacefully in an enclosed world forever. Since the world is enclosed, we will want to open it and see the outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Haotian isn\u2019t human. Even though it is living, at the end of the day, it is a boring, monotonous and uninteresting objective rule. It is afraid of change and doesn\u2019t have the courage to face the unknown. This is the biggest difference between us and Haotian. It is precisely because of this that we can never live in harmony with it forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA melon that was forcefully plucked will never be sweet. How can one marry with different outlooks? If one\u2019s world is covered at the top, how can one breathe freely? Hence, we pluck the seedlings, divorce the wife and open the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the thinking of Lotus and your Youngest Uncle. I too believe in this. In actual fact, there have been countless people who think similarly throughout history. Of course, we are clear that even if there is a sky outside of ours, that sky might just be another larger prison. At least we can see more sceneries and experience more things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese things might be very important or not important at all but I believe they are worth fighting for.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

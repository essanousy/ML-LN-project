However, no one knew whether they were proud because of being strong or they were strong because of being proud.</p><br/><p>Two years ago, they encountered in under an autumn rain and had a fight. However, due to the Buddhism Sect, they didn\u2019t fight to their heart\u2019s content before they had to leave.</p><br/><p>This time, they met again; they took one strike respectively, and no one was able to hurt the other in front of the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>The third strike was about to come.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the battle had just begun since this was just the third strike, but both the two fighters and the hundreds of thousands of people in the wilderness realized this would be the final one.</p><br/><p>Eighteen years ago in the wilderness, he was inspired by the birth of the Son of Yama and performed his best sword during his youth, cutting the small tree into 53,333 pieces.</p><br/><p>After that, he traveled all over the world to cultivate. His sword became slower and slower, turning thousands of them into one.</p><br/><p>One was enough.</p><br/><p>As the autumn wind raised, the Qi of Heaven and Earth seemed to be summoned by the wooden sword from all directions, refracted into a strange shape in the sunshine as if thousands of horses were running.</p><br/><p>Countless golden rice grains were blown in the wind to the north like a golden wave. The wooden sword proceeded through the rice waves like a fast ship.</p><br/><p>Ye Su started to move after the wooden sword, sleeves waving.</p><br/><p>The rice waves pushed the wooden sword to fly faster and faster under the influence of the Heaven and Earth\u2019s Qi like a flash of light, followed by Ye Su.</p><br/><p>No one could be that fast.</p><br/><p>Flying on a sword had always been a legend.</p><br/><p>More precisely, after the Headmaster, the legend had ended.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Ye Su didn\u2019t fly on the sword.</p><br/><p>The wooden sword was a boat.</p><br/><p>He was the one on the boat.</p><br/><p>The boat carried him.</p><br/><p>Not as one pushing the boat.</p><br/><p>After a gust of wind, Ye Su disappeared.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, he showed up in front of Jun Mo, holding his wooden sword.</p><br/><p>He bent his knees, lowered his waist, straightened his elbows, and straightened his wrists.</p><br/><p>The wooden sword stabbed toward Jun Mo\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>An incomparably Divine Light lit up on the sword.</p><br/><p>The sun over the Verdant Canyon turned dark as he swung his sword.</p><br/><p>The world and the sword had merged together.</p><br/><p>He had transformed the will of Haotian into his sword intent.</p><br/><p>This was Haotian\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>Contained in the wooden sword.</p><br/><p>Inevitable!</p><br/><p>The powerful sword was even more aggressive than Jun Mo\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>Life and death could be ignored, but Haotian\u2019s will could not.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo remembered the sentence that his teacher repeated many times:</p><br/><p>There was no omniscient nor omnipotent existence, expect Haotian.</p><br/><p>He knew that he could not dodge Ye Su\u2019s sword, so he didn\u2019t try to.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even look at the wooden sword that stabbed on his chest before he chopped down with his sword.</p><br/><p>It was a simple action.</p><br/><p>He just casually did it.</p><br/><p>If the question was hard to answer, you didn\u2019t answer it\u2014like the puzzle Ning Que gave Chen Pipi before he entered the Second floor. Jun Mo just dropped it because it was too complicated to work out.</p><br/><p>If the knot was too difficult to untie, drop it\u2014like the knot Mu You made when she bathed in the cold water. Jun Mo dropped it because it was too troublesome to untie.</p><br/><p>He asked for the answer from Youngest Brother; if he didn\u2019t tell him, he would punish him with the school rules.</p><br/><p>He told Seventh Sister to untie it; if she didn\u2019t want to, just cut it.</p><br/><p>The wooden sword in front of him was difficult to take, so he didn\u2019t try to; It was difficult to dodge, so he didn\u2019t dodge\u2014he held his iron sword as if he held the punishing ruler and scissors, just chopping down.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo had always regarded his Youngest Uncle as his idol. Even though he didn\u2019t learn the Great Spirit, he had learned the Haoran Sword which taught him to go forward bravely.</p><br/><p>Holding the iron sword and being about to destroy all the huge rocks in the Verdant Canyon, Jun Mo felt so free and contented.</p><br/><p>There was no Buddha or Haotian in front of the sword.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo was peaceful because he was confident that before the wooden sword touched him, his sword would cut Ye Su in two.</p><br/><p>This was a challenge to their courage rather than a mutually assured destruction.</p><br/><p>Courage was pride.</p><br/><p>People all knew Second Brother was the proudest and bravest man in the world. The countless cavalrymen that died in front of the Verdant Canyon could prove that.</p><br/><p>Ye Su was proud, too. Since Jun Mo acted so proudly, he became prouder.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dodge either.</p><br/><p>The seemingly blunt wooden sword instantaneously merged into Jun Mo\u2019s chest through the black armor and triggered the runes which began to shine, emitting a great aura.</p><br/><p>The iron sword didn\u2019t cut off Ye Su\u2019s neck but was blocked by the sheath on his back.</p><br/><p>In the bright light, the inconspicuous sheath was like a sail in a tempestuous ocean that kept out the wind and pushed the boat.</p><br/><p>The tip of the iron sword just hit on the sheath and was stuck since it was wide and straight.</p><br/><p>It looked true but seemed untrue.</p><br/><p>The iron sword was not an iron sword; the wooden sword was not a wooden sword; the sheath was not a sheath. All of them had been injected with the Qi of Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>This was a competition between the fighters\u2019 Psyche Powers rather than their swords, in other words, this was a battle between two worlds.</p><br/><p>Vast amounts of Qi of Heaven and Earth wildly gathered. It was swallowed up by invisible whirlpools in an instant to enter their worlds and then broke out through the sword and the sheath.</p><br/><p>The Qi of Heaven and Earth in front of the Verdant Canyon had been contracted, twisting the refractive daylight so that the Qi of Heaven and Earth began to produce friction, lighting flame!</p><br/><p>If Ye Su\u2019s first sword lit a small sun in front of the Verdant Canyon, this time, they created a real sun, radiating light and heat.</p><br/><p>What a beautiful picture!</p><br/><p>Looking at this, everyone would be excited.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was so bright that few people were able to see it clearly, just as the time when the Headmaster beheaded the Divine General in the wilderness.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai could see it.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu could as well.</p><br/><p>She was quietly sitting in the carriage, lowering her head and seeming not to care about what was happening at the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>However, at this time, she could not help raising her head.</p><br/><p>In the light, Jun Mo pressed his sword down.</p><br/><p>With a hiss, the sheath on Ye Su\u2019s back was torn.</p><br/><p>Ye Su didn\u2019t change his expression while he pushed his sword harder.</p><br/><p>The wooden sword became shorter and shorter\u2014a short part of the sword had been stabbed into Jun Mo\u2019s chest while most of it was smashed into powder, violently burning like candles.</p><br/><p>Now the problem was if the iron sword could break the sail before the wooden sword could break the armor?</p><br/><p>The candle would burn up eventually.</p><br/><p>The burning wooden sword was getting shorter and it still didn\u2019t break Jun Mo\u2019s armor.</p><br/><p>In the blazing light, Ye Su\u2019s face looked transparent without any expression.</p><br/><p>He continued pushing forward.</p><br/><p>Until there was only a hilt left.</p><br/><p>With a loud whistling, Ye Su clapped the hilt and pushed it into Jun Mo\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Previously, his wooden sword had neither hilt nor sheath.</p><br/><p>Now it did.</p><br/><p>It was because, over these years, he had been regressing.</p><br/><p>He was making progress by going backward.</p><br/><p>From ten thousands of swords to one sword, from seeing through to not seeing through, from outside to inside.</p><br/><p>In this battle, he had been moving forward and had not stepped back.</p><br/><p>His sheath was the bond to understand the world.</p><br/><p>His hilt represented all his spirit in the Sword Taoism.</p><br/><p>He caught the iron sword with his sheath and inserted all his sword intent into Jun Mo\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo\u2019s cultivation was as simple as his iron sword.</p><br/><p>He moved forward and never stepped back.</p><br/><p>He had been advancing toward the peaks one by one.</p><br/><p>When Ye Su hit the hilt into his chest, he suddenly released his hilt.</p><br/><p>The iron sword was too wide and straight, which could be contained by neither the sheath nor the world.</p><br/><p>At least for a short time, he could not break Ye Su\u2019s sheath.</p><br/><p>Therefore he dropped it as if he dropped the puzzle.</p><br/><p>He released his hilt and made a compromise for the first time in his life.</p><br/><p>Instead, his left foot took a step forward in the light.</p><br/><p>His right hand clenched into a fist, holding the infinite light in the autumn wind, and smashed into Ye Su.</p><br/><p>The indomitable Jun Mo made his first compromise.</p><br/><p>Ye Su, who used to retreat in order to advance, stepped forward without hesitation.</p><br/><p>The two geniuses of cultivation chose each other\u2019s most adept ways to fight at the same time in the battle. No one could figure out the winner.</p><br/><p>At the time the hilt totally sank into the black armor.</p><br/><p>There was a cracking sound resounding in the wilderness.</p><br/><p>The sky seemed to be torn apart.</p><br/><p>Nothing seemed to happen in Jun Mo\u2019s armor and there were only some bits of wood remaining.</p><br/><p>However, behind him was a terrible sword intent.</p><br/><p>It pointed at the Verdant Canyon, leaving a deep hole in the cliff.</p><br/><p>The remaining sword intent was that powerful.</p><br/><p>What would happen to Jun Mo who took most of the sword intent?</p><br/><p>Almost at the same time.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo\u2019s fist punched Ye Su.</p><br/><p>He held the infinite light in his fist, which was full of the Qi of Heaven and Earth in the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>The Qi of Heaven and Earth was full of unimaginable sword intent:</p><br/><p>The iron sword\u2019s intent and Ye Su\u2019s intent.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo replaced the iron sword with countless ones.</p><br/><p>As he hit Ye Su, the countless swords also fell on him.</p><br/><p>As the spring breeze blew the willows and leaves fell into the water.</p><br/><p>The sun rose and the lake glowed.</p><br/><p>The wild wind blew over the winter lake.</p><br/><p>In front of the Verdant Canyon, it was deadly silent.</p><br/><p>People all nervously watched the two people standing there.</p><br/><p>A long time had passed.</p><br/><p>Ye Su suddenly coughed up and began to bleed.</p><br/><p>Looking at Jun Mo, he sighed and said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t wear that armor, I could win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no if.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo didn\u2019t show any joy on his face and said, \u201cIf you need an if, I will win whether I have no armor or you have no sheath; I will win if neither of us has a sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won, if it was 18 years ago; I will win if it is 18 years later.\u201d</p><br/><p>At last, he added, \u201cAnyway, I will win.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

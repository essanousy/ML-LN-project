It looked at Ning Que innocently with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at it dazedly, countless possibilities whirring in his mind.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a satisfied expression flashed through the Little White Gog's eyes. It opened its mouth widely and revealed shart short teeth. It snapped at Ning Que's wrist viciously, as if it wanted to bite off his hand.</p><br/><p>The innocent and adorable little white dog had transformed into a scary fierce beast within a split second.</p><br/><p>It snapped at Ning Que's wrist like an arrow, opening and closing its jaws forcefully at a speed that that surpassed what the human eye could see. It was as fast as lightning, and if it had really caught Ning Que's wrist, flesh and bones would have broken.</p><br/><p>A common person would have been unable to avoid this sudden attack.</p><br/><p>However, Ning Que had spent his lifetime with danger and beasts. He was very sensitive to movements of beasts like these. He was very alert to the dangers in the forests, much less of this dog.</p><br/><p>When his fingertip made contact with the dog's neck and felt a slight power, he immediately reacted. He shoved his right hand into the Little White Dog's mouth and reached in without mercy as if he wanted to stick his entire arm into the dog's belly. Then, he searched for a soft piece of flesh within the sticky patch and pinched down forcefully.</p><br/><p>The Little White Dog howled muffledly, for his mouth to his throat was filled to the brim. There was no space for anything to move within it, much less for him to bite. The intense pain in the depths of his throat made him tremble violently as droll dripped down the sides of its mouth. It looked especially pathetic.</p><br/><p>Ning Que raised his left hand in the air and shook his head as he looked at the Little White Dog who kept drooling and whose eyes were red from its effort. He had hunted countless beasts in the Min Mountain and had encountered countless dangers. However, this was only the second time his prey had its mouth so close to him and he was forced to use such a risky move. The only other time was when he was surrounded by that pack of wolves as a child.</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan and Ye Hongyu stopped gazing at the Snow-capped Peak and looked at the scene before them in surprise.</p><br/><p>Ning Que raised his arm high with the Little White Dog dangling from it. Half of his arm was stuffed within the Little White Dog's mouth ad it looked as if he was holding up a white fire torch, or a metal rod with a beast skewered on it, ready for roasting. The beast was still alive and drooling, making the image rather ludicrous and funny.</p><br/><p>\"Where did the dog come from?\" Mo Shanshan asked with furrowed brows.</p><br/><p>\"I don't know either.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que raised his head to look at the Little White Dog on his arm, not flinching at the hot dampness and stickiness. He looked at the pitiful expression in its eyes and could not help but waver slightly. He felt that this little thing seemed to be able to communicate with humans like the Big Black Horse and the goose Second Brother raised.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at the snow white pup and felt slightly apprehensive, but did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the Little White Dog's fur that was as white as snow. He thought of something and sighed, \"I used to want to raise a samoyed, but never had the chance to. Who thought that I would meet you?\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan did not know what a samoyed was, but she looked at the adorable dog that was kicking its hind legs in pain and drooling and pitied it for Ning Que's cruel act. She said, \"Then you can raise this one.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu sneered and did a Taoist spell behind her back and looked at the mountain path indifferently.</p><br/><p>Ning Que rubbed the Little White Dog's head with his left hand and discovered that it had a familiar and intimate aura. He could not help wrinkling his brows as he thought of Youngest Uncle's mantle in the Front Gate of the Devil's Doctrine. The Devil's Doctrine had felt familiar because of that, but what about the dog? Could it be that it was Youngest Uncle's pet?</p><br/><p>It could taste the scent of human flesh in its stomach, but it could not even bite down or even lick the human arm in its mouth. The Little White Dog felt miserable, and the pinching of that piece of flesh deep within its throat made it even more fearful and tamed.</p><br/><p>The Little White Dog looked at Ning Que with watery eyes. It looked as if it was begging for mercy and had submitted to him. This human's aura had made it so that he did not mind the submission. The tears in his eyes were due to the immense pain.</p><br/><p>\"Don't look at me like that, for it would make me think twice.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the Little White Dog and sighed, \"Even though I really want a samoyed, and you have shown that you are willing to be taken in, but I can only say that this fated meeting that Haotian has provided is too cruel. I am just too hungry now, and you just look like a pot of fragrant dog meat.\"</p><br/><p>He pulled his podao out of its scabbard with his left hand and was prepared to cut the dog. He murmured, trying to comfort the dog. \"Eating is something more important than Haotian. Master Lotus had to eat human flesh every day to survive. So what if we eat some dog meat?\"</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought that young women were easily taken in by adorable looking creatures like this, and that he had forgotten to seek the opinion of the two girls. He lowered his podao in one hand and held the dog with the other, saying, \"We need fresh meat.\"</p><br/><p>Mo Shanshan could not bear to look. She turned around.</p><br/><p>Excitement flashed through the eyes of Ye Hongyu and she asked, \"Did you do this often?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que brandished his knife proudly and said, \"I don't just eat dogs, I'm already sick of eating the wolves of Min Mountain.\"</p><br/><p>It was only then, when the Little White Dog realized that this fellow was a bloodthirsty pervert who ate wolf meat. He was deathly afraid and had lost all hope, his soft little body stiffened as if it was a block of wood.</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not care if the Little White Dog was as soft as a cat or as stiff as a rock. He had eaten all kinds of food in this life and did not believe in the retarded statement that a prey would secrete poison to make its meat unpalatable if it were frightened before its death. He raised his knife and placed it on the dog, trying to decide where to start skinning it. After all, Sangsang had never liked that he killed young beasts after he had killed the old hunter. He needed to familiarise himself with its physiological structure.</p><br/><p>A furious roar sounded from the rope hidden behind the fog. The clear angry voice was compresed and sounded sharp due to the distance and the rapid approach of the voice.</p><br/><p>\"Who! Dares! To! Touch! My!...\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The clear angry voice had started off in the depths of the valleys afar. However, the person had already arrived in the fog above in the middle of the sentence and could be seen by the three on the ground before the end of the sentence.</p><br/><p>The fog was disturbed and broken. Then, a figure fell from the above like a rock. The figure jumped from the rope above and towards where Ning Que was standing.</p><br/><p>Ning Que held the Little White Dog and turned back to look at the fog. He could see the shadow of the person who was faster than a mortal. He was shocked, and wondered if a fairy had really fallen from the sky.</p><br/><p>As the worn-out leather boots grew bigger in their field of vision, the terrifying sound of wind got closer to his face as well. He finally understood that it wasn't a fairy who had fallen from the sky, but someone who wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>There was a slap of a sword!</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu had kept alert for the appearance of the other party. She had been gathering her Psyche Power for a long time. She released her Taoist spell just as that figure was about to smash into Ning Que. An invisible sword style flew at the figure silently.</p><br/><p>The person who had jumped from the fog hummed and made a sign of the cross with two fists before his body and sealed Ye Hongyu's long-planned sword with his body. He flipped more than a dozen times before landing on the ground heavily. Smoke and sad flew around the valley accompanied by a buzzing sound.</p><br/><p>The dust gradually settled, revealing the person.</p><br/><p>It was a little girl dressed in fur. She had on a fur cap and a beast's tail around her neck. From the looks of her exposed body and eyes, she was still very young. There were two long black braids gently swinging behind her.</p><br/><p>She knelt on the ground on a single knee, and under her knee was a deep hole. However, there was no sign of pain on her face. Both her kneecap and her slender body were as stable as a mountain and did not look like they have been injured.</p><br/><p>The Little White Dog that was clutched in Ning Que's hand started to struggle violently the moment he saw the little girl. Ning Que could not be bothered with it and threw it on the ground viciously for a couple of times. One could almost see the whites of the little white dog's eyes.</p><br/><p>He placed all his focus on the girl who knelt on the ground with a single knee. He could hardly believe what he just saw and could not understand it no matter how he thought about it. There was someone in the world who had jumped from such great heights and did not suffer any damage even after she used both arms defending herself against Ye Hongyu's sword!</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The girl got up after a moment. Her thick long braids swayed with her movements. She looked at Ye Hongyu with a surprised expression in her clear eyes that were not covered by her fur cap.</p><br/><p>\"What happened to you in the Front Gate for your state to fall so drastically... You were already in the Knowing Destiny State when you were on the snow cliff, why are you only in the Seethrough State now?\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu paled, and a self-mocking face appeared on her face. She did not answer the question.</p><br/><p>Ning Que glanced at her. He had many questions about the battle with Master Lotus in the Devil's Palace and had guessed at the possibilities. It was until he had received confirmation from the girl that he became shocked and understood that Ye Hongyu had paid a heavy and terrible price.</p><br/><p>Positive emotions such as shock and gratitude had never stayed on his mind for long. He could see that the girl who descended from above bore a grudge against the Tao Addict. Ning Que would of course not stand there and be the first to be attacked. He walked behind Ye Hongyu silently in a casual manner. One could not figure out what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at the girl indifferently and said to the two beside her, \"This witch from the Devil's Doctrine is called Tang Xiaotang. Don't think that she's an easy opponent just because of her age. If the Devil's Doctrine had not been destroyed then, she would have been the saintess of our generation. She does not dare to fight me, and is very sly.\"</p><br/><p>Tang Xiaotang heard her mentioning about the battle in the Tianqi Mountains and was filled with rage. She retorted angrily in a loud voice, \"I would fight you if you didn't use those despicable means.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu laughed mockingly, unwilling to discuss the issue any longer. However, this made Tang Xiaotang even angrier and she raged at the unfairness. Her face that was not covered by the beast's tail grew reddish.</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not think that she was very witchy other than for her demon abilities when he heard that she was a witch from the Devil's Doctrine. He looked at her red face, clear, innocent eyes and black long braids. And he suddenly felt that he had heard the description of the such a girl somewhere, but could not remember where he had heard it.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>--</p><br/>\n</div>"}

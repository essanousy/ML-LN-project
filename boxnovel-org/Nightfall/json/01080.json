He looked like a young monk. He stood on the mountain path, facing the peak in the light of the Buddha, as if he was actually in front of the Buddha.</p><br/><p>He was silent and did not raise his iron sword to fight again. He was not afraid of any enemy, even the Buddha.</p><br/><p>The chessboard has been controlled by Haotian for many years. Even when the Buddha resurrected and returned to the world through the mountains, it would be far weaker than the Buddha\u2019s peak. At least in the past, he would have the opportunity to interrupt that process.</p><br/><p>Maybe the Buddha was really waiting for Taoism and the Academy to hurt each other before coming back. But he did not care. He did not care anymore, so he did not do anything. His hands clasped behind his back, and the iron sword behind him. He was very tired.</p><br/><p>His eyebrows were straight, like swords that can fight, like a ruler which can measure. He did not want to fight because he was still lonely throughout the world. On the peak, everyone kneeled. Those who had fought with him for many years kneeled at the moment when the Buddha appeared. He stood alone, truly lonely.</p><br/><p>He also did not want to measure, because it was really difficult to measure the human heart clearly.</p><br/><p>There was a shallow frost between his eyebrows. It was chilly, and it came from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>Hearing the Buddha sing, he stood still with his head bowed.</p><br/><p>All the slaves bowed their heads, kowtowed in fear, dared not to look directly at the Buddha\u2019s light, and dared not look at the true face of the Buddha. Naturally, they could not see his somewhat desolate figure.</p><br/><p>They were like group of ants, bathing in the Buddha\u2019s light, afraid to move a single muscle.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>In tens million years, there would always be some unique ants in the colony which, for some mysterious reason, decide to temporarily look away from the rotten leaves on the ground to the blue sky. Then their world was changed. Do they fear because they can see?</p><br/><p>No. One can only be free from fear if they can see.</p><br/><p>A young slave\u2019s trembling hands were supporting his body and could hardly restrain his intense curiosity and concern. He raised his head in fear and uneasiness and looked ahead of the mountain path.</p><br/><p>He saw the light of the Buddha, the lonely Jun Mo in the light, and the Buddha\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Ah, so the Buddha looks like that. It turned out that Buddha looks like that.</p><br/><p>Looking at Jun Mo in Light of Buddha, he suddenly felt ashamed and humiliated. A courage from somewhere he couldn\u2019t tell entered his body. He touched the handle of the sword with trembling hands and grasped it again, then stood up shaking. He stood up.</p><br/><p>He looked around at his companions, and wanted to say something, he wanted to call them to stand up bravely as he did. But he found that no one was looking at him, in the majestic and solemn voice of the Buddha, his voice was too small.</p><br/><p>He felt a little lonely, and so he understood Jun Mo\u2019s loneliness and pride. He wanted to say something to Jun Mo, but he did not know what to say. He looked at the Light of Buddha, the Buddha, and the disciples of the Buddha. He wanted to argue with them, but he found that he could not understand the Buddhist sutras they were singing.</p><br/><p>His frustration grew, scratching his head, feeling a little anxious. The more anxious he was, the more annoyed he was by the Buddha\u2019s singing till he was frustrated. His chest kept thumping and his breathing became rapid. Eventually, all the emotions came together and became two words, coming out from his lips. He looked at the Buddha in the light and shouted, \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>In this instant, the Buddhist sutras seemed to have stopped for a moment. Many people heard these two words.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo lowered his head, the tiredness between his eyebrows and eyes has somehow faded, and the corners of his lips was slightly pulled up.</p><br/><p>Qi Nian remembered his conversation with Ye Su in the wilderness many years ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the first lecture, I had seen countless flying ants soaking in the sun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlying ants will eventually fall, they will never touch the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnts can fly and fall, but they are better at climbing, building a foundation for their companions. They are not afraid of sacrificing themselves, and stacking up themselves one by one. So long as there are enough ants, they will surely be able to pile up into a heap of ants that can touch the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Nian was frightened, and his whole body was cold.</p><br/><p>Ye Su finally began to believe in ants and began to take them to the sky. He had forgotten what he had said and believed in the past. He looked at the slave standing in the Light of Buddha and was suddenly despaired.</p><br/><p>This was only the first ant, and there will be more ants standing up. Yes, the slaves kneeling in the Buddha\u2019s light of looked at each other. Although their eyes were lost, more people stood up, some shouted \u201cShut up,\u201d but more of them were silent. But they stood up. More and more slaves rose slowly in the Light of Buddha, like the black tide. The louder and louder cries echoed between Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>Shut up!</p><br/><p>Shut up!</p><br/><p>Jun Mo lowered his head and listened. The corner of his lips climbed higher and higher, and finally turned into a smile.</p><br/><p>It was a smile at first, then it turned into a big smile, and finally it was a laugh. He laughed in a rapturous joy!</p><br/><p>Hahahaha!</p><br/><p>At last, they stood up, the people who did not want to be slaves.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you hear that?\u201d He looked at the Qi Nian and his smile faded away. He shouted, \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice sounds like a bell, floating between the peaks, cleansing the heart and spleen, awakening the mind with a shock! Wan Feng suddenly fell silent!</p><br/><p>Qi Nian and countless monks spat blood and fell to the ground!</p><br/><p>The sound of the Buddhist sutras ended abruptly.</p><br/><p>The Buddha, who transformed from a mountain, still looked at him quietly.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo looked at him and shouted, \u201cWhat if you\u2019re really the Buddha? I practice Buddhism, so I am a Buddha, all living beings can become Buddha if they want to. Why bother with this Buddha?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the peaks, in the sky and on the earth, there was no hegemony. Only millions of the eldery, the weak, women, children, scarred slaves, and humiliated women.. all eyes were on him. All the forces followed him. They followed him, and gave him their trust.</p><br/><p>An unimaginable power filled his body. He raised his iron sword and slashed at the Buddha.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he was like a god, but he was not a god, his sword seemed to come from the Nether World, but he was neither the messenger of the Nether World, nor the representative of the human world. He was just a scholar in the academy, the top scholar that will unsheathe his sword to protect the weak!</p><br/><p>A clear sword shadow appeared in the sky. Clouds were cut into a big gap. Sunshine leaked through the gap, diluting the Light of Buddha between the peaks, but the world was still bright.</p><br/><p>The iron sword fell. The Buddha, was cut by the iron sword! Years ago, he hacked down the Buddha statues into numerous stones in Lanke Temple. Years later, he hacked the real Buddha into numerous stones.</p><br/><p>The thunderous roar continued to ring. Cliffs burst, mudstones fell, trees were uprooted and temples were crumbling. There were lamentations and howls of monks everywhere.</p><br/><p>Everyone left the mountain and looked at the falling cliff from dozens of miles away, feeling puzzled and shocked by the sight to the point where they did not know how to speak.</p><br/><p>There are still many monks in Qi Nian who have not gone down the mountain road.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a very harsh sound between heaven and earth. It was the sound of friction between rocks and rocks deep in the earth. It was the sound of a heavy mountain breaking up, and the broken sections sliding off each other.</p><br/><p>The giant peak broke from the root and then slowly fell down toward the east!</p><br/><p>The peak was very tall, so it started very slowly and accelerated slowly until the end. When the mountain eventually fell into the field, it did not hit anyone. However, the resulting earthquake caused a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>Smoke and dust was all over the sky, as if the world was entering the night ahead of time. After a long period of time, the smoke and dust gradually converged, so that people can clearly see the sight in front of them, and were shocked speechless once more.</p><br/><p>The giant peaks, like iron swords in Jun Mo\u2019s hands, carved an extremely exaggerated opening tens of miles wide in the ground, and the peak itself became the road paved on that opening.</p><br/><p>Far to the east of the peak, the steep cliff has collapsed into a huge gap, directly facing the distant peak. It looked like a pair of bridges, which can connect the both sides as long as one walks across the field of wildflowers.</p><br/><p>The slaves stared at the gap in dismay, and bold men began to walk toward there. In the west, people climbed up the bridge formed by the great peaks and began to walk there.</p><br/><p>After a long walk, they finally got under the cliff and came to the gap that had become a gentle slope.</p><br/><p>Millions of slaves walked up the hillside. They walked silently from dusk to early morning. They now knew what the ground was, but they still looked forward to it, some were nervous and even afraid.</p><br/><p>Silently walking, only footsteps could be heard. Tss-tss-tss-tss. Anyone who saw this scene and heard the footsteps will be moved by it. They did not know how long they have been walking. Finally, a ray of light fell on the face of the teenager at the frontmost.</p><br/><p>He opened his mouth wide, his eyes squinted slightly, and was somewhat confused by the light.</p><br/><p>Oh, Grandpa, the sun was on the ground, as tall as we were.</p><br/><p>In the light of the rising sun, the slaves who lived underground for generations finally came to the surface. Like that child, some people admired it, some were silent and some wept for their ancestors who could never come to the ground to see the sun.</p><br/><p>Oh, so, the sky was actually this close.</p><br/><p>So, the earth has no edge.</p><br/><p>So, this is how freedom tastes like.</p><br/><p>The cries of pain and the merry dancing began in the morning, then to the sunset, then until the stars appeared in the sky, oh, and the bright moon. The people\u2019s joyful and merry celebration did not end.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo went to the Bodhi tree to rest.</p><br/><p>He looked at the traces of Buddha\u2019s Nirvana under the tree and said nothing. He looked up at the moon and said, \u201cTeacher, in this case, I\u2019m better than you.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

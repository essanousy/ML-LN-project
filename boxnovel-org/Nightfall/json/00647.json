Either of them would need energy and time which she didn\u2019t have.</p><br/><p>She knelt down facing the opposite bank of the pool. As soon as she bent her legs, the iron arrow arrived. Even though she knew a lot of skills, she could not find a single one faster than the iron arrow.</p><br/><p>At this moment, she suddenly opened her eyes. In the depth of her eyes, the Divine Starlight that Ning Que had ever seen before began to burn her soul as wood.</p><br/><p>The burning starlight shot out of her eyes and turned into two extremely bright mirrors.</p><br/><p>As the dark iron arrow struck them, the two mirrors were broken and turned into countless floating sequins.</p><br/><p>The gorgeous divine crown was broken and the 13 brilliant stones were smashed into ash. The golden crown was like a chrysanthemum blossoming in autumn, becoming luxuriant petals and then falling apart.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu knelt on the shore of the wetland, dripping with blood from her face. She looked very bad, even a little pitiful.</p><br/><p>Although the injury looked terrible, the internal damage was the fatal one. In order to survive under the attack of the iron arrow, she depleted all the starlight in her eyes\u2014that was given to her by Haotian when she became the Great Divine Priest. She had paid a terrible price and her Taoist Heart was badly hurt.</p><br/><p>Ning Que should be proud to inflict heavy losses on the Great Divine Priest of Judgment from the West-Hill Divine Palace. Even Jun Mo, the Second Brother would be satisfied with it.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t. Looking at Ye Hongyu who was covered with blood, he felt very disappointed, because he knew he was unable to repeat an attack like that.</p><br/><p>Appreciative and understanding were not only used to describe lovers; they could also describe two similar opponents, such as Ye Hongyu and Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew very clearly that his adept skills and psychological attacks, such as showing weakness or closeness, would not work for Ye Hongyu.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he did not show his weakness or ask for mercy at all. He just persuaded her in an equal way that Ye Hongyu was used to, peacefully and shamelessly.</p><br/><p>Those words could be or not be the plausible psychological attacks. He needed Ye Hongyu to consider him as the same kind of person who was qualified to discuss with her and make her sympathize. When he was sincerely and ruefully looking at the sky with Sangsang in his arms, he hoped these words could relax her vigilance for a short time.</p><br/><p>Even if she relaxed, it was hard for him to grasp the moment. In Chaoyang City, Luo Kedi was awakened even though he was outside the yard, let alone Ye Hongyu.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Ye Hongyu looked up to the dark cloud, Ning Que calmly drew his bow, using the Buddhism mantra Emblematic Gesture that he received inspiration for in the Lanke Temple. He did it so smoothly that no killing intent could be felt, as if he was washing Sangsang\u2019s feet or writing with his pen.</p><br/><p>As for the bow and arrow, Sangsang had already prepared it for him.</p><br/><p>Spending so much time and energy to prepare, Ning Que shot a wonderful arrow that would kill everyone.</p><br/><p>Everyone but Ye Hongyu who was just badly injured. She didn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>He was regretful, and then he drew the bow once again.</p><br/><p>Some slightly dark blood flowed from Ye Hongyu\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>She stood up and turned to Ning Que on the other side of the pool. Although the divine starlight in her eyes had been extinguished, her eyes were still bright, looking blank without any anger.</p><br/><p>The bloody hair and robe were flying without wind.</p><br/><p>Ning Que drew his bow to aim at her, but he failed. He didn\u2019t know which shadow was the real one because her waving hair and robe created countless shadows.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu stepped on the water and leaped toward him. She moved so fast that her hair and robe drew many shadows behind her, like an immortal.</p><br/><p>The fog on the surface had dissipated and the view was clear. However, when she showed up on the water, she absorbed all the essences and dimmed the entire world.</p><br/><p>Maybe because Ning Que\u2019s bow was too terrifying, she did not choose to attack directly. Instead, she kept running on the water and tried to avoid the arrows.</p><br/><p>Looking at the arrowhead, Ning Que stabilized his arms and ceaselessly adjusted his aiming. He stared at the figure that was quickly moving on the water and didn\u2019t dare to blink.</p><br/><p>It came to a deadlock. When he was unable to lock her in, he knew he was in trouble. As the time went by, he felt his sense of perception was swayed as Ye Hongyu\u2019s shadow. His chest was suffering a lot and his face turned pale.</p><br/><p>Only by entering the Knowing Destiny State, he could truly understand the rules of the Heaven and Earth\u2019s Qi circulation.</p><br/><p>He clearly sensed that Ye Hongyu\u2019s body had been reconciled with the aura on the water, like a free fish swimming in the water which could not be located. That was why he could not shoot.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreaking down my Primordial Thirteen Arrows with nothing, Ye Hongyu, you are really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aiming at the figure on the surface, Ning Que thought.</p><br/><p>It was very clear now. He stopped wasting his time and dropped his bow without any hesitation. Then he drew his podao out.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu was waiting for this. As the ghostly shadow suddenly appeared, some ripples waved on the water. Numerous tiny water swords came out of the pool and shot to Ning Que like rain.</p><br/><p>Sangsang opened the big black umbrella.</p><br/><p>However, Ning Que was not behind it. He was waiting for Ye Hongyu to take action as well. Although his face was pale and his body was trembling, he still drew two lines in front of his body with his left hand.</p><br/><p>Then he dragged his podao and rushed to the pool, splashing water like a lightning.The thickly dotted water swords shot at Ning Que and turned into waterdrops, moistening his robe. A dozen of them occasionally stabbed into his body, leaving several bloodstains that were immediately washed away by the water.</p><br/><p>As long as they were thin enough, they would create enough penetrating force. Obviously, Ye Hongyu was ready for Ning Que\u2019s strong body that was refined by the Great Spirit. Ning Que could clearly feel the pain and hurt in his muscles, but he didn\u2019t change his expression and speeded up.</p><br/><p>There were splashes in the pool. The mixture of the white waves and black mud looked like a variegated python. Ning Que was the most dangerous part in front of its head and directly crashed into Ye Hongyu.</p><br/><p>In front of him were two sharp and unstoppable intangible talisman intents which locked Ye Hongyu in a small area. That was his most powerful weapon: the Two-Horizontal Talisman.</p>\n</div>"}

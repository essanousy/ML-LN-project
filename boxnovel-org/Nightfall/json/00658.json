These rocks had some residual snow on them and had the wet marks of melted snow. They landed between the mountains, on the cliffs, and broke into countless fragments. They then violently bounced into the air and continued falling, landing on the black heads of the cavalry troops in the valley.</p><br/><p>From the peak of the mountain to the valley, it was a long distance. The rocks\u2019 speed had become incredibly fast and were much more terrifying than the short spears thrown by the grassland cavalry.</p><br/><p>The grassland cavalry squeezed together and it was hard for them to dodge. The countless rocks landed on them and there was dust flying everywhere. Some of them had holes smashed in their bodies while some of their heads exploded like ripe melons and fruits.</p><br/><p>The exit of the valley was instantly dyed with different colors from the fresh blood and meat pulp. There were screams and cries everywhere. The procession was chaotic, there were horse hooves everywhere and smoke and dust filled the air.</p><br/><p>Many cavalries had blood on their faces, underneath the blood was despair. What happened next, however, left them truly in despair. After the falling rocks, it was a rain of axes.</p><br/><p>Zeng, Zeng, Zeng, Zeng! The sound of swishing air could be heard as at least a thousand heavy axes were thrown down from the mountain tops, towards the grassland cavalry troops that were already in chaos.</p><br/><p>The rocks that had fallen from the peak of the mountain were heavy, the axes were heavy too. To throw them for such a long distance, one would need an immense amount of power. According to logic, only a martial cultivator would have such powers. However, it was impossible to find so many martial cultivators in the world and to group them into an incredibly organized ambush team.</p><br/><p>What followed the axes were earth-shattering screams. 2000 over young men in animal hide started jumping between the mountain rocks. They ran and screamed as they charged below. They weren\u2019t martial cultivators but they had powers that matched those of martial cultivators. This was because they were Desolate Men and they were natural-born warriors.</p><br/><p>This was a unilateral massacre.</p><br/><p>Dozens of heavy rocks landed on the horse carriage. It started rocking violently and what followed was a lightning-like crashing noise. The arrows beside the black horse carriage that were piled up like heaps of grains were smashed by the rocks. The crushed fragments were dyed red and sticky with the flesh and blood of the cavalry troops, looking unusually bright.</p><br/><p>The big black horse stared outside the horse carriage, it couldn\u2019t see what was happening outside but it knew the situation was changing. It couldn\u2019t help but be nervous but a little curious too.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of falling rocks, axes and screaming didn\u2019t stop. After a very long time did everything quietened down. What followed was a volley of cheers before it went back to absolute silence.</p><br/><p>Ning Que embraced Sangsang and got off the carriage.</p><br/><p>Last winter, the Left King\u2019s Palace went against the contract that they had with the Desolate Man\u2019s tribe. They secretly joined up with the West-Hill Divine Palace coalition army to ambush the main force of the Desolate Man. They hunted them down for hundreds of miles, causing mass destruction to the Desolate Man.</p><br/><p>This spring, the Desolate Man\u2019s tribe stalked the Tianqi Mountains for countless nights under the leadership of the Wayfarer of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine Tang until they were at the peak of the Helan mountain range. They ambushed the cavalry of the Left King\u2019s Palace.</p><br/><p>Out of the 3000 over cavalry troops from the Left King\u2019s Palace, only a few hundred of them managed to escape. Only 3 fallen knight commanders out of the dozen of them survived. Prince Long Qing was severely injured and only managed to escape from the hands of the Tang with the help of his two hidden Haotian Taoism cultivators.</p><br/><p>There were the corpses of the grassland cavalry troops all around the valley. Occasionally, there were a few warhorses that were standing disconsolately beside their masters. The 2000 over powerful Desolate Man warriors were holding the iron axes in their hands up high and cheered excitedly.</p><br/><p>This was a perfect revenge from the Desolate Man to the people who betrayed them.</p><br/><p>However, the cheers from the Desolate Man warriors stopped quicker than expected. They looked at the black horse carriage that was surrounded by all the corpse in the valley as they got quieter, a shocked expression on their faces.</p><br/><p>The mood of the Desolate Man warriors wasn\u2019t complicated. Compared to the people in the world who saw this black horse carriage, they were only afraid. Very innocently afraid.</p><br/><p>Especially when the door of the black horse carriage was opened and Ning Que held on to Sangsang while they walked out. The Desolate Man warriors looked at the thin little girl, almost as if they saw the most terrifying night.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany people are easily intoxicated with the pleasures of revenge, I, however, do not find any meaning in that. Even though I have been doing this for the most part of my life, revenge requires animosity first and that means losing first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the powerful person in leather who was several feet away and said, \u201cDesolate Man are natural-born warriors, you have command over this many Desolate Man yet lost so badly last winter. This is unbelievable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang thought back to the bloody battle in the Middle Army Tent in the winter night last year. No matter how tough he was, he still kept silent before saying, \u201cYou have no idea how much power the West-Hill Divine Palace hides.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI do not need to know these, I only know that the Desolate Man are miserable now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang said, \u201cNo matter how miserable we are, without us, you would have died today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI knew you all would come. This has nothing to do with me or Sangsang, hence I do not have to express my gratitude to you all. I have created a perfect ambush opportunity for you all. If you did not grasp this opportunity, the Desolate Man has no right to venture south, much less get back your country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wherever Sangsang was, the dark clouds and crows would follow. The black horse carriage had followed the Tang Empire\u2019s northern Wilderness towards the east and had attracted many people\u2019s gazes along the way. Outside Helan City, Ning Que didn\u2019t choose to go north but rather, to venture east. Creating such a big commotion and revealing his tracks, it was to attract the enemy of the Eastern Desolate Man.</p><br/><p>The Eastern Wilderness was always under the powers of the Left King\u2019s Palace and Long Qing was already the master of this patch of Wilderness. Ning Que knew that Long Qing would definitely appear first. Hence, he wanted to use him and the cavalry troops of the Left King\u2019s Palace to attract Tang and the Desolate Man warriors.</p><br/><p>The tracks of the black horse carriage had entered the Easter Wilderness and the West-Hill Divine Palace and the Buddhism Sect didn\u2019t have time to respond. However, Long Qing and the Desolate Man had time to. Tang had no idea of Ning Que\u2019s intentions and even if he could guess it, he wasn\u2019t sure. However, hearing what Ning Que said, the Desolate Man couldn\u2019t possibly give up this chance of taking revenge.</p><br/><p>Hence, Tang and the Desolate Man warriors would appear here.</p><br/><p>Tang said, \u201cWe are here and we have taken our revenge. We will leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cTake us with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang raised his eyebrows slightly and said, \u201cYou know that is impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cWhy? Even if you do not thank me, I want to know if there is any reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang looked at Sangsang beside him and said, \u201cBecause she is the Daughter of Yama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI remember that the Desolate Man worships Yama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang said, \u201cWorshipping doesn\u2019t equate to liking. It is more of fear. Since the Desolate Man believed in the Enlightenment Doctrine, they have been worshipping Yama, praying to him to not hurt them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cSangsang is the Daughter of Yama. If the Desolate Man do not protect her now when the Underworld Invasion comes, how do you think Yama will punish you and your people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang said, \u201cif she dies, Yama might never find the mortal world. Naturally, there will not be such a thing as an Underworld Invasion. if that is the case, why should my people be worried about something that will never happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \u201cYou all believe in Yama. No one dares to kill her and hence, the Underworld Invasion might take place. Why can\u2019t you all prepare for something that might happen in the future in advance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang replied, \u201cIf I take in you both, I do not need to wait for Yama to appear. The Desolate Man will be surrounded and exterminated by the other tribes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que sneered and said, \u201cFor a good thousand years, who in this world had shown the Desolate Man any good intentions? Do not forget that you all are still in battle. Even without Sangsang and me, the countries in Central Plains would still want to exterminate you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang kept silent.</p><br/><p>Ning Que added, \u201cWhether you all take us in, the Desolate Man will always be the enemies of the entire world. We are the enemies of the entire world. Do you not think we should stay together naturally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang said, \u201cWhat benefits are there to the Desolate Man for taking you both in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said emotionally, \u201cWhatever the case is, Sangsang and I have been decent to your sister. Can you stop being so realistic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang repeated expressionlessly, \u201cWhat are the benefits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked a little helpless before saying with a strict expression, \u201cIf there is an Underworld Invasion, the. Desolate Man will have the most fertile land and the most sheep.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the Desolate Man, fertile land was their life, it was what they were chasing for their whole life. Especially thousands of years after being chased till the Cold Region in the Far North, it has become an even greater temptation to them that they couldn\u2019t resist.</p><br/><p>Tang\u2019s face was still emotionless as he stared at Ning Que\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cIf the Underworld Invasion really come, the Everlasting Night will descend. And the entire world will become incredibly cold. No matter how fertile the land is, without sunlight, how would any grass grow? Without grass, where do the sheep come from? Without sheep, what do the Desolate Man survive on? We will all die and when that happens, does how big the place we stay in matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it not important? I have seen many nobles who contemplate for a good half of their life on where to stay when they die. I have always thought that it is important how big one\u2019s grave is and that the Desolate Man would care\u2026 Alright, even if it isn\u2019t important, I will still promise that after the Underworld Invasion, I will let the Desolate Man become the most powerful ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said decisively, \u201cI promise that when the time comes, I will make you all feel happy even being ghosts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang kept silent for a moment before saying, \u201cI know you are the most shameless of the Academy, but I have never expected you to be this shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked in confusion, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang said, \u201cYour actions now are shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que laughed.</p><br/><p>Tang said, \u201cWhat happens in the future is too empty. It is of no help to the choice I am making now. Hence, the Daughter of Yama and your promise is meaningless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said calmly, \u201cIf you take us in, the Desolate Man will have another decent warrior. More importantly, with me, the Academy will not join in the battle against the Desolate Man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Tang kept silent for a long while before saying, \u201cThat is indeed not bad. I admit I am a little swayed but the Elder might not be willing to take you two in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que. said, \u201cBring us there first, I have an idea on how to convince them. If you have been in contact with Xiao Tang recently, you should know that I am the best at hoodwinking the elders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang handed over the wine bag and said, \u201cThat is decided then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this celebratory wine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que took over the wine bag and took a huge swig.</p>\n</div>"}

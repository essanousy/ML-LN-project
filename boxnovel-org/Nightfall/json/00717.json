It was because they trusted the general in the Northern Military Camp since they had chosen to be here instead of going back to Tang with another group of the Tang Army.</p><br/><p>The podao swords clashed, and the flying arrows screeched. The cavalries escorting the Empress had already prepared their defenses and striking-back as soon as they heard the crowd panic.</p><br/><p>Archers had been long ambushing on both sides of the street, so the Tang army was captured as soon as they were about to ambush the convoy of the Empress.</p><br/><p>During the conflict, the Empress remained expressionless. She was cuddling the Sixth Prince, lowering her head to look into the Prince\u2019s eyes when talking to him.</p><br/><p>Ning Que kept his head down till the conflict was over. Two generals of Tang were shot by arrows and they refused to surrender. Ning Que raised his head and looked out of the window when the two generals pulled out their swords and killed themselves.</p><br/><p>Finally the carriage arrived at the gate of the General\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>The Defender-General of the Wilderness of Tang Empire Xu Chi was welcoming the Empress with his subordinates, and all of them were on their knees waiting beside the stairs at the gate of the Mansion.</p><br/><p>Before General Xu Chi had the time to apologize, the Empress had come out of the carriage with her hands holding the Sixth Prince\u2019s. She said calmly, \u201cThe General\u2019s mansion is really a place hard to reach.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi didn\u2019t explain, and neither had he tried to apologize. He respectfully settled the coffin of His Majesty in his mansion, and then invited the Empress and the Prince to have a rest in the residence at the back.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was no longer around the pine coffin. He was in the study, drinking tea.</p><br/><p>Moments later, Xu Chi opened the door and came in.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had met three of the Four Great Generals of Tang, and Xu Chi was the one he hadn\u2019t met so far. Judging by the descriptions of the Empress and Han Qing, Ning Que had basically pictured Xu Chi\u2019s temperament.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two rebelling generals, they have nothing to do with Gushan Commandery. They were once my subordinates in the Northern Military Camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi admitted it straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIt had nothing to do with Gushan Commandery, but that doesn\u2019t mean it had nothing to do with Hua Shanyue or the Pricess, unless you insist that it was all about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi kept silent for a moment and then he said, \u201cI was told that the Her Highness and Mr. Thirteen were closely related.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cAnd I heard that General Xu Chi was the most loyal subordinate of the late Emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rescript of the West-Hill Devine Palace has spread over the world, and Mr. Thirteen must\u2019ve seen it. The morale of the army was thus influenced, and that was why the conflicting and killing happened today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi said, \u201cI knew you were trying to make a point, but since Her Majesty was a believer of the Devil\u2019s Dorctrine, then the Sixth Prince could no longer succeed the throne, or even go back to Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi said, \u201cBecause the West-Hill Divine Palace won\u2019t allow a descendant of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine to rule the Tang Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cYou idiot, the West-Hill Devine Palace has already been prepared to overthrow Tang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi was silenced. Then he suddenly asked, \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I\u2019m trying to figure out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Asked Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Xu Chi said, \u201cIt\u2019s said that His Majesty\u2019s death has something to do with Her Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cWhat kind of idiotic rumor is this? His Majesty had been suffering from a chronic disease for many years, and I\u2019m sure you knew that because you were his most trusted general. Should it have anything to do with Her Majesty, that must\u2019ve happened many years ago. Since His Majesty didn\u2019t mind it, how dare you resent Her Majesty in his stead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi might have frowned lightly but he looked more relaxed.</p><br/><p>He thought about it for long and then spoke to Ning Que seriously, \u201cYou should suggest Her Majesty and the Six Prince to stay in the Northern Military Camp. I swear I\u2019ll protect them with my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked him in the eyes and remained silent.</p><br/><p>Xu Chi responded to this with calm eyes and expressionless face.</p><br/><p>Then Ning Que suddenly said, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you one more time, and I want to make sure if it is true\u2014are you really loyal to His Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to prove it with my life.\u201d Answered Xu Chi.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI don\u2019t need your life. Swords and spears are enough. I\u2019m sure you know clearly that the Edict in Chang\u2019an is a fake one because the late Emperor had passed the throne to the Sixth Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what are we going to do now, Mr. Thirteen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi answered coldly, \u201cTo bring Her Majesty and the Six Prince back to Chang\u2019an for the fight over the throne with the new Emperor? Or to divide the military forces of Tang and let them fight each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow the Edict without hesitation, even at the cost of a civil war in the Empire, but not now. And I\u2019ll help the Sixth Prince to get on the throne, regardless of Her Majesty being a believer of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine, but not now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi looked extremely severe and continued, \u201cNow all other countries are coming after Tang. The cavalries of the Golden Palace are coming south. The West-Hill Divine Palace is coming north. Qinghe County is rebelling. The Northeast Border Army has been extinguished. Enemies are storming Tang from all directions, and the thousand-year foundation of the empire is shaking in the coming storm. The empire can\u2019t afford any civil war at this very moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said after a short moment of silence, \u201cSo what\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to be united when facing enemies. I won\u2019t allow you and Her Majesty to take thousands of soldiers of the Northern Army to go south to Chang\u2019an. They are supposed to fight bloody battles on the Northern Frontier instead of wasting their lives on civil wars. So I want you to persuade Her Majesty to stay in the Northern Camp with the Sixth Prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi stared Ning Que in the eyes and said, \u201cIf you still insist that this was a betrayal of His Majesty, then I can promise that the Northern Army will support the Sixth Prince after Tang has overcome these difficulties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que frowned lightly. He had to admit that Xu Chi had made a point. The Empire of Tang did need the thousands of soldiers to go back south to fight the invasion, but\u2026</p><br/><p>The door of the study was squeaking, and someone had just opened it.</p><br/><p>The Empress came in and looked at the other two. She said peacefully, \u201cI am going back to Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation Xu Chi knelt before her, and he kowtowed again and again, till his forehead became bloody.</p><br/><p>He said with his pained and shaking voice, \u201cYour Majesty! I\u2019ve been loyal to His Majesty throughout my entire life. Now I have to reject the Edict, I am so guilty and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be regretful for the rest of my life, but the empire can\u2019t afford a civil war now. Your Majesty! Please think twice!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Empress smiled and said, \u201cYou overestimated the influence of me and the Prince. The turmoils in Chang\u2019an or in Tang won\u2019t start or cease just because of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was dumbfounded, and he couldn\u2019t understand what that meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thousands of soldiers going back south originally belong to the Northern Army. They were led temporarily by the Emperor himself to carry out the mission. There\u2019s no way I would take them back to Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Empress said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you these cavalries I brought back here. Me and the Sixth Prince, we\u2019ll go back to Chang\u2019an by ourselves. I\u2019m sure that will allay your worries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chi was shocked and speechless. He thought to himself that since the new Emperor had succeeded to the throne and the Princess Her Highness was in charge of national affairs, Her Majesty\u2019s taking the Sixth Prince back to Chang\u2019an would definitely cost their lives for nothing.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the Empress and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

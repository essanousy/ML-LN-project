There was only one butcher in the world.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest stood outside the door sill, looking at the Butcher who was covered in grease, and yet not one sweat could be found on him, and said, \u201cSince you are here, senior, please do something.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Butcher was cutting pork. After listening to this, he looked at him for a long time and asked him hoarsely, \u201cIs your Elder Brother really ready to do that outrageous thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest replied calmly, \u201cWhat is outrageous? First, we need to define the concept of Tao\u2026 you and Senior Drunkard have hidden under Haotian\u2019s eyes for countless years, isn\u2019t that against her way?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Butcher raised his shaggy eyebrows and said, \u201cHow dare you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest said, \u201cIt benefits you guys too if you help Elder Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo help your Elder Brother,\u201d said the Butcher. \u201cAll I have to do is stay in the small town and don\u2019t come anywhere near here\u2026. because you and I both know that helping your Elder Brother and helping Taoism are two different things.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest was silent for a moment and continued, \u201cThe agreement between Haotian and you is still valid.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Butcher remained silent for a longer time, at first it was because he needed time to think about what he wanted to do, but later on it was because someone had come.</p><br/><p>Hearing footsteps, he started asking, \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest quietly stood outside the door sill and did not turn back to see the approaching figure, and said, \u201cNo one can stop the Black Armor Heavy Cavalry of the Tang\u2019s troop. I will not pray for eternal peace in the temple, but I just hope to save some of the pavilion halls.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Butcher put down the knife in his hands and said indifferently, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest said, \u201cIf the people from the Academy can be killed by you, that would be the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Butcher and the Drunkard were the world\u2019s two longest-living Grand Cultivators, even longer than the Buddhist temple and the Headmaster of Academy. They had always been reclusive until the Headmaster of Academy ascended to heaven and Haotian came into the world, they were then forced to reveal their whereabouts. In these years, the Drunkard had made a move several times, putting more pressure on the Academy so that they could not take anything lightly, while the Butcher did not make a move at all.</p><br/><p>He was extremely strong, perhaps the strongest in the world, and unlike the first that was buried in Prajna Peak, he was strong physically and even stronger with knives, because he was good at killing people.</p><br/><p>For many years, he killed pigs, sheep, cattle, and also men, and this became his strength. While living in seclusion these few years, he lessened his murders, not because of mood alteration, but because of the request by the Headmaster of Academy\u2026</p><br/><p>The Butcher looked impassive and said, \u201cThey\u2019re just pigs and sheep. It doesn\u2019t hurt to kill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was cut off by the cicadas chirping in the small town. At this time, the autumn rain was pretty cold, and the natural sound that the cicadas made in the rain was even sadder. Drowned in the sound of chirping, a little girl in a yellow dress slowly walking from the direction of the town.</p><br/><p>She stopped in front of the Butcher\u2019s shop and looked in. The raindrops at the end of her ponytail were like fine pearls, and as she moved, they fell onto the ground inside the shop. Then she scrunched her nose in a cute way.</p><br/><p>She thought the smell of blood in the Butcher\u2019s shop was too strong, very unpleasant, as unpleasant as the words spoken by the Butcher.</p><br/><p>\u201cOthers are pigs and sheep, but you are a dog. I have never figured out why people like you and Drunkard are willing to be dogs. Is it really that interesting?\u201d Yu Lian\u2019s puerile face was full of inquiries, and she looked cute because she was serious. She was not in a mess though her yellow dress was drenched in the rain, and still looked adorable with her black hair pulled back into a ponytail.</p><br/><p>She was such a lovely but intimidating little girl.</p><br/><p>The injury caused during the war between the Wilderness and the national master of Golden Tribe had fully recovered, yet she did not stop for a rest and travelled thousands of miles toward south, heading to the West-Hill Divine Kingdom, so how would the thousands of cavalryman from the Divine Halls of West-Hill at the outskirts of Peach Mountain stop her?</p><br/><p>Until she came to the butcher shop in the small town, then only did the Divine Hall of West-Hill noticed her arrival. A shrill warning sound went off under the pouring rain and the whole town was in chaos. Countless people came to the town but did not dare to set foot on the street.</p><br/><p>The Butcher looked at the little girl outside his shop, he was able to roughly guess who she was and said impassively, \u201cIt\u2019s better to be a quiet dog than to mess around with people causing chaos\u2026 that\u2019s what your teacher told me personally when we were in town that year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Lian\u2019s gaze fell on the knife in his hand and replied casually, \u201cWhat he said is not necessarily right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Butcher said, \u201cI heard you are the suzerain of Devil\u2019s Doctrine of this generation? Devil\u2019s Doctrine stresses on the vitality of heaven and earth in the body, similar to my self-enlightenment. To be honest, I should be your ancestor in this doctrine\u2026 but seeing that you don\u2019t even care what the Headmaster of Academy said, I don\u2019t think you would give a second thought about what I\u2019ve just said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Lian clasped her hands behind her back and tiptoed to look into the butcher\u2019s shop, just like those little girls who were learning to be adults, absolutely endearing. She said casually, \u201cThe Light\u2019s Doctrine of mine has always been good at deceiving and destroying ancestors.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Butcher replied indifferently, \u201cYou are a very interesting little kid. No one has spoken to me in this way for many years now, you might want to take pride in that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had lived in this world for many years, and by his age alone, he could practically call everyone a child. Yu Lian wasn\u2019t the slightest bit annoyed, but looked at him and responded, \u201cI find you interesting too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d asked the Butcher.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one has ever dared to speak to me with this attitude except my teacher,\u201d Yu Lian answered. \u201cCome to think of it, he was the one who spoke to you with this attitude of mine many years ago. If that\u2019s so, he must have been better at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Butcher was silent for a moment, then suddenly threw the knife in his hand. The Butcher\u2019s knife, full of blood and oil, fell heavily to the ground outside the door sill with a loud clang, as smoke and dust rose in the air, sending gravel flying into the autumn rain as if a mountain had fallen from the sky to the earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can handle this knife, we\u2019ll talk,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Yu Lian crouched down with her hands still behind her back and looked at the legendary knife for a moment. Then she carefully rolled up her sleeves and took out a handkerchief, holding onto the back of the knife with just two fingers.</p><br/><p>With the two fingers, she slowly lifted the heaviest knife in the world off the ground.</p><br/><p>As she moved, the weight of the iron knife spread to her feet. With only two clatters, two clusters of cobweb-like cracks appeared on the bluish marble floor outside the butcher shop\u2019s door sill.</p><br/><p>In the whole process, she frowned and looked dignified. Then she put the knife down.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, you are entitled to talk to me.\u201d The Butcher looked at her coldly and said, \u201cAlthough it was with difficulty, but you managed to lift it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Lian shook her head and carefully wiped her fingers with her handkerchief, saying, \u201cOld people like you always like to boast about yourselves. I just think it\u2019s too dirty. Do you really think that it\u2019s extremely heavy?\u201d She frowned attentively, not wanting her fingers to stain of blood or grease.</p><br/><p>The Butcher was silent for a quite a while and said, \u201cYou are very strong indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the recognition.\u201d She replied casually without a sense of seriousness, her strength didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval, even if the person was the legendary Butcher.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were given my age, no, half, or even a tenth of it, you would probably outdo me, and perhaps even achieve real immortality.\u201d The Butcher looked at her and said, \u201cSadly, you\u2019ll never have that time again, so you\u2019re not enough, and whoever comes from your Academy will be no match for me, because all of you are not strong enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been out in the world for years, so you won\u2019t know that the strength of the Academy is defined as the word \u2018strong\u2019,\u201d Yu Lian said.</p><br/><p>Butcher replied, \u201cDo you want to bring up Ning Que who inherited the legacy of Ke Haoran? Indeed, he is not bad, but many things had happened in Yangzhou City, and now\u2026 he\u2019s still lacking.\u201d He said while raising his eyebrows again.</p><br/><p>Sounds of steady footsteps echoed in the autumn rain. With the powerful rank of the Butcher, he could naturally hear out that something was wrong with the person\u2019s center of gravity, but the footsteps were still extremely steady, which meant this person was dreadful.</p><br/><p>The person was dressed in a shabby frock, his hair was short and loose, but his expression was calm. As he walked in the rain, the distance of every step he took was as if he measured it with a ruler beforehand, there was no deviation.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo was not someone that would make mistakes.</p><br/><p>The Butcher looked at him gravely and said, \u201cPerhaps, you are also here to see if you can pick up my knife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo took the handkerchief from Yu Lian and carefully wiped off the rain on his face, then glanced at the knife on the ground. He did not understand what the Butcher was saying and looking at him was like looking at an idiot.</p><br/><p>Yu Lian looked at the Butcher as if she looking at an ignorant child and said, \u201cI\u2019ve said you would never ask about the world and it proves that I\u2019m right, you don\u2019t know the strongest person in the Academy, and it was never Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the two strongest people of the Academy were Jun Mo and Yu Lian.</p><br/><p>The Butcher, the strongest man in the world of cultivation, or even the strongest one in the whole history of cultivation. The \u201cstrong\u201d used here was not referring to the state of cultivation, but the intensity and strength in particular, thus the two strongest person from the Academy came to meet him.</p><br/><p>Being stared at and ignored by two Academy juniors, the Butcher\u2019s mood turned sour. His face became a little gloomy and he turned quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it enough now?\u201d Yu Lian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d said the Butcher. \u201cBoth of you can join forces and try to battle me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Lian said, \u201cTeacher had said that when giving a regular speech, the words you choose are very important. Jun Mo likes using peaceful measures before using force, since it is enough, then we may first talk about some things.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Butcher took a deep breath, he had done real war preparations these countless years but was stopped by the words of Yu Lian. His turned his pent-up emotions into a word, \u201cSpeak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems a little inconvenient today,\u201d Yu Lian said.</p><br/><p>The Butcher looked at her with his eyes narrowed and eyebrows raised, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>Yu Lian said, \u201cI am not afraid of you, it\u2019s useless to stare at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she turned around to look at the middle-aged man and said, \u201cDo you know why it\u2019s inconvenient?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest sighed. \u201cI think it\u2019s because of my presence? But you are of great powers, so why pay attention to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because you are quite strong,\u201d Yu Lian answered.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged priest smiled, \u201cFrom the beginning till now, I have done nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd because of that you are amazing\u2026 until now, I don\u2019t even know your name, which I have to say it\u2019s quite impressive,\u201d Yulian said to him calmly.</p><br/><p>She was a fog to the world.</p><br/><p>However, this seemingly calm and harmless middle-aged priest, who had been watching and observing for decades, even she could not see his depth, as if his real face was still hidden under the fog, hence, of course, he was worthy of vigilance.</p></div>\n</div>"}

You're certain that your eyes weren't open?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que furrowed his brows as he saw that Pipi did not believe him. \"It is true that my eyes were not open. Furthermore, there was a wall and a bed board between me and the objects. I can't see it even if I wanted to. Right, I went to the casino at the Southern city with my friends and was able to feel the notches in the dice through the dicebox. Is this not perception?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course it is since you can't see it through the dicebox.\" Chen Pipi tilted his head and seized up Ning Que with his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not notice that there was something different with the way Pipi was looking at him. He thought about what happened to him in the casino last night and his promise to Mr. Qi and Sangsang to not use such methods to cheat and earn money. He could not help but feel rather unwilling. He looked at Chen Pipi and was about to say something before clamming up away. However, he could not stop the question from bubbling up and asked in a low tone, \"Is there a way to move the dice without touching the dicebox?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi was shocked and stared at Ning Que as if he had seen a ghost. He scolded angrily, \"You've changed your fate against all odds and can finally cultivate. But you're only thinking of ways to cheat? Is there anyone else like you in the world? You really don't know how to count your blessings!\"</p><br/><p>At this point, the young cultivating genius could no longer suppress the emotions within him. He had always been jealous and even hated Ning Que's good fortunes. He pushed up his sleeves and made a move to hit Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Watching his movements, Ning Que quickly waved his hands and explained, \"I only thought that if I could move the dice without touching the dicebox, it would mean that I can control other things through the energies of heaven and earth. I only chose an example that could be easily understood, don't get so angry. Would I be so dumb to use the Qi of Heaven and Earth to gamble?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi sat down and breathed heavily upon hearing the sincere and believable explanation. He stared at Ning Que with annoyance before tempering his emotions and explained, \"The Initial Awareness State is an unreal state. You can only feel the Qi of the Heaven and Earth and might be able to commune with it, but you cannot affect reality with it. It is only after you have entered the No Doubts State when cultivators can channel Qi through Psyche Power and move objects in reality.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is the logic behind sword masters controlling flying swords and martial warriors fighting without having to touch their enemies physically.\" Ning Que thought.</p><br/><p>\"That's right,\" Chen Pipi continued. \"You have to enter the real state if you want to move the dice without touching the dicebox.\"</p><br/><p>\"The No Doubts State is the third stage.\" Ning Que shook his head and sighed. \"How can I reach that state in a short period of time?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi looked at him weirdly and could not be bothered to speak plainly about what was realistic and what wasn't. He said, \"Even if you entered the real state, don't even dream about being able to control anything using the Qi of Heaven and Earth. Those who are able to are all master cultivators. They only achieved the ability to do so by breaking some invisible barriers.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are there any specifics behind the ability to control objects for cultivators in the No Doubts State?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course there are. You've mentioned that you've seen a battle between cultivators. Have you seen a sword master revealing three rows of flying knives under his robes? Have you seen the disciples of Buddha conjuring 36000 bronze Buddhas at their enemies\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought back to the night at the Spring Breeze Pavilion where Chao Xiaoshu killed the two cultivators. The sword master from South Jin Kingdom had indeed only one sword. He died after the sword was damaged. The sadhu from Yuelun Kingdom had more weapons, but they were but a copper bowl and prayer beads.</p><br/><p>\"Cultivators from the No Doubts State to the Seethrough State have their own unique objects that they perceive. If you want to enter the real state from the unreal state, you have to first cultivate your own unique object. It is also known as the natal item.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \"What is a natal item? I've only heard of the natal year.\"</p><br/><p>\"The sword master's sword is his natal sword. A talisman master's natal talisman is most important to him. The sword and the talisman are natal items.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is the psyche master's natal item?\"</p><br/><p>\"If you can only understand in layman terms, then think of it that he is his own natal item.\" Chen Pipi answered in annoyance. He suddenly thought of the term that Ning Que mentioned earlier and asked curiously, \"What is a natal year?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026 Do you know what ellipses are?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026 I don't know, and I don't wish to know. As for why cultivators need their natal items, you have to understand two things. Firstly, the Qi of Heaven and Earth are everywhere. Even the smallest stone or a withered willow or a ripple on the lake have their own Qi of Heaven and Earth. Secondly, cultivators don't depend on the Qi of Heaven and Earth to directly influence objects on earth. They must use it as a bridge to transfer their psyche power upon the objects, causing the Qi of Heaven and Earth within the object to start vibrating.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sorry to interrupt, why do we need unique items in this case?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is the same example from when I left you the message, the cultivator's psyche power is like one's breath. The Qi of snow and sea mountains are like flutes and bamboos. Only when you are able to blow into it and make a sound will the Qi of Heaven and Earth understand it. And that is when you can feel the Qi of Heaven and Earth. But the thing is, the quality of everyone's flutes and bamboos are different, and yet the Qi can understand them. However, that does not mean that every object can understand or like them all. That is why cultivators have to look for and cultivate their own natal items. It is like finding a partner who can understand and like their own music. I'm already explaining things point-blank to you. Do you understand?\"</p><br/><p>\"I do understand, in general. Is it like the theory of shared vibrations?\"</p><br/><p>\"What is shared vibrations?\" Chen Pipi rubbed his face tiredly. He ignored Ning Que's interruptions and continued, \"When a cultivator enters the real state, he would be able to find an item that fits with his own aura. His state of cultivation would rise easily from there on. But it is too difficult to find a natal item that fits perfectly, which is why many cultivators choose to carve symbols to alter the unique state of each item and cultivate their psyche power for many years to achieve a connection with it.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought about what Lyu Qingchen had talked about regarding sword masters and bucket masters and what not and understood that Chen Pipi was telling the truth. He scratched the back of his hands and smiled, \"So you're saying that in order to become a sword master, I have to find a good sword, hug it every day in bed and become familiar with it before cultivating a relationship with the sword?\"</p><br/><p>\"If you want to understand it in such a ridiculous way, so be it.\" Chen Pipi could not be bothered with him.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, you're the one who said that we have to be in tune to each other!\" Ning Que gestured indignantly before he thought of another important question. \"How many natal items can a person have? What is yours?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why should I tell you what my natal item is?\" Chen Pipi glared at him. \"The greater your abilities, the more intricate your item. The more you can identify the minute differences in the Qi between Heaven and Earth, the more natal items you can have. In the Seethrough state, you can control trees and lakes once you can identify their aura. But an average cultivator would just choose one to ensure that everything works.\"</p><br/><p>\"If I choose to hug a sword to bed every night, can I split my attention and control the dice?\"</p><br/><p>\"As long as you have the energy to study it, you can play around with small things like this. Hey, why are you still thinking about this? It doesn't seem like you're using it as an example.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's just an example. An example. Don't think too much about it.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>And so, the chubby lad of sixteen imparted his knowledge to the sixteen year old beginner cultivator until early dawn. He had completely forgotten the rules of the Academy and the promise he made to himself. He spoke seriously, while his audience listened attentively. The various logics behind the world of cultivation was explained in simple terms.</p><br/><p>He had lived in the hidden grounds of the almighty West-Hill Divine Kingdom. For the past sixteen years, he had focused on cultivation and lived without being affected by the happenings of the secular world after having left home for the Academy. He didn't have a nasty bone in his body. Other than being a little prideful, the heart in that chubby body was clearer than the shiniest crystal out there, touching the hearts of others.</p><br/><p>Having lived on the Min mountain and grasslands and endured much bitterness, and having killed many since the age of four, Ning Que had experienced much deaths in his sixteen years of life. Beneath the jubilant exterior, he hid a careful and cold awareness. In the hours spent together with Chen Pipi, he had felt nothing out of the ordinary. It wasn't until years later when he recalled this moment that he realised how lucky he was.</p><br/><p>Ning Que returned home at twilight the second day and ordered Sangsang to close up the shop and prepare dinner before sitting in the chair next to the window in his room. He looked at the little courtyard and the large tree and fell into a daze.</p><br/><p>Falling into a daze was equivalent to meditating. He was spreading his psyche power through the Snow Mountain and Ocean of Qi towards the various objects in the house and courtyard. According to the method Chen Pipi taught him, the best way to connect to an object that was in tune with him was to keep a heart of joy and follow the lead of his psyche power.</p><br/><p>A weak but pure wave of psyche power emanated from his body, feeling every breath the heavens and earth took before moving off. He could feel the newly embroidered shoe soles beneath the window, the ants crawling around under the tree, and the wad of notes and ingots under the bed. He could perceive many things, but did not receive any reply.</p><br/><p>The Qi of Heaven and Earth existed within everything on earth. According to Chen Pipi's instructions, every object would have a natural rejection against the psyche power of a cultivator. If these objects can feel the kindness and joy within the psyche power of the cultivator and the two's energies can get along well, there will be a reply.</p><br/><p>\"Kindness and joy\u2026 should I try this on the brushes, ink and paper in the shop?\"</p><br/><p>While he was pursuing this train of thought, Sangsang's sudden exclamation could be heard from outside the windows. Immediately following that, was a tinkling laughter reminiscent of bells.</p><br/><p>He opened the windows curiously to see Sangsang's back facing him while trying to get water from the well. Her little hands were swatting behind her back while she said, \"Young Master, stop tickling me. It's itchy\u2026 itchy.\"</p><br/><p>Inside the house, Ning Que looked at the writhing Sangsang in shock. He could understand if Sangsang, who had grown up with him was the one who was most in tune with him. However, was he going to use her as his natal sword?</p><br/><p>Absolutely not! As he thought of the possibilities that were unfolding before his eyes, he took a deep breath and shook his head vigorously in objection.</p><br/><p>If he did that, when he faced general Xia Hou in the future and defeat him, wouldn't that mean he'd have to chant the sword formulas and say, \"You thief, don't you dare be arrogant\u2026 here comes my natal item, Sangsang!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

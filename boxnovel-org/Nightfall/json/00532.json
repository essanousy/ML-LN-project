As long as they could keep away, they would try everything.</p><br/><p>Even so, they were unable to avoid all the attacks. Some of the horses who ran too fast were cut into pieces by the invisible power in the rain. Some knights' shoes were cut up, someone's whole leg was removed with a clean cut. The cut-off section of their leg looked like an eye with a white iris and a red outer sclera, which was extremely disturbing looking.</p><br/><p>Miserable screams sounded in the autumn rain. The invisible lines in the air chased and cut everything as if it had spirituality.</p><br/><p>Zimo moved backward fast in the rain, grabbing two slightly injured companions and throwing them to the back. His armor was ruined with many nicks and cuts on it during his movements and was about to fall apart.</p><br/><p>He hummed and took out his sword containing the purest Qi of Heaven and Earth. He rushed forward and stroked the invisible power so many times that the bright flying sword seemed to become dark due to its speed.</p><br/><p>The damage of a natal flying sword was usually fatal for a cultivator, but Zimo had no time to bother about it. Taking the opportunity he gained with his sword, he was able to get out of the region covered by the power of the horse carriage, and then summoned his sword back.</p><br/><p>A fallen knight commander who was at the rear was not attacked by the invisible power. He could do nothing but watch the horses cutting in pieces and his companions getting hurt. Listening to his companions' screams, he revealed a very ugly expression on his face and became enraged.</p><br/><p>He roared and threw his sword. His sword turned into a flash of green light with a golden edge that rushed toward the black horse carriage through the rain.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as it entered the autumn rain -or to be more accurate- when it got close to the carriage, it slowly dimmed while losing its power and speed. Its surface was covered by rust as if it had been scouring in the rain for decades.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, a lot of tiny cracks appeared on its surface.</p><br/><p>With a bang, it fell on the ground 30 meters away from the carriage and could no longer move at all. It was like a dead bug that had no choice but to rot in the rain.</p><br/><p>That fallen knight commander suddenly became pale and started to vomit blood as his natal sword had been ruined.</p><br/><p>The cold rain flowed from Zimo's hair and over his eyes.</p><br/><p>His eyes remained calm even when he was expelled from the Divine Hall and had his cultivation destroyed by Ye Hongyu. This time though, he felt fear.</p><br/><p>The air started to become colder due to the autumn rain.</p><br/><p>It was just a regular autumn rain; quiet and peaceful. It dampened the yellow grass on the ground, washed the blood on the carriage and the ground. Yet, there seemed to be a net that was weaved by steel wires, waiting for whatever entered the rain, and cutting it no matter if a horse, a man or a sword.</p><br/><p>It was not the rain but in fact the carriage that was causing this. Looking at the carriage and Ning Que who was in it, Zimo's face paled. He thought the man and the carriage must have come from the underworld instead of the human world.</p><br/><p>Seeing his most powerful and loyal subordinates being severely injured and killed by the rain, Long Qing straightened his face. He was unwilling to figure out whether Ning Que was able to shoot the Primordial Thirteen Arrows, and instead started his Psyche Power to transform the surrounding Qi of Heaven and Earth into his own and pushed it to the carriage.</p><br/><p>With the sense of extinction, the devastating power entered the rain, but it vanished instantly.</p><br/><p>At least, it had disappeared in Long Qing's spiritual world, which hurt his sense of perception badly. Thus, his body could not help but start shaking.</p><br/><p>The invisible power in the rain had actually cut through his purest aura.</p><br/><p>Long Qing suddenly remembered the legendary talisman which could cut space if it was well cultivated and changed his face.</p><br/><p>\"A Jing Fu?\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing looked at Ning Que and his cold eyes were full of astonishment and delusion. He was like a hungry beggar who had starved for dozen days and had found a piece of bread in a temple. He could not care whether the bread was bloody or not, and he just wanted to eat it up.</p><br/><p>\"You have learned uncle Yan Se's Jing Fu. You have indeed made a good progress in these two years, haven't you?\"</p><br/><p>Jing Fu was Ning Que's most powerful talisman, and was nearly even a Divine Talisman. It was a heavy burden for him to use it, so he looked paler than Long Qing. He reluctantly laughed and said, \"I don't know where have you hidden these past two years, maybe you were imprisoned or you had encountered some luck. Anyways, you have left for a long time and you've fallen behind. I can forgive you not knowing my legend.\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing said indifferently, \"The war just began and you have already shown your most powerful card. I am curious as to why you are so unwise? Did I push you too much?\"</p><br/><p>\"I thought we, the disciples in the Academy, were the most narcissistic people in the world, but you changed me. Your question is beyond stupid. We should begin with our most powerful skill to fight as if a tiger tries its best to beat a rabbit. Even the girls who are only good at writing and meditation would know this.\"</p><br/><p>The girl Ning Que mentioned was Mo Shanshan who had taught him the fighting attitude during the trip in the Wilderness.</p><br/><p>Being mocked as an idiot, Long Qing didn't get enraged. He calmly looked at Ning Que and said, \"What's next?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \"If you are not going to fight, you can leave first. I won't bother.\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing smiled and said, \"You must die today.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the rain and said, \"You can have a try.\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing looked at the rain and felt the sharp killing intent hiding inside it. He indifferently and ironically laughed. Jing Fu was so powerful that even he was unable to break it, but the biggest feature and also biggest weakness of the Talisman Taoism was its continuity. As the time passed by, it would continually fade till it vanished in the end.</p><br/><p>Long Qing put his right hand behind his back and pointed at the autumn rain with his left hand, saying, \"The second when the talisman disappears with the rain, is the second you die.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que kept quiet.</p><br/><p>Long Qing felt unsatisfied, so he repeated, \"You won't be able to escape today.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \"Ever since I knew you were the one I was going to fight against, I never thought about running.\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing was a little surprised and asked, \"Why? Do you believe it is destiny that we have to fight ?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que ironically said, \"I'm really wondering how you grew up in the palace of Yan Kingdom. How is everything destined? I don't run because I don't have to. Don't forget, to me you are my already defeated opponent. You are never going to beat me.\"</p><br/><p>\"You really think so?\"</p><br/><p>Long Qing sentimentally and painfully laughed after hearing this while saying, \"Do you believe that you can beat me this time?\"</p><br/><p>\"I told you that I don't know what has happened to you these past two years, but I'm not afraid of you. I shall never lose to you and you shall never be able to kill me.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at him and said, \"Because this is my story, and in my story, a character like you is always a foil.\"</p><br/><p>In the carriage.</p><br/><p>Sangsang was installing something on the rest of the iron arrows when she heard Ning Que's words. Her fingers froze and said, \"Do you really think so?\"</p><br/><p>The sounds of the rain covered Ning Que's sigh.</p><br/><p>\"I'm not Youngest Uncle or Second Brother, so of course I don't think so. What's more, in my opinion, the one who is acting as a hero the most won't have a good end.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then, why do you say that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Because I don't like him. Even though I cannot beat him, I would like to irritate him.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que squinted Sangsang and said, \"You know why I don't like him.\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang was ashamed and annoyed. She explained and said, \"I don't like him anymore. I just thought he looked nice at that time.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que coldly said, \"But the truth that you have ever liked him is a fact.\"</p><br/><p>The atmosphere outside was still tense, but inside, Ning Que and Sangsang had the mood to discuss old accounts.</p><br/><p>Li Qingshan didn't say anything.</p><br/><p>The Jing Fu was covering the black carriage, causing no one being able to enter the rain or allowing them to exit.</p><br/><p>However, even the most powerful talisman would disappear after some time.</p><br/><p>Long Qing understood that Ning Que was stalling to recover, so he sat down on the stone step and closed his eyes to meditate, healing his wounds.</p><br/><p>This was a moment of peace in the middle of the battle.</p><br/><p>Soon the rain was going to stop.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>-</p><br/>\n</div>"}

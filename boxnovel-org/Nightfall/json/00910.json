They were very intimidating and well prepared to attack Ning Que.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Raising his right hand, the Sage of Calligraphy signaled the guards and soldiers to halt and said to Ning Que with no expressions on his face, \u201cYou Tang people are indeed unreasonable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy frowned, \u201cWhy do you meddle with Shanshan\u2019s marriage even though you don\u2019t want to marry her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cThat is because I know for sure that she doesn\u2019t want to marry the monarch of the Great River Kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother and I are the closest to her, and we know what she is thinking.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI am her teacher, and I raised her.\u201d The Sage of Calligraphy shouted, \u201cHow could you and Li Manman be the closest to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que spread his hands and said, \u201cI know that Shanshan never thought of you as the closest one. It\u2019s very clear that who is the closest to her and who knows her better.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy didn\u2019t want to argue with him and said indifferently, \u201cI don\u2019t know how escaped from the Divine Hall of West Hill. However, since you came here today, I won\u2019t let you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought of how surprised the Sage of Calligraphy was to see him. After hearing what the Sage of Calligraphy said at this moment, he realized that his escape still remained a secret. The Divine Hall of West Hill probably kept Academy in the dark about his whereabouts, let alone the fact that Sangsang was with him. However, it wouldn\u2019t be a secret anymore after today. What really made him feel puzzled and vigilant was that the Sage of Calligraphy revealed his intention to kill him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Your Excellency?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy didn\u2019t answer him, but the emotions in his eyes turned to indifference. He thought that killing Ning Que would solve a problem for Haotian.</p><br/><p>His Excellency Wang was not Abbey Dean of the Zhishou Abbey and didn\u2019t know the complicated relationship between Ning Que and Haotian. However, he was a super powerful man standing at the peak of Knowing Destiny State. He had intuition for everything, and his intuition was perfectly accurate.</p><br/><p>Looking at the expression on the silver-haired old man\u2019s face, Ning Que quickly understood the reason. His body suddenly turned cold, not because of fear, but because he had to calm himself.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Suddenly hearing that Shanshan was about to get married, Ning Que had to do something, but he didn\u2019t expect to make such a big fuss. He couldn\u2019t just kill the monarch of the Great River Kingdom like Sangsang had suggested. The Great River Kingdom and Great Tang had enjoyed a peaceful relationship for generations and the Sage of Calligraphy was Shanshan\u2019s teacher. However, if the Sage of Calligraphy wanted him dead, then Ning Que would not hesitate to roughly fight back.</p><br/><p>Ning Que respected the old man in front of the hall, not because he was Shanshan\u2019s teacher, but because his surname was Wang and he was known as the Sage of Calligraphy who was also a talisman master equivalent to Yan Se, Ning Que\u2019s master.</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy was his predecessor and probably the strongest in the field of Fu Tao. Of course Ning Que had to respect him, but as a talisman master who learned Fu Tao, Ning Que had his own pride.</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t want to die and was very proud of his Fu Tao. Therefore, the battle with the Sage of Calligraphy was inevitable. He would never give up even if he were to lose.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master, Yan Se, once mentioned to me that Your Excellency was proficient in Fu Tao and he told me to learn from Your Excellency if I ever had the chance.\u201d Ning Que added, \u201cEnlighten me please.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy said, \u201cYan Se might have had a chance to beat me if he was still alive, but you don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said seriously, \u201cYou are wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy asked indifferently, \u201cWhere am I wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cThe proof of the pudding is in the eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy was stunned by the change in Ning Que\u2019s tone, which made his face darken.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The guards turned pale, with complicated emotions in their eyes, for they already knew who Ning Que was. The Great River Kingdom and Great Tang had a very close relationship. The Academy was not only the pride of Great Tang, but also the pride of the people of the Great River Kingdom. The Black Ink Garden and Mo Shanshan were of course also the pride of the Great River Kingdom. The people of Great River Kingdom naturally valued Mr.Thirteen from the Academy who had a much-told history with Mo Shanshan highly. However, he became an enemy today.</p><br/><p>Ning Que dared to threaten the monarch and came to break the marriage, which made the people of the Great River Kingdom angry. However, they would be disappointed if Ning Que had not showed up. When Ning Que did show up, they were somewhat pleased and complacent rather than angry. The people of Great River Kingdom suffered mixed emotions which were hard to explain.</p><br/><p>Ning Que didn\u2019t know what his appearance meant for the people of the Great River Kingdom and what complicated mental stimulation he brought to them. He looked at the Sage of Calligraphy in front of the hall and took a step forward.</p><br/><p>At this time, he was separated from the Sage of Calligraphy by a distance of tens of zhang. Although he was only taking a small step forward, it meant that the battle was about to begin.</p><br/><p>Guards and soldiers evacuated from the square and poured into the main hall, guarding the monarch behind the crowd. The complex emotions became tense at this moment, and a perfect silence prevailed the palace.</p><br/><p>The Sage of Calligraphy was an extremely powerful human and he entered the peak of Knowing Destiny State many years ago. Ning Que was not an ordinary person either. Putting aside the skills he learned in the Academy, his talent for Fu Tao was also known all over the world. Additionally, he was the second youngest talisman master in the world.</p><br/><p>The cultivation world always believed that a talisman master was naturally invincible in the battle of the same state, so it could be imagined how profound and horrible Fu Tao was. What would the battle between two talisman masters be like?</p><br/><p>After all, the human world hadn\u2019t seen the battle of talisman masters for many years.</p><br/><p>The winter winds in Jingdu were not cold, only a little chilly. They were breezing from the flowers and trees inside and outside the imperial city to the square in front of the hall and to Ning Que\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Ning Que lifted his right arm solemnly and began to write in the wind.</p><br/><p>The word he wrote was very simple and only consisted of two strokes, one on the top, the other on the bottom. The two strokes were relative to each other, as if they would never engage or separate.</p><br/><p>It was the first Divine Talisman Ning Que mastered: Two Talisman.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>This Divine Talisman was born out of Yan Se\u2019s Well Talisman. Although the Two Talisman can\u2019t cut off everything in the world like the Well Talisman which can even cut off the space in Battle of Light, it suited the temperament of Ning Que and the Academy perfectly, full of tyrannical implications.</p><br/><p>Summoning the Qi of Heaven and Earth, fierce Talisman Intents raged in the palace of the Great River Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Petals of the flower trees in the imperial garden fell down, and the twisted trees tied by the gardener were tied more tightly by themselves to cause two looming traces on the bark. The notches on the surface of the copper cranes in front of the hall were so deep that the color of unoxidized copper in the notches could be seen. It was as bright as gold.</p><br/><p>The Talisman Intent applied by Ning Que fell in front of the hall and suddenly tightened. It was overflowing with a horrible atmosphere. A few white hair fell with the wind. However, the Sage of Calligraphy was still calm. He took out a brush pen from the sleeve and drew freely in the wind.</p><br/><p>The brush pen was trembling in the wind, and the Sage of Calligraphy looked extremely solemn. All of a sudden, a gust of wind roared, and countless dark clouds appeared to cover the clear sky over Jingdu. The palace became extremely dark and the cloud continued to roll, looking violent. Then a \u201csuppress\u201d script vaguely appeared on the surface of the cloud!</p><br/><p>He must be extraordinary to deserve the name of \u201cSage of Calligraphy\u201d. His cultivation of Fu Tao was different from that of ordinary Talisman masters. Besides comprehending its shape in Heaven and Earth, he also inconceivably possessed his natal item.</p><br/><p>His natal item was the brush pen in his hand. This brush pen looked very ordinary and was as long as an ordinary person\u2019s forearm. It looked like an item used to write big characters. The scripts he wrote in the wind were indeed very big.</p><br/><p>The ordinary Talisman masters normally wrote the characters for Nature with their Psyche Power as the brush pen and their insights as the ink. When Nature understood the characters, Qi of Heaven and Earth would appear and became countless magical means.</p><br/><p>However, the Sage of Calligraphy wrote the characters with his natal item as the writing instrument and the Qi of Heaven and Earth as the ink. He didn\u2019t need Nature to understand him because he was commanding Nature!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a \u201csuppress\u201d script appeared on the surface of the cloud, then a forceful pressure was applied to the palace. The Talisman Intent released by Ning Que was suddenly stagnated, so it was not as powerful as before.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Looking at the old man writing in the wind, Ning Que admired him inwardly. After the Sage of Calligraphy wrote the \u201csuppress\u201d script, the brush pen was still moving. The winter wind surrounding the palace passed the intent to the cloud in the air, stirring up the dark cloud again. Then countless sprawling characters slowly appeared.</p><br/><p>The cloud was like a piece of paper for the Sage of Calligraphy to write on.</p><br/><p>Innumerable, complicated, and unfathomable Talisman Intent fell down from the cloud and descended on Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Even if Liu Bai was revived, he would also feel a little tricky facing the Talisman Intent, for these characters were too scribbled and the intent changed constantly. How was one supposed to break the intents without understanding them?</p><br/><p>Ning Que was an exception because he was also an calligrapher and a well-known one. Looking at the scribbled characters on the cloud, he was still amazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat impressive cursive!\u201d</p><br/><p>Understanding the cursive was only the first step to destroying it. To destroy the cursive which completely reflected an calligrapher\u2019s spirit, the two important things were momentum and magnanimity!</p><br/><p>Ning Que did have talent for Fu Tao but he was only enlightened a few years ago and became a talisman master last year. How was he be supposed to compete with the Sage of Calligraphy who had mastered Fu Tao many years ago?</p><br/><p>Ning Que couldn\u2019t compete with the Sage of Calligraphy in terms of momentum and magnanimity. How could he destroy the Talisman Intent applied by the Sage of Calligraphy? What characters should he write?</p><br/><p>Feeling Talisman Intent falling from the clouds, Ning Que withdrew his hands and held the hilt by his waist, taking out the heavy iron sword and waving to the cloud full of characters!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Waving it to the left!</p><br/><p>Then to the right!</p><br/><p>The Yi Talisman appeared again.</p><br/><p>In terms of the state of Talisman Intent, even Yi Talisman, the most powerful Talisman Ning Que possessed, couldn\u2019t destroy the cursive on the cloud. However, he didn\u2019t use the intent of Yi Talisman but the original meaning of \u201cYi\u201d!</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s Talismans were always so simple that it didn\u2019t need to be written in cursive style. Besides, Yi Talisman especially couldn\u2019t be written in cursive style, for \u201cYi\u201d originally meant grass cutting.</p><br/><p>Many people thought that the word \u201cYi\u201d meant to kill people arbitrarily, which was only an extended meaning of this word. Originally, \u201cYi\u201d meant a knife used to clear weed in the field.</p><br/><p>You wrote a cursive on the cloud. Then I had to cut if off.</p></div>\n</div>"}

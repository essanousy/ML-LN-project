Looking at the iron sword, he said, \u201cFinally, it is getting interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle in Verdant Canyon had lasted for two days and the strongest man was waiting for Jun Mo at his strongest.</p><br/><p>Looking at the iron sword, he finally felt interested, which meant that Second Brother at this time was in his strongest phase.</p><br/><p>The iron sword was indeed interesting.</p><br/><p>More interesting than Liu Bai expected.</p><br/><p>It still represented Second Brother\u2019s rules.</p><br/><p>Black or white, no gray.</p><br/><p>Alive or dead, one or the other.</p><br/><p>To fight or defeat, no one could evade.</p><br/><p>Facing such an aggressive sword, everyone should make a decisive choice.</p><br/><p>There was only one way, going in one direction.</p><br/><p>There was no third way in the world and no weeds on the wall could stand still.</p><br/><p>The sword had gone beyond all expectation.</p><br/><p>It gave its enemies a chance to choose, and then it would smash and eliminate them.</p><br/><p>This was a kingly way.</p><br/><p>How would people choose between life and death?</p><br/><p>Even if they didn\u2019t care for it, they had to choose.</p><br/><p>Just because they had too much in sight, they didn\u2019t know how to choose.</p><br/><p>It was also a failure if they didn\u2019t choose.</p><br/><p>This was the puzzle from the iron sword to Ye Su.</p><br/><p>Ye Su didn\u2019t answer to the iron sword.</p><br/><p>Since the sword represented Second Brother\u2019s rules, if he took it, it was equal to accepting his rules which could not be changed no matter how he tried.</p><br/><p>However, the iron sword needed to be taken.</p><br/><p>What could he do?</p><br/><p>Ye Su made the field to take the sword.</p><br/><p>The field was his rule.</p><br/><p>Before the iron sword came out of the Verdant Canyon, he had been putting his hands behind him.</p><br/><p>The breeze created by his sleeves slightly blew over the field.</p><br/><p>Then the iron sword flew into the field.</p><br/><p>The field of rice divided in two, waving like a lake, a sea, and green pines in the mountains.</p><br/><p>The weeds on the ridge were stained with blood.</p><br/><p>The matured rice was stained with blood.</p><br/><p>The iron sword flew over the weeds, smashing them into dust, which flew up and fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>The matured rice fell down as the sword flew.</p><br/><p>Losing its heavy seeds, the rice straightened up, rebounding its leaves into the air.</p><br/><p>The ears of rice fell to the ground and the seeds bounced into the sky along with the leaves before they touched the ground.</p><br/><p>The bran covering the seeds cracked, revealing the round crystal grains.</p><br/><p>The grains flew around, reflecting sunlight like pearls which looked extraordinarily beautiful.</p><br/><p>The grains in the sky, burned by the sunshine, smelled fragrant.</p><br/><p>The grains on the ground, being dyed bloody, immersed in the earth.</p><br/><p>Green rice leaves grew in the soil.</p><br/><p>They sturdily grew up to the sky.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the field of rice had experienced harvest, death, and rebirth.</p><br/><p>The rice\u2019s life just happened in front of people.</p><br/><p>It was a continuous processes in the perfect harmony circles with no boundary, which even the flying iron sword could not find the dividing line.</p><br/><p>It was still flying forward in silence.</p><br/><p>The growth of rice suddenly speeded up, whooshing.</p><br/><p>The iron sword created a hurricane over the rice.</p><br/><p>Ye Su\u2019s wooden sword suspended in front of him and was swayed by the hurricane like a frail boat in the rice sea.</p><br/><p>The boat had no power and was swayed by the push of the rice and wind.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong the waves were and how fierce the wind was, the small boat had never sunk, rising and falling in the dark sea with white waves.</p><br/><p>A moment ago, it disappeared in the sea.</p><br/><p>The next moment, it showed up once again.</p><br/><p>The boat had no deck nor cabin.</p><br/><p>It was the wooden sword, the simplest piece of wood.</p><br/><p>It aimlessly floated in the sea of life and death.</p><br/><p>It asked for neither survival nor death.</p><br/><p>Therefore, nothing could control it either.</p><br/><p>Some time passed.</p><br/><p>The wind stopped and the sea calmed down as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Only the seedlings on the ground could prove what had happened.</p><br/><p>Ye Su reached and caught some grains.</p><br/><p>They were full and burned by the sun, turning yellow and having a good smell.</p><br/><p>He put a grain into his month.</p><br/><p>He slowly chewed with a smile on his face, carefully tasting it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver ten years ago when I traveled around many countries, I believed I had stopped caring for life and death and stopped being scared. I believed I and my sword had merged together, and it knew me as a second me,\u201d said Ye Su.</p><br/><p>Ye Su sprinkled the rest of the rice to the ground and said with a smile, \u201cIf I faced your sword at that time, I would have taken it and lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil a few years ago, when I stabbed Mr. First across space against the sun on the Snow-capped Peak with my pure sword intent, I realized that I was completely wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su stopped smiling and calmly said, \u201cBecause that sword I was proud of, never hit Mr. First. It didn\u2019t even stir up the water in the pool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. First was reading books by the pool and he didn\u2019t even look at my sword or think of it at all. Until that moment, I realized that\u2026 seeing through was a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that, I went to Chang\u2019an and lived in a small Taoist temple for a long time. I saw the Taoist temple collapsing and my neighbor\u2019s roofs breaking. I was no longer supermundane. I was feeling them. I began to repair the temple and houses for them and finally understood the truth of \u2018first destroy and then build\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the blood in the field, he continued, \u201cBlood represents death, but it can fertilize the field. The blood-rice must be delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrist destroy and then build. This is the circle of life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no death in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Brother looked at him and suddenly said, \u201cThere is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su said, \u201cI know. But in our time, there is no death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Brother said, \u201cLife and Death, how can you break them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Buddhism and Taoism both ask for the last great peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing through life and death is aimed toward the last peace. However, at this moment, I understand death is eternal and life is lucky, both of which are full of joy. Why should people have to be in peace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kind of peace is false.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFacing life and death, people should follow their hearts. That is real.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my view of life and death now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems simple and powerless, but it can\u2019t be broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeither by your sword nor by anything in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Second Brother thought for a moment and said, \u201cYou have approached the Tao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su said, \u201cBut I haven\u2019t attained the Tao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Brother said, \u201cHowever, your Tao has deviated from Haotian\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Su said, \u201cTao exists in the heart of Heaven. Maybe this is the Tao Haotian teaches me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Brother asked, \u201cIf it isn\u2019t, what will you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the rice and seedlings, he answered after a long silence, \u201cI have my sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>He reached out his hand to the golden rice sea.</p><br/><p>He held the wooden sword.</p><br/><p>Everyone had his own Tao.</p><br/><p>This was irrelevant to faith and piety.</p><br/><p>Someone like Ye Su was bound to develop his own Tao.</p><br/><p>Second Brother\u2019s question was practical.</p><br/><p>So was Ye Su\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>He was prepared.</p><br/><p>This represented a shocking fact.</p><br/><p>If Haotian agreed with his Tao, he would remain pious.</p><br/><p>If not, he had his sword.</p><br/><p>Since his Tao had been built, he would like to hold on to it.</p><br/><p>Ye Su was a genius as well as a determined believer of Haotian, because of which the Abbey Dean took him as a disciple.</p><br/><p>However, he had changed.</p><br/><p>Maybe since he was in the wilderness, or in the temple in Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>Anyway, he held his own sword.</p><br/><p>The sword dared to question the Heavens.</p><br/><p>How powerful he must be.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he was a believer of Haotian.</p><br/><p>The Wayfarer of the Haotian Taoism.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t need to question the Heavens.</p><br/><p>Instead, he asked Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>Was Jun Mo able to take it?</p>\n</div>"}

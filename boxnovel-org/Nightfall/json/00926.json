If what I want is immortality, then what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want eternity,\u201d said the Abbey Dean.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard pondered on his words and felt his infinite desire.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean continued, \u201cEternity means no change. Any change will lead to an end.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the fundamental conflict between the Academy and Taoism. For someone like the Drunkard, it was an obvious fact. He frowned and asked, \u201cEven if it were to become like a pool of stagnant water?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean said, \u201cYou and I live here. Our numerous predecessors and descendants had lived and will live here. There are lush trees and blooming peach blossoms. Who would say it is like a pool of stagnant water?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The Drunkard doubted. \u201cThat probably won\u2019t convince the Headmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean said, \u201cEven if it were to become a pool of stagnant water, it is eternity.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard asked, \u201cI want immortality because I want to be alive. Is eternity really so important to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean said after a long pause, \u201cEver since I have been enlightened, I have been thinking of that question. I\u2019ve found that I cannot accept a world without eternity.\u201d</p><br/><p>It became quiet again inside the stone cottage. His voice resounded continuously as if it was trying to awake every bird in Peach Mountain and every flower around the Divine Halls.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there will be an end to everything, then what is the significance of every existence throughout time? Whenever I come across that possibility, I feel the most profound despair. Don\u2019t you find that depairing?\u201d the Abbey Dean asked the Drunkard seriously. In the meantime, he was also asking his disciple and Long Qing as well as everyone in the world, including the Headmaster and those from the Academy.</p><br/><p>The Drunkard found it bitter. He did not know how to answer because when he thought carefully, he sensed the most profound horror hidden in this question, which prevented him from thinking further. He asked instead, \u201cHow about yourself? What if you could not find eternity together with Heaven and Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean answered, \u201cEveryone is a part of this Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth is eternal, we will definitely be eternal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Drunkard asked, \u201cEven without your own consciousness?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean said, \u201cIt is already comforting enough to know that eternity exists.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The Drunkard shook his head with disagreement. \u201cYour thinking has already deviated from the true meaning of life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean smiled and asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the reason why we cultivate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Life is a cultivation.</p><br/><p>Ning Que could not remember where he saw that sentence, but he remembered it because he found it very sophisticated and extremely magnificent.</p><br/><p>While he toured around the world with Sangsang, they crossed many rivers and mountains and met many strangers as well as acquaintances. He suddenly realized this saying was very substantial. Then he found out he might have mistaken it with another saying \u2014 life is a journey.</p><br/><p>The sceneries changed constantly on their journey and so did their sentiments. Leaving Linkang, they crossed the Great Swamp, traveled along the southern part of Yan Kingdom and entered the territory of Tang Empire. Ning Que suddenly regained his good mood \u2014 they finally returned home. The green fields looked so charming and even the smell of manure in the wind was not that disgusting.</p><br/><p>People appeared differently when they were in a very good mood. As for Ning Que, he would repeatedly do very simple tasks. It was the only way that he could fully express his happiness.</p><br/><p>He sometimes wrote on the ground with sticks, and sometimes sharpened his slasher against the stone, or sang a part of a song repeatedly.</p><br/><p>He sat on the back of the big black horse and kept Sangsang in his arms. It was a bit hard to hold her tight because of her lofty figure, but that did not affect his good mood at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Jude, lalalalalalala\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>It seemed to be a song from his previous life. He could only remember the first line and kept repeating it. There might be some other reason for his good mood. He kept singing and became so happy that even his eyebrows dancing.</p><br/><p>Sangsang had been indifferent until he was only singing that line. She became more and more annoyed and looked gloomy. She looked gloomy for a long time before Ning Que finally noticed that she was unhappy. He got close, looked into her eyes and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cI don\u2019t like being called a black pig.\u201d *(see note)</p><br/><p>Ning Que finally understood why she was unhappy and tried hard to keep himself from laughing. He said, \u201cYour have such fair skin now. Who could call you black? Don\u2019t be so sensitive, okay?</p><br/><p>Sangsang said, \u201cIt was just because you kept thinking of me being dark in the past. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Troubles like misunderstanding song lyrics were merely some episodes along their way. They rode on the big black horse and continued to the east. They saw the golden rape flowers in the fields and farmers\u2019 cottages in bright colors. They finally came to the City of Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>The sky crapping city was unparalleled and magnificent.</p><br/><p>They used to loaded with emotions whenever they saw magnificent cities. Now they were very calm because they had lived here for a long while.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was still a bit excited because he had finally brought Haotian home.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I want to go into Chang\u2019an.\u201d Sangsang\u2019s words were like dumping freezing water on him. He felt cold from inside out.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He said after a while, \u201cThere\u2019s indeed no reason for you to go to Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Throughout the human world, the only thing that could pose some threat to Haotian was the God-Stunning Array in Chang\u2019an. Even though it was a disabled God-Stunning Array, she was still on the edge.</p><br/><p>They came to the Farewell Pavilion by the road and looked at the magnificent city from some distance. He asked after a long while, \u201cIf this is not the end of our journey, then where should we go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang replied, \u201cIf this is the end of your journey, you can leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not say anything. He did not realize until they came to the City of Chang\u2019an, that the battle between Haotian and humans was far from ending. Their journey should continue.</p><br/><p>He could have threatened her by trying to kill himself and forced her to get into Chang\u2019an. However, he did not want to because that would make no sense and could not be claimed as a victory.</p><br/><p>The day when Sangsang would enter the City of Chang\u2019an voluntarily would be his day of victory.</p><br/><p>The Farewell Pavilion was located a few miles away from the city.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at miles away, as if he could see the city wall made of black bricks. Then he saw the gate of the city slowly opened. A scholar-looking man walked out of the city holding a young boy in his hand.</p><br/><p>This man was still wearing a cotton-padded gown in the spring. It must be his Eldest Brother.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The Academy guarded the Tang Empire. Therefore ,the young boy in his hand was definitely the young emperor of Tang Empire.</p><br/><p>The young emperor was handsome and dignified, but he looked a bit confused at the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, why do we need to get out of the imperial palace today?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest brother answered, \u201cBecause I want you to meet two people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young emperor looked afar but could not find anyone. He knew that ever since ten days ago, the City of Chang\u2019an had been more intensely guarded. Ever since last night, they even closed the gates and did not allow anyone to enter or exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, who are we meeting with? Does that have anything to do with the tension in the imperial palace? Are they our enemies? Are they from Taoism or is that the national master of the Golden Tribe?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother answered with a smile, \u201cThey are two interesting people. The woman is learning how to become a human being, or not to become one. Meanwhile the man is on a more difficult assignment. His task is to make her fall in love with human beings and teach her to be a one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Recalling those rumors he heard in the imperial palace, the young emperor seemed to understand and became anxious. He instinctively held his Master tighter and asked, \u201cIs the Youngest Uncle back?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother answered, \u201cYes. Your Youngest Uncle is back. Your father and mother had entrusted the City of Chang\u2019an and the Tang Empire to him. He never lets anyone down. He even left behind his own life and those he treasured, only to strive harder for fulfilling his task.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young emperor pulled his hand from his master\u2019s hand and made a serious salute to afar.</p><br/><p>The Eldest Brother looked to the Farewell Pavilion and thought, Youngest Brother, I brought His Majesty here for you. Chang\u2019an is safe as usual. There\u2019s nothing to be worried about. You just need to try your best but never push it too hard or forget your original aspiration.</p><br/><p>He held the young emperor in his hand and walked back into the city.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The gate was not closed. Dozens of strong men wearing black clothes pulled out a black carriage from the city. They had to use extremely strong ropes and pulled really hard to get it out.</p><br/><p>It took them a long while to get the black carriage to the Farewell Pavilion.</p><br/><p>The Fourth Master Qi led his dozens of clansmen from the Fish-Dragon Gang to the pavilion and kowtowed to Sangsang. Then he smiled at Ning Que and headed back to Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>The Grand Secretary, Zeng Jing, and his wife had also come with the crowd.</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing\u2019s wife came to the Farewell Pavilion. She felt complicated while looking at Sangsang and wondered how her daughter had become such a lofty woman.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said to Sangsang, \u201cYou have to pay back the worldly bonds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang turned to Zeng Jing\u2019s wife and said emotionlessly, \u201cI grant you immortality.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was speechless. He mocked silently, What do you think immortality is? A cabbage?</p><br/><p>Zeng Jing\u2019s wife did not get her words clearly but felt heartbroken upon hearing the familiar voice. She took some steps forward and sensed her familiar smell.</p><br/><p>She got hold of Sangsang\u2019s sleeves and held her tight in her arms. She cried with trembling voice, \u201cMy child, what had happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sangsang frown and felt annoyed.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at her and thought, If you have come to the human world for a cultivation, then being hugged in the Farewell Pavilion and seeing her crying was an inevitable part of your journey.</p><br/><p>Sangsang knew what he was thinking about, not by guessing or reasoning, she just knew. She heard his silent voice then calmed down.</p><br/><p>She let herself be held by Zeng Jing\u2019s wife and her warm tears fell on her flowery green dress. However, she still looked indifferent. No one knew if she even felt anything.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>* Note: The pronunciation of \u201cHey Jude\u201d sounds like \u201cblack pig\u201d in Chinese. /hei/ \u2013 black; /d\u0292u/ \u2013 pig.</p></div>\n</div>"}

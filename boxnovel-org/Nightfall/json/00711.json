After a moment of silence, he replied, \u201cSince there is no edict, the general has to return to the south.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is better to be honest at such a time. If I have not anticipated wrongly, General Xu Shi started on his return journey after the news of father\u2019s passing away spread to the south.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cThis is not the time to investigate these matters. I want you to tell the old general that Chang\u2019an and the Empire of Tang need him now. The imperial edicts issued by the West-Hill Divine Palace to attack the Tang Empire will surely do him no good. Please ask him to be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The general thought that the Princess would blame the military for taking actions without permission, and he didn\u2019t expect such an instruction from her. He said, \u201cYour Highness, please rest assured that the general would definitely return to Chang\u2019an safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu could finally relax a little when she heard that.</p><br/><p>The next person who was brought into the imperial study by the eunuch was Supervisor Song.</p><br/><p>The censor was not related to any military or political affairs. However, Li Yu had summoned him because Supervisor Song was her contact to the warlords of Qinghe County.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe imperial court has already transferred the Northern Army back and the Western army and the Southern Army have also received military orders; they will soon go north to resist the cavalry of the Golden Palace. The West-Hill Divine Palace has been planning for many years. The South Jin Kingdom\u2019s emperor has yet to get over the death of his son, so there would definitely be a large army coming from the south to stop our troops. We can only rely on the navy on the Great Lake and the warlords of Qinghe County.\u201d</p><br/><p>All these things mentioned by Li Yu were open arrangements made in the Court, so she didn\u2019t need to worry about leaks. She looked at Supervisor Song silently and then said, \u201cI will not forget what I have promised the warlords of Qinghe County. I hope that they will also show this in their actions. I anticipate the arrangements made by them in the West-Hill Divine Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Supervisor Song knelt without hesitation and bowed deeply to the princess. He said respectfully, \u201cPlease rest assured, Your Highness, the 100,000 state troops in Qinghe county and the 30,000 Zhuang troops of the warlords would definitely cooperate with the various navy departments. They will stop the enemies from the Divine Hall and hold the South Jin Kingdom troops in the north of the Great Lake with their lives. Even if they do not succeed, they will definitely buy time for the empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Li Yu said, looking at him quietly.</p><br/><p>After Supervisor Song left, the Grand Secretary of Huaying Hall, Mo Han, emerged from behind the bookshelves. He looked at the tightly shut doors of the imperial study and said worriedly, \u201cIf there is a Defender-general of the State in Chang\u2019an, the morale of the army and people would be further stabilized. I\u2019m worried about Qinghe County even though the warlords have pledged loyalty for many years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The warlords have used so many resources to get Huiyuan and me to this position. Even if they had other ideas, they cannot change too much in such a short period of time. Otherwise, the difference would cause a huge problem within the ranks of the warlords.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu did not wait for him to complete his statement. She said coldly, \u201cFurthermore, the descendants of the warlords, including Old Master Cui\u2019s second son and a few grandsons are all in Chang\u2019an. Would they have such thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Han thought about it for a moment and felt that Her Highness\u2019 plans were indeed fool-proof. However, the worry on his face did not disappear completely. He said, \u201cIs the Academy still inactive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu fell silent. Then, she suddenly picked up a paperweight from the desk and threw it on the floor.</p><br/><p>There was a crash and the paperweight shattered into countless pieces.</p><br/><p>She could not hide the ire she felt. Her body stiffened as she said, \u201cThe Academy has locked up their doors and is still refusing to accept guests\u2026The Tang Empire has fed the Academy for millennia. Now that the empire is in danger, they refuse to lend a hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a eunuch softly said something outside the imperial study.</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s ire had not dissipated. She yelled for the eunuch to leave.</p><br/><p>The eunuch\u2019s voice trembled, but he did not leave. He continued to say that someone was here to visit the Princess.</p><br/><p>Li Yu froze slightly when she heard the person\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Mo Han frowned slightly and said, \u201cYour Majesty, just meet with him. I will take my leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Chao Xiaoshu who had entered the palace in the middle of the night and forcefully requested for a meeting with the Princess. It was no wonder why the bodyguards and the chief eunuch did not dare to leave nor announce his arrival.</p><br/><p>Li Yu looked at the middle-aged man in a turquoise robe standing under the autumn tree. After a moment of silence, she said, \u201cI have requested for second uncle Chao to enter the palace a few days ago, but you ignored it. Why have you come to see me today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu replied, \u201cA few days ago, you requested for my visit for matters relating to the court. I have told His Majesty back then that I will not interfere with court matters of the Tang Empire. That was why I refused to enter the palace to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu furrowed her brows slightly and asked, \u201cThen why are you willing to come and see me tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu said, \u201cBecause this is no longer just a matter of the court. It concerns the safety of the Tang Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cSecond Uncle Chao, what is it? Please just speak plainly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to request for two imperial edicts.\u201d Chao Xiaoshu said.</p><br/><p>Li Yu was rather surprised. \u201cImperial edicts? What are you going to do?\u201d She asked.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu said, \u201cOne of the imperial edicts should be for the Fish-dragon Gang. If Chang\u2019an were to be thrown into chaos by the Taoists of West-Hill Divine Palace, they will help His Majesty to suppress it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu watched him silently, as if wanting to see if there were any hidden meanings in his words. She said, \u201cChang\u2019an will not be thrown into chaos, so I don\u2019t think that this edict would be necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu looked at her and said, \u201cYour Highness, do you really have faith that Chang\u2019an will not be thrown into chaos?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu answered, \u201cIn Chang\u2019an, there\u2019s the Chang\u2019an Local Government, the Bodyguard office, the Valiant Cavalry Battalion and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu interrupted her, \u201cThe second imperial edict that I\u2019m requesting for has something to do with the Valiant Cavalry Battalion. I would like His Majesty or Your Highness to give me temporary control over the Valiant Cavalry Battalion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s eyebrows knotted even more. She could not understand the request. She said, \u201cI have already promised that Chang\u2019an will not be thrown into chaos. No matter how annoying those officials loyal to the Empress are, I will not act against them before we solve the attack against us. What do you want the Valiant Cavalry Battalion for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to take them away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you leaving Chang\u2019an?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu looked at her and said, \u201cWe both know that all of the Tang\u2019s military power right now is used up against the Golden Palace and the West-Hill Divine Palace\u2019s northern expeditionary troops. We still have to leave some troops to guard against the Yuelun Kingdom. Now that the Northeast Border Military has gone down, the imperial court cannot find any other troops to defend against those coming from the Yan Kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu shook her head and said, \u201cThere are still Garrison Troops from the Gushan Commandery and various states.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu said, \u201cThe Garrison Troops move slowly and cannot keep up with the speed of the grassland cavalry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cThe grassland cavalry in the Eastern Wilderness do not pose much danger. Even if they enter the empire borders, they cannot affect the war overall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the citizens in the eastern Tang will be killed, looted or burned to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu looked at her and said, \u201cI know what you are thinking about.\u201d \u201cIf we allow the grassland cavalry to invade, and as long as they continue to rob, kill and grow corrupt, then the slower they will move. Just like greedy bears, they will get too tired to even have the desire to eat in the end. As such, they would not be able to threaten the prosperity of Chang\u2019an and the Tang Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu retorted coldly, \u201cIsn\u2019t that what we expect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe loss of some elderly, women and children, ordinary people, the burning of villages in the fields and the destruction of small towns can save an army and might bring a millennium of peace to the Tang Empire\u2026You are right if we look at it this way. In fact, it might even be a wise decision and a calm response.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Chao Xiaoshu said, \u201cBut there is not only just Chang\u2019an City in the Tang Empire. Those old, weak, women and children, ordinary farmers are also Tangs; those villages in the fields and the run down small towns are also part of the Tang Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cSo\u2026 you want to take the Valiant Cavalry Battalion to the east?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu replied, \u201cYes. If the late Emperor were still alive, he would have done so long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cYou would do this even though you know that the Valiant Cavalry Battalion cannot change the situation in the east at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu said, \u201cWe must at least let the people on that land know that the Tang Empire has not forgotten them.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long silence, Li Yu said, \u201cI will not give you the first edict.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu replied, \u201cThank you, Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Li Yu was meeting everyone in the imperial study, her younger brother, Li Huiyuan was talking to those in his own palace. However, the conversation was not pleasant.</p><br/><p>He Mingchi glanced at the dark night outside the palace and turned around to look at Li Huiyuan who was livid. He said, \u201cChao Xiaoshu is in the imperial study, but I don\u2019t know what he and Her Highness are talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Huiyuan waved his arm around anxiously, screaming, \u201cRoyal Sister will deal with those things. Why would you care about that? I\u2019m asking you if there\u2019s anyway to contact those from the West-Hill Divine Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Mingchi bowed slightly and replied, \u201cYour Majesty, even if we can contact the West-Hill Divine Palace, we cannot make them change their minds. You have to know that the Divine Hall has already issued the rescript and both parties have already fallen out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Huiyuan paused when he heard that, his expression turning ugly and his right hand trembled incessantly. He wanted to pick up the teacup on the table and drink from it, but almost knocked it to the ground instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly think of a way.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cIf we cannot contact the West-Hill Divine Palace, then quickly think of a way to contact General Xu Shi. Tell him that the West-Hill Divine Palace is on the way to attack him.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Mingchi was slightly startled when he heard that. \u201cYour Majesty\u2026do you wish for everyone to find out about this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Huiyuan looked up slowly and glared at him viciously. He said coldly, \u201cEven if the military finds out that I have once tried to ally with our enemies and tried to kill the Defender-general of the State, I have to change the tides of this situation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had thought it was just Long Qing with the grassland cavalry harassing the borders. But I had not expected it to turn out into a war! I have to protect the Tang Empire and the general. Go do it immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu left the Imperial Palace.</p><br/><p>He did not take an imperial edict with him. Instead, he received a letter written by Li Yu.</p><br/><p>Li Yu was now governing the country. With the letter, and coupled with the fact that he was friends with the commander of the Valiant Cavalry Battalion, he was confident that he could take the battalion out of Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>After his return to the second street of Spring Breeze Pavilion, the Chao Mansion set up a banquet and invited actors to perform.</p><br/><p>At a time when the Tang Empire was on the verge of collapse, such an action was rather infuriating.</p><br/><p>However, no matter the guests who attended the banquet, Linzi who hugged the crying child silently, or the old master Chao who held his crutch calmly, not one raised any objections.</p><br/><p>This was a farewell banquet, a banquet to send off someone.</p><br/><p>Supervisor Song left the palace.</p><br/><p>According to Li Yu\u2019s wishes, he first went to the Qinghe Guild Hall and met with the disciples of the Qinghe County warlords and had a long talk with Old Master Cui\u2019s second son.</p><br/><p>Then, he brought Second Young Master Cui back to his manor, held a banquet and invited more than ten singers to add on to the festivities.</p><br/><p>After the banquet ended, Supervisor Song drank himself unconscious.</p><br/><p>The censor\u2019s wife looked at him in distress. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s bad to drink too much. Furthermore, you are the censor and you shouldn\u2019t do something like this at this time. You might be attacked for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Supervisor Song opened his eyes and looked at the curtains on the top of the bed. After a long silence, he suddenly smiled and said, \u201cThere are many types of banquets. There are banquets for farewell and sending people off. The banquet tonight was for the palace to see. I want the palace to think that we are drinking in remembrance of our old friends in our hometown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould the imperial court trust us from Qinghe County completely? There are secret guards following me, the Second Young Master Cui and all the other disciples of warlords from the Qinghe Guild Hall all year round.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo we will all die in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wine tonight was to allow us to boost our courage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut for the sake of a thousand generations, even the wine of death must be consumed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Darkness enshrouded the Xiao Mountain.</p><br/><p>There was a military camp at the foot of Xiao Mountain made up of more than ten military tents. There were not many people there.</p><br/><p>Painful coughs came out of one of the tents.</p><br/><p>Xu Shi was already very old. The wrinkles on his face and his worsening lung ailment proved this. However, he would not allow himself to collapse, especially at a time like this.</p><br/><p>He was the Tang Empire Defender-general of the State and led the Tang military. He was trusted and loved by the Emperor. He had been stationed in the Southern Army for the past few years as the humid air in the south was better for his health.</p><br/><p>The Xiaoshan mountain was a few hundred miles from the Southern Army. However, it was closer to the north and his lung ailment acted up again. The old general\u2019s chest was like a broken drum, and everyone in the camp could feel his pain.</p><br/><p>In the battle for the throne, the most powerful general Xu Shi had remained silent. Because of their wariness against the Academy, many people, including the Li siblings were all suspicious that he secretly supported the Empress. However, the facts had proven that he did not support anyone else but the late Emperor.</p><br/><p>When the Emperor died, he supported His Majesty\u2019s edict, so he now supported Li Yu and her brother. However, when the imperial edict calling him back to the capital did not reach the Southern Army, he began to feel that something was wrong with the matter.</p><br/><p>He brought more than a hundred soldiers and left the Southern Army, entering the forests and headed for Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>In the night, beneath the Xiao Mountain.</p><br/><p>Wang Jinglue once again questioned the general\u2019s decision. Xu Shi glared at him and rapped out, \u201cWhen the general is away, he can choose to follow the Emperor\u2019s order selectively. What\u2019s more, the Emperor has gone missing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Later on, when Wang Jinglue thought back to this, he sighed with regret. When one grew old, they would tend to become like children and act rashly. General Xu Shi was in a hurry to return to Chang\u2019an because he was worried about the country. But when he thought about it deeper, perhaps he was just eager to see His Majesty for one last time.</p>\n</div>"}

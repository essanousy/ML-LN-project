There are verdant hills, thick trees and cool winds. If I stay there in summer, I'll feel much cooler and don't need to listen to the ministers' quarrel in the imperial hall. Thus no one will bother me every day, and I'll be a lot easier.\"</p><br/><p>After the meal, the Emperor took Ning Que to walk around the palace, the so-called digestion but in fact chatting. Just now, the sky started to become dark and Chang'an City's lights were lit early. So one could see a lot of sceneries by looking out.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stood next to his Majesty and watched his hansome side face, thinking why he would share the feelings. \"Was it really so difficult for the Emperor to find a talker in the deep palace?\" Before Ning Que tried carefully to analyze the problems hidden in this treatment, he remembered the hot weather last year in Chang'an and felt a strong sense of compassion. So Ning Que respectfully said, \"His Majesty might as well get out of the city as soon as possible this year.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor folded the sleeves behind the back and looked at the night imperial city to say with a sign. \"In early years, when the Empress has said she wanted to move to the Daming Palace, the ministers cried and ran into tears to persuade with the rules of ancestors, for they dare not urge me for delaying the management. Although I'm the Tang Emperor, I can't be free to pick a dwelling place. Even if no one has ever dared to be against my will these years, I have to move until the mid-summer so as to close the old guy's mouths.\"</p><br/><p>After listening to the words of his Majesty, especially the obvious grudges, Ning Que could not help laughing secretly.</p><br/><p>The Emperor suddenly turned around and interestedly looked at him to say, \"This year, I and the Empress will move to the Daming Palace. Why don't you come with us to live there for several days? Yu Er always thinks it's lonely and boring outside the city, but in fact the scenery is extremely beautiful.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que's smile on his face disappeared very fast, for he felt a bit awkward when listening to these words. It was unlike a emperor who invited the favored administer to the palace for a rest. The casua tone resembled that of the rural old farmer, who suddenly saw a young relative from the county town and then kindly invited the man to eat some fruits in his own farmhouse, speaking highly of his own sweet well water.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was very clear what it meant when the Emperor invited him to the Daming Palace for spending the summer, .</p><br/><p>Where there was an emperor, there was a royal palace. Where there was a royal palace, there was a writing administer. Such an administer near to the Emperor had a high statue and was respected by the people. Although not involved in the imperial affairs, he had a great influence on them. Although with the littile salary, he could earn countless silver by writing some calligraphies and poems. If in the past, Ning Que, of course, was willing to be such a writing administer. But now he was no longer the lad soldier of the border town. In addition to silver and prospect, he has seen that enigmatic world. Therefore, he was no longer willing to be an administer.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks for his Majesty's appreciation, but as a student I'm ashamed to accept this. It should be a wonderful thing to get his Majesty's guidance on calligraphy day and night... \"</p><br/><p>Ning Que respectfully greeted a bow with hands folded in front and peeped at his Majesty's face. He said, \"To be honest, who don't want to be outstanding and glorify the family name? But I as a student have just entered the Second floor and haven't seen the headmaster. It's really inconvenient... \"</p><br/><p>\"I just talk about it at will. Why are you so serious?\" His Majesty said with a slight smile, \"There are many unrealistic words in what you said, and I don't want to correct them one by one. But as for the matter of being outstanding... why doesn't Chao Xiaoshu want it?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not know how to answer and had no choice but to keep silence.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the Emperor looked at him and asked, \"Do you know where Brother Chao is?\"</p><br/><p>\"As for the big brother Chao, I really don't know.\" Ning Que answered.</p><br/><p>The Emperor came to the bar, touching the cold stone bar with his slender palm and looking at the palace with the night scenery. After being silent for a moment, he softly lamented. \"There was a school of royal court poems, such as red leaves, court wall and palace maids. However, in this imperial palce, not only the palace maids or concubines but also I am locked here. Now I recall the moments when I as a crown prince often went to Chang'an City and went straight into the Spring Breeze Pavilion with Chen and the other for drinking or fighting with Chao Xiaoshu. What a pity! Those moments are really lost in past.\"</p><br/><p>Listening to his Majesty who comtemplated the present and recalled the past with emotion. Ning Que felt bitter in the mouth for a while, thinking why the honorable Emperpr told the secrets to him. He just wrote a section and met the Emperor for the first time today. How could he be qualified to bear such trust?</p><br/><p>As if being aware of Ning Que's doubt, the Emperor turned the head and looked at him faintly laughing. \"I chose Chao Xiaoshu. Chao Xiaoshu chose you. There was the name of Spring Breeze Pavilion for my valuing Chao Xiaoshu. You followed him to Spring Breeze Pavilion to kill overnight for Chao Xiaoshu's valuing you. So later you were sent by him to the secret guard and entered my imperial study to leave that calligraphy there. Until then did I know who you are. It seems to be complicated but in fact shows one thing.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew that he could no longer be silent at this time. He had to behave himself well, so he quickly asked, \"What kind of thing?\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor smiled and said, \"It shows that there is fate between me and you, just as between me and Xiaoshu.\"</p><br/><p>\"The word fate is really good.\" Ning Que joyfully thought in the heart. \"His Majesty thinks he has the monarch-minister fate with me. Then in this secular world, I'll have a talisman, or even free from death. In the future, I'm afraid a lot of things will be much easier.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor looked at him and said with an invisible smile, \"Since there is a fate between me and you, you should stop being so stingy and take more written calligraphies in the shop to the palace for me. You can regard this as I borrow them from you.\"</p><br/><p>\"The word fate is not good.\" Ning Que painfully thought in the heart. \"It's the so-called mysterious imperial palace. Once the sections, equal with notes, enters the imperial study, there's no way to see them again. As for borrowing, it is even more ridiculous. If the Tang Emperor borrows a few things from one, how dare one go to ask them back?\"</p><br/><p>At this time in this place, Ning Que could no longer refuse his Majesty's request of borrowing sections for a view. As the Emperor of Tang Empire, he had the qualification and power to be unreasonable. But today his Majesty has invited Ning Que to eat and talked heart to heart not only the exhortation but also friendship and fate. Therefore, Ning Que had to lend them.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked up and resolutely said, \"Tomorrow I'll send the works of these years to the palace for his Majesty's guidance.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor was full of comfort, gently stroking the long beard under the jaw, and then watched the lad in front to nod slightly. He secretly thought that this lad has not yet been a full idiot.</p><br/><p>Ning Que's determination on the face quickly became sadness and frustration at the next moment. He looked at the Emperor and bitterly said, \"His Majesty was actually waiting for me here.\"</p><br/><p>\"The Tang law values discipline first. Even if I'm the Emperor, I can never grab and keep the people's stuffs.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor smiled proudly, looking at Ning Que's painful look. He said with a comfort, \"Naturally I'm not a freeloader.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que became excited after hearing this and thought that the Emperor would not be too stingy even if it was the cost price, or the price under friendship and monarch-administer fate.</p><br/><p>The Emperor pondered and said, \"Compared with your beautiful ink words, taking gold and silver as a return seemed to be too vulgar.\"</p><br/><p>In the opinion of Ning Que, the most elegant thing in this world was silver. As for gold, it could be classified as sacred stuff. At this moment, Ning Que felt so disappointed after hearing that his majesty despised the vulgar gold and silver. But all he could do was to control himself not to comment it and continue to listen patiently. He secretly thought that if the Emperor did not give silver, some things like treature, silk or makeup powder were also fine. Although he did not need them, Sangsang absolutely liked those. He could even send the remaining to the girls in House of Red Sleeves.</p><br/><p>At this time, the Emperor naturally did not think of this lad's bad idea that Ning Que actually prepared to send the gift given by him to the brothel girls for decoration. After a moment of thinking, the Emperor suddenly thought of a matter and said with the shining eyes, \"Master Yan Se has taken you as a disciple, saying that you have the potential of Divine Talisman Master. There is exactly one thing suitable fot you in the palace.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que curiously asked, \"His Majesty, what is that?\"</p><br/><p>\"I can't show it to you now. Even if you see it now, you won't understand it.\" The Emperor looked at him and smiled to say, \"When Master Yan Se reports that you really enter the Fu path, I'll give it to you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que slightly frowned and thought of the gift that was even related with his own cultivation. Since his Majesty refused to speak, Ning Que had to thank the kindness for the gift that he did not even get or know about.</p><br/><p>Seeing the darkness in the sky, he remembered something that he had thought of before entering the palace. So he respectfully reported. \"His Majesty, I as a student have now entered the Second floor of the Academy. Should I quit the job of secret guard?\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor slightly startled and shook his head as an opposition. Then the Emperor looked at his eyes and said, \"I have seen the files presented by the Military Ministry. You have performed extremely well in the Wilderness of the frontier fortress, even beyond my imagination. You're loyal to the Tang Empire, kind to the comrades, good at resolution and capable of killing. I just need such a secret guard like you.\"</p><br/><p>\"But in the Academy, I really don't know what to investigate.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que seemed to casually ask this question. But in fact, Ning Que was trying to find the answer to his one-year puzzle from his Majesty's reply. Whether did the imperial court have the doubt about the Academy? Was he an undercover inserted in the Academy?</p><br/><p>The Emperor looked at him and unhappily exclaimed. \"Idiot! The Academy is the foundation of my empire. How can I be so confused to shake the foundation? Who lets you investigate the Academy? I want you to be aware of those cultivators!\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que quickly pretended to be a loyal administer and showed his approval. In fact, he still did not understand how he could keep watch over other cultivators when he studied in the Academy and only kept contact with those cultivation students. As for the Emperor who reprimanded him as an idiot, Ning Que was even unhappier, for he called others as idiots in the daily life... But this was the Emperor. So he had to let it go.</p><br/><p>The Emperor said slightly happily, \"In the future, you follow the Headmaster of Academy to learn in the Second floor. It is a great opportunity. You must grasp it and work hard. Compared with your study, these things I delivered to you can be finished later.\"</p><br/><p>After a pause, the Emperor looked at him and said with a solemn expression, \"The future of the Tang Empire depends on young people like you. You were a glorious soldier at the frontier fortress and now the most trusted secret guard, and a student of Headmaster of Academy. So the Tang Empire won't let you down, and you can't embarrass the Tangs. Understand?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que heard of the Emperor's trust and respect in the words and felt a little stern. He replied, \"Yes, I do understand.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor looked back at the palace outside the bar, which was like a star and a light candle, and said indifferently, \"In a short period of time, I'll not give you the governmental position in the imperial court. Because the whole world now knows that I appreciate your section.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not understand what kind of logic was in the words.</p><br/><p>\"If you are promoted, even for your other ability, the courtiers will think I do it for your section and let you be. But when it comes to the imperial affairs, they will regard calligraphy as meaningless. Although I don't care how the courtiers and people think of me, I do care about how the historians would write about me. So I won't give you a high official position or live in my favorite Daming Palace.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor turned to look at him and said, \"Because I don't want to become a foolish emperor in the history book.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que greeted a bow with hands folded behind and sincerely said, \"His Majesty is an eternally wise emperor.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor smiled and joked. \"This is an eternal flattery.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que laughed and did not feel embarrassed.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>By walking around the palace for a circle, the Emperor has finished expressing the feelings and robbing the section. When Ning Que was about to leave, his Majesty specifically asked the favorite daughter to send him to outside the court, which made Ning Que feel glorified a lot.</p><br/><p>There were two long shadow on the stone shone by the place lantern. Ning Que walking behind could not help laughing. Lee Yu heard his laughter and confusedly looked back, seeing his expression and the shadows on the ground. She guessed what he was laughing at and could not help furrowing the brows. Then she said with a low voice, \"This is in the palace, not Northern Mountain Road. Behave yourself.\"</p><br/><p>In the face of Lee Yu, Ning Que did not have any psychological pressure at all. He laughed and said, \"Her Highness, what are you talking about?\"</p><br/><p>They walked to outside of the court and stood on the stone stairs. Then they stopped.</p><br/><p>Lee Yu looked at him with an invisible smile, with a much more beautiful face shone by the palace lanterns.</p><br/><p>\"What else do you hide from me?\"</p><br/><p>\"A lot.\" Ning Que glanced at her with a smile and said, \"What do you want to know?\"</p><br/><p>Lee Yu thoughtfully said, \"All of them.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que nearly said that she was born a beauty. But he looked at the palace maids and palace mammies around and reacted in time to stop saying those ridiculed words. Instead, he respectfully said, \"It would be a very long story. I'm afraid Her Highness can't wait for so long.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que pretended to show the respectfulness, but in fact still had the tone of usual randomness. And this usual randomness was frivolous and rude for the Princess of the Tang Empire. Those palace maids and palace mammies on the stone steps have lived in the palace for a long time, experienced in obseving speeches and behaviors. So they heard Ning Que's unrespectfulness and suddenly became very unnatural.</p><br/><p>In the daily life, those palace mammies would certainly scold Ning Que. However, they today have seen the attitude of his Majesty towards Ning Que and noticed that Her Highness were not disobedient. So they thought they had some deviations on thinking and then turned the heads so as to not listen to the dialogue by being away from Her Highness. They even made those palace maids lower the heads with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>Lee Yu walked down the stone stairs and approached Ning Que. She smiled and said, \"Speaking of time, if you have time a few days later, you can come to my mansion. This year, I've always heard Sangsang talked about your stories. So I want to hear how you'll tell your own stories.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew there was a strange affection between Sangsang and the Princess, which was beyond the class and the age. But he firmly believed that Sangsang absolutely would not talk about the his mission and secrets with outsiders. Lee Yu's remark was nothing more than a trial and a test. Ning Que said with a modest smile, \"Her Highness should be clear that I'll be very busy from now on. So it's hard to fix the exact visiting time.\"</p><br/><p>Lee Yu furrowed the brows and said, \"Even I have the time, you don't?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que quietly looked at her and suddenly softly asked, \"Her Highness is trying to recruit me again?\"</p><br/><p>Even if Ning Que guessed it right, she looked calm as usual and said with a smile, \"Is it not a natural thing?\"</p><br/><p>After hearing her natural approval, Ning Que startled instead and said a moment of silence later, \"Now the price is different.\"</p><br/><p>Lee Yu smiled and shook her head to say, \"Last time, I regreted not to see your true potential and underestimated your confidence. But this time I think it should be different. Maybe I'll offer a price you can't refuse.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at her beautiful face and said, \"There are few things in the world I can't refuse. But Her Highness, you're truly one of them.\"</p><br/><p>Lee Yu slightly startled, with a slight anger appearing in her eyes and a touch of blush on her cheek. Ning Que's pun could be said to be rude and shameless, or respectful and flattery. She felt shameful but did not know how to deal with him.</p><br/><p>A moment later, she looked at Ning Que with faint sarcastic and said with a smile, \"You're really pretty.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly turned away, secretly regretting not using this sentence previously. As a result, she stole this sentence for her use.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Outside the court, it was young eunuch Lu Ji who waited to take Ning Que out of the palace.</p><br/><p>Walking along the Imperial Garden for a long time, they finally saw the imperial city gate in the darkness. The wobbly palace lanterns have been far away from the eunuchs and palace maids passing through the palaces. Lu Ji, who has lowered the head and led the way ahead, slowed down his footsteps and kept the voiced down to say \"Thank you\".</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew what Lu Ji thanked for, so he shook his head with a smile and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Outside the Imperial City, it was the court bodyguard Deputy Commander Xu Chongshan who was responsible for guarding the night palace.</p><br/><p>After a harsh or even kind of perverted long examination, Ning Que was finally taken to the duty room next to the imperial city gate. He rewore the shoes and the belt and later looked at Deputy Commander Xu. Then he said with a bitter smile, \"Why you waited for me here?\"</p><br/><p>There were only two of them in the room.</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan looked fully helpless and looked at Ning Que to seriously greet a bow and gratefully said, \"I've worried about it the whole day. After all, I still have to express my gratitude to you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at him and shook the head to say, \"Lu Ji took me out of the palace and you are here for the night duty. His Majesty certainly knows this thing. I even think whether his Majesty specially left us some time for a united stance.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan said with deep regret, \"It's too late now. Even if his Majesty has guessed something, I still have to shut my mouth.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the nominal boss and said with a comfort, \"Guessing is different from knowing after all.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan came over with two rough short legs and looked at Ning Que. Then he seriously said, \"If this time I really lost his Majesty's favor, I'll follow you from now on. My legs are too short to run fast, so you must wait for me.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que has told a pun when talking with Lee Yu and then heard another pun at the Imperial City gate. The palace bodyguard Deputy Commander's position and attitude directly surprised Ning Que who kept waving the hand and said, \"Your Grace, please don't say so. My waist and legs are good but not so strong.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan pretended to be displeased and said, \"You have a thin waist but a fat thigh. Don't be so humble.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que heard this weird flattery with a serious accent of Hebei Province and could not help shuddering. So he quickly changed the topic and lowered the voice to ask, \"Your Grace, is it easy to expose our secret guard identity? Before entering the palace, Eunuch Lin has pointed out my identity.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan explained. \"Eunuch Lin is the server of his Majesty and of course knows the list of secret guards. Except for few people in the palace, no one knows your identity, including Her Majesty.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que remembered that previously in front of the Empress, his Majesty really has not talked about secret guards with him. So Ning Que started to be at ease.</p><br/><p>Suddenly he thought of one thing and asked earnestly, \"How about... Her Highness?\"</p><br/><p>Xu Chongshan looked a little embarrassed and thoughtfully said, \"Guessing is different from knowing. Didn't you say these words before?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Nice to meet you, my emperor brother.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sit down please.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor waved his hands at will, indicating the Prince Li Peiyan to sit down, and then put down the papers at hand. Suddenly, he thought of one thing and asked, \"Last time I let someone deliver the two barrels of double-distilled wine to your mansion. Did you drink it? Do you like it?\"</p><br/><p>Li Peiyan frowned and honestly said, \"That wine is too scorching.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor said unhappily, \"If it isn't scorching, why drink it? Since childhood, you had a poor body but was still spoiled by mother. So your body continued to be so weak.\"</p><br/><p>Li Peiyan laughed twice and said, \"Anyway, I have the emperor brother to cover me. I am fine with being weak.\"</p><br/><p>After finishing this sentence, he became serious and stood up from the chair, beginning to enter the monarchy-administer time period. He reported, \"West-Hill mission team is ready to leave and Long Qing is also about to leave Chang'an. I urge his Majesty to leave this person in Chang'an.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor said casually, \"The previous agreement was for the young man to enter the Second floor. Since he had no ability to enter, I'm not to blame. And the agreement is also invalid, so let him go as he wants.\"</p><br/><p>Li Peiyan felt a little surprised listening to those words and anxiously said, \"My emperor brother, he's the hostage of Yan Kingdom. How can we let him leave?\"</p><br/><p>\"The Tang Empire is famous in the world for its cavalry warriors and the spirit of not surrendering, not for some hostages who hang out in Chang'an's brothels every day.\" The Emperor said with a slight ridicule, \"In those years, the Yan Emperor sent his crown prince to Chang'an, not for my sake but for his own benefits. If I did't accept his son, wouldn't he be afraid every night that my cavalries might break into Capital Cheng at any time and entered his palace? In order to let that old guy sleep better and live a few days more, I had to accept it.\"</p><br/><p>\"You have to understand that it's these emperors of Yan Kingdom and South Jin Kingdom who urgerly sent hostages to Chang'an City, not I want them to come. My Tang Empire even has to spend money and food on those damned crown princes.\"</p><br/><p>The Emperor waved his hand and said, \"Let Prince Long Qing go as he wishes. Chang'an City doesn't raise useless men.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Ning Que got off the horse carriage in the alley of Lin 47th Street and quietly slipped to the narrow lane of back courtyard. He spoke out the cipher at a distance from</p><br/><p> the wall. Then the back door of Old Brush Pen Shop was pushed open with a squeak. Ning Que dodged in with the fastest speed.</p><br/><p>Ning Que took over a hot towel to wash his face and put the feet in a hot water basin with proper temperature. He felt so comfortable as to utter a groan, with the tiredness from yesterday to today swept away. The tightened spirit for a long time has finally soothed down.</p><br/><p>During the whole day, he climb</p><br/><p>ed the Academy's back mountain, defeated Prince Long Qing to get the qualification of entering the Second floor, and changed from a forgotten Academy student to a genius who the Academy and South School of Haotian Taoism asked for. Afterwards, it was discovered that he was the owner of the calligraphy section. So he entered the royal palace, had a meal with his Majesty, and chatted with the imperial family...</p><br/><p>Shock after shock, a wave was followed by another wave. They all happened witihin one day, which was really hard to imagine and might also be very difficult for someone to copy in the future. In the outsiders' eyes, it was already dizzying enough, let alone Ning Que himself. When Ning Que finally lay on the familiar bed, he still felt somewhat absentminded</p><br/><p> and unreal.</p><br/><p>Sangsang added half a scoop of hot water to his foot-washing basin and squatted on the floor to look up at him. She curiously asked, \"Young master, what does the Emperor look like? With a long and white beard?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's Santa Claus who has a long and white beard, not the Emperor.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que reclined on the bedclothes and pointed the aching thigh with his fingers, indicating Sangsang to massage a few times. He said, \"His Majesty, ah, in fact, is not too old. I really do not know what kind of person he is?\"</p><br/><p>This was a very honest remark. For the Emperor of the Tang Empire, Ning Que has always felt somewhat complicated in the past few years. From that natural disaster to the many details of the City of Wei stronghold, he could feel the Emperor nowadays was a legendary wise monarch. However, whenever he thought of the bloodshed in General's Mansion and those murders who were still sitting in the imperial court, he had to put a question mark for the wise monarch in the heart.</p><br/><p>From the frontier fortress back to Chang'an City, he began to chase down the murderers who participated in the case of General's Mansion that year. During this process, he found out that the Emperor did not look into this matter but secretly did many things these years, such as demotiong them and keeping at a distance with them. Although this lack of justification is far from sufficient, Ning must have admitted that for a country that has been forgotten by the world for so long and without any evidence of conviction and any necessary refutation, Your Majesty the Emperor has done enough.</p><br/><p>As for the culprits in the case of General's Mansion, the Prince Li Peiyan and General Xia Hou... one was the younger brother of the Emperor. The other was the mainstay of the Tang Empire. They were still enjoying the fame and fortune. However, Ning Que could understand it.</p><br/><p>Ning Que silently said in the heart, \"His Majesty, if you can't deal with your own younger brother, then let me do it for you.\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang sat on the bed, waving a small fist rhythmically to beat his thigh and looking at his face. She could not help feeling curious and asked, \"Does Her Majesty look beautiful? Her Highness seems to dislike her. But last time when I was in the House of Red Sleeves, I heard Xiaocao said that Her Majesty was the best-looking woman in the world, so his Majesty only liked her these years.\"</p><br/><p>Feeling the percussion of her small fist, Ning Que comfortably narrowed his eyes and said. \"You should spend less time with Xiaocao, for you can't learn any skills from her but only talking about the imperial harem like a gossip woman.\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang said: \"I'm just curious.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que suddenly thought of one thing. So he opened the eyes and said with a sigh, \"There's nothing special with Her Majesty. It's also hard to summarize his Majesty. But at least I know he is truly a master on business.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The master and the maidservant stared at the silver box on the bed, or accurately the paper in the box, and showed the same distressed look. After a long time of silence, Sangsang looked up and a little unwillingly asked, \"Send all of them to the palace?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered with a husky voice, \" Of course not, two thirds at most. No... just a half. \"</p><br/><p>Sangsang began to pick up some sections from inside the box. And she was very slow and unwilling, with a distressed expression on her face. Ning Que also felt very distressed and said with regret and lament, \"If I had known one day a piece of paper I randomly wrote would be equal to a silver note, how could I throw so much and burn so much? Even if I wrote it badlly, even with a lot of ink, a section still could be equal to half of a note. In this way, didn't we throw away a number of notes these years?\"</p><br/><p>Listening to these words, Sangsang's eyes suddenly became bright. She jumped out of the bed unusually quickly and rudely dragged Ning Que off the bed, lifting up the mattress to reach her hands in for a long time. Then she took out a small box and opened it on the table. She took out the paper inside and later exclaimed. \"Young master, I picked up a lot of sheets of paper that you had thrown in the past. Can you exchange these for money?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que felt a little startled, subconsciously picking up a piece of paper on the top for a look, and then found that it was the mourning section he had written on the night when Zhuo Er had died. He was shocked and asked, \" I have already thrown this section. When did you pick it back?\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang smiled and no longer spoke.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was shocked and speechless. After a long time, he came to himself and extended his both hands to hold Sangsang's little black face. He affectionately said, \"Sangsang, how can I live without you?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, his stomach suddenly growled.</p><br/><p>Ning Que took back his hands to rub the belly and took a look at the night scenery outside the window. He said, \" It takes a long time for dawn?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, young master.\" Sangsang asked in curiosity, \"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que seriously said, \"At this time I miss the hot and sour noodle slice soup very much.\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang puzzled and asked, \"I heard there was at least a hundred dishes on an imperial banquet. Young master, were you not full?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said with a ridicule, \"Those innocent people didn't know the Royal Palace. Although there were all kinds of delicious food on the banquet, they still focused in delicacy and elegance. How could they serve the food like moving a mountain? I've now had the imperial feast. In the future you should not say that kind of words outside, lest people would mock our short vision after hearing that.\"</p><br/><p>Sangsang agreed and continued to ask quietly, \"The royal feast must be good.

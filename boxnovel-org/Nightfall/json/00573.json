Knowing Sangsang could be cured indeed cheered him up, but he always felt that something would happen. It might be the three games of chess on Wa Mountain, especially what they saw in the illusion of the chessboard.</p><br/><p>What alarmed him most was the Buddhist carriage. He didn\u2019t understand why the bigwig from the Xuankong Temple came to the Wa mountain. After all, it was an Unknown Place to the outside world.</p><br/><p>The cultivators who came to the Yue Laan Hungry Ghost Festival didn\u2019t leave last night. Quni Madi and the president of Commandment Yard at the Xuankong Temple stayed at the Lanke Temple.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had decided they must keep away from the cultivators, especially the bigwig from the Xuankong Temple before Sangsang was cured. His dangerous chilhood hunting experiences at Min Mountain had brought him an instinctive habit. If you could not locate the danger in the forest, you\u2019d better stay away from it.</p><br/><p>There were footsteps outside the Buddhist room.</p><br/><p>Ning Que glanced at the sleeping Sangsang, then quietly got up, dressed, and walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>The morning light was shining. The old temple was exceptionally beautiful in the autumn fog.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan stood beside the stone balusters in a thick cotton coat. He was still shaking because of the coldness. Looking at the temples and towers, he said, \u201cNothing has changed for decades.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had lived in seclusion at Wa mountain for half his life. He did not leave the mountain since the Lotus\u2019 bloody conspiracy decades ago. Now, looking at the familiar yet strange temple, he sighed with emotion.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stood beside the master and said while looking at the looming front hall, \u201cYesterday, Sangsang spent at least decades in the chessboard. She told me nothing, but I know it must be very painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cShe is not a normal girl, so she wasn\u2019t in as much pain as you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cDid Buddha really leave the chessboard in the world? What does our experience in the chessboard mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said, \u201cIt was indeed the Buddha\u2019s relic. As for the world in the chessboard, you can see it as an illusion created by the Buddha\u2019s supreme power, or a possible future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the master\u2019s reply, Ning Que fell into a long silence, and then asked, \u201cIs that the future of me and Sangsang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan looked into the distance in the fog and said, \u201cThe future one can see is no longer the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIs it possible to change the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan looked at Ning Que\u2019s eyes and said kindly, \u201cSince it is a possible future, it\u2019s not settled. Why can\u2019t we change it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que seemed to realize something and continued, \u201cThey say you can see the future. Is that because of the chessboard which gives you the power to help people avoid misfortune and answer their doubts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan laughed and said, \u201cThe Buddha may be able to see the future. How can I, a mortal, see it? And even if you could, when you see the future, the future will be influenced by your gazing. How can it be the same future as before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cIt sounds complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan did not make any further explanations and continued, \u201cSo, if someone wants to see the future like what Li Qingshan, the Nation Master of Tang Empire, the Great Divine Priest of Revelation and I have done, he can only secretly take a look at the chaotic future from a distance in fear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it is only then that we mortals won\u2019t influence the world of chaos, but be swallowed up by the chaotic future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said with emotion, \u201cBut if we try to see the future more carefully and clearly, the future we see may be false and we will bear a more severe punishment from the heaven. It is said that the Great Divine Priest of Revelation went to Chang\u2019an City last spring and foresaw that Sangsang in the Old Brush Pen Shop would come back to the West-Hill Divine Palace three years later. The Priest almost went blind from looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que became serious. He had only learned what the Priest had to pay to see Sangsang\u2019s future today.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder the Priest agreed to my three-year promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of something and frowned, then he said, \u201cThe future might not be true, but since the Priest had paid a big price for seeing Sangsang\u2019s future, he must have some confidence about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan sighed and said, \u201cFor some reason, I have some doubts about the future he saw, but as you said, I have to believe what he saw. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so confused.\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of future could it be that even the Priest and Master Qishan could not see? Where was Sangsang\u2019s future? What would happen to her?</p><br/><p>Looking at the heavy fog, Ning Que patted the baluster and said, \u201cI still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the future was like peeking at the secret of the heavens. Even bigwigs such as the Great Divine Priest of Revelation, Master Qishan or Li Qingshan could not confirm that they really understood what they had seen, let alone Ning Que.</p><br/><p>But Ning Que did not care. Since the Priest had foreseen that Sangsang would come back to West-Hill three years later, she should have been cured then.</p><br/><p>As long as Sangsang could live, any future was acceptable to him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The temple bell rang.</p><br/><p>After a simple breakfast, the monks at the Lanke Temple started their morning class. Sangsang was a little bit sleepy because her illness. Ning Que took her out of bed and started the class.</p><br/><p>Sangsang studied in the back hall of the temple.</p><br/><p>It was a bit too much for such a magnificent golden hall to be used as one person\u2019s classroom.</p><br/><p>They had the privilege partly because of their special identities. More importantly, their dharma lessons\u2019 teacher was Master Qishan, the ancestor of the Lanke Temple.</p><br/><p>If necessary, one word from Master Qishan could empty the back hall, even the whole temple, and nobody at Lanke Temple would dare to say anything.</p><br/><p>All the monks had been banned from entering the back hall except for some senior monks waiting outside as servants. The hall was very quiet.</p><br/><p>Occasionally, one could hear Master Qishan\u2019s calm and wisdom-filled voice from outside.</p><br/><p>Sangsang did not speak. She listened carefully and studied.</p><br/><p>Under the porch outside the hall, Ning Que was listening to the essence of Buddhism while looking at the scattered autumn fog. He felt very calm.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan did not stop him from attending the class, but Ning Que thought, that he was a disciple from the Academy after all. It was an exception last night inside the cave, but today it was an exclusive Buddhist class for Sangsang; he should not attend it. Besides, he was not interested in the dharma because of Second Brother.</p><br/><p>As time passed slowly, the dharma lesson in the main hall came to an end. Sangsang sat on the futon and tried to meditate with closed eyes. She was thinking about the earlier lessons.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan walked out of the hall.</p><br/><p>It was near noon. Autumn clouds covered the sky and occasionally a few cold spots of rain fell to the ground. It was cold outside the hall. The master was chilled and coughed a few times.</p><br/><p>Ning Que sent the master a cup of hot tea to warm him up.</p><br/><p>Master Qishan took a sip of the tea and put the teacup on the step in front of him. He looked at Ning Que and smiled, \u201cYou treat me better than you treat others. And you\u2019re nicer to me than last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m a realist and even a snob. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The master shook his head with a smile and said, \u201cFrankness sometimes does not necessarily change people\u2019s impression on you, but I believe that before becoming the Headmaster\u2019s disciple, you were already a realist but more cautiously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I entered the Wilderness and found that the token of the Academy\u2019s Second floor could frighten so many people, did I realize I could be less cautious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan nodded and said, \u201cSince you can now rely on the Headmaster, nobody in the world could make you live as gingerly as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cSometimes I ask myself if I am really a snob.\u201d</p><br/><p>The master said, \u201cSometimes a snob is the one who is free and easy. How you succeed won\u2019t affect their opinions on you. Yesterday you took a tough stance, but compared with Mr. Ke, you were as submissive as a rabbit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the second Youngest Uncle, so I think being a snob is more interesting than fighting against the world alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan looked at him and said with a touch of pity, \u201cI know you have suffered so much and even endured the most unbearable things in your childhood; that\u2019s how you became the man I know today. But, since you have entered the Academy, became the Headmaster\u2019s disciple and made friends with other disciples, you should change a little bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a short silence, Ning Que answered, \u201cThe Academy has changed me a lot and I like it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m grateful to the Academy. But the change can be very time-consuming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Qishan said kindly, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to what you will become eventually, though I may not be able to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que was slightly surprised and asked, \u201cThen what is the last thing you want to see in me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The master did not directly answer the question. He sadly looked across the continuous rain to the distant square in front of the Lanke Temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cDecades ago, my younger brother Lotus slaughtered many at Lanke Temple, where he ate people for the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

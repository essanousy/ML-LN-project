After he went to the Academy, Ning Que once asked Chen Pipi to show him what Knowing Destiny State was like. One night, when they had just left the old library, Ning Que was impressed by the beautiful picture he saw: under the starry sky, fish stopped swimming in the lake as if they were stored into an amber or as if they were kites in the sky.</p><br/><p>\"Cultivators that enter this state no longer just understand the flow pattern of Qi of Heaven and Earth from the surface, but grab the essence of the movement pattern of Qi of Heaven and Earth. They are able to understand the connection between Haotian and all living things in the world, and the principle of this world with clarity. People who enter such a state can see the true will of Haotian and understand it.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \"Once you enter the Knowing destiny State, you will become a Grand Cultivator. You can understand the destiny of Haotian, so naturally that even the slightest change of the Qi of Heaven and Earth cannot escape your eyes. Therefore, no matter what your enemies want to do, it will always be within your experience and sense. That is the real scary part of the Knowing destiny State.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the reflection of the willow trees in the lake and pondered over this for a long time. Then he asked, \"But you are only at the lower level of the Seethrough State. Why is it still so difficult for me to fight with you?\"</p><br/><p>\"I have once crossed that threshold and reached the Knowing destiny State.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \"Once you see it, you will never forget it. Even though my state is falling, my sense still stays at the Knowing destiny State. Of course you are not my equal.\"</p><br/><p>The willow branches were dancing in the breeze. They bent down low to the lake and dipped into the lake from time to time, rippling the lake surface and breaking the reflections into pieces.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared at the broken reflection of willow branches and light. He asked in a deep voice, \"So, if I want to defeat a Grand Cultivator at the Knowing destiny State, I have to cross that threshold first?\"</p><br/><p>\"The barriers among the Five States of cultivation are very hard to break, which makes it almost impossible to defeat someone at a state higher than yours. But there is a small chance that it will still happen, if every factor is perfect and you also get some extra help.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyue continued, \"For example, last year in the Wilderness, you shot Long Qing on the snow cliff. And when I was below the Seethrough State, I once defeated an instructor in the Revelation Institute, who was in the middle part of the Seethrough State.\"</p><br/><p>\"But being at the peak state of cultivation, the Knowing destiny State is nothing like the other four states; the gap between them is unreachable. Challenging a Grand Cultivator when you are not in the Knowing destiny State is like a mantis trying to stop a carriage on the road. You are doomed to be crushed.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que watched the bugs chasing the shadow of the willow branches and asked calmly, \"I just want to know if someone has ever succeeded before. Even one example will be enough.\"</p><br/><p>\"If you regard the fights between me and Chen Pipi as examples, then I can tell you that I can cross the barrier between states and defeat him any time. But you know that is an exception.\"</p><br/><p>\"What about other examples?\"</p><br/><p>\"In the classics of the West-Hill Palace, there are no records of a case where a Seethrough cultivator succeeded in challenging a Knowing destiny State cultivator.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked a little disappointed.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at him and said with hesitation, \"Although the classics didn't record it, I have heard the seniors in the Divine Hall talk about Mr. Ke's story. He once left the Academy. It was when he was at the Seethrough State, he defeated a powerhouse at the Knowing destiny State on the way.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que's eyes lit up when he heard the story without having any evidence.</p><br/><p>He clearly knew about the big difference between him and his Youngest Uncle no matter in which aspect. But at least this challenge happened once; no matter how impossible it was, it still made this issue less disappointing than before.</p><br/><p>He turned around and looked at the girl under the tree. \"Do you know how to gauge the strength of cultivators who are at the Peak state of Martial Arts and the powerhouses from the Devil's Doctrine?\"</p><br/><p>\"The concept of Peak state of Martial Arts was originally used in the Devil's Doctrine.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu continued, \"This state is at the same level of the Knowing destiny State, except that they are on two different paths. Knowing destiny State pursues understanding and commanding the world, while the powerhouses of the Devil's Doctrine only want to get infinite power; they only focus on themselves and refuse to communicate with nature. They want to replace Haotian. This principle of cultivation is the most evil, but I have to admit that it is also the most powerful.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que noticed that her expression suddenly became very cold. He asked, \"The Taoists and the followers of the Devil's Doctrine have always been enemies. All the principles from Haotian Taoism, including you and Chen Pipi, hate the Devil's Doctrine the most. Although Chen Pipi and the girl from the Devil's Doctrine are in a relationship, I still don't understand why the Divine Palace would allow Xia Hou, a survivor of the Devil's Doctrine to be not only alive but also enjoying a successful life.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at him. She understood why he would ask such a question and why his tone was so cold and mocking.</p><br/><p>\"The West-Hill Palace guards the world on behalf of Haotian. It requires power, especially when there is such a powerful empire like the Tang empire. And Xia Hou has been one of the most powerful people over the last decade.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said peacefully, \"He is a giant sword; he could split a mountain and divide the sea. Both of the Divine Palace and the Tang empire are keen to control this sword, for which they have been competing for more than several decades. That is why the current situation is so complicated. For the West-Hill Palace, Xia Hou is very useful because he is at the highest position of the Military Ministry in the Tang empire. They will never be willing to give him up.\"</p><br/><p>The strong sunlight shone on Chang'an City. Even while the wind was blowing from Yanming Mountain at the south shore of the lake, the lake was rippling and they were standing in the shadow, it was still hot.</p><br/><p>Near the lake under the willow trees, everything was quiet.</p><br/><p>After some time.</p><br/><p>Ning Que said to Ye Hongyu in a serious voice, \"I need power.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu was silent.</p><br/><p>He looked into her eyes and continued, \"You need time, which is actually power as well.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu replied, \"I don't deny that.\"</p><br/><p>\"Can you help me?\" Said Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at him and said, \"But what will you give me in return? It can't be rental fees anymore.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \"What do you want?\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \"The Haoran Sword.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>She was the marvelous Taoist Addict of the West-Hill Divine Palace, and he was the new student of the Headmaster of the Academy. They could never become real friends based on their different standpoints and backgrounds. Even though they were cultivating together and learning together, they were still thinking about what they would do the day when they become enemies again.</p><br/><p>Under this circumstance, neither of them would expect to get anything really useful from the other. But when Ning Que asked, Ye Hongyu's answer was so quick and precise as if she had been thinking about this question for days and nights.</p><br/><p>Interestingly, Ning Que seemed to be prepared for the current situation. When hearing her requirement, he seemed unsurprised by it. \"What will you give me?\" He asked.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \"You have already seen what I can give you.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que furrowed his brows and thought for a long time. \"Can you make the decision by yourself?\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \"Since he gave it to me, it belongs to me.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \"I am sorry that the thing I can give you belongs to the Academy. I can't make the decision by myself; I need to ask the Headmaster's opinion.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu said, \"As you wish. I don't think I need to remind you to keep our deal secret though, right?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que nodded, then he left Yanming Lake.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The hut at the back of the mountain in the Academy was wall-less. But the wind there was not as hot as that near the lake, thanks to the lush vegetation of the mountain and the Cloud Gate array that stopped the heat, which made the temperature mild and stable no matter the season.</p><br/><p>The Headmaster was sitting on a futon with a book in his left hand. His right hand was copying something.</p><br/><p>Ning Que sat on the futon across the desk.</p><br/><p>He went to the back of the mountain of the Academy and entered the hut. He was ordered by the Headmaster to wait aside. He had been waiting on the futon for a long time; even the history book on the desk had been updated with records of two years.</p><br/><p>He had tried to say something, but the Headmaster didn't pay any attention to him. He was still absorbed in transcribing the book, as if the words of his young student were just like the wind.</p><br/><p>The Headmaster threw the old yellowish book onto the desk and put his brush pen on the ink stone. He rubbed his wrists and stretched himself.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stood up as quickly as he could. He took the towel from the water in the basin, wrung it out and passed it to the Headmaster. Then he changed the remaining tea with a new hot one.</p><br/><p>\"Never be hurried, no matter what you do.\"</p><br/><p>The Headmaster threw the towel away and took the hot cup. He blew at the bubble on the surface and said, \"Just like when you want to drink tea, you cannot do it when it is too hot.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que was thinking about how he could get the thin paper sword hidden in Ye Hongyu's bosom. He ignored what his teacher said, rubbed his hands nervously and said, \"But if you don't drink it when it is hot, it will soon become cold.\"</p><br/><p>The Headmaster turned around and smiled at him, \"Then you could just drink it, why still ask for my advice? You are always the most strong-minded kid at the back of the mountain of the Academy.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que could feel the criticism or even warning in his words, which he could not disobey. His body became stiff and he said bitterly, \"I don't have enough money to buy the tea. The money belongs to the Academy and Master. But the most important thing is, although I am strong-minded, I am authorized to make a decision on such a big issue.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is your mind?\"</p><br/><p>The Headmaster continued to say, \"It is what you are thinking when you are about to make a decision. It is about which road to choose when you are at a crossing. Change or not? What's your choice?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered honestly and cleverly, \"What should I choose?\"</p><br/><p>The Headmaster almost choked when hearing his answer. He reproached Ning Que and said angrily, \"Why do you bother me with such an easy question? Are you an idiot? Of course you should choose whatever is the most beneficial to you.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

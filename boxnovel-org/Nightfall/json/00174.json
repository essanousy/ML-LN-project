There were actually none living in Chang'an City. Having seen Brother II's lovely little livehand, Ning Que had thought to move into the back mountain with Sangsang. However, as a newcomer in the Academy, he considered himself unqualified to be compared to Brother II. It might be considered indecent for him to make such a request. Besides, he thought the back mountain, though beautiful, lacked a sense of civil life. So he became the only non-resident student in the Academy.</p><br/><p>Sangsang rushed to the western street and bought back several pens, ink and bizarre materials as per Ning Que's list. She finished before the shops closed and streetlights were turned off. And then she was busy with cooking. She gave Ning Que the Old Brush Pen Shop's daily business report as she was cutting vegetables.</p><br/><p>\"It was busy today, especially in the morning when the threshold was almost trampled. I had the shop door repaired yesterday, but it still wasn't solid enough and broke again. The crowds only died down after people heard that you weren't in.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly thinking of something, Sangsang wiped her wet hands on her apron and took out a thick stack of name cards and invitations from the back room. She put them on the desk. \"A lot of people left these inviting you to their mansions. There are too many, and their names are there in writing, so I didn't take notes.</p><br/><p>Ning Que glanced at the invitations and name cards, and looked to the Classics of Talisman, thinking he was too busy to attend any appointments. He replied, \"You pick out the important ones and put them aside after dinner. I'll handle them later.\"</p><br/><p>\"How should I choose and manage them?\" Sangsang asked seriously. As Ning Que's little handmaiden, she had no experience in dealing with bigwigs from the Empire. She had no idea which kind of invitations were important.</p><br/><p>\"Just like selecting vegetables, you keep the fresh and expensive, and put aside the stale and cheap. As for what is fresh and expensive... I told you before about the imperial official system. Do you still remember? The ones from junior officials are expensive. I will handle and answer these letters out of etiquette, since what they really want is merely my calligraphy.</p><br/><p>Sangsang listened to his reply with her brows slightly furrowing, and then whispered, \"Master, your calligraphy can be sold for money now. Isn't it a pity to give them calligraphy replies for free?</p><br/><p>Ning Que laughed and continued to concentrate on the dozens of thick Talisman Classics in front of him. He had only read a few and really had no extra time to think about other things.</p><br/><p>Master Yan Se had given him a total of 33 Classics on Talisman, which recorded Talismans left by precedent Talisman Masters. Together they added up to 387 sections, and 2477 talismans, as complicated as the sea.</p><br/><p>Ning Que made a rough review of the Classics and gave a long and attentive gaze to one particular set of talismans. They seemed totally different and he could not find anything in common between them. Gaining nothing, he frowned deeper and deeper.</p><br/><p>According to Master Yan Se, the Fu characters were for Ning Que's reference only. As for how to write them, it all depended on his personal understanding. But how on earth was he going to get the references he needed to comprehend them? They looked like tadpoles, graffiti, rain drops and silk, rather than characters or pictures.</p><br/><p>Ning Que randomly picked a book from the hill-like Classics and found that it was the first section of Volume Three, the beginning of the Water Volume. He was a bit excited when he discovered that the beginning was seemingly concerned with something like water, the most indispensable and closest thing to human life. This might make it easier for him to study it.</p><br/><p>There were four pages in the first section. Ning Que read carefully from the beginning to the end and discovered that more than a hundred Fu characters on these pages had similarities. Most of them consisted of six lines running from top to bottom, except that the six ink lines differed in thickness and length, and especially in their style of combination and arrangement. In the strangest Fu characters, the six ink lines even entangled together completely.</p><br/><p>\"Are these all water characters? Is there a river that is the longest?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared with furrowed eyebrows at the Fu character written at the highest point in the Water Volume, the six ink lines that were neatly arranged and slightly curved in the middle. Gradually easing into tranquility, he envisioned the ink lines as water flows as if he could vaguely see the rainwater falling from eaves to the quartzite, blooming rain flowers, and then integrating again into the surrounding rainwater.</p><br/><p>Beside the desk were some materials such as ink and cinnabar. He had asked Sangsang to buy these cheap ordinary items, all of which, according to Master Yan Se, were essential materials for writing Fu characters.</p><br/><p>Rather than continuing to watch the six ink lines, Ning Que poured water into the inkstone and began to slowly grind the inkstick. When the ink was sufficiently mixed with the water, he took a writing brush down from the shelf and gently dipped it into the ink till it was plump.</p><br/><p>He did this in a gentle and leisure way, but it was actually the way taught by Master Yan Se, forcing the Psyche Power to slowly run out of the Snow Mountain and Ocean of Qi, to get through the paper window, to fall into the well at the small yard and finally to exquisitely experience the flavor of primordial Qi in the water.</p><br/><p>He raised his brush from the inkstone but could not write on the paper. He sat with his wrist stiffened above the inkstone.</p><br/><p>Ning Que frowned slightly and looked at the six ink lines again, forcibly disassembling the Eight Strokes Calligraphy of Yong in his mind, only to find that the six lines suddenly separated, floated away and turned into a black rain cloud that hung above his head. However, the dark ink cloud persistently refused to drip a single drop of water.</p><br/><p>With his wrist slightly quivering, Ning Que was ready to start writing, but his brush had stopped in the air. He could clearly feel that he was still incapable of writing the Fu character and connecting his own feelings with the well water, even though he had comprehended the meaning of the well water and this Fu character. It turned out to be wrong eventually.</p><br/><p>On a quiet night the candlelight gradually rose.</p><br/><p>There were two dishes and a bowl of rice on the desk. A bowl of water, lightly rippling with the night breeze, was placed under the lamp.</p><br/><p>Ning Que stood at the desk by the window, watching the Fu characters of Water Volume. His body was stiffening and his right hand that was pinching the brush was slightly shaking. He had kept this posture for a long time, but still failed to write on the paper.</p><br/><p>Sangsang sat at the bed embroidering shoes, occasionally raising her head to glance at him.</p><br/><p>A few hours ago, she had finish eating, without asking Ning Que to join her. She knew that Ning Que was in a big trouble whenever he habitually began to study with all his effort. Though she was worried, she still kept silent. She was used to this kind of situation.</p><br/><p>Ning Que owned an excellent but poor quality that whenever he met puzzles that he was eager to solve with interest, he would become fully absorbed into the process. Before the answers came to him, he could not even sleep, and even the most delicious food was as unpalatable as candles in his mouth. The surrounding world was totally insignificant for him.</p><br/><p>The reason he could be regarded as a genius was largely because of his way of solving problems, which was actually a nuisance for the people around. He would forget to eat and could not fall asleep. He would keep torturing his body until he became extremely weak, even dangerously so. He would not awaken until he solved the problem or restored his sense to confirm that the problem was beyond his ability.</p><br/><p>The year when Ning Que found the Article on the Response of the Tao for the first time at the frontier fortress, he didn't sleep for two weeks. He had tried to force himself to enter the meditation state constantly so that he could perceive the Qi of Heaven and Earth. Sangsang, who was still young at the time, had painstakingly taken care of him for exactly half a month. It hadn't ended until the ex-general of the City of Wei, unable to bear the situation any longer, had asked his pro-soldiers to whip Ning Que awake. After that, both Ning Que and Sangsang had gotten a seriously sick.</p><br/><p>It was the same case last year when he ascended the old library. He had stayed up unconscious and been thrown outside the building every day. He would return home in a horse carriage with a pale face, and vomit continuously in bed like a drunken man, even spitting up blood. It was Sangsang who had accompanied him and dared not fall asleep every night.</p><br/><p>After she finished embroidering the flower, Sangsang looked up and rubbed her tired wrist. She glanced at Ning Que, who was as still as a statue, and then continued to embroider soles, hiding her worries.</p><br/><p>Over the years, she had become accustomed to Ning Que's craziness when solving problems.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had gotten used to being taken care of in such situations.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>When the night grew late, the oil burnt out and lights went off.</p><br/><p>Sangsang wasn't sure when she had fallen asleep in bed in her clothes. She awakened, rubbed her eyes and looked at the half-light dawn sky outside the window. She saw that Ning Que was still standing by the desk in his writing posture.</p><br/><p>Sangsang walked over to open the window and turned to the desk, finding that there was not even a single dot of ink on the white paper. Yet Ning Que was extremely frail after a whole night of suffering, and his dry eyes were completely bloodshot.</p><br/><p>Sangsang stood by the window and stared into Ning Que's eyes for a long time. Ning Que did not see her at all. She shook her head and went out to cook.</p><br/><p>It wasn't until Ning Que was covered by a steaming hot towel on the face that he recovered from his selflessness. He sat in the chair with his whole body aching as if it had gotten rusty.</p><br/><p>Ning Que rubbed his face with hot water, brushed his teeth and then drank a pot of tea to recover his strength. He took the Water Volume from the desk and put it into his sleeve before leaving for the Academy.</p><br/><p>Standing in front of the Old Brush Pen Shop, he turned to Sangsang. After a moment of silence, he said, \"The problems I am encountering this time are more troublesome than those before. It may take a few more nights. From tonight onwards, rather than stay up late with me, take good care of yourself; even though you haven't been sick for almost a year. If I wear out, you can look after me. However, if both of us fall ill, it will be impossible to make Aunty Wu next door come to take care of us. \"</p><br/><p>Sangsang nodded.</p><br/><p>By the time Ning Que arrived at the Academy, study rooms had already begun classes. After coming up to the old library alone, he took a deep breath and went out into the mist of the mountain.</p><br/><p>The elegant dawn light and beautiful cliff landscape appeared out of the mist.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had rested on the horse carriage traveling from Chang'an City to the Academy, so he was slightly better in mentality. He seemed more vigorous as he enjoyed the beautiful scenery. He held the book tightly in his sleeves and considered lying on the lawn to read. The back of the mountain of the Academy might be a fantastic environment for perceiving Talisman Taoism.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a clear voice was heard beside him.</p><br/><p>\"Younger Brother... ah, you're here.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que turned around and saw Seventh Sister. She was wearing a yellow spring Academy uniform. Hurriedly, he said, \"Seventh Sister, it's a great honor to meet you here.\"</p><br/><p>Seventh Sister looked curiously at him. With concern she asked, \"You seem to be in a bad state of mind today?\"</p><br/><p>The biggest difference between Senior Sisters and Senior Brothers was that Senior Sisters were female, and Seventh Sister was a young and pretty woman. No matter how old a man was, he would never show his incapability by admitting that he was in a bad mental state in front of a beautiful young woman. Therefore, Ning Que laughed and replied, \"I entered the back of the mountain yesterday, so I was too excited to get a good night's rest.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, then I don't need to worry anymore.\"</p><br/><p>Seventh Sister took a note out from her sleeve and gave it to Ning Que. With a smile, she said, \"You know I'm responsible for maintaining the array tactics in the mist now. This month is just the right time for an overhaul, so I need a lot of materials. Would you please fetch some from the front yard? You can find Professor Wen Lan directly. \"</p><br/><p>Ning Que opened his mouth slightly, remembering Chen Pipi's complacent laughter yesterday, and began to feel regret for his reply just now. He answered with a bitter face, \"Yes, Seventh Sister.\"</p><br/><p>\"Please be quick,\" Sister giggled and continued with some embarrassment, \"Some fabric materials need to be changed, thus I have to bother you to help me.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que opened his mouth wider. helplessly pointing at the thick fog behind him, he said, \"Sister, you mean you want me to go into the fog and help you change the materials? I have... poor vision in the fog.\"</p><br/><p>Seventh Sister laughed with her sleeves covering her mouth like a weak woman, but she suddenly patted his chest like a strong man, and said, \"I won't let you be blind in the mist. I need to check the array center and have no other choice, but to bother you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't mention it. It's no bother,\" Ning Que said, opening his eyes. \"Or should I ask Chen Pipi to come help us? It may be faster if we do it together.\"</p><br/><p>\"Younger Brother, although you were familiar with him before ascending the mountain, he is now your Twelfth Brother after all. You should use the correct title.\" Seventh Sister looked at him with a sweet smile. \"The Second floor of the Academy is not so pedantic as other sects in the world, but we still need to pay attention to matters such as honoring teachers and brothers, caring for friends and esteeming the truth.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que understood what she meant and was not eligible to refuse her. He was merely a freshman and Younger Brother of the Second floor of the Academy.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>On the second day, when Ning Que came to the Academy and entered the back of the mountain, he looked rather haggard. The redness in his dry eyes was worse. He had not slept for two nights. Yesterday he had worked for Seventh Sister like a coolie running all over the entire mountain, so he had had intimate contact with the magical array tactical in the fog for the first time. However, his mental state had become worse to the extreme.</p><br/><p>Yesterday Senior Seventh Sister had said that the overhaul might take at least a month and that it had to be finished before the Headmaster of the Academy and eldest Brother returned. When Ning Que remembered this outside of the mist, he felt a chill throughout his whole body. He quickly slipped into the shadowed woods in the back of the mountain and lowered his body as a vole.</p><br/><p>He took an unusual Mountain Path, and only walked to the depth of the grass and forest. Seeing that the lake as a mirror on the cliff was getting smaller and smaller and the waterfall between the cliffs at the opposite side was becoming thinner and thinner, Ning Que could not help feeling happy. He assumed that Seventh Sister would certainly not be able to find him anymore. He rubbed his tired and tingling cheeks, and looked towards the distance leaning on a cedar, which seemed comfortable.</p><br/><p>\"Erm, someone's here on the mountain? Erm, it's actually you? Erm, why are you here? To bring us food?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly Ning Que heard two vigorous and tired voices from behind a hardy pine. He was sure that there were two people speaking, but the sounds magically mixing together seemed to come from the same person.</p><br/><p>Ning Que was shocked. He looked back and found two men of an unknown age, with long beards and messy hair. They were sitting on the opposite sides of a stone table beside the pine. It was late spring and there was a lot of heat even in the mountain. Yet strangely, the two men were still dressed in thick Academy winter uniforms, with stains all over them. He could not guess how long it had been since their uniforms had been washed.</p><br/><p>He immediately guessed that the two men were Fifth Brother and Eighth Brother, since Chen Pipi had told him about them. He forcibly suppressed his shock and respectfully gave a deep bow, saying, \"I'm Ning Que. It's my honor to see you here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Younger Brother, it's good to see you. Come over here.\"</p><br/><p>Said the man with dirty beard and hair in an exhausted voice. Ning Que did not know if it was Sixth Brother or Eighth Brother.</p><br/><p>Ning Que walked over and found that the stone table was carved with dense lines. It had become a stone chessboard, with dozens of black and white chess pieces, a few in the east and a few in the west. Ning Que did not know what it meant.</p><br/><p>He was suddenly startled when he looked down and saw that one of Senior Brothers' hands had reached his arms.</p><br/><p>\" Brother...\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm your Eighth Brother.\"</p><br/><p>\"Eighth Brother... Why do you put your hand on my arm?\"</p><br/><p>Eighth Brother shakily withdrew his hand, and asked blankly, \"Younger Brother, why don't you have food with you?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que was speechless. He wondered if they were two children who would ask for candy from each person they met.</p><br/><p>\"Younger Brother... no, Twelfth Brother came to tell us the night before last that you would be responsible for bringing us food from now on. He did not come to us yesterday, and neither did you.\" Eighth Brother watched Ning Que and said in a frightened voice, \"Younger Brother, we haven't eaten for two days and two nights. Why haven't you brought us any food today?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que opened his mouth wide but was unable to speak. He thought to himself, I have not slept for two days and nights as well, but why should I be charge of their diet? Yet he couldn't really feel any malice seeing the wistful eyes of the two Brothers. They were like two pitiful babbling birds. Ning Que sighed and said, \"I'll... go find some food for you.\"</p><br/><p>Fifth Brother, who always kept silent and only showed his yearning for food in his eyes, suddenly cheered up knowing that he was about to have food and would not starve to death. He stroked his jaw and said, \"Hey... one or two days of hunger won't kill us.\"</p><br/><p>Eighth Brother stretched out three fingers and pointed them at Fifth Brother. In a trembling voice, he said, \"You idiot, we haven't eaten for three days.\"</p><br/><p>It seemed Fifth Brother could not see the three fingers right under his nose. Instead, he looked at Ning Que and said, \"Next time, you're first.\"</p><br/><p>Eighth Brother withdrew his fingers and nodded his head in agreement, saying, \"Not bad, that's something serious.\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the Brothers nearly starving to death, Ning Que thought that they were destined to die of hunger.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>On the third day as Ning Que left the Old Brush Pen Shop at Lin 47th Street, the paper on the desk was still as white and clean as the first snow, without any ink blotches. The morning light was shining on his face, making him appear haggard and exhausted. His eyes were extremely bloodshot.</p><br/><p>He walked out of the mist and headed towards the mountain. He was blocked by a brush of light yellow after taking just a few steps. Seventh Sister gently watched him and said, \"Younger Brother, I know you must have been busy yesterday, but not today, right?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que stared at Seventh Sister. He raised the heavy meal box in his right hand, and answered bitterly, \" Sister, I spent the whole day playing chess with Fifth Brother and Eighth Brother. Now I'm anxious to bring them something to eat, or else they may actually starve to death.\"</p><br/><p>\"I see,\" Seventh Sister raised her brows slightly. \"Don't waste your time on those two nerds. Playing chess and lyre, after all, is meaningless. If you can help me overhaul the array tactical, it will probably be beneficial for your cultivation.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que repeatedly said yes. He promised her that he would go see her embroidering in the lake pavilion and help maintain the array tactical, after he went down the mountain. Only after giving her such a promise, was he able to get away. However, he knew in his heart that he would never go down the mountain to meet her later.</p><br/><p>Under the pine, the Brothers who were too hungry to speak were still staring at the chess board. Ning Que put down the meal box, and said, \" Brothers, come and eat please.\"</p><br/><p>The food that Sangsang had prepared last night was still warm, and it smelled good when it was opened. Brothers were trembling to sit straight and started to eat, ruefully looking up at Ning Que from time to time and uttering vague exclamations that were filled with regret.</p><br/><p>\"Younger Brother does not hide his dullness. He's really clumsy, judging from his chess playing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Younger Brother has never played chess before.\"</p><br/><p>Yesterday Ning Que had lost twelve times. The Brothers finally confirmed that the lad was one of the legendary chess rookies. They no longer asked him to play with them, which was a real blessing and comfort for Ning Que.</p><br/><p>After bringing them the food, Ning Que went deep into the mist.</p><br/><p>He decided to make good use of the stolen half day and rest or study the books Master Yan Se had left.</p><br/><p>However, he'd barely taken two steps when a man walked out of the jungle and grabbed his sleeves. Senselessly he asked,</p><br/><p>\"Younger Brother, where are you from? Where are you going?\"</p><br/><p>Startled, Ning Que stared at Eleven Brother with his silver hair. Suddenly he burst into tears. Fortunately, Eleven Brother did not ask who the little Younger Brother was, or Ning Que might have fainted on the spot. After a moment of silence, he let go of Eleven Brother's wrist and ran down the mountain, shouting, \"Seventh Sister, where are you? I'm coming to help you.\"</p><br/><p>In the lake pavilion, Seventh Sister's fingers, which were pinching an embroidery needle stiffened. She looked up towards the forest in the mountain, thinking in surprise, \"How diligent the newly-enrolled little Younger Brother is! Compared to him, Pipi is completely a sluggard.\"</p><br/><p>In the small courtyard before the waterfall, Second Brother raised his eyebrows in satisfaction, appreciating the proud white geese down the stairs. \"It's been dreary in the back of the mountain for many years. The Younger Brothers and Sisters are all shameless. Finally, we have a Younger Brother who is focused on cultivation. How could I not feel happy?</p><br/><p>Somewhere in the mountain, Chen Pipi stood eating a drumstick behind a thatched cottage. He cleaned his oily face with his hand and turned to look into the depths of the mountain. He gasped in shock. \"As if you're so humble and melancholy to loudly declare out, just to charm Sister. Ning Que, I'm not your match indeed!\"</p><br/><p>The vertical bamboo flute and lyre gradually stopped in the forest and a conversation could be heard.</p><br/><p>\"I just realized we forgot one thing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, we haven't yet invited little Younger Brother to listen to the song we composed last month.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Ning Que had lived life to the max after he entered the Second floor of the Academy. He was so active that he was exhausted almost to death. The brush in the Old Brush Pen Shop still hadn't fallen and the white paper was still as white as snow. He was busy with many things; he spent nights solving problems without falling asleep, he went to the Academy in the early mornings and brought food and water to the Brothers.</p><br/><p>Eleventh Brother liked to discuss philosophical issues together and if he wanted to get rid of him, he had to become Seventh Sister's coolie and admire the Brothers' new compositions. As he sat among the long grass sleepily nodding his head, he was unexpectedly regarded as a musical talent in the eyes of the two Brothers. They thought Ning Que was nodding to show praise and understood the meaning of the song.</p><br/><p>The hot towel that Sangsang handed over was getting hotter and hotter, but still could not wash his fatigue away. He spent days and nights floating in the vast and mysterious sea of the Talisman Taoism, growing tired of Brothers' and Sisters' hospitality. Ning Que's eyes were bloodshot, full of red veins, frustration and dullness. His fingers exposed outside the sleeves kept drawing talismans in the air, depicting the thousands of Fu characters that he had silently remembered in his brain. He looked like a fool indeed.</p><br/><p>Chu Youxian stood in the meadow of the Academy. He peered at Ning Que and assuming he was miserable, he asked in shock, \"What makes you so?\"</p><br/><p>Situ Yilan and Jin Wucai passed Ning Que the invitations from their families inviting him to gatherings in their mansions on behalf of the elders. Hearing Chu Youxian's words, they were quite taken aback by Ning Que's extremely weary face.</p><br/><p>Ning Que took the two invitations and pressed them into his arms. After giving a numb greeting bow with his hands folded in front, he walked towards the back mountain again. He appeared to be losing his wits.</p><br/><p>Chu Youxian, Situ Yilan and Jin Wucai, watched Ning Que's figure from behind as he walked slowly in front. They were too astonished to utter a word. Situ Yilan shook her head vigorously to drive Ning Que's ghost-like face out of her mind, murmuring, \"Is there a ghost on the Second floor?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! You saw a ghost!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi was so scared that he retreated backwards twenty meters. He did not come back until after a long period of hesitation. He stared speechlessly at Ning Que.</p><br/><p>Ning Que languidly replied, \"It is you who has seen a ghost.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi nodded, and earnestly said, \"Yes, you actually look like a ghost now.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que glanced blankly toward the forest, saying, \"I did see ghosts. In the back mountain, I saw two hungry dead ghosts who were so crazy in playing chess that they even wished to be fed with food; two elegant ghosts who were addicted to playing vertical bamboo flute and lyre to recreate themselves and who insisted on demanding I enjoy their composition without even discovering I was actually asleep as I sat there; and another philosophical ghost who always asked nonsense questions when meeting a person...\"</p><br/><p>He turned to look at Chen Pipi. With pain in his eyes, he said, \"And you, a coward with no righteousness.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know this is a non-human life, but don't forget I've been in this life for several years,\" Chen Pipi looked at Ning Que and continued, \"But no matter how hard it is, I haven't become what you are. What has caused you to be like this?\"</p><br/><p>\"I was following Master Yan Se in learning Talisman Taoism,\" Ning Que replied, looking at him blankly. \"It has been a long time, yet I've learned nothing. It's really difficult without direction and mind. I'm not happy about it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Did you use the Eight Strokes Calligraphy of Yong?\"</p><br/><p>\"I used everything I knew, but still couldn't find the right method.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que slowly bowed his head and said with exhaustion, \"I actually fear difficulty. I feel a bit desperate... you know? This is the first time in my life to feel desperate in learning.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi recalled Ning Que's desperate performances in cultivation, and then nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Ning Que shook his head and said, \"Even in the City of Wei, when I found I was incapable of cultivating, I was not so desperate and so eager to give it up as I am now. Because when I fell asleep at that time, I always felt like I was in meditation. Yet in front of those Classics on Talisman, I still know clearly that I can't accomplish it even if I can get into a sleep-like state of meditation.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi looked at his haggard cheeks and dim eyes, and suddenly said, \"I'll take you to a place and show you someone.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \"Where? Who?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't let Eleventh Brother hear what you asked,\" Chen Pipi jokingly replied.</p><br/><p>Ning Que wanted to laugh but was too tired to even raise his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Looking at Ning Que's poor appearance, Chen Pipi sighed. He took him by the sleeves and walked towards the back of the mountain.</p><br/><p>After coming to a cliff, Chen Pipi stopped. Staring at Ning Que, he said, \"Last time when you reached the top of the mountain, you saw an old gentleman and regarded him as your Brother, but in actuality, he wasn't.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que remembered the old gentleman. He said, \"You said you didn't know what to call him.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi replied, \"I really don't know what to call him. The gentleman entered the back mountain of the Academy very early on, even earlier than eldest Brother and Second Brother. Logically we might call him uncle, but the professors told me that he didn't belong to the Academy.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que began to cheer up, imagining a big BOSS from legends hiding in the branches, like a wise man who gave advice to heroes. Peering at Chen Pipi, he asked, \"The old gentleman... is he good at Talisman Taoism?\"</p><br/><p>\"No,\" Chen Pipi said shaking his head. \"He doesn't know Talisman Taoism nor ways of cultivation.\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \"Then why are you taking me to see him?\"</p><br/><p>\"You said this is the first time in your life when you're afraid of difficulty and want to give up. Do you really like cultivation?\"</p><br/><p>Ning Que kept silent for a long time before firmly replying, \"I do like it.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Pipi looked at him and said, \"If you like it, you should stick to it. I am showing you the old gentleman because I want you to know a person who is really crazy about a type of Taoism will never give up.\"</p><br/><p>\"If the old man can't cultivate... what is he obsessed with? What does he like?\"</p><br/><p>\"Reading...\" Chen Pipi said with an aggravated tone. \"He likes reading.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As the New Stream prevailed, Taoism had declined. She was getting weaker as she lost the strength of faithfulness from hundreds of millions of believers, especially now that she was carrying a baby.</p><br/><p>She was not the omnipotent Haotian anymore. She no longer possessed the strong state that was far beyond the reach of the world. However, the arrow she shot on behalf of Ning Que was stronger than the steel arrow Ning Que shot to Qinghe Prefecture during the Rite to Light. Why was that so?</p><br/><p>This was because during the Rite to Light, Ning Que used the natal connection between both of them to forcefully take over the Tianqi of the Hierarch, Xiong Chumo, and kept the strength for his own. However, this time it was out of her own willingness.</p><br/><p>This was the real unity of nature and mankind. Who could beat it?</p><br/><p>Ning Que was by her side, attached the arrow to the bow once again and pointed towards the other side of the cold lake. Hundreds of miles across the nature, he could aim it anywhere and released the bowstring once she voiced out.</p><br/><p>The wildflowers all over the mountain were drifted by the wind to high altitude and then fell off gradually. It was as though the goddess was hidden in the clouds to spread flowers, congratulating Haotian for revealing its divine manifestation in the human world once again. However, Sangsang looked rather pale.</p><br/><p>She knitted her eyebrows with her willow-like eyes squinted, making it look narrower. She appeared to be angry and also displeasure. It did not have anything to do for not being able to shoot off the Abbey Dean. The reason behind of her displeasure was because of her body condition. She could not bear seeing herself be so weak. She needed to fight against human beings, and what was worse was that she could not even win.</p><br/><p>Yes, she had used up almost all her strength when she helped Ning Que to shoot the arrow previously. The God\u2019s Plan had activated immediately and required lots of energy. If she was to figure out the position of the Abbey Dean now, her belly was suffering in pain and felt uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>This fight was the highest level of battling. Ever since the beginning of human history, the only battle that stood out was the battle between the Headmaster of Academy who entered the Divine Kingdom and Haotian, which had induced the hundred days of rain. It only took a few seconds to determine the outcome of the battle.</p><br/><p>Sangsang could not figure out the location of Abbey Dean in the first place, hence Ning Que could not release the bowstring immediately. The Abbey Dean did not miss out that very first moment. As the mountain wind caressed his body, his figure returned to the lakeside.</p><br/><p>The lake was cold and deserted. Outside the lake was filled with a rich atmosphere of spring. Ning Que stood in the atmosphere of spring, stared at Ning Que and Sangsang with a straight face. His eyes firm yet calm with a slight sense of arrogance.</p><br/><p>He was not alone by the lakeside because he brought along a mountain with him.</p><br/><p>The mountain stretched across a thousand miles, separating the northern land into two. It was the Min Mountain from the city of Helan located in the north region. It was also known as the Tianqi Mountain because it was a mountain under the influence of the Devil\u2019s Doctrine. Thus, this was the mountain that was abandoned by Haotian.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean was the head of the Taoism. By rights, his aura was not connected with the lofty mountain, it would even cause conflicts. However, it was different now as the situation was similar to one of his apprentices thousand years ago: the one who had created the Great Divine Priest of Light for Light\u2019s Doctrine, but had betrayed Haotian. To be more precise, he abandoned Haotian!</p><br/><p>He had blended as one with the mountain that had been abandoned by Haotian!</p><br/><p>He returned to the lakeside, his right hand pointed toward the opposite side of the lake. In between his fingers carried the whole Tianqi Mountain\u2019s Primordial Qi of Nature with the State of Purity being combined with nature, and infinite power lifted the heaven and earth. All of it directly smashed toward Ning Que and Sangsang!</p><br/><p>Before he attacked, he relied on the delicate skill, which was hard to imagine. The attack itself was just that simple and straightforward yet unreasonable because there was no need for any reason under such tremendous momentum!</p><br/><p>The surroundings of the cold lake used to be filled with the ambience of spring, but now it had been destroyed. Those flowers and trees that were chopped into pieces by Ning Que previously with blade intent had turned even worse until they could not be cut into more pieces anymore!</p><br/><p>The thousand miles mountain just fell off out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>Ning Que knew that even though his steel arrow could penetrate through the mountain, it could not block the destruction of the mountain. He recalled his bow without a second thought. He then turned around and held Sangsang in his arms, and decided to use his body to hold it out!</p><br/><p>He wanted to see if he could withstand the force from the mountain and keep his head above water for the calamity brought to them by the Abbey Dean as he had been smelted in Haoran Qi for years, and his body had been strengthened for a thousand years by Sangsang!</p><br/><p>Sangsang did not give him the chance to do so.</p><br/><p>Her hands passed through Ning Que\u2019s armpit; it seemed like she wanted to give him a warm hug. The next moment, a black flower bloomed in her hands: it was a shabby black umbrella.</p><br/><p>The black umbrella that had disappeared for a very long time and nowhere to be found, appeared in her hand. Along with the sound of opening up, the umbrella flew toward the mountain that fell from the sky.</p><br/><p>The black umbrella was still shabby as it used to be. The umbrella cover was occupied with dust and oil. The black umbrella that used to shine under the light of Buddha, revealing its identity had returned to its original appearance.</p><br/><p>Ning Que and her had the habit of calling the black umbrella as the big black umbrella. It was just like how people used to call the black horse as the big black horse. This was because it was incredibly big. Although the black umbrella looked small after being opened, as a matter of fact, it could actually envelope the whole sky.</p><br/><p>As long as it could cover the eyes, it could shield the sky.</p><br/><p>The big black horse and indigo lion hid at the back of Sangsang under the black umbrella with the feeling of terror and discomfort. Sangsang was holding the black umbrella while hugging Ning Que. She leaned against his shoulder with her head turned sideways, looking at the mountain fell from the sky.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean\u2019s hand went across the cold lake to the opposite side. The entire Tianqi Mountain split the sky into parts and landed on the cold lake. Beneath the giant mountain, the black umbrella appeared like an insignificant black dot.</p><br/><p>Thud! Thud! Thud! Loud noises echoed through the atmosphere!</p><br/><p>Countless of smoke and dust wafted through the sky and the wilderness in all directions. Numerous gravel pebbles were like thousands of arrows forming lots of traces in the sky, and set the whole world quaking.</p><br/><p>The surface of the land trembled vigorously. The pine trees that grew on the rock located far away from the mountain even blew off to the mid-air. A blue ice lake which was beneath the snow-covered mountain that was even further away had been shaken to the sky, forming a miraculous picture. It was like countless of deep blue pearls leaving the ground and dropping from the sky.</p><br/><p>The earthquake had spread through a very far region. Not to mention about Chengjing of the Yan Kingdom, even the Song Kingdom\u2019s crabs that lived in the weird breakwater stone located in the famous seaside dam had jumped back to the sea, as they could feel the terrifying tremble from the faraway northern region.</p><br/><p>The city of Helan was only ten miles away, hence they experienced a more direct and serious effect. Inside the two cliffs emerged countless cracks, and rocks could be seen falling off like a waterfall. The sound could make one be struck with fright.</p><br/><p>The two heavy and big city gates which had blocked the grassland barbarians for many years were now seriously out of shape, forming a very big gap. Over hundreds of years, the military fort had never collapsed, but now it had been destroyed!</p><br/><p>There were all kinds of terrifying noises. The miraculous yet unrepresentable landscapes, the inclination of the cliff, the destruction of the fort could only tell how intimidating Abbey Dean\u2019s hand that had landed on the opposite side of the cold lake.</p><br/><p>Without knowing how long it had passed, the earthquake finally calmed down. The dust and smoke fell off slowly and being absorbed by the snow left on the crushed cliff of the mountain. The cleanliness of the air recovered gradually.</p><br/><p>Greenwoods in the mountain had turned into broken bits, and the cold lake became flat. Those leftover ice crystals and scaleless slim fish at the bottom of the lake had blended into one with the soil and rock; hopefully, they would be rediscovered by humans after numerous years.</p><br/><p>The cold lake was left with a vague shape.The lakeside had a trail. It was reformed from the stone powder, and transformed into a circle pavement which was about a hundred miles square. The atmosphere of spring had became a monotonous world that was built up from multiblocks.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean stood on a stone by the lakeside. His face was slightly pale; his right hand rested on his body shivered a little. Thus, his green clothes also trembled along, causing rings of ripples to sway as calm as water.</p><br/><p>Accompanied by the whole Tianqi Mountain, the attack was extremely earth-shattering. Even for him, he also needed to pay a price for it. The cold lake had vanished, and the atmosphere of spring had disappeared. However, he was still as calm as the water and as warm as the ambience of spring in the bottom of his heart. This was because he was clear that the long amount of time he spent to prepare for this heavy blow must have injured her severely.</p><br/><p>Even if the big black umbrella was a piece of thing that she tore it out from the dark before she came to the human world to protect her real weak body, it still could not stop the entire Tianqi Mountain.</p><br/><p>The crushing sound from the stone by the lakeside was due to lifting and separation of the gravel pebbles. The big black umbrella was exposed, big black horse and Indigo Lion were blanked out under the umbrella. Obviously, they had not regained their composure from the terrifying earthquakes earlier. Ning Que was awakened, but his face looked extremely pale. He did not have any severe injuries, but Sangsang was on the point of death in his arms.</p><br/><p>Sangsang lay in his arms, still breathing. Her face was as white as a sheet and blood leaked out from the corner of her mouth. Her willow-like eyes were dull, and no longer as shine as they were before.</p><br/><p>Ningque quickly wrapped her up in front of him, and rode on the horse.</p><br/><p>A ruthless voice spread out from the broken cliff. The Abbey Dean fixed his gaze at him said, \u201cDo you think you can escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not answer him. Sangsang was badly injured at the moment.It was difficult for him to escape from the Abbey Dean if it was merely him. However, he knew that someone would come for his rescue.</p><br/><p>As long as he knew where Ning Que was, he would definitely come. The Abbey Dean had launched a shocking attack, even the earth and heaven could also perceive it. He would know where Ning Que was.</p><br/><p>Ning Que had waited for this moment. He was confident about it just like many years ago, he came to their rescue when he and Sangsang fell into a desperate situation in the White Tower Temple located at the Yuelun Kingdom\u2019s Chaoyang City.</p><br/><p>The wind blew across the cliff, causing the Abbey Dean\u2019s expression to alter slightly. A gust of wind swept in, and instantly came before Ningque. A finger was pointed on his chest and the fingertip reached between Sangsang\u2019s eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a wooden stick appeared in front of his finger. It was just an ordinary wooden stick. It was not rosewood, definitely not agilawood, and not Pao Rosa. It was a wooden stick that could be found anywhere in anyone\u2019s house, that was usually used to make the dough, or to beat the kids.</p><br/><p>When the Abbey Dean waved his hand, the mountain would fall off as there were mountains and rivers in-between his fingers.</p><br/><p>However, this ordinary wooden stick was able to resist his finger movement.</p><br/><p>A snap sound was produced between the wooden stick and the finger.</p><br/><p>A ripple of the Primordial Qi of Nature could be seen spreading across the surroundings. The ripple hit the cliff, causing damage to it once again, and the hard rocks flipped as well. The remaining forest was engulfed with strong winds.</p><br/><p>The wooden stick withdrew.</p><br/><p>In front of the big black horse, a scholar with a cotton-padded robe appeared.</p><br/><p>The sparks at the edge of the cotton-padded robe had not faded away, could someone imagine how fast it took for him to arrive.</p><br/><p>There was dust everywhere on his cotton-padded robe, even in his shoes and hair. One could not imagine how far he moved.</p><br/><p>The Abbey Dean looked at him quietly, taking one step forward.</p><br/><p>The Elder brother raised the wooden stick horizontally in front of his eyes, equalling it to his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>With this action, he utilized Jun Mo\u2019s intent of respecting each other.</p><br/><p>Back in those days, he did not know how to fight, and not even know how to kill someone. However, he was forced to learn how to fight and kill someone because of this brutal world. From that day onwards, he equipped himself the ability to fight.</p><br/><p>A stick was equal to the eyebrows, hence the Abbey Dean was not allowed to enter.</p></div>\n</div>"}

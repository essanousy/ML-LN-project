Not even Chao Xiaoshu knew what he was doing. When he received the invitation from the Academy, he thought he would be able to find the answer.</p><br/><p>An adorable and handsome little servant was waiting on the mountain path in the mist. When he saw them coming, he saluted politely and said, \u201cMr. Chao, please come this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>They arrived on a plateau at the back of the Academy\u2019s mountain after walking through the mist. Chao Xiaoshu looked at the beautiful scenery and inwardly lamented that, had the Emperor not needed him back then, he would have definitely applied to enter the Academy. He might even have had the opportunity to become a student on the Second Floor and be one of them.</p><br/><p>The Tangs who visited the back of the Academy\u2019s mountain for the first time would feel rather nervous. Chao Xiaoshu did not feel as nervous, but Chen VII who had accompanied him on the trip could barely control his emotions. He was unlike his usual composed self.</p><br/><p>They heard the sound of a waterfall cascading down and the little servant brought them to a small courtyard where Jun Mo was waiting. The three greeted each other; then, Jun Mo handed a file to them and said, \u201cThe Academy has drawn some plans. We don\u2019t see any problems with it, so we need you two to help us look through it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu accepted the file and opened it. Chen VII stood beside him, confused. The students of the Academy were all highly intelligent people, why would they need him and his people to evaluate the files?</p><br/><p>Jun Mo knew what he was thinking and said, \u201cThe Academy has killed many people, but usually, we kill them when we meet them. We don\u2019t really have experience regarding this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen VII understood what Jun Mo meant, and he suddenly felt the burden on his shoulders growing heavier. He also could not help but feel proud, and thought to himself that it was no wonder that Second Brother Chao would bring him along.</p><br/><p>After Second Brother Chao read through the file, he passed it to Chen VII and then, looked at Jun Mo with a grave expression. He said, \u201cIs what Ning Que is doing related to this plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo replied, \u201cWhat he has to do is not written in the file, but is the most important part of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen VII\u2019s breathing grew more rapid as he read the file. As the brains of the Fish-dragon Gang, he was no stranger to plots and schemes. He himself had set many. For example, the plot at the Spring Breeze Pavillion that rainy night. However, he had never imagined that he would have the opportunity to participate in such a plan. After all, the two targets of the plan were like deities to him.</p><br/><p>The plan in the file was initially conceived by Fourth Brother, Fan Yue, and Ning Que. Then, Eldest Brother had written it personally. There were not any problems if one thought through it rationally and logically. However, the matter was simply too important and the Academy lacked experience in this aspect, which was why they needed the help of the Fish-dragon Gang.</p><br/><p>Chen VII held the file tightly and read it for a long time. He forcibly repressed his excitement and nerves as his brain whirled quickly. He only looked up after a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis plot is very well done and only some minor details need to be tweaked. Give me one night and I can fix them. I believe that even if the two of them were truly deities, they would not be able to see through the plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at Jun Mo and said, \u201cHowever, the crux of the matter is that where to find the most suitable person to carry this out? The person who would dare to do this would have to be extraordinary. A regular person would not have the courage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo answered, \u201cWe heard that tens of thousands of hot-blooded people stood before Youngest Brother the day the Abbey Dean entered Chang\u2019an. It is not difficult to find someone like that. And if we can\u2019t, we will send two of the newest disciples the Academy accepted. They have yet to start cultivating officially and fit the criteria.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was on the Vermilion Bird Avenue that day too.\u201d Chen VII shook his head and said, \u201cThe ordinary people were acting on the spur of the moment. What we are doing now is planning before acting. These are completely different concepts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu had not spoken, but suddenly said at the moment, \u201cThere\u2019s another way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jun Mo and Chen VII understood what he meant immediately. Chen VII did not hesitate to object with vehemence while Jun Mo stared at him quietly.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu smiled slightly and said, \u201cIt is my greatest regret that I have never been able to study in the Academy. But I have learned much in the city and on the streets. I can behave like a human or a ghost as I wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that horse of yours still like grain porridge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi pushed the basin containing the pork trotters to the opposite side of the table, and motioned for Ning Que and Wang Jinglue to eat it. Then, he lifted the flagon and filled up the wine bowls in front of the two.</p><br/><p>Ning Que remembered the rotten porridge he saw the other day and said with a smile, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he still likes drinking grain porridge or not, but that silly horse never forgot about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi took a bite of the pig trotters and guzzled down half a bowl of wine. He rubbed his belly and sighed in satisfaction. Then, he looked at Ning Que and warned him, \u201cThe situation right now isn\u2019t that great. Be careful on the road.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que replied, \u201cThe Eastern Border is peaceful now, and there shouldn\u2019t be an issue with the southern side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi laughed and said, \u201cThe peace at the Eastern Border was fought for by us. Those idiots at Qinghe County in the south have never been beaten. Would they really behave themselves?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que\u2019s brows picked up and he said, \u201cI remember you saying three years ago that you\u2019ve already retired from the army.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi patted his oily chest and said with satisfaction, \u201cI don\u2019t look it, do I? I joined the voluntary army. I am the best at painting in my county, and I\u2019m also not bad at fighting wars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at the farmer who was a common sight in the villages of the Tang Empire and did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>Wang Jinglue had focused on eating meat and drinking wine since he entered the courtyard. He did not understand how Ning Que had gotten to know such a farmer and had even wanted to stop here until he heard that\u2026</p><br/><p>He looked up and raised his wine bowl, placing it in front of Yang Erxi to say, \u201cI admire you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi took up his wine bowl and they toasted each other before he drank the remaining wine in his bowl. He said, \u201cCompared to those dead fellows, I don\u2019t deserve the admiration.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only then when Ning Que noticed that he bore a new scar between his brows.</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi pointed to the spot and said with a smile, \u201cI was really lucky. Even though the barbarians cut me several times, they did not hit anything important. Even this wound on my face is hidden between my brows, and I have not been disfigured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not say anything else. He took up his wine bowl and dedicated a toast to him again.</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi lifted the flagon and realized that it was empty. He yelled out of the window, \u201cGo get another flagon of wine from the village. Oh, and cut me another pork trotter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to eat the pork trotters from our home when I was at the Eastern Border.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi looked at both Ning Que and Wang Jinglue, and said as he lamented, \u201cSay, why do you think we work so hard for? Isn\u2019t it for our wives and children? Isn\u2019t it for them to have tasty and fragrant meat to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was then, when the sound of his wife complaining could be heard from the courtyard. \u201cYou only know how to drink wine and eat meat every day. You invite everyone you see in our house to eat and drink and you never ever worry that they will eat away our family\u2019s money.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice was not high nor low and could not be heard by anyone outside the courtyard. However, it would definitely be heard by the two people sitting by the table eating meat. Wang Jinglue felt a little uneasy, while Ning Que seemed to not have heard it at all.</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi felt embarrassed and slammed his hands on the table angrily and shouted, \u201cWhat are you complaining about? Is it wrong for me to want to eat a piece of meat and drink a bowl of wine when I return home? Do you not want me to come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>The courtyard was suddenly silent, and then, the sound of a woman crying could be heard.</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi felt even more embarrassed and yelled, \u201cCry, you only know how to cry! You cry when I am not home, and you cry when I return!\u201d \u201cI gambled with my life at the Eastern Border and rendered military service. I was awarded 200 taels of silver, so why am I not allowed to eat meat? Also, if you dare to pick the meat out of my bowl and give it to our son, I\u2019ll give you a sound thrashing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman stopped crying and started to chop up the pork trotters. She cursed the man for being heartless as she chopped the pork.</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at him and asked hesitantly, \u201cAre you really going to thrash her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi said, \u201cWomen, will they be obedient if you don\u2019t thrash them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cAre you not afraid that she will sue you at the county government?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi\u2019s expression grew awkward and he replied, \u201cThis is called being fierce, do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought of why he was going to the West-Hill and seemed to have learned something.</p><br/><p>They had to leave after eating and drinking their fill.</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi sent them to the mill and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but I don\u2019t think you are ordinary people, and I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do. If you\u2019re going to kill, kill more people on my behalf.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi would definitely not say this had he not drunk so much.</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and asked, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi said, \u201cWe met once three years ago. I would have forgotten about you if not for your black horse that ate my grain porridge. Would an ordinary person be able to afford feeding a horse like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cAnd how did you know we are going to kill someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi said, \u201cYou are Tangs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que asked, \u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi said matter-of-factly, \u201cWhat else other than killing are the Tangs going to do when they head to Qinghe River now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, a pair of siblings ran towards them.</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi swooped down and carried them. He looked at Ning Que and boasted, \u201cMy daughter and son. How are they? Aren\u2019t they great? They rank in the top at school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI don\u2019t have children, why are you so proud?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi said, \u201cAre you married?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que nodded and said, \u201cYes. You\u2019ve met her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi asked, \u201cIs it that girl who likes to drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and answered, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to drink now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi replied, \u201cIt\u2019s been three years, why do you still not have children?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me, I think the problem lies with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi said unhappily, \u201cI don\u2019t like listening to this. Men like to push all the blame to women. If there\u2019s a problem, find a way to resolve it and don\u2019t complain so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que replied seriously, \u201cI intend to do that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi\u2019s daughter looked at the two strangers and asked curiously, \u201cFather, who are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are father\u2019s friends from Chang\u2019an.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Erxi said proudly. He did have friends from Chang\u2019an and had never lied to his daughter.</p><br/><p>The daughter looked at Ning Que, her eyes turning in their sockets as she asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que answered, \u201cI want to head to the south.\u201d</p><br/><p>The daughter asked curiously, \u201cWhy are you going to the south?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said with a smile, \u201cTo pick up my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>The daughter said happily, \u201cIs your bride beautiful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought it over, and replied, \u201cShe\u2019s not really beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The daughter said seriously, \u201cEven if she\u2019s not beautiful, you can\u2019t abandon her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at her and said seriously, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

However, when facing the river, no one could find the small, dry mounds of sand.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo did not see the river, but he could sense it. As such, he found a spot in the surging river and turned slightly, his feet landing on the spot.</p><br/><p>He opened his eyes once more and saw the river flowing beneath his feet like the passage of time. He did not lament like his teacher, instead, a hint of light gleamed through his eyes.</p><br/><p>His face was pale, but he looked just as calm.</p><br/><p>A loud whistle burst out from his lips.</p><br/><p>It was like the call of a young phoenix, or like the first chirp of a phoenix after its rebirth in flames.</p><br/><p>The autumn wind grew stronger, and Jun Mo\u2019s hair danced in it.</p><br/><p>He opened his arms, his sleeves flapping in the wind.</p><br/><p>Blood flowed incessantly from his torn limb.</p><br/><p>His Psyche Power burst in all heaven and earth\u2019s directions.</p><br/><p>There was a sword in a hob under the iron shelter of the Verdant Canyon. It sensed the wild calling of the Psyche Power. With a poof, it broke through the box, the shelter, and flew towards the plains.</p><br/><p>Sudden shrieks of surprise sounded in the southern plains where the camp of the West-Hill Divine Palace Coalition Army was. The cultivators of different sects suddenly found their Natal Swords leaving their control!</p><br/><p>The crisp sound of sword and scabbard rubbing against each other could be heard in the Military camp. Several swords flew out of their sheaths and swept toward the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>Deep in the green hills, several fallen leaves gently covered a large iron sword wielded tightly by a broken arm. Suddenly, the iron sword trembled violently, breaking through the leafy coverings and flying into the sky.</p><br/><p>The heaven and earth surrounding the plains were filled with Jun Mo\u2019s powerful Psyche Power.</p><br/><p>Countless swords, summoned by this Psyche Power, came from all directions. They crossed the distance at the speed of lightning, arriving at the Verdant Canyon and stabbing at Liu Bai!</p><br/><p>Liu Bai held the broken sword before him with a solemn expression, setting up an one-foot radius around him once more.</p><br/><p>Thousands of swords, suddenly stopped in front of him, hovering in the air.</p><br/><p>There were too many swords, and they made up a large ball of swords. They blocked the daylight, making it seem eerie.</p><br/><p>The intent to kill was overwhelming.</p><br/><p>This was the sword\u2019s world.</p><br/><p>It was a world surrounded by swords.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai was surrounded by thousands of swords.</p><br/><p>He could not see what was happening around him, and his connection to the Qi of Heaven and Earth seemed about to be broken.</p><br/><p>He could only calculate.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo wielded his sword amongst the thousands of swords.</p><br/><p>Using his left hand.</p><br/><p>There were swords everywhere in front of the Verdant Canyon, and sword styles were everywhere. The aura of Heaven and Earth was chaotic.</p><br/><p>However, he could still find where his iron sword exactly was.</p><br/><p>Because his right arm was still on the iron sword.</p><br/><p>By holding his iron sword, he was also holding on to his broken arm.</p><br/><p>He pulled out his iron sword and then rushed towards Liu Bai, who was surrounded by thousands of swords.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai could not see it, neither was he able to predict accurately.</p><br/><p>But he could feel this sword.</p><br/><p>It was the most powerful sword he had ever seen.</p><br/><p>It was even more terrifying than the sword of the Sword Master from the South Sea who had dubbed him the Sword Sage.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai did not hesitate any longer.</p><br/><p>He did not flash his sword, nor set up any city walls or moats.</p><br/><p>At the most crucial moment, he only trusted his sword.</p><br/><p>At this time, Jun Mo had already successfully risen his urge to battle and his pride.</p><br/><p>He believed that he was invincible.</p><br/><p>Those standing in front of the Dahe Sword shall fall.</p><br/><p>No matter how terrifying Jun Mo\u2019s sword was, it was no match for him.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai attacked.</p><br/><p>The great river flooded the plains.</p><br/><p>He was the Sword Sage.</p><br/><p>And his sword was the holiest of all swords.</p><br/><p>With his attack, there would only be one sword left on the world.</p><br/><p>The one-foot radius around him widened.</p><br/><p>Thousands of swords suddenly dispersed, flying across the plains around the green hills and falling to the ground.</p><br/><p>There was nothing else blocking Liu Bai\u2019s view and his sword.</p><br/><p>But there was still another sword in front of the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>The iron sword was held in Jun Mo\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Then it was wielded by Jun Mo.</p><br/><p>The statement was repeated.</p><br/><p>But it was true.</p><br/><p>The hilt was held by a broken arm.</p><br/><p>And Jun Mo was holding his broken arm.</p><br/><p>The image seemed gory, but that was not the point.</p><br/><p>Other than the fact that the iron sword seemed to have grown longer.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo attacked, focused and solemn. He remained unshaken even though he was bathed in blood.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai attacked slightly later, but his sword arrived before Jun Mo\u2019s. No sword in the world could be faster than his sword.</p><br/><p>However, Liu Bai only had a broken sword left in his hands.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo\u2019s iron sword was longer than usual.</p><br/><p>A light sound echoed around the Verdant Canyon.</p><br/><p>It was like a drop of water falling into the furnace, touching the red hot coals.</p><br/><p>The iron sword pierced into Liu Bai\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai\u2019s broken sword was still a distance away from Jun Mo\u2019s throat.</p><br/><p>It was neither close nor near. It was exactly one foot away.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai abandoned his sword.</p><br/><p>The sword broke once more, shattering into countless bright shards.</p><br/><p>The Qi of Heaven and Earth on the sword shook uneasily.</p><br/><p>The plains before the Verdant Canyon started to shake, and there was a loud, long groan.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai backed up with the moaning.</p><br/><p>He came like the yellow river rushing into the sea and left like the gushing flood.</p><br/><p>He backed up more than hundred feet away in the flow of the Qi of Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>And then, he stopped.</p><br/><p>And began to cough.</p><br/><p>He coughed up blood.</p><br/><p>He looked at the wound on his chest with a slight frown.</p><br/><p>He finally understood why Jun Mo had taken control of so many swords.</p><br/><p>That was because Jun Mo wanted him to calculate.</p><br/><p>He might be the strongest powerhouse in the world, but he was no mathematical genius like Sangsang. No matter how powerful he was, he could not calculate all the changes in the world.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo did not need to calculate because all the swords were fake. Only his own iron sword was real.</p><br/><p>However, even so, Jun Mo\u2019s iron sword could not enter the one-foot around him.</p><br/><p>Until his arm had been broken and he was gravely injured. Jun Mo had felt pain, anger and was spurred on. The Etiquette that he had followed religiously for many years and had bound him for many years was finally released at this moment.</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes and did not see the Yellow River falling from above, and avoided the fatal strike of Liu Bai\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>He whistled, and the green hills and plains shook uneasily, calling countless of swords towards him.</p><br/><p>A weak point had finally appeared in Liu Bai\u2019s sword style.</p><br/><p>Jun Mo\u2019s iron sword entered from that spot.</p><br/><p>That weak point, perhaps, was made deliberately by Liu Bai.</p><br/><p>Because he believed that his sword was the fastest in such a short distance.</p><br/><p>But he missed one thing.</p><br/><p>The Sword Taoism consisted of sword and skill, while it also was divided into power and technique.</p><br/><p>Other than speed, there was still length to consider.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai smiled as he looked down at his bleeding wound.</p><br/><p>His smile was not disconsolate, instead it had a tinge of self-mocking and lament.</p><br/><p>He had not expected the ending to be like this.</p><br/><p>He could accept it if both parties were injured and both had lost. But he found it hard to accept this cause.</p><br/><p>This cause was too ludicrous.</p><br/><p>The broken sword had met the long sword. And for some reason, the person holding the broken sword had stabbed his opponent to death instead. And for some reason, the person holding the long sword gained an advantage\u2026</p><br/><p>This was a battle scene that only a first learner of sword arts would think of.</p><br/><p>He and Jun Mo were the two strongest people in Sword Taoism.</p><br/><p>They chose to end the fight in this unique way.</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought that the clear stream would turn into a turbid river, but would clear up again after entering the sea. Would the same principle work in Sword Taoism?</p>\n</div>"}

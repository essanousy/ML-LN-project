It sounded monotonous as if someone were slapping the old bell in the Imperial Palace with his hand. It was a dull, painful ringing. The crutch under Ning Que\u2019s armpits landed rhythmically on the snowy ground, following his footsteps. However, it did not make any sound.</p><br/><p>He had stayed silent after a long time, after hearing Chao Xiaoshu\u2019s words. Then, he said, \u201cThe Academy does not interfere with politics. The Empress will be the one to decide whether to kill her or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the Academy did not interfere in politics, the Tang Empire would have fallen months ago. The words \u2018The Academy did not interfere in politics\u2019 had long become a empty talk, and as such, the second statement was pointless too.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu said, \u201cShould Hua Shanyue be killed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI want to kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu replied, \u201cThe Hua family is still a prominent family in Hebei. Unlike the families of Qinghe County, he has always been loyal to the Tang Empire and has connections in the army and court, especially in the five camps of Gushan Commandery, which they are in charge of. The Hua family has fought hard this time in the Northern Frontier and the Eastern Border, and they\u2019re still fighting hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cAre you telling me all this to say that Hua Shanyue shouldn\u2019t be killed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu said, \u201cYou know this as well, otherwise you\u2019d have done it already even if I had not stopped you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI was thinking, if I wanted to kill Hua Shanyue, should I also kill his entire family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though this answer is cold and cruel, it is within my expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu said, \u201cIt\u2019s just that there are too many for you to kill them all. You cannot possibly exterminate the families of ministers that support Li Yu since that will doom the Tang Empire. However, once the war calms, these people will definitely worry if the Empress or the Academy will get rid of them. The conflict will thus continue. Even if the Hua Shanyue incident had not happened, something similar will also happen in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI will find a suitable method to deal with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two stopped their discussion about the matter. After all, those incidents and their solutions were all rather sinister. It was rather dissonant with the snow white streets and the days of hot-bloodedness.</p><br/><p>Ning Que did not say anything else since Chao Xiaoshu did not like it. The two continued forward silently, and they shortly arrived at the Eastern City\u2019s Spring Breeze Pavilion.</p><br/><p>Upon entering the Chao Mansion, Ning Que greeted Old Master Chao before being pulled away to the yard by Shangguan Yangyu. He looked at the prefectural magistrate sleazy\u2019s appearance and raised his brows, saying, \u201cHow fast was the reaction over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yangyu touched his goatee, looking calm. However, his hand was actually shaking so hard he nearly plucked his already thin beard off. He said, \u201cIt was not easy for things to calm down over the last two days. There would be great trouble if this matter is not handled properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do we handle the matter well?\u201d Ning Que looked at him and asked.</p><br/><p>Shanagguan Yangyu grew anxious at Ning Que\u2019s stare and he answered, \u201cThe best way to handle it is the way that you deem is the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and said, \u201cWho\u2019s been pressing you for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yangyu answered, \u201cNot even the Grand Secretary or the senior ministers dare to come forward regarding this matter. Who else could it be? The Supreme Court minister is waiting at my house right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que only realized that the Supreme Court minister was related to the Hua family after the prefectural magistrate\u2019s explanation. After thinking about it, he asked, \u201cWhat does the Empress intend to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yangyu said, \u201cThe Empress asks that Mr. Thirteen handle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he looked around him to make sure there was no one watching them. He said softly, \u201cThe Hua family, old and young, are kneeling before the palace right now. It might continue until tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of kneeling now?\u201d Ning Que asked.</p><br/><p>He understood what the imperial court wanted. Hua Shanyue\u2019s clan did not agree with his actions. But at a point of time like this, everyone wanted to keep peace and remain united.</p><br/><p>Only the Academy was qualified to handle the matter and calm the storm.</p><br/><p>In other words, he had to handle the matter.</p><br/><p>Ning Que thought of the Northern Army officials and the army which attacked the Empress\u2019 convoy at the Northern Military Camp. He said, \u201cSend all those involved in the matter to General Xu Chi. Tell them that I have ordered them to do so. Following precedent cases, they have to redeem themselves with ten heads. Return to your home and tell the minister that if the war stops, have the Hua family be ready to hand over their military power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yangyu had been tossed out by the Empress to become the middleman. But he was unwilling to offend the Princess and her faction. He finally heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Ning Que\u2019s suggestions and he asked, \u201cWhat about Hua Shanyue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que replied, \u201cThrow him there too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yangyu could finally breathe easy. He had been extremely worried that Ning Que would insist on killing Hua Shanyue. Even the Empress thought that Hua Shanyue could not die at this time.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Yangyu left the Chao Mansion, leaving Ning Que alone in the courtyard. He caressed the rough surface of his crutch and thought of what had happened tonight. He felt that something was off.</p><br/><p>A cough sounded from behind the wintersweet bush. Old Master Chao walked out from behind it.</p><br/><p>Ning Que went up to help him.</p><br/><p>Old Master Chao waved his hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a cripple now, and you\u2019re still thinking of helping me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que smiled and suddenly asked, \u201cSecond Uncle, what do you think of this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Chao said, \u201cIt\u2019s such an important matter of the Royal Court, why have you come to ask me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cEven the Abbey Dean has to ask you, let alone me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Chao said, \u201cThen tell me about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cI still think it\u2019s not right to handle it like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Chao replied, \u201cBecause you are retreating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said thoughtfully, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m no longer used to retreating with regards to matters in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Chao looked at him and said, \u201cIf you want to ask about the Heaven\u2019s Way, then you shouldn\u2019t care about matters of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Queasked, \u201cBut what if the matters of the world keep coming to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Chao asked him, \u201cWhat did you do when the Abbey Dean stood before you?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many stoves in the Chao Mansion parlor; it was as warm as spring.</p><br/><p>The Fish-dragon Gang had suffered heavy casualties the other day, and the atmosphere in the gang was naturally subdued. Now that Chao Xiaoshu and Liu V returned, many gathered in the Chao Mansion. However, they did not drink much.</p><br/><p>Ning Que and Qi IV looked around the table after they discussed the rebuilding of Yanming Lake.</p><br/><p>Chen Liu was drinking hot tea. He did not like drinking alcohol because he thought that it hindered one\u2019s thinking ability.</p><br/><p>Ning Que excused himself, saying that he had drunk too much.</p><br/><p>Moments later, Chen Liu left the parlor as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are close to the army. How is our relationship with the Northern Army?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que looked at Chen Liu and asked.</p><br/><p>Bright yellow light streamed through the window paper, shining on Chen Liu. It cast a large shadow, and his face could not be seen clearly.</p><br/><p>After the night at the Spring Breeze Pavilion, the relationship between the Fish-dragon Gang and the army grew extremely close. Chen Liu knew that he could not hide anything regarding this matter, and so, he said softly, \u201cWe are relatively close.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Que said, \u201cTell them that I want Hua Shanyue to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long moment of silence, Chen Liu nodded.</p><br/><p>His nodding movement was so small that Ning Que would have missed it if he had not been staring at him.</p><br/><p>The two returned to the parlor one after the other.</p><br/><p>Chao Xiaoshu looked at the two and said, \u201cEat quickly, the meat is about to rot.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

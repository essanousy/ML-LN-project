He had decided to admit to everything, but he did not expect that the Great Master had already known his true identity.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said, \"I have been raising you for seven years and teaching you for seven years. Even if you were a cold sword, you could still be reclaimed. However, it did surprise me that the Judicial Department's men were born to be ruthless.\"</p><br/><p>The disciple was silent for a long time, then he bowed deeply again. He sincerely apologized and said, \"I'm sorry. I didn't expect it to end like this.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said with no expression, \"If the Judicial Department wants to use the Sword Garret to do the dirty job, they should at least inform me first. Taking without permission is not borrowing. It is stealing.\"</p><br/><p>The disciple said with emotion, \"I didn't want to do this, but it was my duty.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know.\" Liu Bai said impatiently.</p><br/><p>The disciple slowly stood straight, and calmly gazed at Liu Bai across the pool. He was able to withstand Liu Bai's powerful sword style, indicating that his true cultivation state was much higher than what he usually showed.</p><br/><p>Of course, even if his cultivation state was several levels higher than what he had shown previously, he still wasn't a match for Liu Bai. However, there wasn't a trace of fear on his face.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai, the Sage of the Sword was the strongest fighter in the world. Countless cultivators feared him. However, the disciple was the deacon of the West-Hill Divine Palace. He received orders from the black Taoism Temple in Peach Mountain.</p><br/><p>In the words of Liu Bai, the disciple had simply used his authority to manage the Sword Garret. He maneuvered to borrow Chao Xiaoshu's sword and gave it to Liu Yiqing, who was about to leave for Chang'an City, telling him a few words.</p><br/><p>Taking without permission was indeed not borrowing. It was stealing.</p><br/><p>However, since the men of West-Hill Divine Palace wanted to borrow the sword to do a dirty job, the unapproved borrowing could be regarded as borrowing.</p><br/><p>Even if this was stealing in others' eyes, it was still borrowing.</p><br/><p>After all, Liu Bai was a visiting professor of West-Hill. He had to act on the orders of Haotian. What could he do to the Divine Palace's man?</p><br/><p>\"Regardless of whether Prince Long Qing died or not, he is ruined,\"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai looked at him and said.</p><br/><p>The disciple said respectfully, \"Indeed.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said, \"I also heard that Ye Hongyu was scrapped after she came back from the Wilderness.\"</p><br/><p>The disciple calmly said, \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai laughed and said, \"Will you return to Peach Mountain to take over as the Grand Master?\"</p><br/><p>The disciple also laughed and admitted with silence.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai laughed more happily, and said, \"Does it mean that you may become one of the Great Divine Priests in the future?\"</p><br/><p>The disciple smiled and remained silent.</p><br/><p>The smile on Liu Bai's face suddenly disappeared. He looked blankly at the disciple and said, \"Although it is an honor that my disciple can succeed as the high priest, I suddenly realized that if you really become the Great Divine Priest of Judgment, it would be hard for me to kill you.\"</p><br/><p>The disciple suddenly became stiff, and he looked across the small pool.</p><br/><p>\"Since you are not the Great Divine Priest of Judgment now, you have to pay for your stealing.\"</p><br/><p>The disciple's expression suddenly became chilly, and he wanted to say something, but he tasted something sweet in his mouth and sensed a slippery thing between his teeth. It was his own tongue.</p><br/><p>Immediately, his head was disconnected from his neck, and fell down on the bank floor. It rolled into the small pool. After a few moments, some blood showed on the surface of the water.</p><br/><p>The blind fish sensed the smell of food and began to spit blisters happily.</p><br/><p>The disciples who had been silently kneeling beside the pool walked up and began to clean up the headless body. They noticed that the neck cavity was smooth and bloodless, and the cut seemed to be covered with a transparent film. They could see the trachea, esophagus, the bones, and blood clearly. This scene made them feel sick.</p><br/><p>For Liu Bai, killing an important person of the Divine Hall Judicial Department was just like killing a mouse. The look on his face did not change at all, but when he looked at the letter from the Academy, he started to frown.</p><br/><p>\"Find Chao Xiaoshu, send him back to Chang'an City safely and trade my brother back.\"</p><br/><p>The disciples glanced at each other and went to carry out his orders.</p><br/><p>At this time, a middle-aged man came in from outside. He looked at the blood bubbles in the small pool. He sighed, walked towards Liu Bai and said, \"Senior Brother, is the problem solved?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said, \"If killing could solve the problem, then the world in my eyes would be much better.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man said bitterly, \"I heard that the Great Divine Priest of Judgment thought highly of him. He was prepared to have that man return to the Peach Mountain to take over Ye Hongyu's place. You could have just chopped off one of his hands, why did you have to kill him?\"</p><br/><p>After a short moment of silence, Liu Bai said, \"Bring me paper and pen.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The light from the top of the cave shone on the pool, the hut beside the pool and the people.</p><br/><p>Liu Bai sat on the bank of the pool, close to the light. He pondered for a long time before picking up the pen. He wrote slowly and casually on the yellowish paper.</p><br/><p>He was not writing, but drawing.</p><br/><p>The soft ink pen moved on the unbleached paper. Lines twisted and knotted and trembled from time to time. A few lines constituted a long and narrow hollow thing, but it was hard to identify.</p><br/><p>This picture was very crude and it looked like the work of a naughty boy.</p><br/><p>However, such a crude and simple painting seemed to exhaust Liu Bai. His face looked pale when shone upon by the water's reflected light.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man took a look at the painting and suddenly his body stiffened.</p><br/><p>\"Can you tell what I painted? \"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai asked.</p><br/><p>After being silent for a moment, the middle-aged man said, \"It is a sword.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said with satisfaction, \"Since you can tell that this is a sword, your state seems to have risen.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man forcibly suppressed his shock and asked, \"Who do you want to give this sword to?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said calmly, \"Send it to West-Hill and to Ye Hongyu.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man could no longer control his emotions. He kneeled behind Liu Bai and said in a trembling voice, \"Senior Brother, why are you doing this! Why do you want to send it to Tao Addict?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai looked at the paper in his hand and said, \"Because after the Priest of Light died in Chang'an City, out of the entire Peach Mountain, I only admire this woman a bit.\"</p><br/><p>\"But...but the Sword Garret and the Judicial Department have already turned against each other.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man said with anxiety and trembling, \"If Ye Hongyu really understands your sword style, and becomes powerful, will she be an enemy of the Sword Garret?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Bai said, \"Even if I don't give her this sword, the Tao Addict will still be able to pass that threshold. I just hope she can be faster.\"</p><br/><p>He lifted his head up and looked at the light from the peak. He said blankly, \"The damn Judge lent a sword to Yiqing. I will lend a sword to Ye Hongyu.\"</p><br/><p>Lending a sword was naturally aiming at murder.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Peach-Mountain of West Hill, a remote stone house.</p><br/><p>\"High Priest, I'm just a messenger, but please forgive me.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Bachi looked at Ye Hongyu who was before him. His eyes were attracted to the loose blue robes and then landed again on her beautiful face.</p><br/><p>He used to be the commander of Divine Hall's cavalrymen. Although he was forced to be tortured by Ning Que and lost his job because of the Black Ink Garden's disciples' confrontation with the Horse Gang. He was still in the Seethrough State, so he still had a very high position in the Judicial Department.</p><br/><p>In the past, his immediate supervisor was the Prince Long Qing but the person he feared the most was Ye Hongyu who was in front of him. Even if Ye Hongyu was down and out now, he would still find it difficult to breathe when he looked at her. He used the old title, and picked his words with extreme caution.</p><br/><p>After all, things were changing. Everyone in the Divine Hall knew that the Great Divine Priest of Judgment had suspended Ye Hongyu's job and asked her to repent.</p><br/><p>Perhaps influenced by this incident, Chen Bachi became a little more disrespectful than before. While Ye Hongyu looked calm on the outside, he looked her up and down, from her beautiful cheeks to her body.</p><br/><p>The reason why Ye Hongyu, Mo Shanshan, and Lu Chenjia were called as the Three Addicts in the World, was not just due to their high cultivation state, but also their beauty.</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu was very beautiful. Her figure had always been very good and attractive.</p><br/><p>Now her petite and enticing body was covered by the loose blue robe, but Chen Bachi had seen too much of her wearing a red short skirt. At this time, the wide blue robe seemed to disappear, exposing that pair of tight and straight thighs.</p><br/><p>The young girl was still beautiful and moving, and she was now in a dim situation, which had added a bit of realism to her charm, giving people some courage to possess this beauty.</p><br/><p>Chen Bachi's eyes were a little bit guilty, but he did not dare to think anything nasty, because he didn't have such courage. It had nothing to do with the majesty of Tao Addict in his mind. It was only related to what he was going to say today.</p><br/><p>\"Lord Luo Kedi is the commander of Hierarch and a confidante of the Hierarch Lord. My lady should be very clear about his cultivation state. If he is willing to join the competition battle for the Divine Priest of Judgment's position, the odds are great.\"</p><br/><p>Watching Ye Hongyu turning around, Chen Bachi respectfully lowered his head and said, \"If My Lady feels that this is feasible, the commander will come to show you his affection and determination. The Lord also said that as long as you agree, he would immediately go to the Hierarch Lord to propose marriage.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu looked at the respectful man before her, who was once her subordinate. After a moment of silence, she said calmly, \"I need some time.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Bachi said immediately, \"Of course, of course .\"</p><br/><p>Ye Hongyu slowly closed the door of the stone house and then sat on the stone bed in the shadow again.</p><br/><p>The commander of Hierarch had proposed to her. It was more than something she deserved; a pleasant surprise for a woman who had almost lost everything but beauty.</p><br/><p>Her expression was still calm, but the body in the loose blue robe started to tremble uncontrollably. The stone bed creaked and seemed like it would collapse at any moment.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ah, although I completed that easily.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t even anything special to mention about it.</p><br/><p>Apart from a slight incident where Selphy, who received notice that she passed, went on a small rampage and destroyed all the chairs in her room. What blissful normal, ordinary, regular, ever day life.</p><br/><p>And after that, we got wrapped up in talking about our grandpas again. I had no idea if my grandfather in this world was still around but no matter how I thought back, there was no mention of him at all, not to talk about meeting him.</p><br/><p>But they were the parents of both of my idiot parents.</p><br/><p>Not telling anything about their own parents meant, leaving aside if they were hiding it from me on purpose or not, something must have happened. If that was the case, asking about this over the phone\u2026.. communication tool would be kinda rude.</p><br/><p>Oh well, since I would be returning home for the summer holidays, I would just make use of that chance to ask about it then.</p><br/><p>So right now, I was currently using the dormitory cafeteria. Nope, I won\u2019t be entertaining any tsukkomi asking why the heck I was in there.</p><br/><p>Adding whipped cream into the milk, then put the sugar and egg yolk in before mixing it well. Humming a song under my breath, I began violently mixing it together. And as I mixed, I covered the bowl with mana.</p><br/><p>Of course, the chant would be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d I love you~ You love me~ \u300a\u300bit all, you bastard~! \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Reitou, Freeze. BTW, the original lyrics are: Chin pui pui, Chin pu~i]</p><br/><p>I chanted a freezing spell. Well then, you guys should know what I was making by now. Yes, I was making \u2018Vanilla Ice Cream\u2019 at the moment. But unfortunately, since I did not have any vanilla beans on hand, this was going to be simply a milk ice cream but since that sounded horrible, I would still call it as \u2018Vanilla\u2019 ice cream.</p><br/><p>No matter what anyone said, this was \u2018Vanilla\u2019 ice cream.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t you find that once the name was written in katagana, it became so much cooler? But if one used it too much, one would develop chuunibyo. Japanese sure was difficult.</p><br/><p>[TN: \u2026..Too much to explain, read the footnote.]</p><br/><p>\u201d Yosh, it hardens nicely. \u201d</p><br/><p>I had borrowed the cafeteria during the time around 2 hours passed lunch, where the sun was the brightest, yet before dinner. And well, since I was borrowing it free-of-charge, I allowed all the lunch ladies who were working in there to stay behind and have a look.</p><br/><p>It could be considered cheap if the cost for renting the cafeteria was only to endure all the gaze piercing my back.</p><br/><p>I am a generous gentleman.</p><br/><p>Well, in normal circumstances, an 8 years old boy who cooked while humming would definitely attract attention. If it was me, I would too, observe if a boy walked in while hugging all the ingredients, asking if he could borrow the cafeteria with bright sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>As these random thoughts went through my brain, the ice cream was done. The cooking song I was singing in my head finished at the same time as well.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well\u2026. then. \u201d</p><br/><p>I turned back, and smiled. I should probably first satisfy all the onlookers\u2019 (lunch ladies\u2019) curiosity. Also to thank them for renting the place out.</p><br/><p>\u201d Dear madams, would you like to have a taste? \u201d</p><br/><p>I activated the skill I learnt when I was 3 in order to deal with my father \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 Wolf-in-Sheep-Clothing. As the perfect young master\u2019s smile hung on my face, the lunch ladies began getting closer.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Spinel. \u201d</p><br/><p>Muttered the only person left behind in the Hattuo\u2019s King Throne Room. And silence answered him. It remained the same no matter how many times he tried. Surprised, the man frowned.</p><br/><p>The man who always appeared whenever he called out to him was not responding.</p><br/><p>It meant that the mission he gave Spinel failed. The mission to remove the son of Duke, William Beryl.</p><br/><p>In order for the man\u2019s plans to move along smoothly, he had planned to kidnap Gion\u2019s, the strongest knight in Elzmu, son, in order to use him for his plans but when he realized that the son himself was an obstacle, he had planned to nip in the bud but to think he hadn\u2019t made it in time.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he even lost an important pawn like Spinel.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will I make it in time\u2026\u2026 ? \u201d</p><br/><p>He mumbled to himself, as his body wobbled when he began walking.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Katagana is one of the alphabets of Japanese. They are usually used to spell out anything that did not originate in Japan, such as hamburger, or the foreign spelling of a word. For example, school, in Japanese Kanji would be  gakkou, while katagana would be \u30b9\u30af\u30fc\u30eb, sukuuru. Yay for Japanese English.</p><br/><p>I would be having a huge exam on Wed that determined if I could advance or not so please sacrifice yourself to feed me so I can grow even crazier and rampage around on Wed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

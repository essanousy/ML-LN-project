The days just flow by since it\u2019s the holidays\u2026 Sorry guys, here\u2019s the chapter, enjoy!</p><br/><p>\u201d Ladies aaaaaaaand Gentleman~!! We have kept you waiting! The very first Beryl\u2019s Fireworks Festival is starting! \u201c</p><br/><p>The loud voice resounded throughout the entire street and of course, to where we were sitting as well. As I laughed at how Zen and Selphy jumped at the sudden announcement, I turned my eyes towards the sky. I was sure there were many who were as surprised as Zen and Selphy. Thinking about that, I can\u2019t helped but grinned.</p><br/><p>The first shot of fireworks spread out in the sky. Truth was, it was my creation. I wanted to create something interesting since I was in another world. I managed to designed something that would take a super computer from my previous earth to compressed it into a shot. Although I had no idea what the speed of a super computer was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d Ehhhhhh?! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Why is words appearing in the sky?!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, I designed the fireworks out to create a sentence in the sky.</p><br/><p>BERYL</p><br/><p>I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS SHOW!</p><br/><p>Zen and Selphy read the message shining across the sky as they eyes sparkled. Magic was all about imagination. In Japan, they would try their best to somehow made a shape in the sky but over here, with the help of magic, this was easily doable.</p><br/><p>Ah, although I was just playing around.</p><br/><p>The cost would blow up if every shot of fireworks were to be made using magic. Plus, it would overturned the trait that \u2018it could be created even without the use of magic\u2018. In the first place, fireworks were beautiful even without magic.</p><br/><p>A few shots were then fired all at once. This time, even Father and Mother raised their voices. With a loud bang that seemed to even resounded throughout one\u2019s body, flowers colored yellow and white bloomed in the sky.</p><br/><p>The might of the fireworks lit up the surroundings. A enormous amount of mana would be needed if one were to use magic to duplicated the same effect. Which meant, the only ones able to do it would be people working in the castle. Which would in turn raised the cost if for a single firework.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wah\u2026! \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy clapped her hands at the sight of various colors of flowers blooming continuously. Then, a few flowers bloomed all at once. The entire show took around one and a half hour. In the middle of it, the 2 of them were simply sharing at the sky with their mouth wide open.</p><br/><p>Then, there was a pause.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ahh\u2026.. That was amazing! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen exclaimed. I then shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ha ha ha. It\u2019s not over yet, look. \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked up at the sky again and the 2 of them followed. At that moment, a yellowish-green colored flower bloomed in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wah! That\u2019s mine! \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s mine! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen pointed to a shape that had a circle with a star inside. I nodded as my smile deepened. Next up was mine again.</p><br/><p>A white \u2018flame\u2019 bloomed into a red flower following by a \u300e\u300fshaped firework as it turned into green sparkles as it fell. Yes, my image was a magic circle. Anyone going to school would be able to recognized that shape, as in I tried using kanji. Even to me, it had a very japan feel to it.</p><br/><p>[TN: , mizu, water]</p><br/><p>Lastly.</p><br/><p>Buoooohhhhhhhhh!</p><br/><p>A roar sounded as a greenish-white line was drawn in the sky. Then a loud bang was heard as it fired, producing a dragon-shaped that looked like it\u2019s soaring up into the sky before dispersing.</p><br/><p>Next up would be the finale as usually seen in Japan. White and golden colored \u2018willow\u2019 or \u2018chandelier\u2019 spread across the sky and brightly lit up the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Everyone here stared at the sky, too amazed to even make a sound.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d And so, the firework festival for today is over! Thank you for watching! \u201c</p><br/><p>After hearing the host announcing the end of the show, I had an urge to shout \u2018TA-MA-YA\u2019. If I really did that then I would definitely be in the center of attention. And I then be labeled as someone weird.</p><br/><p>I would really like to avoided that if I can. Since I was already being thought as one even under normal circumstances. I had been noticing gazes that said \u2018It can\u2019t be helped since it\u2019s Will\u2018 a lot lately.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I do not wished to be labeled as an eccentric person as all I wanted was to be someone normal. Ah, but since they were still willing to stay by my side, was it better to continued on this road..?</p><br/><p>No, definitely no.</p><br/><p>What was I thinking, happily accepting the role of a weird guy? That was close, that was close. I almost thought that wouldn\u2019t be bad as well.</p><br/><p>\u2026And enough about that.</p><br/><p>Although I was the one who planned this show, the completion was way better than what I expected. Professional were indeed professionals. The aura of a craftsman could be felt strongly from Master Bran as well. It had been fun talking to him from the start.</p><br/><p>Gurus-san felt like a normal salesman but as the talk went on, his eyes began sparkling whenever he saw me. Whenever he called me a \u2018revolutionary\u2019, I had the urge to called him a \u2018strange uncle!\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201d That was amazing\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen muttered as Selphy and I nodded strongly at his word.</p><br/><p>\u201d There would be another show next year too, right? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep. \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy asked, looking at me with eyes full of expectation and I nodded immediately, affirming it.</p><br/><p>\u201d I wanna visit this place again next year! \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy said happily in response to my affirmation.</p><br/><p>\u201d Please do! Zen too! \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, smiling happily as Zen nodded at my invitation. Even though a lot of things happened, I managed to met my goal of making it an event for friends to hang out together. I wish, that our friendship would go on forever.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: Will made a friendship declaration to go on forever.</p><br/><p>Selphy-chan\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>TN: Don\u2019t write it that way if you\u2019re sad for Selphy! Although I\u2019m on Chiffon\u2019s ship\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh yes, as for the \u2018TA-MA-YA\u2019 yelling thing, it is a famous thing in Japan for people to yell that after a fireworks show as in Edo period, one of the the workshop for fireworks is called Tamaya. They used to compete with other workshops and people would then cheer for the workshops they like.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t ask me why they only cheer for Tamaya though. Ask Google-sensei.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

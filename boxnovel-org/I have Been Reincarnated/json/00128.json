As my chuunibyo-ness was overflowing at that book, I noticed the title.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300a\u300bwas it\u2026 fu fu fu fu fu. \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Explaination in the main text]</p><br/><p>Oops, I accidentally released a weird laughter. According to Father, this seemed to be a fairly old spell book handed down from the Beryl\u2019s family but because it was only half-filled with magic circles formation so it was left forgotten on the shelves.</p><br/><p>The norm for a spell book was having the explaination and the chant of what the magic circle was for, written in this world\u2019s language. Because if one activated the magic circle without knowing what it was for, an extremely large amount of mana would be needed / wasted. Plus, this book was filled with incomplete and imperfect magic circles formations.</p><br/><p>I wondered why the magic didn\u2019t start up.</p><br/><p>Although research about magic circles were still in progress by the royal scholars, the magic circles from this book were unable to be copied so they gave up and returned the book back to Beryl\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>But for me, finding out the reason to why the magic formations failed was an easy task. Because this was a diary. No one would jot down magic circle formation in their diary.</p><br/><p>\u2026.If they did, it would be a glorious black history for them.</p><br/><p>Eh\u2026. It might be that guy who did this.</p><br/><p>I thought back to all the \u2018stuff\u2019 that were left behind.</p><br/><p>That guy was an examplary chuunibyo patient.</p><br/><p>A book that was passed down throughout the generations, moreover, it was written in Japanese\u2026 There was only one person that came to mind as to who wrote this diary.</p><br/><p>A wry smile hugged my lips as I opened the cover and froze.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Eh!? \u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, surprised came out from my mouth. Why\u2026 why\u2026 why.. in this place\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Terao Azuma\u2026.!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Did any of you remember?</p><br/><p>I did. Very vividly.</p><br/><p>I hadn\u2019t heard that name for 8 years but it was still imprinted in my memories. This name\u2026 this was the name of my only friend on earth!</p><br/><p>\u201d Terao is\u2026 the First Founder\u2026..? \u201d</p><br/><p>Or\u2026 It might simply be a person with the same name. Countless of excuses ran through my mind as I flipped through the diary.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d It is the time for dinner. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mary-San\u2019s voice snapped the me who was reading quietly in my room, out of my concentration. What the heck was I doing?! This was the first time in my life that I invited friends over and I hid in my room the entire time!</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>I sat there, still, like all the strength had been taken from me, unable to move. I was sorry to make Mary-San worried, but I really can\u2019t move at this moment.</p><br/><p>I pulled out the ultimate skill I learned after dealing with Father, [Wolf-in-Sheep-clothing] and smiled at Mary-San.</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019m sorry, Mary-San. I was so focused on reading the book that I didn\u2019t notice that my body had gone numb. \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, I snapped the book shut. In my dumbfounded state, my heart was beating with complexed feelings but right now, Zen and Selphy were more important.</p><br/><p>The content in this book was very very important to me, be it Shou, or Will, or Williams Beryl, a citizen of Elzmu. But time was limited and I had to placed importance of those in order. And right now, the important thing was this big event of having my friend visited my house. That\u2019s how important it is.</p><br/><p>Looking outside the window, the sun had not completely gone yet, letting out a beautiful glow. Go Summer! This was good. Although time were taken by this unforeseen matter, I still have plenty of time to play with Zen and Selphy.</p><br/><p>Because, I had gathered together, even from my past life, all the things I wanted to do with my friends! There were a lot of things I wanted to do!</p><br/><p>\u201d Yosh, let\u2019s go, Mary-San. \u201d</p><br/><p>Strength flowed into me as I jumped up. There was no time to lose! Wait for me, Zen, Selphy! Let\u2019s play! Fuhahahahahahaha!</p><br/><p>\u2026..What character was this? Let\u2019s stop, it\u2019s getting sad. This lonely tsundere Demon King character was a bit hard for me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, Young Master. Every one is already there. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mary-San said, smiling gently at me. With a renewed vigor, I walked down the long corridor, heading towads the dining area.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

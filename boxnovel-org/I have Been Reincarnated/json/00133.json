Where? Where? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen, who was blindfolded, helplessly moved one step to his right.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s too right! Go back a little! \u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Zen moved back too much. He was like the fox. Without thinking, I let out a chuckle. I once read a tale from Aesop\u2019s Fables, which talked about a dog and a cat fighting over a piece of meat. A fox nearby then suggested using a scales to split the meat equally. The crafty fox then began to eat away the excess meat in order to balance the 2 pieces of meat and ate it all up in the end.</p><br/><p>Helpless Zen was amusing though. He seemed to had gotten cocky and regardless of how Selphy\u2019s instructed him, he had moved in a totally direction from the watermelon.</p><br/><p>I opened my mouth as the corners of my lips curled up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Zen, take a step towards your right around 10cm. Yep, that\u2019s it. Now raise the bat in front of you\u2026. swing it clockwise at a 15 degree angle! \u201d</p><br/><p>I gave Selphy a \u2018how\u2019s that\u2019 look.</p><br/><p>Hehehehe.</p><br/><p>You need detailed instructions like this for it to work. It was this kind of moment that made me felt alive! Viva knowledge! Totally different from the temporary knowledge one gained by cramming all they can the night before an exam!</p><br/><p>\u2026Ouch! Stop throwing rocks! How childish!</p><br/><p>I am a fair and just person who will not let children just because they were young. Although there was no victory or defeat for watermelon smashing.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just in the heat of the moment.</p><br/><p>As per the rules, I spun Zen around, who was blindfolded, before starting the game. This was a game for others to lead the blindfolded person towards the watermelon and smashing it, but the spinning around in the beginning was enough to messed up one\u2019s direction sense.</p><br/><p>But I seemed to had spun him one too many times. I got excited and spun Zen until I think I saw stars. I can\u2019t helped it, this was the first time one of my dreams came true so I got really high.</p><br/><p>\u201d Right there! \u201d</p><br/><p>As Zen slowly swung his bat around, I gave a yell when his bat reached the top of the watermelon. Zen nodded at my instructions and raised his bat.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026.! \u201d</p><br/><p>He fell. Zen fell splendidly.</p><br/><p>\u201d *chuckles* \u201d</p><br/><p>A chuckle escaped from my mouth. Even laughter could be heard from Selphy standing beside me.</p><br/><p>Seriously! How scary was his ability to make one laugh?! Oh, Zen! There was no other way about it. I am truly convinced. The god of laughter loved him. He must had divine protection or favor with the god.</p><br/><p>All the way up till he swung the bat was perfect. But it seemed like he used to much strength in swinging the bat that he slipped on the mat. And he splendidly did a beautiful fall. The kind where one landed on one\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>Not to mention him falling perfectly on top of the watermelon. Gravity was certainly doing it\u2019s job.</p><br/><p>\u201d Zen, so, sorry. I should have secured the mat firmly. Are you okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>I apologized to Zen, holding on to both my stomach and my laughter. Zen, who was still blindfolded, raised his head to where my stomach was and laughed sheepishly.</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019m okay! I guess I used too much force. \u201d</p><br/><p>But since Zen didn\u2019t looked like he was in pain from hitting his stomach, I guess there was no harm done. That\u2019s great. But I was still the one at fault for not securing the mat.</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019ll heal you just in case. \u300a\u300b. \u201d [TN: Chiyu]</p><br/><p>I cast a healing magic on Zen\u2019s stomach. And at the same time, restored the smashed watermelon. Seeing that, Zen had a weird expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201d To used the legendary healing magic like that\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>On a watermelon. Not to mention it was just for fun. I knew he was thinking about all that but please, wasting food was a big no-no. 1 grain of rice hold 7 gods.</p><br/><p>Ah, but this world doesn\u2019t had that many gods. Just one. That grandpa. I wondered if he already shaved off his beard.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then! I\u2019ll go next as an apology! \u201d</p><br/><p>Taking the blindfold over from Zen, I blindfolded myself. And was then spun around by the both of them.</p><br/><p>Yep.</p><br/><p>I must had spun Zen around too much the first time. Because I was spun around quite a bit. But me, who possess [cheat], this was nothing. I immediately regained my bearings.</p><br/><p>Too bad! I am really good at watermelon smashing!</p><br/><p>Eh? How did I know about this since I had never played this game with anyone before? Don\u2019t ask! You already knew, don\u2019t you\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201d The watermelon is\u2026\u2026 here! \u201d</p><br/><p>I pointed my bat.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wah!! You\u2019re awesome!! \u201d</p><br/><p>I heard Zen\u2019s voice. It seemed like I pointed in the correct direction. Well, I can sense it\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>Living things in games or manga were often depicted to had a [presence] but here, [presence] meant using sound or the wind as a way to feel what\u2019s around you.</p><br/><p>On other (previous world) words, the sixth sense.</p><br/><p>By using the reverberation of the sound, I could determined where someone was going as they moved.</p><br/><p>But a watermelon had no presence.</p><br/><p>Yep.</p><br/><p>Because it can\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>If it did, it must had been possessed.</p><br/><p>So why was I thinking of this? I am an idiot, I apologized. I felt like sensing [presence] since I was blindfolded to see if I could sense anything.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hmmm\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Then how do I sense stuff that doesn\u2019t move? There was this thing called [mana] in this world. Everything in this world possessed mana, which was how I sensed it.</p><br/><p>Normally, mana given out by vegetation was so weak that it could hardly be sensed. But, I had my [cheat].</p><br/><p>But, since this was a game, it wouldn\u2019t be fair. So I shall stop sensing. Although I could also produced sound and tried to use that to determined the place of where the watermelon was at\u2026 Nah.</p><br/><p>The fun part of this game was to get lead around by your friends as you played together and not really that the smashing part.</p><br/><p>And so, I readied myself and waited for the both of their instructions.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

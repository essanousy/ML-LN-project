Previously I kept on getting linked back to the digest chapters so I thought they were the same but hey!</p><br/><p>Not much difference so you can skip this if you want.</p><br/><p>That day, was a stunningly sunny day even though it was the rainy season, which put me in a good mood since morning.</p><br/><p>The place was away from the city, where you would need to change trains to get to. The countryside-ish slightly worn station was only crowded in the mornings and evenings, due to students commuting to and from school.</p><br/><p>Most of the state schools were situated here as the land was cheap.</p><br/><p>Luckily, even if I went to one of the schools here, the distance was not that I would need to take a bus from the nearest station.</p><br/><p>I would die if I was forced to exercise this much in the morning.</p><br/><p>[TN: It\u2019s just taking a bus\u2026]</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, I wouldn\u2019t even choose that kind of school in the first place. Right.</p><br/><p>Ah.. But the weather was so good today, so good that I felt like skipping all the way. The little sweat I had told me that summer was coming, made me happy. Blanking out as I walked, someone tapped me from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201d Shou, good morning! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm? Ah, morning Terao. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ehh.. Why was it not a girl from my class\u2026 was not that I was thinking. I was not thinking about it!</p><br/><p>Terao.</p><br/><p>My best friend. I only came to know him when I entered high school but due to our personality being similar, we got close fast.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2019s with that face?</p><br/><p>You must be thinking about something rude like ah, why is it Terao, right? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah. I was exposed. \u201d</p><br/><p>I laughed but reality was cruel.</p><br/><p>That dude was popular. That dude was what they called an \u2018Ikemen\u2019. [TN: Handsome] That dude was. Stop with the \u2018That dude\u2019 thing? Couldn\u2019t be helped, that was how I spoke ill of him.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026 I am jealous of your looks. \u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to the sunny sky, my heart was drizzling a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2019s that? Really\u2026you allllllways say that kind of stuff, I\u2019m so tired of hearing it. \u201d</p><br/><p>Terao said with a serious face. This daily conversation was almost a template for us. To the fact that you could call this as our greeting to each other.</p><br/><p>But\u2026uh.</p><br/><p>Even though I said that all the time, Terao was still kind to me. That must be why he was so popular.</p><br/><p>He could strike up a conversation with girls easily.. See, he was greeting them right now. Not discriminating to anyone, friendly, yet not frivolous and kind\u2026 That was Terao.</p><br/><p>And there was me.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t want to admit it but it seemed that I was hated.</p><br/><p>Every time I greeted them, they would say something in a tiny voice before turning red and running away. If I ever wanted to chat with them in the classroom, someone would come over and drag them away somewhere.</p><br/><p>What was so different about me and that guy!!!?</p><br/><p>\u2026Must be the face.</p><br/><p>Oh. While ranting in my heart, Terao was looking at me with a strange look.</p><br/><p>\u201d It..It\u2019s nothing. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that so suddenly was just like admitting that there was something! Should not have said that\u2026</p><br/><p>But Terao just said \u201d Okay. \u201d with a smile. What a gentleman. I needed to learn this.</p><br/><p>As I was nodding that the fact I had a good example by my side\u2026</p><br/><p>A vase fell.</p><br/><p>\u2026hm? Eh?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

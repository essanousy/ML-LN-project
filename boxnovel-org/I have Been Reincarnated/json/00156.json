Today, he chose to slept in his room at the student dormitory but as he thought, it was no good. The number of presences here at the dorm made it difficult for him to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>Plus, at this very moment, there was a presence making it\u2019s way towards him. No to mention it\u2019s coming via the ceiling. What a lack of common sense, to not use the perfectly good corridor but instead chose to travel through the ceiling instead. He looked towards the ceiling, preparing to give the incoming presence a good scolding.</p><br/><p>Even though he did it quite often himself. What a huge contradiction there.</p><br/><p>\u201d Who is it? \u201d</p><br/><p>Calius was feeling disappointed that he currently did not have the skill to recognized a person based on the presence alone. A Ninja would never make a sound when he / she was on a mission but it was not like he was on one right now. Since there was no other choice, he couldn\u2019t helped it but to asked who the person was in the ceiling.</p><br/><p>But even without the answer, he already had 2 person in mind. It was someone who could hide their own presence till they reached his room and after that, released enough presence to allow him to detected it. A person who could do that shouldn\u2019t even be here in the first place. Calius did knew that he came recently but to be able to do that was plenty weird in itself.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s me, Calius-senpai. \u201d</p><br/><p>He knew it. Without him realizing it, a smile had appeared on his face. There was not many in Phillis Academy who knew this secret passage in the ceiling other than the Ninja Family. Normal Noble kids who had been raised up carefully before sending them into the academy would never had paid any extra notice to the ceiling. Only an adult noble who had been through all sorts of trials would had noticed it.</p><br/><p>The best evidence was that no one had never found the secret passage in the ceiling till now. Thus he was very surprised by how Will managed to discovered the passage himself. [TN: Erm, your dad revealed it to him though.]</p><br/><p>But more so about how he could controlled his presence. No one would had thought that a 1st year lower acad student could do it since it was not taught yet. Not to mention he was only 8 years old.</p><br/><p>And to think Calius himself only found out about that passage recently. If it wasn\u2019t his hobby of observing people, he would had missed the hidden passage. And to had found and used it so easily, William Beryl was a person Calius found to be really mysterious. That peaked his interest and above all, he found Will really amusing.</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, the academy was truly a boring place for Calius. No one knew since he loved hiding behind his poker face as not to stand out but Calius was a very curious and competitive person. His hobby of observing people was not his interest, but instead a way of training in uncovering people\u2019s weaknesses. If not for training, he would had came to know everyone\u2019s movement without the need specially observed them since they all lived at the same dormitory.</p><br/><p>And the one to break that old boring mold, Will, became a very delicious lure in front of Calius. He was, at the same time, jealous of the fact that Will got to go on a mission with his father but that feeling was soon gone.</p><br/><p>Because the more he observed, the more he knew. That to fight with that Will was the most stupid idea one wold ever had. Will was that unusual.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, Will was unusual the very first day he stepped into the dormitory. He managed to opened the door despite having not yet learned any magic, that odd calmness of his that didn\u2019t fit his age when giving his self-introduction and also the way he read the atmosphere and adapted to the situation.</p><br/><p>Oh yes, and he did not gave his family name when he did his self-introduction. Of course, from the Ninja Family, there was no way Calius was as stupid as not to know that the son of the most prestigious noble family had skipped ahead of his peers and enrolled into the academy at the early age of 8. He realized it was Will the moment he gave his name but at that moment, Calius had thought Will was testing them.</p><br/><p>Having raised in the Ninja Family, Calius loved these kinds of scheming and secretiveness. To him who loved reading these types of stories since young, no one could blamed him for expecting it to happened.</p><br/><p>But now, he think that the reason Will did that was because he didn\u2019t want to stand out, or so that he could make friends without them minding his status. Even so, William Beryl was someone he had not fully figured out. Will\u2019s actions had always been so erratic that it was difficult to pinpoint but that was also why Will was so amusing to him.</p><br/><p>So what had Will done this time? Excited, the normally emotionless Calius had a bright smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Senpai, you always said that you want to go on a mission like the intelligence squad, didn\u2019t you? \u201d</p><br/><p>That question that came out of nowhere surprised Calius so much that he froze for a few seconds as he stared at the ceiling.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

(Zen\u2019s POV)</p><br/><p>Posted on January 2, 2017 by crazypumkin</p><br/><p>Editor: Poor_Hero</p><br/><p>TN: Last chapter before I go for my holiday tomorrow. Yes, I just dropped that casually.</p><br/><p>It was my first time setting foot into the capital and it was all very interesting! I finally arrived at the capital where Phillis Academy was located from my hometown, located at the countryside, excited. My aim was to skip grades and complete my education as soon as possible! The Academy came with a dorm and the capital\u2019s library was said to be the biggest one! Plus, Phillis Academy was the oldest academy around and it was rumored that one might possibly find things that the first founder had left behind.</p><br/><p>It was all very interesting to the me who came from the countryside, which had nothing, that I couldn\u2019t help but looked around restlessly. I love strange and weird things. They just shined so brightly to me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Uwah! \u201d</p><br/><p>I exclaimed, looking at the sky. Amazing! What a weird color for a tree! Despite being one, it had pink flowers blooming and were planted near the entrance of the Academy gates.</p><br/><p>I was sure I could find plenty of amusing stuff here!</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d It is this time of the year again, where seedlings plants their roots here and bloom beautifully\u2026\u2026\u2026First years, I congratulate you on your first day of school. \u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t really get what the Headmaster was trying to say. Sometimes adults were so difficult to understand. Was there any meaning to using a roundabout way just to say something simple? It was just a waste of time, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>\u201d Thank you, Headmaster. And so, the entrance ceremony is over. Students, please head towards the classroom that correspondences to the color of your student card you are given earlier. Once you exit the assembly hall, there would be upper classman guiding you so please do not worry. \u201d</p><br/><p>Glancing around, I saw that there were many whom had fallen asleep. I was almost going to, at one point. Then, according to what the muscular sensei had said, everyone stood up from their seats. They must had been bored.</p><br/><p>Well then, hmmm. Color of my student card. I looked at the card I was given. It shined a beautiful white.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s white! Cool! \u201d</p><br/><p>As to sensei\u2019s instructions, I began heading towards the person who was holding a white flag up, holding up the card high and skipping along the way. Because I was just so happy!</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, I did not see the person standing in front of me and bumped into him. To think I had already messed up! Because of this, my childhood friend used to call me \u2018a clumsy and inattentive fool\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..!! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Uwah, sorry, I did not see you there! \u201d</p><br/><p>I should apologize in moments like this. And I should look at their eyes when apologizing\u2026.. I was surprised at the child who turned back and looked at me. I mean, he was as cute as those angels from the picture books!</p><br/><p>How small!</p><br/><p>Did he skip grades?</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry, I am not paying attention as well. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Could it be that you skipped grades? By the way, I am Zen. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, kinda. I am only 8 years old so I am not a \u2018real\u2019 chibi! I am William Beryl, you can just call me Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>I see\u2026So he\u2019s only 8 years old\u2026. What was I doing when I was 8? Maybe only to the standard of running errand from the opposite streets. He\u2019s amazing.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Eh? Did he.. just say\u2026 his last name?</p><br/><p>Only Nobles have a last name. Father used to say it was because they were part of the older generations or something like that, I don\u2019t really understand. Anyway, Father said that if it\u2019s possible, praised anyone who gives their full name as they were most likely a Noble.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.That\u2019s amazing, you\u2019re a noble. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I am not that amazing. Only by chance did I get born into a Noble family. I did not do anything. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You\u2019re interesting, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Is that so? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, you\u2019re interesting, Will. I had thought Nobles were people who had a strangely strong pride. I wanna be friends with him. Plus, with that cute look of his, he used \u2018Ore\u2019. Was he trying to be older? Hehe.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Related Image :</p><br/><p>https://pumlated.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/relations.png?w=739</p><br/><p>Image taken from the website.</p><br/><p>TN: Opps, such a short chapter, did not realized that. Anyway, I came to realized how childish Zen\u2019s monologue actually was as compared to Will. Cute.</p><br/><p>Oh yes, holiday. I would be gone for 4 days so the next new chapters would be in around 5 days time\u2026. I hope. Happy new year!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

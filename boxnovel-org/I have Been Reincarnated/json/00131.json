My mental strength was depleted along with my physical one. Why, for all things, that I had to be rubbed on the face by a man with an average face that was exactly like the one I had?!</p><br/><p>Did he did it on purpose to make me hate him?! Did he?!</p><br/><p>If I was to be rubbed, I would really rather it be Chiffon\u2026 Ah no, I said nothing. If I did that then I would simply be a pervert.</p><br/><p>Seriously. Since I can felt his love for me, it was even worst. Rubbing my slightly reddened face, I hurried over to my seat. I might get attacked by Father again if I don\u2019t hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will is so easily embarrassed\u2026.! \u201d</p><br/><p>I glared at Father who was sprouting off his mouth. Please stop. Please stop providing Selphy with topics she could used against me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ufufufu. You are like always\u2026. Well then, I am sorry for letting you wait. Let us start our dinner. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mother said, smiling gently. That\u2019s right. It was a cruel thing to let 10 years old in the mist of growing to wait with food right in front of them. It was like placing a dish of dog food in front of your dog and not allowing it to eat.</p><br/><p>\u201d Guuuu\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>A sound was heard.</p><br/><p>Oh, how timely. Whose stomach rumbled, I wondered. And then, the person whose face reddened was none other then Selphy.</p><br/><p>\u2026Oh, so it\u2019s you.</p><br/><p>I had thought that it would be Zen since it looked like something he would do. I did not realized that I was looking at her with a grin on my face. Selphy shrunk even smaller as she hanged her head down.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will and Gion-Sama are really alike\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Just how alike were our grinning average face? Or rather Zen, you were really looking down on my [cheat] hearing if you thought I could not hear what you mumbled under your breath. He he he.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh my~, let us start! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s right. Well then, ittadakimasu. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d Ittadakimasu! \u201d</p><br/><p>At Mother\u2019s rushing, everyone raised their voices and started the meal. Hah, you all must be disappointed. The event where \u2018Explaining what ittadakimasu to everyone after you accidently said it\u2019 couldn\u2019t be done.</p><br/><p>Why? The reason was of course, the First Founder, Terao-kun\u2019s work. He had snapped that flag into 2. Because when he first founded Elzmu, he had spread the use of [Ittadakimasu] to everyone.</p><br/><p>Which meant, Terao, that guy, had experienced that \u2018Explaining what ittadakimasu to everyone after you accidently said it\u2019 event. Hm, don\u2019t think I\u2019m feeling envious because you did it.</p><br/><p>\u201d Delicious\u2026! \u201d</p><br/><p>As useless thoughts ran through me mind, Zen, who was eating hearty, muttered, trembling slightly. He seemed to be shaking from the deliciousness of the food.</p><br/><p>Oh oh, right~</p><br/><p>The maids and cooks in my house were awesome, weren\u2019t they! Before heading towards the Academy, I was really quite bored at home. So I sneaked into the kitchen a few times.</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t look down on me, who was once called the devil of working part-time.</p><br/><p>Ah, although I hasn\u2019t really been called that before. I know. I don\u2019t even had enough friends who would called me that. Ha ha\u2026. how empty.</p><br/><p>An, anyway, I did several food-related jobs before. And was even offered a full-time position.</p><br/><p>Simply, I am good at cooking.</p><br/><p>And so, I had freely shared my expertise with our house\u2019s cooks. You can say that they were my disciples. And these dishes were all cooked by them. To hear my disciples being praised really made me happy.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hahaha! Right? This dish is called \u2018Rolled Cabbage\u2019. It\u2019s cooked by slowly simmering orc minced meat rolled with cabbage in the meat juices! Isn\u2019t it delicious? \u201d</p><br/><p>Well, it can\u2019t be helped that I was feeling quite proud.</p><br/><p>\u201d Can it be that this dish had something to do with Will too\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen said, as his head whipped around and looked at me. With that proud expression on my face, I nodded slowly. At my affirmation, Zen\u2019s eyes sparkled.</p><br/><p>\u201d So you can even make such delicious food! Please marry me!! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wait wait wait a minute, calm down! I don\u2019t want to! \u201d</p><br/><p>At Zen\u2019s sudden declaration, I can\u2019t helped but threw in a tsukkomi after see how Mary-San and the other maids tried to suppressed their laughter.</p><br/><p>Stop it!</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t have any dating experience but it didn\u2019t meant I went that way! Although I\u2019m happy Zen loved my dishes but why had it came to that?!</p><br/><p>Zen was still as air-headed as ever.</p><br/><p>I panted a little from over-using my strength at tsukkoming. Then, as if realizing what he had just said, Zen\u2019s face went red. Please stop with that kind of reaction. It would only introduced more misunderstandings. There would be major problems happening if there were any corrupted ladies here.</p><br/><p>I grew wearily, thinking back to all the rumors I had in my past life. Moreover, Selphy had a deeply-in-thought expression on her face. I wondered what she was thinking. Maybe she was just feeling grossed out by imagining Zen and I being married.</p><br/><p>\u201d Cough. It was a famous person around here who made that dish and not me. Besides, I\u2019m sorry to say but I love girls. Yep. \u201d</p><br/><p>I coughed and although it was a little late, I tried setting things right. But, when my eyes met with the maids, they immediately averted their eyes away with a great force. And Mary-San\u2019s eyes had a warm sheen to them.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will, you\u2026 To say that you love girls at your age\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Father went up and threw a tsukkomi straight at me. It seemed like I said something weird in mist of all that confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201d I feel uneasy for Will\u2019s future\u2026. Ufufufu. His future will be unpredictable. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mother said happily, laughing. Ah, even I would think the same way if I were to heard an 8 year old said he loves girls.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh no\u2026. Will\u2019s dangerous\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>I came crashing to the ground after hearing what Selphy muttered. I kinda hate my [cheat] right now. This was definitely a misunderstanding!</p><br/><p>To think the summer event of having my friends over at my house was just beginning. Ah, that uneasy feeling I had before must be about this dinner.</p><br/><p>I truly prayed that I would be able undo this misunderstand before they went home.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Normally, that was. There existed people whose \u2018world\u2019 got smaller instead. What the heck, that\u2019s me. Oh, whatever. What I wanted to say was, besides the \u2018world\u2019 that I knew, there were definitely other \u2018worlds\u2019 out there.</p><br/><p>In other words.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026Where\u2026was I?</p><br/><p>I only knew that this was a very narrow place. For some reason, my field of vision was all dark and I felt like I was wrapped up and floating.</p><br/><p>It seemed like I had arrived at a \u2018world\u2019 I had never seen before. In short, another world. Without making it short, it was still another world. Wha\u2026..haaa.</p><br/><p>To affect the way I grasped what a \u2018world\u2019 was only if I had been through it once as a human. Since textbooks usually did not teach about other worlds\u2026They didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Yep.</p><br/><p>Going straight to the point.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.That dude who was god said so.</p><br/><p>Which meant I was on the path of being reincarnated into another world.</p><br/><p>Could I backtrack? I was going to do that.</p><br/><p>\u2026Heck, who I was asking anyway\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>The vase hit my head directly.</p><br/><p>The world started spinning in slow-motion.</p><br/><p>The vase touched the top of my head, little by little, as the pressure was felt, my skull cracked.</p><br/><p>I died\u2026!</p><br/><p>As I was thinking that, I realized my surroundings were a field of flowers. This was heaven? But I was sure I had not been through the wheel of reincarnation or King Enma or the last judgement?</p><br/><p>Dying was surprising boring.</p><br/><p>Having died by a vase, I really did not want to wake up amidst a field of flowers. My head was not full of flowers! And I started meaningless arguments with myself.</p><br/><p>\u2026 While I was doing that, the field of flowers disappeared, leaving behind blinding white space all around.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am really so sorry!! \u201d [TN: He\u2019s doing old man\u2019s speech]</p><br/><p>And suddenly someone jumped and knelt in front of me\u2026 An old man.</p><br/><p>[TN: He was doing dogeza]</p><br/><p>Erm\u2026 What was with this situation?</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm, what is happening? Please raise your head. \u201d</p><br/><p>For now, I went along with the situation. An explanation would be good now.</p><br/><p>\u201d You would forgive me? \u201d</p><br/><p>The old man raised his head in a snap, eyes sparkling.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.Not amused.</p><br/><p>I was not feeling happy despite the fact I was in heaven.</p><br/><p>\u201d This is not heaven. \u201d</p><br/><p>The old man said. Hm? Have you stopped apologizing? Or rather, this person, was he reading my thoughts?</p><br/><p>\u201d I am not a human but a god. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026For. Real?</p><br/><p>It must be since I was in a heaven-like-space.</p><br/><p>\u201d Please don\u2019t tell me\u2026 that I died because of\u2026you? \u201d</p><br/><p>I asked, remembering the web novel I was into at the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, it is. \u201d</p><br/><p>He puffed out his chest.</p><br/><p>\u2026This guy\u2026..He was definitely not regretting this!</p><br/><p>\u201d Please listen to my reason? \u201d</p><br/><p>I was tired of retorting. I sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh\u2026 Ah, my beard caught onto the plants without my knowing.. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026His beard.</p><br/><p>The reason for my death was his beard, because of his beard.</p><br/><p>My shoulders sagged.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..And? What should I do? \u201d</p><br/><p>I hugged my head, giving up.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.You accepted that pretty fast. \u201d</p><br/><p>God said, shocked as he looked at me with eyes peeking from underneath his long eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026Haa\u2026 Even if I make a fuss.. Though I cannot forgive you for causing my death with a smile, being angry doesn\u2019t mean you can send me back, right? \u201d</p><br/><p>At that, God looked at me, still shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201d Even so, normally one would still fight against this fact. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah. That was right.</p><br/><p>It must be because I was a lonely existence.</p><br/><p>My sigh got seen by God.</p><br/><p>\u201d And, what\u2019s gonna happen to me? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Sorry, but you can either choose to reincarnate or disappear. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was not disappearing! That\u2019s horrible!</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026. I\u2019ll reincarnate. \u201d</p><br/><p>At that answer, God nodded deeply and said \u201d This time really\u2026 \u201c. I did not pay attention to most of it but it ended with \u201d To truly apologize, I will grant you any of your wishes. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026In that case\u2026 I did not want to be hated as like my previous life.</p><br/><p>\u2026Experience\u2026I would keep it.</p><br/><p>\u201d I want to have all of my memories of this former life. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Is that all? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d If I ask too much it\u2019s scary. \u201d</p><br/><p>I laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>Tongue-Cut Sparrow was the biggest trauma from my childhood.</p><br/><p>[TM: It\u2019s a folktale, search it up.]</p><br/><p>\u201d I see. \u201d</p><br/><p>God smiled gently upon hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201d And so. Let\u2019s send you on your way. \u201d</p><br/><p>At that, my body was wrapped in a warm glow.</p><br/><p>\u2026Ah, right, there was something I would like to say.</p><br/><p>\u300a Side: God \u300b</p><br/><p>\u201d Please shave your beard. \u201d</p><br/><p>The young man wrapped in light disappeared from the white space.</p><br/><p>The young man wrapped in light disappeared from the white space.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hmm, the beard eh.. \u201d</p><br/><p>God happily twirled his beard around his fingers and started playing with it.</p><br/><p>\u201d What an amusing fellow. I wanted to grant him [cheats] but did not get to. Such a small wish too. Makes me seemed like the bad guy here. \u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing, god handed down an order.</p><br/><p>\u201d For now, let\u2019s just make all of his abilities maximum. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u300a Side: Shou \u300b</p><br/><p>And so, we returned to the beginning of this chapter.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026..!!!!!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, my world started shrinking. My head was splitting and it felt like something was pulling me along.</p><br/><p>Wuuuuuahhhhh\u2026pain! \u2026.I am dying\u2026</p><br/><p>Then. Light.</p><br/><p>\u201d Gkyaaaaaaaaaaaaa (It hurtsssssssss)!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.Ah, can it be that it was my delivery just now?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although he was really cute when he was awake, he was really cute when he was asleep too. Though wrinkled, he really looked like that person. The chances of him growing up with a well-featured face in the future was high.</p><br/><p>I could not wait for Will to open his eyes.</p><br/><p>I lowered Will, who was sleeping soundly in my arms, onto the bed. Well then, the level of tiredness of having just given birth was high but do not underestimate the strength of a mother!</p><br/><p>\u2026.I entered the room next to my bedroom and even though the day was still bright, I changed into my night dress.</p><br/><p>It was no good. I was really tired.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the sofa, I relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Gyaaaaaaaaaa! \u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud voice could be heard from the room next door. Oh my, Will was awake. I snapped up from the sofa, trying not to make a sound, opened the connecting door between the rooms and rushed over to Will\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if he is hungry\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked into his crib [TN: Isn\u2019t he lying on a bed?] and saw that even though Will stopped crying immediately, he was sporting a sad face. I was sorry to keep you waiting.</p><br/><p>As this was my first time nursing, I was nervous. I wondered if he was drinking it all right.</p><br/><p>But this was a good thing as I did not have to worry about food for a while. Ah\u2026was that the wrong word to use?</p><br/><p>After drinking silently for a while, Will smiled, looking like he was satisfied, and opened his mouth. Was it my imagination that he seemed to look at me, smiling, looking like he was trying to say that he was already done? \u2026..It must be.</p><br/><p>I mean, he was just born moments ago! Hmm\u2026.but if that was really the case, my child was a genius!</p><br/><p>I followed the advice of Mary, who was my Senpai in both life and motherhood (even though she would never admit it), and timidly moved him to my left shoulder. Erm\u2026 I was to pat his back gently I thought. After a few pats, Will burped.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Burp. \u201d</p><br/><p>That was it\u2026.?</p><br/><p>If I was not mistaken, usually the first time a child would vomit out milk\u2026 My child was excellent!</p><br/><p>\u201d Are you full, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he could not understand yet, it was important to keep talking to him. That was why I would keep talking to him about trifling matters. With all my love.</p><br/><p>After a while, Will started to get sleepy.</p><br/><p>Oh my, this child was doing things at his own pace.</p><br/><p>Really, why was he so cute?</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN : Isn\u2019t it nice? You are being seen as smiling and not grinning.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

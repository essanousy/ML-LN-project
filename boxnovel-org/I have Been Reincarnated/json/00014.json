It looks like he have a lot of things he needs to try his best on.</p><br/><p>Having seen my Father\u2019s plain features a while back, I received an unfathomable shock.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will really looks like you, dear. \u201d</p><br/><p>That comment from Mother sent me over the edge.</p><br/><p>Why did I not ask god to make me a Ikemen?! [TN: He just made you a SUPER Ikemen.] How regretful.</p><br/><p>But, come to think of it, having a handsome face might not mean anything. I mean, just look at how my plain-looking Father could get Mother. Father just taught me that in this world, a face was not all that was! (So rude)</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, in my previous life, there was a person who was popular even though his face, sorry for saying, was not one of the best out there. That was why, face, even though this was just me escaping from reality using just a simple reason, as long as I made an effort, would not mean a thing! Yes, I was just trying to make life simpler for myself.</p><br/><p>Yep. This time, in this world, I would try my best!</p><br/><p>I said, Mother, Father.</p><br/><p>I knew you had not met each other for a while now, but would you mind not flirting with each other here?!</p><br/><p>My broken heart was breaking even more\u2026</p><br/><p>I would try my best!</p><br/><p>[TN: Now, this next passage I don\u2019t really understand but it seems like he is playing a connecting game\u2026]</p><br/><p>Ah, \u2018My broken heart\u2019 sounded like what a foreigner would use.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s play with that\u2026.starting with \u2018Foreigner\u2019, \u2018Headaches hurt\u2019, \u2018The First of the first\u2019, \u2018The feet of Pig\u2019s feet\u2019 till the last was \u2018A foot that looks like a foot of a Serow\u2019.</p><br/><p>The last one was slightly wrong. According to my friend\u2019s opinion, \u2018A foot that looks like a foot of a Serow\u2019 meant a foot was attached to the head, torso and limbs of a Serow, the meaning of boundless grotesque. [TN: Real meaning, to compliment on someone\u2019s legs as long and strong like a wild goat\u2019s. It\u2019s supposed to be a good thing\u2026I think]</p><br/><p>Thinking of it now, why was I thinking about such stupid and meaningless stuff? That must be because I was trying to distract myself.</p><br/><p>By my side, a weird atmosphere drifted in the air. Don\u2019t you dare drift over here. I would punch someone.</p><br/><p>All right! Situations such like this meant sleeping. Sleep\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>After desperately hypnotizing myself, I fell asleep. When I came to, soft white light shining through the window made me understand that it\u2019s morning.</p><br/><p>Next to me was\u2026.Nice, it looked like they had already woken up.</p><br/><p>Recently, I came to understand what my body was trying to tell me and I also managed to have self-control. I began to daydream, ignoring my hungry stomach. [TN: A baby should pay more attention to eating!]</p><br/><p>It took me a long time to get to here. I tried my best.</p><br/><p>It had just only been a few days? See here, calling for somebody by crying for a Japanese like me was so embarrassing that I could not bring myself to do it, even though I knew I should not. It took so long~</p><br/><p>Saying that, I was pleased with myself being able to stay calm in spite of hunger.</p><br/><p>Currently the sphere of my life revolved around this room like \u2018THE\u2606HIKIKOMORI\u2019 [TN: People who stay stuck in their rooms and don\u2019t go out], it had only been a few days after I was born so there was no helping it. The room next door seemed like a place to change or to relax. This room seemed to be the bedroom with 2 doors, 1 to go out into the corridor and another which connected to the room next door.</p><br/><p>In the middle of this ridiculously huge room was a ridiculously huge bed where my parents slept and right across, to the side of room next door was my baby crib. As my neck still could not support my head, this was fine as I could not move but once I could, I would want to leave this room.</p><br/><p>Madam, I wanted information.</p><br/><p>But, the first barrier was this fence\u2026 This safety design of installing fence around the crib to prevented a baby from falling! To me this was an unwelcome favor.</p><br/><p>However, seeing this European-ish room, didn\u2019t it mean that Nobles and Knights exist in this world?! Was this not exciting?!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t get excited! Don\u2019t think that this is a Fantasy world!</p><br/><p>That was why, I was trying hard to get my neck to support my head and so, I started doing training with my hands and feet. As well as vocal exercises.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ga\u2026Uu\u2026I\u2026Wu\u2026U\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>It would look like I was only wriggling my limbs about.</p><br/><p>\u201d Shashuishu\u2026shesho! \u201d [TN: Japanese alphabets \u2013 Sa line, Sa Shi Su Se So.]</p><br/><p>I was weak at the \u2018Sa\u2019 line\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Will is wriggling about! Are you already awake? Are you crying? \u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened and Father walked in.</p><br/><p>I could hear his footsteps about 3 times as he walked on the carpet and carried me up. It must be because I was so small right now but Father looked so huge. No\u2026His height must be over 180cm. And though I said he looked like me from the previous life, there was some fantasy elements mixed in. Because his face looked Caucasian. That silky silver hair with green eyes. \u2018Who is this chuunibyo?\u2019 kind of feeling. I mean, silver hair and green eyes!</p><br/><p>But his face was plain so what a pity.</p><br/><p>\u201d Your mother is still changing so let\u2019s wait for her while you play with papa~ \u201d</p><br/><p>He said happily, stroking his face against mine. It was good that you were happy but, touch! That stubble of yours hurt, Father!</p><br/><p>\u201d Sha yuu beii bobaaree!! \u201d (Shave your beard properly!)</p><br/><p>I used all of my strength to resist as I wiggled my arms and feet about and yelled but my short limbs could not reach him so the critical hits kept on coming.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh! See your father made you so happy, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>Plus, not being able to speak properly made him misunderstand~!!</p><br/><p>Damn it\u2026I had to practice my pronunciation from now on! I would try my best!</p><br/><p>After that I was completely exhausted and so I obediently played with Father until Mother arrived.</p><br/><p>I\u2026 would try my best!!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN : Excuse me\u2026 Thank you for liking! It will still be at this slow-pace from now on but yoroshikuonegaishimasu!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The number of people increased so my heartbeat is raising\u2026And so.</p><br/><p>A child\u2019s work was to play, to eat and to sleep.</p><br/><p>I bade farewell to the 1 year of being a kid which I enjoyed very much.</p><br/><p>In that year I played with Father in the garden sometimes, had Mary San read pictures books to me, played building blocks with Mother. And also practicing magic when no one was looking.</p><br/><p>It seemed like in this world, the growth of the body was faster as compared and nowadays, I was eating what adults were eating. Eating food that Nobles ate.</p><br/><p>But somehow even though the ingredients were high-grade, there were times when the taste was so bland that I yearned for a stronger, junk-food like taste.</p><br/><p>Which I felt was such a pity.</p><br/><p>And that kind of me was finally turning 3 years old today!</p><br/><p>Finally! 3 years old!</p><br/><p>Actually, upon coming into this world, I made a promise with myself. 3 years old, it was 3 years old. When I could finally show my thirst for knowledge as well as speech and conduct. As I had memories of my previous world, I came to the conclusion that it would not be strange for a child to have a thirst of knowledge at 3 years old.</p><br/><p>Honestly, hearing all about Father\u2019s hero\u2019s tale and gossips about the nation from the maids made me unable to stop thinking about it!</p><br/><p>And finally the day which I could do something came and I was so excited.</p><br/><p>Ah, no, it was that I was excited about the party or looking forward to the presents or stuff like that. I was not.</p><br/><p>And that kind of me is finally turning 3 today!</p><br/><p>Finally! 3 years old!</p><br/><p>Actually, upon coming into this world, I made a promise with myself. 3 years old, it is 3 years old. When I can finally show my thirst for knowledge as well as speech and conduct.

I am not.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Young Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mary San took my hand and opened the huge door.</p><br/><p>\u201d Good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, we entered the room. I gave a small nod, and looked in front of me. A red curtain filled my sight. Splendor gold ornament embellished it, a rare sight in our house.</p><br/><p>And if I turned my head a little, what entered my sight would be people, people, people\u2026.</p><br/><p>Yes, today was my birthday party slash debut party.</p><br/><p>3 years old debuting was a little early but when I heard about it, my first impression was that it must be a custom among Nobles.</p><br/><p>Tentatively, it was the birthday of the eldest son of a distinguished family so a magnificent buffet was held, where the likes of Nation\u2019s high ranking officers and Nobles were invited.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Uwah, how very noble-ish\u2026 Even though I was a Noble as well\u2026</p><br/><p>Did I have to do courtesy calls? To become a Tanuki to find out what was their intentions? [TN: Meaning using sly methods to gauge their intentions or what they are thinking.] Well, I had been worrying about all these things but it turned out that because I was only 3 years old, my duty was only to do the introductory speech at the beginning.</p><br/><p>Ah, I was relieved.</p><br/><p>And thus, I was at the stage of a ballroom-like room in my house, standing at the side, behind the curtains, waiting for my turn.</p><br/><p>\u2026I was not..nervous..not but since I was only 3 years old, I could pretend to be innocent. Thinking of ridiculous excuses like that, I could remain somewhat calm.</p><br/><p>There was no royalty here. There was no state officers here. Everyone was a pumpkin! [TN: Me!]</p><br/><p>Yes, pumpkin\u2026no, that person might be an egg that looked like a pumpkin. Oh, I was about to burst into laughter, and thanks to that, my nervousness lessened.</p><br/><p>Thank so much, Egg-like Uncle. In my heart, you were THE Humpty-Dumpty.</p><br/><p>And as I was thinking about rude stuff like that, Father finished his greetings and my name was called on stage.</p><br/><p>On the palm of my hand, I wrote \u2018EGG\u2019 3 times and swallowed it down. I steeled myself and walked out of the curtain and onto the stage. [TN: Japanese custom is to write people, , 3 times on the palm and swallowed it down to prevent nervousness.]</p><br/><p>\u201d Oooh! \u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately all eyes were on me and astonished gasps could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u2026.E,eh?! Eh, eh, was there something wrong with me? Was there something stuck on me? It could not be, were my clothes torn?</p><br/><p>The EGG I just swallowed felt like it exploded somewhere inside me but somehow, I managed to control my expression and walked to the center of the stage slowly, minding my posture.</p><br/><p>I faced the front.</p><br/><p>I could see the Egg (-like Uncle). \u2026Phew\u2026I felt more composed.</p><br/><p>\u201d As introduced, I am Williams-Beryl. Today is my birthday party for celebrating me becoming 3 years old and I am really grateful to all of you for accepting the invitation. I hope you can enjoy yourselves and hope you have a great chime. \u201d</p><br/><p>Commotion stirred among the guests.</p><br/><p>Uwah\u2026Damn it, I fumbled!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it fine, I was only 3 years old! \u2026Of course, I guessed a Noble had to really do it properly\u2026</p><br/><p>I controlled the urge to hang my head and mustered the last of my energy. Pasting a pleasant smile on my face, I slowly and elegantly bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201d And so, let the feast start.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that one sentence from Father, the room became brighter.</p><br/><p>\u2026It must be light magic.</p><br/><p>I bowed once more, to the noisy guests who held wine or appetizers in their hand, and walked back backstage.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Hahhhh\u2026.I was tired.</p><br/><p>As I released a deep sigh, the door opened and I met eyes with Mary San.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You worked hard, Young Master. It was a wonderful speech. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026I fumbled though.</p><br/><p>But I accepted Mary San\u2019s compliment honestly. \u2026I think it was okay to not rub salt into my wounds.</p><br/><p>\u201d Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled, finally relaxed, and entered the room.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: EGG Uncle played a big role.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

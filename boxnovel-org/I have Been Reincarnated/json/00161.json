It had been some time since the last meeting. Ah, hmm, it really hadn\u2019t been that long, to tell the truth. But since I had been running between meeting Calius-senpai, John-Sensei, the Headmaster as well as trying to scout several others, it felt like it had been longer than normal.</p><br/><p>And, the current place we were holding our meeting was, in fact, inside a horse carriage.</p><br/><p>Yep, we were on the road. Not to mention the destination was set for Hattuo. Hm? You were asking me if Guta was released or not if that was the case? Ah, no no no no no, nope. This was my boss (the King), we were talking about, you know. The one who went ahead and cut off all the useless nobles and killed all those anti-kingdom rebels and stupid nobles, that Boss. That King Kesamu would never had allowed Guta to ran free, would he?</p><br/><p>Then why? I had been given the [Highest Order] to get Hattuo down under Elzmu rule as soon as possible. What an overbearing way of using people. In simpler terms, I was currently going over to \u2018observed\u2019 Hattuo. In even simpler terms, he knew about my teleportation magic, which allowed me to go and return whenever I wanted. Really, what an overbearing way of using people.</p><br/><p>Which results in the following members on this trip\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.eryl\u2026.. Commander Beryl. \u201d</p><br/><p>As those thoughts went through my mind, I realized that Guta was trying to engaged me in a conversation. It seemed like he had been calling me for some time. As I was still wrapped up in my thoughts, I accidentally looked at Guta with dazed eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sorry about that. I was thinking about something. What was it you want to talk about? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, we came out earlier than I expected and I was wondering if these few numbers of guards would be enough. \u201d</p><br/><p>Guta said, as he looked out the window. Well, it was true that the number of guards that can be seen was not much. These numbers would be adequate for passing through the street but it so happened that we were in in the middle of the grass plains heading towards the Iza River. Demon beasts often appeared along these areas so it was understandable why Guta was feeling insecure.</p><br/><p>\u201d Don\u2019t worry, these guards possess better skills than you thought. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That is\u2026! \u201d</p><br/><p>Guta seemed to had grasped the meaning behind my words. The members going along with us to Hattuo was consisted of members from the Black Knights Intelligence Corps as well as those with their unique set of skills that I scouted.</p><br/><p>It was a high-leveled group which possessed power that one normally could not imagined. And it seemed that Guta realized that as well. And their eyes were always \u2018observing\u2019. Not only just the citizen\u2019s reactions, they had to take in everything about the country we were about to take over.</p><br/><p>Information was important.</p><br/><p>Which was why, I had only chose those with skills. That did not meant that they were lacking in attacking power. At least Buu-san and Nyaru-san alone had the strength to go though the [Demon Forest].</p><br/><p>\u201d I see. \u201d</p><br/><p>Guta nodded and directed a smile at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d I don\u2019t really want to say this, but have you forgotten who is the strongest around here? \u201d</p><br/><p>It really wasn\u2019t something I should say about myself though. But I had decided not to be humble nor hiding my head under a rock this time around. As I had decided not to go easy, taking down Demon Beasts shouldn\u2019t posed a problem foe me. I can\u2019t say for sure there would not be anyone better, but I knew that I was one of the top in regards to Elzmu, or the Raiina continent, for that matter. So there should be no trouble with these Demon Beasts. If I were to ever fail, it would meant that most people in this world would die as well.</p><br/><p>Although I can\u2019t helped it if that really happened.</p><br/><p>At Guta whose face went tight with realization, I turned over and sighed. This\u2026. uncle. What should I say about him? Should I say he was easy-going or was his adaptability too high? To a person who wanted to kill me not long ago, he had totally no guard against me at all.</p><br/><p>And as if he had read my mind, Guta looked at me and gave a wryly smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d No matter how much a gifted child you are, you are still at an age where everything shows on your face. No.. Or is it that you trusted me? Your face is saying how can I be an Emperor like that. Most likely you are thinking that I have too little of a guard up, right? \u201d</p><br/><p>I could only stared in silence when I was being told that. What a blunder. It seemed like my poker-face was not working as well as I imagined. At the silent me, Guta laughed happily. With his face, all I could see was a villain doing his evil laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hahaha, I understand. I am not someone who would expose this to others. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Plus, it would be rude of me to put up a guard against you. \u201d</p><br/><p>The tiny murmur at the end of the sentence was caught by my [cheat] hearing. I could do nothing but tilted my head that that sentence.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>We went through the borders to Flowason easily. I had no good memories of Flowason at all. That vase placed at the window still, that kidnapping episode, not to mention that black history of cross-dressing. That black history of cross-dressing to invoked the pity of Flowason\u2019s guards and that kiddish, child-like behavior.</p><br/><p>Just that history alone made me felt like running away from this street as far as possible.</p><br/><p>Quite a few number of the Intelligence Corps members had separated from the group and blended into the street but as they had erased their presence from the start, no changes could be seen. The team was currently heading towards the Center-Tulle as we rode through the center street of Flowason.</p><br/><p>Center-Tulle was the central city of Hattuo.</p><br/><p>It was where I had crushed the hideout of the [Shadows] previously. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant place for me to stay at but considering Guta\u2019s stamina, it wasn\u2019t feasible to kept on the road so we were running towards our destination with the aim of staying for a while there.</p><br/><p>The horses were doing their best as well. Although this carriage was a magical tool created by me. It had magical circles for lightening and anti-shake on it. I wondered how long would it take for this tool to be spread around the world. Though I do not had the intention of making it known for now.</p><br/><p>Cheap and convenient magical tool spreading might not be a good idea, was what I learned from John-Sensei. Jobs available right now might be affected. Like those who reared horses and those who build carriages. The balance of the country\u2019s economy as well as the production output would hinged on the tool and that would not be great for the country.</p><br/><p>Besides, I had the very impossible [Highest Order] to get Hattuo under Elzmu ASAP to complete at the moment. This fast carriage was one of the advantages I had and I was keeping it up my sleeve for the moment. But I would open up the technology in the future. Because\u2026 the butt does hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201d There is a church in Center-Tulle and over there, the priests are in-charged. \u201d</p><br/><p>Guta, who had been looking out the window, spoke all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u201d I have heard about how capital belongs to the royals while Center-Tulle to the priests. Hm, no matter what, both are rotten. \u201d</p><br/><p>A bothersome piece of information came just as we were about to reached our destination. My mind started wandering. I heard of this information but having someone who experienced it said it increased the reality of it and made my head hurt. And surprising, Guta had an stern look on his face as well. I turned and looked at Guta.</p><br/><p>\u201d I might be rude, but the priests hid under the history of previous people who spoke of the massages brought by angels and god, and proclaimed themselves to be gods. They twisted the massages by god and made themselves unaffected by the law. In front of the law, they waved their religion as a sword and made themselves heard. They even managed to avoided paying the taxes. \u201d</p><br/><p>Guta, who had been speaking as he looked outside the window, turned and looked straight at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Did they thought that god was blind to all that they had done? \u201d</p><br/><p>I was caught in that gaze as the words rang throughout the carriage. I did not speak. When I first got hold of this information, I had though that, even in this world without religion problems, there still would be people who made used of it.</p><br/><p>In this world where god existence was confirmed, I did wondered how did they managed to did what they did without fearing. Because, god was a presence very close to me.</p><br/><p>And, to them without fear, I would be crushing them within my palm. The atmosphere turned heavy. My face turned stern, as of Guta, as I looked outside the window as well. The sky outside the window was clouded over.</p><br/><p>To Hattuo, winter was coming.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

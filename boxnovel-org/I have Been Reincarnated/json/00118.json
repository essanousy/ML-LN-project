You are indeed a son of Lily\u2019s and mine! I did think that you would win but really! By a lower acad first year! \u201d</p><br/><p>Gion stood up as his excitement levels rose. He had paid a close attention to the time and knew that the tournament would be just about ending and when the phone rang, he rushed to pick it up. The better result than expected made it hard for him to hide his joy.</p><br/><p>He continued to talk in high spirits with Will through the phone, chuckling throughout.</p><br/><p>\u201d It was all thanks to everyone\u2019s summoned beasts. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201d Well, it might look that way but it was the idea that won. You deserved the praise. \u201d</p><br/><p>As he continued praising his humble son, he began to reminisce about his boyhood.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Oiiiii!! Stop right there!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Today was another day of escaping. At the escaping side, Gion looked at his partner-in-crime\u2019s face and the both of them grinned. Then, at the forked end of the passage, they cleanly split up, one going to the left, while the other to the right. The black-haired boy who was chasing them, stopped as he wavered about which way to go. But that moment of waver cost him the both of them.</p><br/><p>\u201d Damn it\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>The 2, who looked down at the frustrated boy with his slicked back hair, looked at each other and grinned once again.</p><br/><p>Gion Beryl.</p><br/><p>He was the eldest son of the distinguished Beryl family of the current 12 year old Elzmu country. But the real him was\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201d Hehehehehe\u2026.. It went swimmingly well, Gion! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Aah, my crime-in-partner Kesamu! Everything\u2019s easy with this damascus ring! Fu hahahahaha!! \u201d</p><br/><p>He laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>Yes, the son from the highest ranking family was a Chuunibyo scamp. Moreover, he loved playing tricks.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yea. The face of Varino when he got [Kancho-ed] was the best! \u201d</p><br/><p>Kesamu laughed, his eyes a pair of slits. Yes, the one running around playing tricks on people with Gion was none other than the next king-in-line, Kesamu Tera Oi Elzmu.</p><br/><p>The 2 scamps often played pranks on their teachers as often as they played truant. But even so, they scored high marks when it came to their exams so it was frustrating.</p><br/><p>The black-haired boy just now, Varino, had stopped their pranks on the teachers the moment he became the dorm leader but that was because most pranks headed his way instead.</p><br/><p>This had earned him praises from the Headmaster and from the teachers as they were freed from the pranks but was it really a good thing for Varino?</p><br/><p>The poor Varino, who had his butt assaulted with a [Kancho] from Gion, held it with his hand as he went back to the classroom, eyes watering. The 2, who had waited for that, descended down from the ceiling. Gion even posed when he landed on the floor. Ah\u2026 the painfulness of Chuunibyo\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d What shall we do next? \u201d</p><br/><p>Gion laughed fearlessly. Many ideas started appearing in his head.</p><br/><p>\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be art if we are to repeat our pranks\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Gion flipped his soft silver hair as he grinned. The pranks from the 2 of them had quite a wide range. Like inserting the blackboard eraser between the doors (which was opened by Varino a second just before the teacher), or to steal his favorite food during lunch, or to ask about Liliana, who Varino seemed to have a crush on.</p><br/><p>There was one time where they used the organs of magical beasts which gave off such a putrid smell that they felt like they were really betting their lives with that one. And after that, the 3 years white class had a stinking classroom for a week.</p><br/><p>And the 2 vowed never to touch that one again.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, pranks were the reason for living to the both of them. The both of them had spent their childhood as good kids but from the moment they met at the Phyllis Academy entrance ceremony, they had surprising turned into a pair of troublemakers.</p><br/><p>But even so, their personality was still very likable and coupled with their looks, the [pranking] aspects of their personality was deemed as \u2018cute\u2019 by the girls. Serious boys like Varino was not as well-liked as them.</p><br/><p>Kesamu snapped his head up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Talking about scheming, Gion. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d What? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d The swimming tournament is around the corner, isn\u2019t it? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Aah! That\u2019s right! \u201d</p><br/><p>Gion remembered the time during the May festival where the both of them cross-dressed as they escaped. That was fun. Time sure flies.</p><br/><p>\u201d It is time for them to see why [Trickers](us) reputation is so high! \u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no one throughout the academy who called them that. This, guys, was a perfect example of what chuunibyo was.</p><br/><p>But, Kesamu, who was inflicted with the same illness, nodded happily.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>And then, it was finally the day of the tournament.</p><br/><p>It was the day the both of them had been looking forward too. The 2 of them randomly chose a speedy Beastman and an elf and had practiced hard for this. They were prepared.</p><br/><p>Gion looked at Kesamu, who was at the other end of the pool. Just nice, Kesamu was looking over as well. Their eyes met. Grins appeared on their faces and others, who were standing near them, shrank back when they saw it.</p><br/><p>Those 2 were well-known for playing pranks and they were trying not to get involved with whatever these 2 were planning to do.</p><br/><p>Not sure if he had known about their plans, the Headmaster gave the staring call. The first leg was Gion. He gathered his mana, which was way higher than anyone else, and activated his magic.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300a\u300b! \u201d [TN: Hidama, Fireball]</p><br/><p>As he posed with his right hand, a fireball was shot out from it. Gion was one of the rare ones who possessed double attributes, fire and wind. Everyone knew fire would be extinguished when it came into contact with water so they were expecting wind magic.</p><br/><p>But, wasn\u2019t he cool when he used the unexpected fire magic?!</p><br/><p>Gion then proceeded to dive all the way to the bottom of the pool. With his overwhelming mana, the fireball had evaporated the water from the pool. And Gion began giving his all in running to the other end of the pool. Without taking much time, his hand touched the wall of the pool</p><br/><p>Next was Kesamu.</p><br/><p>He was also a rare one, who possessed all attributes.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300a\u300b! \u201d [TN: Tsuchikabe, Earth wall]</p><br/><p>Walls were built to prevent water from rushing back and Kesamu ran as fast as he could. When other teams had only completed 2 rounds, they had completed 3.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>In the end, their team were disqualified for foul play. It was a tragedy induced by forgetting about the rule which one part of their body had to touch water. They had completely forgotten all about it.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, Varino won, and he was a part of Liliana\u2019s team. Liliana had frozen the water as they took turns in running down the pool. Gion and Kesamu were defeated with this one clever scheme.</p><br/><p>\u201d Come to think of it, that was the time I took an interest in Lily. \u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking back to his dark boyhood, Gion\u2019s face flushed red from embarrassment as he coughed. Since that tournament, Gion\u2019s pranks stopped. He began observing Lily, who devised that clever scheme, and had fallen in love.</p><br/><p>And he became Varino\u2019s rival in love as they fight it out in the open (?) for Lily\u2019s love.</p><br/><p>Of course, Gion won. Liliana\u2026.Lily, was the mother of his 1 year old child (Will). Her looks were beautiful as ever. Gion felt blessed to have his wife and a son he could boast about.</p><br/><p>\u201d I wondered if that guy, Varino, is well\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Gion, who was thinking of boasting to Varino the next time he headed towards the capital, was the same old Gion.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: I guess Will was not disqualified because his body touched water when he dived in. Gion\u2019s team was, because Kesamu did not touch the water at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

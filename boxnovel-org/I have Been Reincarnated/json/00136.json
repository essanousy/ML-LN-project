I\u2019ll be reverting back next week to trying to type 2 posts per week.</p><br/><p>Summer just saps everything out of me..</p><br/><p>\u201d And? Did everything go well? \u201d</p><br/><p>John-Sensei asked, his eyes sparkling while looking like he was preparing to fly towards me. I unconsciously took a step back as I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201d The magical tool created came out quite nicely. The only problem was how the colors looked like from a distance. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026 As expected of Will, again. \u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, when I first decided to create fireworks, I had asked for John-Sensei\u2019s help in experimenting with various metal dust. Just a little before the summer holidays, I came unannounced during one of the laboratory\u2019s day off and we managed to work some great colors out.</p><br/><p>Well, every blacksmith already knew about the fact that different metal dust, when burnt, would produced different colors, not to mention John-Sensei, who was often asked to help in researching fireworks for the royal family.</p><br/><p>With the knowledge from the both of us, we managed to produced fireworks. Hm? Where did the experiment grounds and the metal dust came from?</p><br/><p>Magic!</p><br/><p>I teleported us over to the Beryl\u2019s garden and held our experiments there. Or rather, I want to praise John-Sensei. He was knowledgeable in almost every field. Really, how wasteful was it for him to became a child\u2019s tutor?</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, let us get on our way. \u201d</p><br/><p>John-Sensei said, as he lifted his luggage.</p><br/><p>\u201d Got it. \u300a\u300b! \u201d [TN: Teleport]</p><br/><p>I imagined my room as I chanted. And we landed safely in my room without any hiccups. Viva teleportation magic. But I shouldn\u2019t relied on it too often. My legs would degenerate.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Oh well, Will. How unusual to see your room in such a messy state. \u201d</p><br/><p>John-Sensei said, as he looked at the scattered papers in the middle of my room. I smiled wryly as I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201d Father lent me a new book and I got too absorbed in it. To think I even had friends over. \u201d</p><br/><p>I passed Terao\u2019s diary over to John-Sensei. Curious, John-Sensei took the book over and after glancing at the pages inside, his face showed understanding. But I knew that was just the start of his crescendo. Oh, here it comes.</p><br/><p>\u201d Can it be.. the First Founder\u2019s diary?!?! This is famous for being a book filled with unknown magic circles and incantations that had gone unsolved! I see\u2026 So it\u2019s the Beryl who had it\u2026.! \u201d</p><br/><p>To the me who had retreated a very safe distance away from John-Sensei, he was looking lovingly at the Terao\u2019s diary as he stroked it. \u2026..Ah, I think I heard him said it before that his wife was research\u2026</p><br/><p>John-Sensei area of research was magic circles and incantation. Add that with the history of this book and you were dangling a carrot in front of a horse.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving aside me, who had a weird look frozen on my face, John-Sensei continued as he stroked the diary.</p><br/><p>\u201d Once, when I was still in Higher Academy, I had gotten hold of this book to try and decipher it. Ah, the arrogance of youth. To had baseless confidence about how I might be able to do it when all the famous researchers can\u2019t. I was really conceited\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Hmm, was this what you called a bittersweet memories? I could see a hint of happiness and fun in his expression.</p><br/><p>\u201d By the way, this was used by the royal research lab to put all the newcomers in their place. It seems like it would caused them to be even more earnest in researching. \u201d</p><br/><p>I get it, so John-Sensei went through it as well. With a face full of nostalgia, John-Sensei passed the diary back to me.</p><br/><p>\u201d So this was really a book full of magic incantations and circles? \u201d</p><br/><p>Cue eyes sparkling. I smiled wryly.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, this is actually\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I wondered how long was I going to keep lying.</p><br/><p>As I was worried about that, for some reason, \u2018because it\u2019s will\u2019 came to stand. And now, no matter what I said, even though surprised, people had came to accepted it.</p><br/><p>Which meant, I had no more reason to hesitate.</p><br/><p>For what reason did I hide the truth about what I know? The reason was because I might get targeted. To be used for some unsavory stuff. But above all, I don\u2019t want to be hated by people I hold dear.</p><br/><p>Although it was a bit late to talk about being targeted for my life since I had just exchanged blows with the [Shadows]. And the title of being the Duke\u2019s son brought about it\u2019s own share of danger too.</p><br/><p>Even it\u2019s not for my [Cheat], there were various other reasons why my life would be targeted as well. As for being used\u2026 it all depends on the situation, as well as the other party.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t wanna get hated by my close friends.</p><br/><p>If my secret ever get exposed, I wondered if any of them would leave. No, no they won\u2019t. Even I knew that. I knew it, yet there was still unease. It was becoming to be a habit.</p><br/><p>It was deeply grinded in my psych as a way of self-defense that I can\u2019t let people have any expectations of me. Even I get irritated at this thinking of mine.</p><br/><p>How stupid. I kept my memories just so I would stopped being stupid. And it made me felt like I was not trusting them at all. I am angry at how my own weakness turned into suspicions of everyone.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why.</p><br/><p>I pointed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Actually, John-Sensei, this is not a magic or spell book. It\u2019s a diary. The First Founder\u2019s diary. \u201d</p><br/><p>John-Sensei, who had a moment of shock on his face, reverted back into a researcher\u2019s face almost immediately. I let out a tiny breath of relive.</p><br/><p>Finally, the memories I kept from my previous life seemed to had been out to good use.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Please enjoy~</p><br/><p>And sorry for the bad baby talk, I don\u2019t have one at home to get a reference from.</p><br/><p>AN: Thank you for all the likes and reviews!</p><br/><p>You will get a glimpse of [cheat]\u2026or not.</p><br/><p>And so.</p><br/><p>\u201d Your father is so much more brilliant at it. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mother, you\u2019ve got a really beautiful smile on.</p><br/><p>\u2026That was not it! Father was a lot more brilliant? That silly and plain Father?</p><br/><p>\u201d Reelly? \u201d</p><br/><p>I hoped you would forgive me for making such a doubtful face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Are you doubting it, Will? Really, this child.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, exposed. I laughed, trying to cover it up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Your father is a \u2018Double\u2019 you know. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Doublru? \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, I kinda get it know. But that Father was\u2026</p><br/><p>As I was thinking of rude things, the door opened suddenly. And while I was shocked at that, I was lifted up that shocked me even more.</p><br/><p>\u201d Here we go! Your father is amazing you know. \u201d</p><br/><p>He said, as he rubbed his face against mine. Ah, Father shaved his beard. Must be because I said it hurt earlier on.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh my, are you not at the office? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yeah, my work for today is finished as there are not much paperwork. \u201d</p><br/><p>This conversation was taking place over my head.</p><br/><p>Ah, that meant I must be lifted up by Father, carried and had my face rubbed against his.</p><br/><p>\u2026This idiotic doting father? Awesome? Were you kidding me?</p><br/><p>\u201d What isu doublru? \u201d</p><br/><p>Since I was born, I could finally reach my father and so I avoided him wanting to pinch my face. The doting idio\u2026Father, with a look of regret, carried me over to the sofa and began speaking happily.</p><br/><p>\u201d Being interested in magic already Will? You are my son indeed! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d He is also mine you know! \u201d</p><br/><p>Yep, it began like this and since this was taking longer then expected, I shall cut it all out.</p><br/><p>As the book had written, there were attributes in magic and basically, each person had 1. But, as I thought, Father seemed to be a \u2018Double\u2019 elite who possessed 2 attributes. By the way, his attributes were Fire, which was the most common, and Wind.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he stayed at his father\u2019s, my grandfather, friend\u2019s place and trained. And there, he contributed to the nation and was scouted by the knights. Now, he had became the leader of the knights.</p><br/><p>By the way, the friend of grandfather\u2019s was a well-known adventurer in this nation.</p><br/><p>\u2026.What was with this cheat-like bastard.</p><br/><p>[TN: Will! Be more polite with your father or I\u2019ll wash your mouth with soap!]</p><br/><p>We had the same plain looks so what was with this gap in status?</p><br/><p>\u201d Father issu awesome! \u201d</p><br/><p>But, I was still proud of the fact that my father was so brilliant that even the country acknowledged it. Besides, what a fantasy it was, from an adventurer, to become a knight.</p><br/><p>Simulated by that word, my brain had already reached a fever state.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ahahahaha, that\u2019s right, I am awesome! \u201d</p><br/><p>Father looked so happy. Since he was in a good mood, there was a chance! Let\u2019s get cocky and use the ultimate tactic, \u2018Upturn eyes\u2019!</p><br/><p>[TN: To be used when you\u2019re at a lower position, look up to the target\u2026.what the heck, like how Puss-In-Boots from Shrek used it.]</p><br/><p>\u201d Father, I wanchu use magic too! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Is that so, you want to be like Father, don\u2019t you, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Father, can I do chuow? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm, Will. Right now your mana isn\u2019t enough, how about waiting till you are older? \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Father rubbed my head, messing up my hair.</p><br/><p>Eh\u2026? But I had enough\u2026 It must be that by the mana I had, the results would end up shabby anyway so it would be better not to try.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then, when chu I ruent? \u201d (When can I learn?)</p><br/><p>Man, did I fumble with the words but I didn\u2019t mind, the more important thing was the result.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will is a good boy so I really want to teach you, but the mana required to activate magic is more then what a 1 year old child can produce. How about waiting till Will is 10? \u201d</p><br/><p>Father persuaded me.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Hm? \u2026What did he say just now? I did not have the mana required to activate magic?</p><br/><p>\u2026I believed that Father was not lying so that must be the common knowledge of this world.</p><br/><p>\u2026But\u2026eh\u2026I just did it\u2026?</p><br/><p>Taken aback, I stared at my hand. I could still feel the mana.</p><br/><p>Could it be that I\u2026was amazing? [TN: You cheat-like bastard.]</p><br/><p>I looked up at Father and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201d Okay! Will wait! \u201d</p><br/><p>Hehehehehe\u2026Let me surprise you! I was gonna become the Master of Magic!</p><br/><p>After that, it went without saying that I was once again, \u2018assaulted\u2019 by Father with his face\u2026 Sob sob\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: Thank you very much.</p><br/><p>I am thinking that it\u2019s about time to speed things up.</p><br/><p>Please take care of me from now onwards as well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

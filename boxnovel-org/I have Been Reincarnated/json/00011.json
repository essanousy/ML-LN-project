Anyone have a better idea?</p><br/><p>Editor : Poor_Hero and Lazaruz22</p><br/><p>I still could not lift my neck.</p><br/><p>How many days had it been since I was born?</p><br/><p>After training everyday, I could finally move my hands, feet and fingers consciously.</p><br/><p>But\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d A\u2026.E\u2026.Eee\u2026.Uuu\u2026.U\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>I still could not pronounce correctly. That was why every morning when I woke up at the same time as my mother, I practiced speaking like this while Mother was getting ready. And I was actually trying to say \u2018A, E, I, O, U\u2019. [TN: Japanese A, I, U, E, O, pronunciation is Ah, Ii, Wu, Eh, Oh. ]</p><br/><p>Or rather, it was difficult to move. I could wiggle my hands and feet but I still could not turn over.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh my, are you already awake Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened and Mother looked down with a surprised face.</p><br/><p>Ah yes, this was my recent breakthrough. I did not know if it was because I was a baby, but an astounding memory manifested and I came to understand what people surrounding me were saying. Also, I came to understand different things as my vision got clearer.</p><br/><p>\u201d Uh! \u201d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s reply for now. Normal babies did reply somehow or other so it was not unusual to do so\u2026..I thought.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will rarely cries. What a good boy~\u266a \u201d</p><br/><p>Mother said, as she lifted me up. My Mother\u2019s name seemed to be Lily.</p><br/><p>Yes, come to think of it.</p><br/><p>I had already gotten used to it so I could have \u2018 breakfast\u2019 without any sense of discomfort. And I came to realize, thanks to my vision clearing, a certain truth.</p><br/><p>\u2026.My mother was a real beauty\u2026.!</p><br/><p>Pale and smooth skin like a child, beautiful plump pink lips, perfectly balanced outlines, big and round eyes with a beautiful nose that were all perfectly arranged.</p><br/><p>\u2018 If this is not beauty then what is?! \u2018 kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>This made me enthusiastic and happy about my promising future but by some chance I might look like my Father.</p><br/><p>As I had yet to met my father, there was nothing I could say.</p><br/><p>Ah, as my Father had yet to appear for days now, I grew worried if this would turn out to be a complicated family or not. Then, about 3 days ago, a maid-like person spoke to Mother.</p><br/><p>\u201d Congratulations Madam, it seems like Master has finished his patrol of the territory and is rushing back home as fast as he can. \u201d</p><br/><p>I, too, was relieved. And happy. Because in this world, both of my parents were around. On this occasion, I would like to say that it seemed like this was a Noble\u2019s House. Further on that note, my dad seemed to be a Knight. A Noble and a Knight\u2026.the combination of an Ikemen. My hope raised.</p><br/><p>About this country or world, I had heard nothing so I had no knowledge but the interior of my house looked European-ish so it would most likely be that.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Nnn mu. \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, as I released my mouth from my Mother\u2019s\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, are you full, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Nn. \u201d</p><br/><p>And while this exchange was going on\u2026.</p><br/><p>[TN: Your nightmare is coming Will.]</p><br/><p>\u201d Ohhhh! Will! This guy, is he born?! \u201d</p><br/><p>The door slammed open and a loud voice was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201d My, are you back Gion? This is your father, Will\u2026. Here, Gion. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was then passed to Gion, my Father, by my delighted Mother.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am your Father, Will~ \u201d</p><br/><p>What a nice smile. Which caused me to smile as well.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>What normal face!!!</p><br/><p>Looking closer, he looked like me in my previous life\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Oi god, this was the first time I felt despair.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN : Father who has Will\u2019s face of the previous life, which Will thought was average-looking.</p><br/><p>Of course, he is the super Ikemen Knight who is yearned by all ladies.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

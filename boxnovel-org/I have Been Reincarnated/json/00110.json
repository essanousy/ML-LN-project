Since I only have the time and internet to do this on the weekends, I said I could only update once a week.</p><br/><p>However, I don\u2019t really like to keep you guys waiting and once a week is gonna make me rusty.</p><br/><p>So, I decided on 2 post in a row every weekend. I would try to continue this and at times where I couldn\u2019t, I would inform you.</p><br/><p>I do have a life. So I do wanna go out sometime during the weekend. Hehehehe. A pumpkin hadda eat!</p><br/><p>Yes, of course there would be a trial waiting for me after the ceremony / announcement. It\u2019s named, being-in-the-center-of-a-storm-from-everyone\u2019s-gazes. I was being pierced by arrows everywhere. If my situation was to be drawn in a manga, I would be lying in a pool of blood right now.</p><br/><p>By the way, King Kesamu met my eyes again when he was leaving. Yes, he snickered. Seeing that expression, I had a feeling he was aiming to expose this in the first place but since it was already done, there was no use crying over spilled milk.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it had already been exposed to a muggle student, Calius-senpai via Zirco-san. Come to think of it, hadn\u2019t I been exposed many times already?</p><br/><p>As this all ran through my mind, I walked cheerfully down the corridor, driven out by all the gazes directed at me. At least the only relief was there were hardly any malice in the gazes. Zen and Selphy\u2019s gazes were exceptionally sharp and pierced right through my back but sorry, I would not look back.</p><br/><p>As long as I reached the classroom, I would be saved. A savior (god) was waiting for me. A savior (god) given by John-sensei.</p><br/><p>I was not planning to stay silent, but this was not a suitable place to talk. At least wait till we were in the dorm.</p><br/><p>Like that, with a slightly quicker pace, we reached the classroom. And there, I was dealt with another shock.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Zelda-sensei\u2026..?!?!?! \u201d</p><br/><p>I shouted, unintentionally. Because the person standing there was\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d Ha ha ha ha ha!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Grinning while revealing his rows of white shiny teeth, he was showing off his muscle with just a single pair of briefs on.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>The unfortunate trio that arrived at the classroom looked at each other. Within the huge classroom, we were unforgivingly assaulted by the swirling chaos.</p><br/><p>With us frozen in position of looking at each other, we began talking with our eyes. When Selphy and I looked at Zen, his eyes swam about as he gave a small shake of his head. And when Zen, who looked like he was about to cry, looked at Selphy, she shook her head, her face stunned. If you were to forcefully dub this\u2026</p><br/><p>[ Zen, you go! ]</p><br/><p>[ Im, impossible! Help, Selphy! ]</p><br/><p>[ What are you saying? I don\u2019t want to! ]</p><br/><p>Was what happened.</p><br/><p>In the end, their gazes were directed at me. \u2026\u2026Oi. Was today \u2018direct your gazes at me\u2019 day? Ooooiiiii.</p><br/><p>No helping it, I gave an inaudible sigh as I took a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wh, what are you doing, Zelda-sensei\u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Please forgive me for stammering.</p><br/><p>It was that you know.</p><br/><p>The intensity of that sight close up was stronger than I thought. What was this brown luster coming from his muscles\u2026.. when did you get this tan, Zelda-sensei. Elzmu does not have a beach, you know? Nor a tanning salon.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026You meant you did it on the streets? Or the park?!</p><br/><p>At my question that was overflowing with doubts and bewilderment, Zelda-sensei directed a matter-of-fact refreshing smile at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d That is, of course, the explanation for the swimming tournament! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah. Mm. You see, I know why you were wearing swimwear to explain, I know, but.</p><br/><p>Here. Is. The. Classroom. The classroom!!!!! Indoor!!!!</p><br/><p>After a while, the classroom was filled with noise.</p><br/><p>That much was of course.</p><br/><p>A muscular gori\u2026.no, Zelda-sensei was standing at the front of the classroom with just a pair of swimwear on.</p><br/><p>But since most of them hadn\u2019t swum before, they might not know that it was a swimwear. Which meant, there was a man clad in just a pair of briefs standing right in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>In that case he was just a pervert.</p><br/><p>Plus it was their homeroom teacher whom they, kinda, had respect for. Of course they would be making noise. And in the mist of it, that one man was currently doing various muscle-showing poses. What the heck was he doing? I totally could not understand.</p><br/><p>But thanks to that, the storm of the gazes were not directed at me now. \u2026\u2026Eh, can it be that Zelda-sensei was aiming for that?!</p><br/><p>Wondering, I directed my gaze filled with respect at Zelda-sensei.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026No, never.</p><br/><p>The respect died down. Yep, I mean, look at his skin. To get it this tanned would take about a week. Since he couldn\u2019t have known that this would happen, there was no way he was doing it on purpose to help. Sitting by my side, Zen whispered to me with a stunned look.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will\u2026\u2026Is that.. is that a \u2018swimwear\u2019? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm? \u2026..Ah, I think so. \u201d</p><br/><p>He asked timidly and at my answer, his shoulders drooped.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026His reaction was too honest. Ah, although I was the same as him. But as expected of children, to show their dislike straight to the person\u2019s face. Ah, no, as expected of Zen.</p><br/><p>Selphy, who was also standing next to me, started shaking at my answer. Naturally, 3 of our gazes went to where Zelda-sensei\u2019s \u2018swimwear\u2019 was.</p><br/><p>\u201d Kyahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! \u201d</p><br/><p>A distressed scream came out of Selphy\u2019s mouth. Yes, Zelda-sensei\u2019s swimwear had a distinct shape of a [T]. Which meant, Zelda-sensei was wearing a T-back with his glistening brown muscles in various poses, as per bodybuilder.</p><br/><p>And that T-back had a pattern painstakingly printed on it. A green background with black stripes running down, just like a watermelon, giving off a strong summer-feel. I was not happy at seeing that at all, plus summer was just suffering hot. I sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, I don\u2019t think our swimwear will be in that shape. \u201d</p><br/><p>From my small mumble, the 2 of them looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Really?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy cried happily, grabbing hold of me as I was taken aback at her sudden movement.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, ah, I mean, there was no way girls can wear that. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026..Which means\u2026 that is for us\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>This time, it was Zen who went pale. With a wry smile, I was about to explain before Zelda-sensei\u2019s voice boomed throughout the classroom.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, since everyone is here, the explanation for the swimming tournament will begin! Firstly, I am sure you are interested at this clothing. This is called [Swimwear]! \u201d</p><br/><p>As Zelda-sensei showed off his white teeth, distressed cries from the girls resounded throughout the class.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>As the class calmed down, Zelda-sensei laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Although all of you are so happy about this, unfortunately, this is not the [swimwear] for girls. As for the reason why I am pretty sure you guys know. Plus there is another reason. \u201d</p><br/><p>At Zelda-sensei\u2019s words, half of the class, girls, got excited. Beautiful smiles decorated their faces while the rest of the class were as pale as Zen as they waited for Zelda-sensei to continue. Would it be that it was not for them too? They believed there was hope in the world.</p><br/><p>Full of smile, Zelda-sensei headed towards his desk and rummaged around in it. Everyone\u2019s gazes followed his every action, afraid in missing out anything. Then, finally having found it, Zelda-sensei took it out.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>My jaw dropped opened.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 The thing held in Zelda-sensei\u2019s hands was a school swimsuit. Schoolsuit. It was a deep shiny blue color. At the chest area, a piece of white cloth was sewed on, with the words \u2018Ist years \u2013 White Team\u2019 written on carefully. With a proud expression, Zelda-sensei held it out.</p><br/><p>\u201d This is the swimwear that the First Founder had suggested! Although there are many other variations, this is the one everybody prefer\u2026 ah, what I wanted to say is, this is the product from the wonderful First Founder! \u201d</p><br/><p>Pausing, Zelda-sensei looked around the classroom.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Basically, this could be said to be one of Phillis Academy\u2019s uniforms. As this is a place where everyone, from commoners to nobles, attends, uniforms are created by the First Founder to bring equality! And then this swimwear! Plus, it is designed to be the best shape for one to move in the water!! Isn\u2019t this swimwear wonderfull?!! \u201d</p><br/><p>AS he got heated up, Zelda-sensei clenched his fists, and his eyes were shining as though he could shoot laser out from them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d Oooohhhhhh!!! \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>The class raised their voices.</p><br/><p>Zelda-sensei nodded satisfied, before taking a piece of chalk and began writing down the explanation for the tournament on the blackboard. As for me, feeling were swirling around like a storm inside.</p><br/><p>First Founder\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!</p><br/><p>You did this!!!!!!!!!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Another short chapter. Perfect for me to ease my way back into translating.</p><br/><p>Ah Will, you are always so good at tsukomi.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

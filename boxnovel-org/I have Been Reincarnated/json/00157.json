Sorry for the late updates as I was busy traveling all around the world for Christmas as well as the New Year~!</p><br/><p>Just wanna say a great big thanks for being the best readers out there for bearing with all my lateness in updating as well as all of my disappearing acts. Im really sorry about that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, come to think of it. He must have thought that there wouldn\u2019t be anyone like that. You should have seen his expression. \u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking back to the Emperor\u2019s expression, I can\u2019t helped but grinned.</p><br/><p>The former Emperor\u2026 Let\u2019s just call him Guta. Although I gave him a lesson on our first meeting, he showed no signs of being irritated as others do when they were being taught by a kid. Instead, he looked at me with honest eyes, or perhaps he was simply a serious person who preferred efficiency, and was moved by the things I said to him.</p><br/><p>And then, after looking back at all that he did, Guta deeply reflected upon his deeds and kept on apologizing regretfully to me. So much so that I had forgotten about the anger I felt for his action and simply felt stunned at his change.</p><br/><p>Besides, Guta was not the one who created the [Shadows] or set down the practice to demeaned Beastmen. Moreover, it seemed like Guta did not directly laid down the order to endanger my friends when the incident happened with Selphy so I could somehow suppressed my anger. It did felt a little like how those politicians went \u201d It was the secretary who did by their own accord. \u201d but I was just going to leave it at that.</p><br/><p>Since I was entrusted with by the King with Hattuo, there was no way to avoided Guta so bearing a grudge was really not feasible. Plus it would be better for my mental health.</p><br/><p>And so, my rationality convinced my feelings to to \u2018forgive \u2018. The deeply regretting Guta did make things a lot easier though.</p><br/><p>Since Hattuo was going to became a vessel of Elzmu, I would need to make a trip over in ordered to set everything in motion. Since I had to managed a country, there was no meaning in going in my own.</p><br/><p>Country management was usually done as a group, or a council. Hmm, I was having a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu like I had thought about these things before\u2026 Did I raised a flag then?!</p><br/><p>I would really like to asked the \u2018Flag raising\u2019 god but it\u2019s put this matter aside for now.</p><br/><p>The problem now was personnel. The King had given me advice that as the basic minimum, I would need to have at least an intelligence corp under my direct supervision. He also added that he could give me anyone I had in mind.</p><br/><p>I had initially thought that the King was joking when he said that because there was no way I would know any intelligence member who would be willing to work under an 8 year old. But hey, reality was always unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well and so, if Calius-sempai agrees, I would like you to to be part of the Knights Intelligence Corp under me. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wh, what, wait, what?! Isn\u2019t this too sudden, Will?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, by the way, I haven\u2019t told Calius-sempai about Hattuo being a vessel of Elzmu or that I was going to be the commander-in-chief in that matter. Others were soon going to know about it but it was still top secret information at this moment. But since this was Calius-sempai, there was a little fear in me that he already knew about it.</p><br/><p>Right now, that usual poker-face of his was dyed in surprise. He even rode onto my rhythm and gave a tsukkomi back. That showed the height of his surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201d So\u2026 do you want to do it? \u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Calius-sempai\u2019s surprise, I repeated my question. And why was that?</p><br/><p>\u201d Of course I am if I can. \u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why. I already knew his answer.</p><br/><p>\u201d Okay! So Sempai, as my subordinate, you are to infiltrate into Hattuo for information. This time, Hattuo is going to be a vessel country under Elzmu. Ah yes, I am also going to be the commander-in-chief. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, ha ha ha. Even Calius can\u2019t stopped opening and closing his mouth from all this information. Don\u2019t worry Sempai, that\u2019s a natural reaction.</p><br/><p>And so, I got my first subordinate. There was a lot of things I had to do and I already had a inkling of how bothersome this was going to be. But still, I can\u2019t helped but felt excited for the future to come.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Short chapter!</p><br/><p>A poll for you guys.

As well as how I came to the conclusion that Sensei might be in trouble and went [TN: Flew?] over to check.</p><br/><p>While listening, Sensei pursed his lips from time to time. I guessed he determined that instead of his spirit of study, solving this situation came first. In the end, apart from interrupting to give his thanks for me saving him, he silently listened to my story till the end.</p><br/><p>\u201d I will want a clear explanation on how you did everything later\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>John-sensei said, his sharp eyes piercing.</p><br/><p>N-o-!!</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t dissect me! I believe in Sensei so please don\u2019t go all mad scientist on me!</p><br/><p>\u2026. At least don\u2019t treat me like a guinea pig\u2026.?</p><br/><p>I trembled, and after suppressing my urge to run away, I invited Sensei to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201d As you thought, this had to be the work of the Anti-Kingdom faction. \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei let out a deep sigh and his face showed a mixture of surprise and worry. His father and brother were most likely weighing in his mind.</p><br/><p>Erm, Sensei, your black aura was out in full force! And somehow I could see lighting striking in your background! \u2026. Maybe Sensei \u2018s attribute was Thunder? Like a certain rat?</p><br/><p>\u2026. It felt like lighting would strike if Sensei was truly angered\u2026</p><br/><p>As I waited timidly, Sensei gasped his shoulders suddenly. As if he was trying to regain his balance.</p><br/><p>\u201d But first\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>He looked straight at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d In the future, you will refrain from such dangerous behavior right? \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei said, his face full of smiles.</p><br/><p>\u2026 This was definitely not a question\u2026</p><br/><p>I replied at the speed of light.</p><br/><p>According to my 21 years of experience, 17 in the previous world and 4 years here, I took the stance that was the most effective in situation like these. I lowered my head and apologized.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am so sorry! I will not do it again! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 That\u2019s right, to earnestly apologize!</p><br/><p>It.. It\u2019s not because Sensei was terrifying. Most definitely not. Just that, you see, to get this thing done in the fastest way possible was to compromise.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026 Hm, I will take you for your word. \u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the unconvinced Sensei, I panicked and tried to changed the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201d I.. I am not worried about Father but what about these intruders? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 It was not only to divert Sensei\u2019s attention. I earnestly thought about the safety and public order of the residence. And the best way was to get this incident solved as soon as possible. Yep.</p><br/><p>And it must be my imagination that Sensei just looked at me with amazement.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s right\u2026 It is useless to speculate here. Let us meet with them first, shall we? \u201d</p><br/><p>I had no reason to reject Sensei suggestion and so, after agreeing, we teleported back to the office. I had called it as \u2018Teleportation\u2019 but in this world, it was just a normal spell that \u2018Transfer\u2019. That thought crossed my mind when I chanted the spell to teleport us both and John-sensei understood.</p><br/><p>But it was really cool how we could teleport at the sound of my voice!</p><br/><p>I met Sensei\u2019s eyes, gave a small nod and chanted.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300a\u300b\u201d [TN: Teni, Transfer / Teleport. Pronunciation : Ten-i, not Te-ni]</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015A short moment after Will left the House\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Why.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Was the first thing I said when I came to. I didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>It was not that I had no memories of what happened but\u2026 As a Shadow, this behavior was unthinkable. To be speaking on enemy grounds\u2026 Even so, I was currently in a situation where I couldn\u2019t move an inch.</p><br/><p>I tried to twist my body but the intense pain that struck throughout my body made me frown. This time, I stayed silent. As a Shadow, it was trained in me. To not make a sound no matter the pain. And I followed it this time. But in that same training, I learned how to kill as well. Maybe that was the reason.</p><br/><p>I rolled on the floor, trying to get a look at the surroundings. No one could be seen apart from us. And as it was, the other 2 were still unconscious.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, doubts started raising. Even if we were unconscious, leaving us \u2018Shadow\u2019 alone unsupervised was rather careless. We were professionals. We did possess the skills to break out even the strongest bindings.</p><br/><p>At that, I tried to move my body and was taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I could not move.</p><br/><p>Even though nothing could be seen binding us, I could not even move a finger. It felt like my body had turned into lead, as the \u2018Shadow\u2019 side of me calmly analyzed while the other side of me felt an unfamiliar sense of terror, causing me to sweat. I convinced myself that the sweats were due to the intense pain I felt.</p><br/><p>In the first place, this request was supposed to be easy.</p><br/><p>Our client had lured the head of this house out and left only the maids. We were supposed to sneak into the house, grab the required documents and the child and that\u2019s it. Just that.</p><br/><p>I did not know who the client was. I only followed the orders we were given by my owner. In the first place, I was given no choice to refuse. I tried many times, using anything to get it off, using any methods to break it off, frantically, over and over.</p><br/><p>But even till now I could still feel it on my neck.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015[Collar of Slavery], a magic tool. In this country, slavery had long been banned and it was believed that the [Collar of Slavery] was out of existence.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Till that day.</p><br/><p>I was an orphan.</p><br/><p>I could not even remember my parents\u2019 faces but I was okay with it. However, I could not say I was in a happy place. The orphanage I was in was rumored to have underground dealings and they hardly fed me. The first thing I learnt when I was slightly older was how to sneak out onto the streets. I was in an environment where I was always unreasonably treated. Hostility, ill-treatment, ridiculed at. At that young age, naturally, I accepted it as that was what I was.</p><br/><p>Because I was obviously different from the other kids.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015 A Beastman.</p><br/><p>Instead of the round ears at the side of my head, 2 furry ears were placed on top of it.</p><br/><p>But, as I went out onto the streets with a hooded cloak, I came to know that this world was small, yet large. I then decided that I would get out of this place as fast as I could and become an adventurer that travelled the world.</p><br/><p>But what a short dream it was. The day I set my heart to it was the day I was sold.</p><br/><p>It was a night like always, and I went to sleep on a hard and uncomfortable bed. Thinking back now, it was unusual that they actually fed me dinner that day. It must have beeb drugged with a sleeping potion.</p><br/><p>When I came to, a thin black metal collar was attached to my neck and training started.</p><br/><p>Training to erase one\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>Training to endure pain.</p><br/><p>Training to get used to poison.</p><br/><p>\u2026.. Training to kill.</p><br/><p>At first, I desperately tried to resist but even so, my body would move obediently to the orders. It was like my mind and body were separated. There were a few times where I would start thinking that even if I was dead, my body would move on its own and still execute out orders.</p><br/><p>As time passed, I gave up on resisting and simply followed orders. It might be because of my blood-stained hands that I felt like I did not deserved to be saved. A Shadow\u2019s job covered a lot of grounds but I was usually assigned to assassination or kidnappings.</p><br/><p>Grouped along with 2 other people, each with different builds, we then executed orders given to us. I wonder if the other 2 had been through what I had too\u2026 The tall guy and the average guy hardly spoke at all. And that included me. We had no idea what each other were thinking about at all.</p><br/><p>Before I realized it, I got used to killing.</p><br/><p>\u2026 Did I get conceited with this request, I wondered.</p><br/><p>No. Never.</p><br/><p>That would never happen with this collar still on. Even with this collar that forced me to be absolutely faithful, till now I still couldn\u2019t move my body.</p><br/><p>And I still had no idea what just went down.</p><br/><p>Trained in moving in darkness, we had no need for lighting as we searched around the dark office for the \u2018required\u2019 document. For precaution, Tall guy casted\u300a\u300b[TN: Kage, Shadow] that merged our bodies into the shadows.</p><br/><p>Then all of a sudden, I heard a kid\u2019s voice and released my weapon in that direction by reflex. But no sound of metal embedding into flesh was heard and instead, I lost conscious.</p><br/><p>\u2026. Did a kid do this?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t be silly, I needed to rethink this. I wouldn\u2019t be tricked.</p><br/><p>Even though nothing was going as planned, I stayed calm. And felt slightly happy at how I was resisting the collar\u2019s commands to move.</p><br/><p>It was then.</p><br/><p>I heard the pitter-patter from 2 pairs of footsteps and the lamp was turned on.</p><br/><p>A black haired man then appeared in front of me. And following him, an angel-like gorgeous child..</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: Most likely in the next chapter, this series of incidents will be solved!</p><br/><p>And it might be the first appearance of \u2026\u2026.!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

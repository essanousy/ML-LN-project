I did this in a few hours so it might be rougher on the eyes. I\u2019m heading to bed now, bye.</p><br/><p>In Elzmu, Knights Order was separated into 2 groups, Black and White Knights. The one who managed them was Gion but the one who was usually mobilized was White Knights. Why? Because Black Knights were mostly imperial guards.</p><br/><p>Would it be easier if it was explained that Black Knights were King\u2019s personal knights? Even though it was the Vice-Leader who gave directions, it was known that he was moving under King\u2019s order.</p><br/><p>Black Knights were again, separated into 2 groups, Combat and Intelligence. Combat Corps were mostly guarding the castle or King\u2019s personal guards and would join the war as soldiers if there was one. The 2 guards who stood before the audience room and trembled at Will\u2019s family name were under this corp.</p><br/><p>As for Intelligence Corps, they were not widely known. What they do was as their name specified, intelligence gathering. Gion\u2019s secret job could be classified as so, but strictly speaking, there were slight differences.</p><br/><p>Gion\u2019s work was to handle those who opposed Kesamu.</p><br/><p>Black Knight Intelligence Corps were to handle and managed all information.</p><br/><p>Plus, they were \u2018not widely known\u2019 which meant there were still people who knew about them. As opposed to Gion, who moved in absolute secret.</p><br/><p>That day, Zirco was summoned by the King and was given an assignment. He admired the King. Kesamu, both as a King and man, was magnificent and he had decided to swear his loyalty and his life to him.</p><br/><p>To add to that fact was that Zirco\u2019s family, the Ninjas, had served the King for many generations. No one knew, but they had been supporting the Royal Family behind-the-scene throughout history. It was in his blood to serve the King.</p><br/><p>Kesamu was being called as the Wise King. Zirco had been told to do some crazy things which he couldn\u2019t understand why. It was always afterwards where the King\u2019s action revealed their meaning.</p><br/><p>Which was why, he does not question the King and simply moves according to his directions. But this time was different. This time, he totally could not wrap his head around what he had been told.</p><br/><p>The usual crazy requests had been easier to understand as they were usually something that had a deeper meaning to them. This time, however, the reason was given right from the start which made it even more difficult to accept.</p><br/><p>The one who provided the information and also the one who gave his suggestion was an 8 years old kid.</p><br/><p>\u2026.An 8 years old kid who had seemingly defeated Abi.</p><br/><p>Any usual King would dismissed it as a kid\u2019s prank. Of course, not to mention to even research and follow the kid\u2019s suggestions. It was something Zirco had never thought he would do.</p><br/><p>His head hurt. He had, for a moment, thought to ask the King if it was what he really wanted to do. Of course, he said nothing. Kesamu had always been able to see-through his opponent\u2019s true nature. Having doubts against such Kesamu was something only an idiot would do.</p><br/><p>Which was why, he would have to meet with the person to understand it all.</p><br/><p>He walked along soundlessly even in the stone-paved castle where sound reverberated easily. It was meant to make it difficult for any spy to infiltrate. It was said to be the First Founder\u2019s taste but actually, it was a counter-measure.</p><br/><p>Williams Beryl.</p><br/><p>The next Duke in line. Any Noble would had heard of his name once before. He was said to be like an angel at his debut when he was 3, and was even praised by the famous court scholar John Veltor for his intelligence. A genius, a prodigy. He was someone who was covered in rumors.</p><br/><p>And to add on, Gion-sama\u2019s son.</p><br/><p>Gion was Zirco\u2019s superior. He was the leader of both White and Black Knight so it\u2019s a given. As said, Gion, who usually led White Knights, had very little chance to come in contact with Zirco, who was from Black Knight Intelligence Corps under the King.</p><br/><p>Even so, Zirco knew how splendid Gion was. He was as admired by the people as Kesamu.</p><br/><p>That person\u2019s son.</p><br/><p>Zirco knew the theory of not coming to a conclusion before investigating but he was just 8 years old. He can\u2019t help but makes light of it. Plus this incident might be the death of this country if it was revealed to be a child\u2019s prank.</p><br/><p>But this child was recognized by 2 highly respected people.</p><br/><p>Then calmness was restored to Zirco\u2019s heart by a simple fact. Just focused on the King\u2019s order for now. Putting aside his complex feelings, he focused on the order he received straight from the King himself and rushed out of the castle soundlessly.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>The table shook under the man\u2019s tapping of his foot. The comfy sofa, placed in front of the large table in the spacious room, sat a man who plucked off his remaining 2 strands of hair.</p><br/><p>Rummaging through the shelf placed to the side of the table, he took a map out. In the middle of the map were the words, \u2018The Country of Hattuo\u2019. Glaring at it, Guta mumbled in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201d Winter is coming soon. \u201d</p><br/><p>The country of Hattuo, which Emperor Guta reigned over, was set at the north of the continent Ranaa. Therefore, the weather had always been cold. At winter, the ground would freeze over, drift ice would cover the north sea and sea voyage was deemed as sheer stupidity.</p><br/><p>To this Hattuo, instead of farming or fishing, they would breed livestock instead. And since they began breeding, they were militarized not long after.</p><br/><p>And as compared to the other countries around them, they had a big problem. Food.</p><br/><p>No matter how they trained the army, no matter how much they earned from magic tools, the only one thing that can\u2019t be solved was the problem with shortage of resources. No matter how much land the country possessed, people cannot live without food.</p><br/><p>The people would lower their heads to people from the surrounding countries for food. Cold and hungry.</p><br/><p>Guta had watched it happened. He wanted to save his country. It wasn\u2019t justice. Guta desired growth for his own country for his own benefit.</p><br/><p>Guta wanted the continent.</p><br/><p>And for that to happen, he needs a place where the soil does not freeze over.</p><br/><p>He glanced at the map again.</p><br/><p>Starting from the center of Ranaa, mountains ran along from northwest till the southeast. The places around the mountains were known as the [Demon Forest]. As the name implied, it was squirming with demon beasts. With the unknown reason, a large amount of demon beasts were spawned in the forests and in there, a survival of the fittest. If anyone dared to take a step in there, it was sure that they would never come out.</p><br/><p>And in the middle of the [Demon Forests] sat Elzmu. Their territory was squeezed in between the [Demon Forests]. Even so, they possessed good soil and their agriculture development bloomed.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, people who won in life and people who yearned for peace began gathering in Elzmu. They started researching magic tools and now, their magic development was almost reaching Hattuo\u2019s standards.</p><br/><p>The barrier between the 2 countries was Iiza River. But, 200 years ago, no one knew that area over the river was inhabitable.</p><br/><p>Then, it was taken over by a man who suddenly appeared. Thinking back, Guta pities the Emperor of that time. It was a precious land that they needed. The land from the south that won\u2019t freeze over.</p><br/><p>\u201d Spinel. \u201d</p><br/><p>Guta called out.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2015\u2015Here. \u201d</p><br/><p>Guta did not seem surprised even though Spinel suddenly appeared in front of him. Spinel was a \u2018shadow\u2019 owned by Guta.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Williams Beryl\u2026. No, stop investigating Elzmu. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Understood. \u201d</p><br/><p>At that, Spinel melted into the shadows.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like Elzmu could live in between the [Demon Forests] that easily. Thanks to the strong knights, they had made it livable. Guta was not that stupid to make those knights his enemy. Hattuo had an army but they were people after all.</p><br/><p>But Elzmu would definitely not raise a hand against the [Demon Forests]. No matter how strong they were, there were things they couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015If you raise a hand against the Demon Forests, calamity would befall you\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>It was a phrase passed down since the olden times. It was a tradition, a belief. The corners of his mouth raised as he grinned. He would have to develop Hattuo in order to save his people. Which was why, he would silently wait for now.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Caralsdoni tasted despair quickly.</p><br/><p>He had reached for the top from zero. He had thought that as long as money made the world go round, he would do anything. Yes, he had thought, past-tense.</p><br/><p>Caralsdoni, who had finally walked out from the slums, went to confirm the place he was in. He could kinda guess where he was by looking around him but to be sure, he asked people who walked passed. He was at a remote countryside in Dyuvu. He would reached Elzmu if he crossed the Demon Forest but he would have to cross the Demon Forest again.</p><br/><p>There were many beastmen living at the place he was in. He had no discrimination against them but he felt angry at those beastmen, who had better noses, steering clear of him.</p><br/><p>Urg. He stank and he knew it.</p><br/><p>Moaning, he tried to look for a job to earn money so he could get somewhere. And at that, he tasted despair.</p><br/><p>Caralsdoni had the talent. He turned his business into a success. That much was the truth. But he was lacking in something now. And that was youth. No matter how good he was at calculation, how good he was in business, how good was his tongue, he cannot overturn the truth about his age.</p><br/><p>Everyone had rejected him thinking he must had had some problems to be fired at his age. His dirty robe made it worst but Caralsdoni did not realize it.</p><br/><p>It was no use. He can\u2019t get a job\u2026.</p><br/><p>He hanged his head in defeat.</p><br/><p>The country of business, Dyuvu. It was not that he hated the place. He had visited a few times on business. But this was not the place he wanted to lay his bones upon. The Maria he loved was still waiting for him in Elzmu.</p><br/><p>He can\u2019t give up. In that case, he would have to reveal everything. Tell the truth and he would get a job. Was what he thought but it didn\u2019t work. A merchant who was tricked to this extend was out. And he was rejected also to protect his pride and not be seen with pity as a merchant.</p><br/><p>Plus, not remembering what happened to him and with his fuzzy memories, no one would really accept his vague explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, but it\u2019s really itchy. \u201d</p><br/><p>Caralsdoni knitted his brows together. That\u2019s right, let\u2019s wash himself clean first! With that aim in mind, Caralsdoni staggered over to the river.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: URGH. I\u2019m done. This was tiring. And not very interesting. URGH.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

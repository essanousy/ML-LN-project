I crashed onto the sofa and my body just sank into it.</p><br/><p>This room had been emptied for 4 months but it had remained in a spotless condition as always. The maids had been properly cleaning this room, it seemed.</p><br/><p>Ah, but really.</p><br/><p>To think the attacks of words would kept coming. Chiffon had grown up and as for Mary-San, I did expected her to say something. But that? But I also came to recognized that Chiffon\u2019s actions were resembling a puppy fighting for it\u2019s owner\u2019s affection. Not that it\u2019s an insult.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, Selphy had misunderstood. Did you see that red face of hers? She most definitely thought that I had some weird fetish or something.</p><br/><p>I would have to asked Chiffon to retract her words. Ah, but it might backfire. On top of being thought to have a weird fetish, I would also looked to them like I was using my authority to cover it up, and became the worst of the worst.</p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t want that. Why? Because Zen and Selphy were the first friends I made in this world. Eh? If it\u2019s not of the same age, it should be that person? Had you thought that the first friend I made was John-Sensei? But he was 20 years older than me\u2026</p><br/><p>But yes, I do think John-Sensei as one of my closest friends. He was someone whom knew my secrets, even more so than my parents, as well as my real personality and was a person I would talk and consulted with. If it was not for John-Sensei, my life would had most likely taken a different turn.</p><br/><p>I also wouldn\u2019t be calm if anything happened to him. He was that important that if John-Sensei was captured and tortured, I wouldn\u2019t know what I would have done to the culprits.</p><br/><p>That really sounded like I was describing a lover.</p><br/><p>\u2026..No no no, yep, I said nothing. He\u2019s a friend, Yep. Erm, please do not direct that weird gaze at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then. \u201d</p><br/><p>Chased by some thoughts I don\u2019t want to, I stood up. Zen and Selphy should be unpacking their luggage right about now. Which meant I had the time to complete one of the mission I had set out to do here.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I knocked twice.</p><br/><p>\u201d Come in. \u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, approval to enter was given. The Beryl\u2019s office which I had always found it huge when I was young, to the 8 years old me now\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep, it\u2019s still huge. \u201d</p><br/><p>As thought, it was really huge. When I pushed opened that thick, large, wooden door, Father, full of smiles, was waiting inside.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm? What\u2019s huge? \u201d</p><br/><p>Father asked, as if he heard what I just mumbled. Luckily it wasn\u2019t something that couldn\u2019t be heard, I answered.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, the door. The door is huge. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d True. I had also once thought that everything in this room is excessively huge. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Once? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d It felt just right now. Maybe it\u2019s because our ancestors and the older feudal lord had been large in size. \u201d</p><br/><p>And I was attacked mentally by a harmless conversation.</p><br/><p>Were you trying to tell me I was small?! Huhhhhhhhhhhhh?!</p><br/><p>\u201d A, ah, yea, must be. \u201d</p><br/><p>A noncommittal response was given. As if reading my mind, Father continued while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201d Because I was called a \u2018chibi\u2019 when I was young too. \u201d</p><br/><p>Aah, was he trying to say that I was a \u2018chibi\u2019 now? Sniff.</p><br/><p>An, anyway, leaving aside the jokes, it might meant that I too, carry the genes of a late-stage bloomer in me as well. I still have a bright future! Come on, Hight! Even though my height right now was of me looking up to everyone, my future would be, like Father, looking down upon everyone.</p><br/><p>Ah~ No matter, my neck muscles would be sore~</p><br/><p>\u201d So, what\u2019s the matter, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>As my chest was swelling with anticipation of my future, Father brought up the main subject. He knew I had something I wanted from him since I looked for him this early when I just brought friends over.</p><br/><p>Father would had never guessed the reason. I then opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201d Would you know where Grandfather would be? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yes. The mission was to investigate about my grandfather of this life.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: The internet connection had gotten worst again. I managed to get this up after a lot of trouble. I shall pop over to the hardware store to see if I could solved this to post another post later today but\u2026\u2026\u2026. no promises. Sorry!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Maybe I didn\u2019t made it clear in the translation but the author meant going to 30. Maybe she\u2019s tired of writing \u2018going to\u2019, since everyone knew the age, she simply refer it to 30. And sometimes she uses \u2018arasa\u2019, which meant going to 30, 30, around 30. Hopes this cleared it up.</p><br/><p>It was evening.</p><br/><p>I kicked the worm in my stomach, who was growling with all its might due to its loss of today\u2019s dinner, far far away as Zen and me sat in front of the table. Sitting opposite of each other, I was looking at Zen in all seriousness and at this exact moment, the worm raised its head and did its best growl as I ignored it, and ignored it! It was just a worm!</p><br/><p>\u2026..Ah, I\u2019m sorry.</p><br/><p>As my heart grew colder , Zen opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201d I, had always thought I am good at studying. I had always thought that, different from Selphy who is receiving your teachings, I did most of my studies myself with just a few bits of advice from you. \u201d</p><br/><p>I imagined Selphy shouting \u2018How rude!\u2019 at his comment but I would just let it slide.</p><br/><p>I mean, this guy was a natural airhead, which contributed to the \u2018bad\u2019 part of his personality. He was a guy who could say unpleasant stuff like \u2018You are too small (chibi)\u2019 straight to my face. If I were to retort to each and very little thing he said, I wouldn\u2019t last.</p><br/><p>I had a feeling there was another guy like this around me but\u2026no. That guy, Shiro, he was doing it on purpose.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015No wait, wasn\u2019t this fatal?</p><br/><p>Zen was worried about how his father was handling everything else half-heartedly but wasn\u2019t a magic tool shop a place frequented by Nobles? Wasn\u2019t it dangerous if he was to accidentally be rude to one?</p><br/><p>According to this flow\u2026 was this a place I was supposed to retort?</p><br/><p>\u2026.Ah, no, the important thing right now was listening to Zen\u2019s troubles. I kept the serious look on my face as I made some agreeable response.</p><br/><p>\u201d But then I\u2026 When I tried to study on my own, I found that I can\u2019t understand anything\u2026. And that Will had been helping me all along. I can\u2019t even get pass page 10\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen;s shoulders drooped as he said that.</p><br/><p>I had no idea how to response. Certainly, it sounded like I had been giving Zen support without even realizing it. Zen, who realized it on his own was awesome too though\u2026.</p><br/><p>Or rather, the studies we were doing right now were rather ahead and leaving aside my reincarnation cheat, frankly, Zen can be considered a genius.</p><br/><p>But, he had a shock when he found out he couldn\u2019t do it on his own.</p><br/><p>At a loss at how to response, to the me who remained silent, Zen sighed and went \u2018As I thought\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.Sorry.</p><br/><p>Was this where I should deny it?</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015How foolish. To be 30 and yet showed this kind of face to a 10 years old who was worried. But this was truly the first time, including my previous life, to have someone consult and discuss his worries with me. Since I had only made a close friend only when I entered High School in my previous life.</p><br/><p>Ah, even so, this was completely my fault.</p><br/><p>I had closed myself up when I was in Primary School and did not talk with anyone. All because I was idiotically studying hard and trying my best with household chores just to get my mother\u2019s approval. But maybe thanks to that, in this life, that experience in turn could help Buu-san\u2019s business.</p><br/><p>Of course, at that time, the me who was doing all of those had no spare time to make any friends.</p><br/><p>Due to my grades, I had high praises from the teachers and since my Middle School was linked with my Primary one, the only time I could escape that \u2018chains\u2019 was in High School.</p><br/><p>And well, even that was beautifully severed by a vase.</p><br/><p>Thinking back, I grew slightly depressed.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s stop. Leaving aside my previous life, in this life I was having fun every day. If I were a normal kid, I would definitely spend each day without even realizing it. That such normal life was something so wonderful.</p><br/><p>That was why, to allow me to realize that, there was a meaning to bring my memories (cheat) over. Yep yep. Even if it does not help in some areas! Like this</p><br/><p>And when I was thinking about these useless stuff, Zen\u2019s drooping shoulders drooped even more. And then, he began mumbling.</p><br/><p>\u201d I mean, yes, I am depressed over not being able to do it on my own but\u2026. the skipping of grades exam\u2026. there is only 1 month left\u2026. It would be hopeless if no one is going to teach me\u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>With an aura that looked like mushrooms were going to sprout from his head, Zen continued mumbling to himself. And to tell the truth, it was quite an eerie sight but I did catch some important stuff from it.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026The skipping of grades exam.</p><br/><p>Yep.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026.Hee, tee hee?</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Er, erm, Zen? This is really difficult for me to say but.. \u201d</p><br/><p>I tried to hold down the trembling of my voice as I continued.</p><br/><p>\u201d What? As I thought, even Will can\u2019t do it\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: He meant teaching him]</p><br/><p>Zen, who lifted up his head, had slightly wet, glistering eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Uwahh!</p><br/><p>When our eyes met, my body drew back.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah no, you see, the book we are doing right now\u2026\u2026is already the last from the lower acad 3\u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>I had a cramp on my face after forcing myself to smile. I know! I know! I know the mouth opposite of me was opening and closing over and over again!</p><br/><p>Holy cow.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be, it can\u2019t be, I had put others through the thing I had been put through!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Kuuu! This was that, wasn\u2019t it? The one where the student was influenced by the weird habit of the teacher!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.No, that wasn\u2019t it! I am really sorry! John-sensei!!</p><br/><p>At Zen, who was still opening and closing his mouth, I was doing a very beautiful dogeza in my heart. I didn\u2019t inform you, did I?! Sorry!</p><br/><p>\u201d Tee, Tee hee\u266a \u201d</p><br/><p>I had said that instinctively in a small voice but there was no other choice, was it? St-stop it, I know, I know, so please stop throwing stones at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen, who finally recovered, moved quickly. In a speed faster than the eyes could follow, he pulled out a book from the drawer.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh, eh, eh. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was really sorry to the Zen who was in a dazed state, staring at the book as I glanced at it. No matter what, it would be the best to confirm the book Zen was currently studying.</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>\u2026.Oi.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wait- I say, Zen. \u201d</p><br/><p>Without thinking, I took the book from Zen. And, pushing it in front of him, I pointed at the title.</p><br/><p>\u201d Please look at this. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Um\u2026..\u300eUnderstanding with Diagrams! The How of Mathematics \u2013 5\u300f\u201d</p><br/><p>With a question mark floating on top of his head when I pointed it to him, Zen slowly read the title out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201d Number..? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen froze. I nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201d 5!?!?!?!? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen yelled as he stood up.</p><br/><p>I will explain. This \u300eUnderstanding with Diagrams! The How of Mathematics\u300fwas an exercise book intended for the lower acads. It was like a reference book that had both explanations and practice questions and was a book recommended by me if one were to undergo the skipping of grades exams. And yes, as with exercise books, each number of the book corresponds with the academy levels. Which meant, book 1 for lower acad 1 and so forth.</p><br/><p>Well then, everyone, you understood by now, don\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>\u201d Zen, you went and skipped a grade\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Of course he couldn\u2019t do any questionsssss!!!!!!</p><br/><p>I yelled in my heart, forgetting my fault from earlier.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Really, as expected of Zen.</p><br/><p>Yep, it was screwed on loosely. Ah no, it was totally undone.</p><br/><p>Which meant, when I left for the secret mission, we finished lower acad [Number 3]. And Zen had borrowed [Number 5] from the library.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Sorry to the Zen who was yelling with tears in his eyes but I couldn\u2019t help but to hit him.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Zenn\u2026\u2026!!!</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>The reason for Zen wanting to skip grades was because he wanted to finish his compulsory education as soon as he can and return home but it was not as easy as he thought.</p><br/><p>For a magic tools shop, no, a magic tool engineer, [Qualifications] were needed. Although the strength of magic tools were determined by the magic circles carved, as there were dangerous objects such as sharp blades, special knowledge on how to handle it was needed.</p><br/><p>And the minimum for that was the completion of Higher Academy.</p><br/><p>So, if one were to follow the flow, it would take about 9 years.</p><br/><p>Normally, kids who wanted to become a magic tool engineer were usually from family who owned a magic tool shop. They would usually have the money to slowly learn, for the sake of research as well as their future.</p><br/><p>Zen, in any case, was worried for his family.</p><br/><p>As for me, I would like to do something I couldn\u2019t do in my previous life. Filial Piety. There was also my fault that our territory increased. Ah, anyway, I would really like to lessen the burden on Father if I could. Ahhh, this was really embarrassing.</p><br/><p>This will definitely not ever coming out of my mouth. Yep.</p><br/><p>I would like to think that it was my imagination that Mother sent me off with warm gazes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.And so, since I wanted to get through this as fast as I could, I entered the capital\u2019s academy which had the system to skip grades. The boarding system also served as a way to build my self-reliance. Or rather, I had a feeling I was going to be a useless person if I continued to stay in that house. Playing with Chiffon and allowing Mary-san to pamper over me\u2026.. definitely useless. I do want to become a splendid man. In reputation too!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026I cannot pay attention to the fact that I was already around 30 plus for my inner age.</p><br/><p>Th-that\u2019s because I-I am William Beryl, 8 years old! Anyone would agree with me! I won\u2019t mind it. Don\u2019t mind it, me!</p><br/><p>All the studying also played a part for skipping grades. This was a long-awaited chance for me to enjoy school life while messing around with friends so I would not deny that I was wasting that time away.</p><br/><p>Anyway, let\u2019s put that aside.</p><br/><p>I lay on the bed, exhausted, thinking hard about one more person.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Selphy.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.I wonder what she skipping grades is for.. \u201d</p><br/><p>I mumbled, glaring at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>All in all, Zen and I both had a clear reason for skipping grades and it was the main reason we came to this academy. But that was not so for Selphy. The thing about school life was that it unexpectedly has a large influence on the future and skipping grades will directly affect the employment opportunities, speeding it ahead.</p><br/><p>I wonder if it was alright to accept that she was doing it because she did not want to be left out from the group.</p><br/><p>Unusually for me, I started considering about these kind of things.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Sorry for being late with this chapter! The homework was overwhelming me\u2026 I would continue to try my best to upload every 3 days but if I can\u2019t handle it, I might delay the releases.</p><br/><p>But relax, I am not giving up on this series.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

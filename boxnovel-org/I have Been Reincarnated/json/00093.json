Sorry for the wait guys. I was very very addicted to a novel and just simple can\u2019t tear my eyes away from it.</p><br/><p>After reading about 280 chapters I could finally move my eyeballs away from that text to this text so\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the first.</p><br/><p>I had been dragged into various troubles but never had I been embroiled in a religious one. Each and everyone would have their own sense of values and notion and I knew that it differs with everyone and I was not to judge. I also thought I should not impose my own values on others. But that was not the problem.</p><br/><p>Which meant, religion existed in this world.</p><br/><p>Unlike my previous world, there was no \u2018free-thinker\u2019 nor the acceptance of other religions.</p><br/><p>Why was that?</p><br/><p>Easy. The god was real in this world.</p><br/><p>No really, you can actually see them.</p><br/><p>At one end, there was the Adventurer Guild. Following the usual tropes of an orthodox Adventurer Guild, it did give an adventurer card. And this card was created by god.</p><br/><p>Another troupe, one was to touch the crystal ball and the card would materialize above it. This crystal would appear once a guild was built.</p><br/><p>Good grief. That grandpa\u2026 the spells were all Japanese and even the Adventurer Guild was as orthodox as they came. It all reminded me of him. I was really doubting if he was doing it on purpose.</p><br/><p>Anyway, that was the reason for the absence of religious problems. This was a world where you can feel God working his \u2018magic\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hmm~ I am looking forward to it. \u201d</p><br/><p>I lay on the creaking bed, muttering to myself. The inn itself was rather worn out but the Innkeeper looked like a good person. He did not reveal any disgust at Buu-san too. I believed that I would not be dragged into another kidnapping situation this time round. Please no.</p><br/><p>We rented 2 rooms. Ivan-san had stubbornly opposed to sharing a room with me.</p><br/><p>How sad. Onii-san, you made me really sad.</p><br/><p>He said nothing could stop him but it seemed that cross-dressing was way too disgusting for him.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Ahhh\u2026..He misunderstood. He totally misunderstooddd!!</p><br/><p>I had to lay it down that this was really not my hobby! We would spend a lot of time together since I hired him so what was this uneasy situation? Ahh, whatever. I was not going to bother about that. Nope. Uh-uh. Not bothering.</p><br/><p>Zirco-san looked like he was going to persuade Ivan-san as he left for the other room. Buu-san followed him. Since I was the one being targeted by [Shadows], it would make it easier to lure them too, being the only one left.</p><br/><p>Tomorrow, we are going to get a guild card in replacement of identity papers for Ivan-san.</p><br/><p>While we are on it, I would love to get mine created as well but\u2026 ah, sadly, this was an undercover mission. Since I can\u2019t really deceive God\u2019s Eyes, I can\u2019t get my guild card made.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s too bad. That\u2019s too bad.</p><br/><p>But, then, even so!!</p><br/><p>It is going to be my first time in an Adventurer Guild! Was there anything more exciting than this? No, there wasn\u2019t! I did not enter one in my past life too. No, something would be wrong if I did.</p><br/><p>I was so excited!</p><br/><p>Guild!!</p><br/><p>It was when I was laying on my bed, thinking about these stuff.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026!? \u201d</p><br/><p>A chill ran through my entire body. What was this\u2026.!? Someone in the room next door was asserting his/her strong mana. Goosebumps appeared all over my body.</p><br/><p>The moment I came to my senses, I threw open the door and rushed over to the room next door.</p><br/><p>[Shadow].</p><br/><p>[Shadow] came.</p><br/><p>I thought they would come for me! Damn it!</p><br/><p>As I smashed open the door to the room next door, everyone there was enclosed in a large amount of mana and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201d A\u2026 ah\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Standing in the doorway, I could see a piece of paper fluttering in the middle of the room.</p><br/><p>\u300e 3 people were received. They would be placed under William Beryl. Please head over to my hall this evening.</p><br/><p>Chief of Shadows Spinel \u300f</p><br/><p>[TN: 3 people had been saved. 3 people had been saved. No survivors. 3 people had been saved.]</p><br/><p>I swallowed after reading the letter before crushing it in my hand.</p><br/><p>Damn it\u2026.</p><br/><p>What kind of invitation was this?</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b</p><br/><p>[TN: Kage, Hikou, Touka. Shadow, Flight, Pass (through)]</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t even have the time to open the window. I activated the magic with an image of passing through buildings like a ghost. Flying straight up into the sky at once, I set up a barrier around me. Following that, I enhanced my senses and sped up my thinking and then started searching for the presence of Zirco-san and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.Nothing. \u201d</p><br/><p>I increased my enhancement.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Nothing?! \u201d</p><br/><p>I further increased\u2026.. but stopped. The information flooding my head was making me dizzy but forget about that.</p><br/><p>Nothing. I got nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201d Why\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>The word echoed around me. Upon the enhancements, the area I could search was bigger than the continent itself.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.a\u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Even so, why?</p><br/><p>The huge loss and that feeling that was slowly boiling over inside of me was unmistakably anger. Towards the [Shadows].</p><br/><p>No. Me. Towards the useless me.</p><br/><p>In the end, I hadn\u2019t changed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Damn! \u201d</p><br/><p>The tiny curse that I muttered did not get out but instead, whirled inside of me.</p><br/><p>It was always like this.</p><br/><p>Always. Always. Every time I wanted to try my best I ended up kicking the air. In my previous world and in this world, in the end, nothing changed. No matter how many [Cheat] I got from god, I am still me.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015In a good sense as well as the bad one.</p><br/><p>Every time I moved to protect the ones I love and every time I exposed them to danger instead. I can\u2019t stop my frustration. Buu-san\u2019s identity might be discovered. I felt very uneasy.</p><br/><p>Mother, Father, Chiffon, Zen and Selphy.</p><br/><p>Even Zirco-san, Buu-san and Ivan-san.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>I was reincarnated into this environment where I was surrounded by all these people whom I love and loved me back. Why did you have to get in the way?</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 Ah.</p><br/><p>\u201d Zirco Ninja \u300a\u300b! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Buhual\u300a\u300b! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ivan \u300a\u300b! \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Pumpkin \u300a\u300b!

I had the advantage in spells chanting too. I shall use everything I can use.</p><br/><p>*Ping</p><br/><p>At the same moment an electronic noise sounded, a map with 3 red dots on it, floated up in front of me.</p><br/><p>Stupid. I was really stupid.</p><br/><p>Anyway, let\u2019s breathe in and calm down first. Why did I panic so hard when it was only their presence I failed to detect?</p><br/><p>\u201d Let\u2019s go. \u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time I said the 2 words, I shot through the sky. As I flew through the sky as if I was gliding, the corners of my mouth curved. The deadening silence of the upper sky was paired with the biting coldness.</p><br/><p>3 dots represented the positions of where the 3 of them were.</p><br/><p>It was at a town outside of Center.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Shall I change chants to aria?

Then suddenly, in the middle of everything, the scenery changed and I seemed to be sitting on top of a sofa. I thought they tried to ask about my identity a few times but I was beginning to think that the reason I could not move might be because the collar was broken.</p><br/><p>That thinking / hope only lasted for an instance before disappointment crashed in.</p><br/><p>[TN: She heard or knew it was because of her broken bones.]</p><br/><p>Before I realized it, the cloth around my neck was unfastened and my collar revealed.</p><br/><p>Then, the angel-like child walked over and without even asking anything, started to murmur something.</p><br/><p>A warm mana then wrapped around me and around my neck area, a sound was heard.</p><br/><p>My understanding couldn\u2019t catch up.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026..Why? \u201d</p><br/><p>The word just slipped out.</p><br/><p>I had a feeling I said that before. But right now, my cracking voice exposed my emotions. My clouded world just suddenly became clear. Unable to process all of this, my vision went white.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Onee-san, who came to recognize that her collar had been taken off, looked at me with eyes filled with questions before passing out. The control from the collar was broken which allowed her to faint from the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sensei, what do you think? \u201d</p><br/><p>Before she fainted, the expression that she had, made me felt like she was no longer our enemy.</p><br/><p>By my voice, Sensei seemed to have come back from his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026How many times do you want my heart to stop\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei, who was sighing, sounded happy despite his words.</p><br/><p>\u2026It was going to be hard after this. But really, I was only grasping at straws just now.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am not a guinea pig, you know? \u201d</p><br/><p>I was going to try my upturned eyes attack!</p><br/><p>This was super embarrassing but I would do anything to protect my mental health! My life was precious to me!</p><br/><p>In the end, Sensei snickered at me.</p><br/><p>\u2026Wasn\u2019t it fine? You didn\u2019t have to laugh at me\u2014!</p><br/><p>But just a little, I was relieved that Sensei was still Sensei. I had been afraid that our relationship would fall apart by me using my magic.</p><br/><p>I was embarrassed at myself for thinking about this!</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.And so, is this Onee-san our enemy? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, maybe. Will, are you thinking that she is not an enemy? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes\u2026 It is just my intuition though. \u201d</p><br/><p>John-sensei heard the last part I murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201d My intuition is telling me the same thing but\u2026 without anything concrete\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>He said, troubled.</p><br/><p>\u2026Sensei, who had a troubled look, looked at Onee-san. With dusk lighting framing the both of them, they looked picture-perfect\u2026</p><br/><p>Damn\u2026 I was so jealous of their beautiful faces\u2026</p><br/><p>For a moment, I stood there, hanging my head, before managing to continue the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201d But, having the collar attached means that it is very likely Onee-san has no idea who her \u2018client\u2019 is, right? \u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. Of course, in the best case, the person who attached the collar was the one who ordered this job. But they had went through the trouble to attach the collar onto her, which meant the \u2018owner\u2019 would not want the \u2018client\u2019 to control them easily. Which was why, it was most unlikely that it was the \u2018client\u2019 who attached it.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.I agree\u2026 Well then, let us wait till she regains her consciousness, shall we? I am sure Master will return by tomorrow as well. \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei said, nodding at me. Catching his meaning, I chanted.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300a\u300b\u201d [TN: Chiyu, Heal]</p><br/><p>And another on just in case.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300a\u300b\u201d [TN: Buki Tanchi, Weapons Detection]</p><br/><p>I chanted as I imagined if any weapons were found hidden on her, even with her clothes on, would emit a red glow. Her arm and leg glowed. I removed the pointy-knife-like weapon and passed them over to Sensei before he carried her over to the bed.</p><br/><p>I then remembered the other 2 and gave them the same treatment as Onee-san.</p><br/><p>By then, it was so deep into the night that the sky might just be getting bright soon. Somehow today seemed to be extremely tiring\u2026 I had unknowingly tensed myself up all this time and when I relaxed, a strong wave of sleepiness swept over me.</p><br/><p>Uwah\u2026..Slee\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026. ll\u2026 ill\u2026 Will! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Y, yes! \u201d</p><br/><p>I answered by reflex as I seemingly heard Sensei shouting my name.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Hm? Why is Sensei here? \u201d</p><br/><p>When I realized it, Sensei was lying beside me in my bed, with his clothes in a mess. I thought no one would blame me for panicking a bit. I turned to John Sensei with surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201d Why? \u2026You\u2026 Will, you grabbed onto my clothes and fell asleep and I tried but I could not release your grip. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Uh\u2026eh\u2026. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>It was deep in my psyche to apologize reflexively. And when I looked around, I found out that the room I was in was not my own but Sensei\u2019s\u2026</p><br/><p>At that point I snapped out of my drowsiness and remembered all that happened yesterday.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right\u2026 I removed the trio\u2019s collars, healed them, placed Onee-san on my bed and the rest on the sofa\u2026 with restrictions.</p><br/><p>I snapped up. Mary-san was going to my room to wake me up!</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s okay, it is not the time yet. I woke you up early. \u201d</p><br/><p>Like he had just read my mind, Sensei smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well, thank you for all your hard work yesterday. You saved me. Thank you. \u201d</p><br/><p>John-sensei said his thanks again, making me a little awkward. But the smile, void of any scheming or plans, from John-sensei was extremely destructive.</p><br/><p>E..Even me\u2026 In the future\u2026 I can!</p><br/><p>Undauntedly, I smiled and turned to Sensei.</p><br/><p>\u201d You are welcome. \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Sensei stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, shall we clean things up before Mary-san comes? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>We moved the trio to the office and I went back to my bed, feigning sleep. By the way, John-sensei was in the office as well because he had not \u2018returned home\u2019 yet and would cause surprise if seen.</p><br/><p>I managed to pull one over Mary-san\u2019s eyes and after breakfast, succeeded in secluding myself in the office. How did I do it? \u2026. Please do not ask. I said something along the lines of aspiring to become Father\u2026 Who was I explaining to, anyway?</p><br/><p>As I was bathed in questions after questions from Sensei in the office, my savior came home. Hearing a knock, I looked out into the corridor and saw a maid standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201d Young Master Will, Master has returned. \u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, the maid seemed to be in high spirits as she forcefully held my hand and having no choice, I let her as we hurriedly made our way to the entrance hall. Once there, I saw Father, face ashen.</p><br/><p>\u201d Welcome home, Father. \u201d</p><br/><p>Happy that he was back, I rushed over as Father, with an about-to-cry face, laughed and hugged me.</p><br/><p>\u201d You are safe\u2026! Will! \u201d</p><br/><p>Although his beard hurt but I decided to let it go this time. The fact that I returned Father\u2019s hug happily was a secret between us. It must also be my imagination that Mary-san, leading the rest of the maids, looked at that scene of us warmly.</p><br/><p>After that, I dragged Father to his office and together with John, explained all that happened yesterday. Listening with a grim face, Father nodded and began to rely his version of what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201d I had a bad feeling throughout the entire case. As I thought, that was just a lure. \u201d</p><br/><p>Once Father reached the capital, it was confirmed that merchants, who had once been suspected of slave trading, and Nobles that were closed to Veltor, were seen at the harbor. Moreover, they seemed to be piling up large bags of something.</p><br/><p>When Father launched a surprise check on the luggage, both the merchants and Nobles had a nonchalant air about it while smirking. At that point, Father was certain he was tricked and when checked, all the large cages contained only chickens.</p><br/><p>Now it was confirmed he was tricked. He then hastily finished the procedures and proceeded to rush home. To go through such a trouble just to lure him to the capital, he was certain the target was his family. Plus Mother, who possessed the strength to fight back, was staying over after her tea party and John was back to his house due to his mother\u2019s illness. There was only 1 person left to target and just by thinking about it, Father panicked and rushed as fast as he could back home.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will, you did well! You really wanted to help John-sensei right? Amazing! As expected from the son of Lily and me! \u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, I was caught by Father again as he ruffled my hair over and over again.</p><br/><p>\u201d Pleassseeee Stttooopppppppppp!! \u201d</p><br/><p>My cries of distress did not seem to reach Father\u2026</p><br/><p>Shortly after, Mother came back and the 2 looked like they wanted to discuss something. Father let me go and they entered their private room.</p><br/><p>I had done all I could, and would leave the rest to Father. After that, which was\u2026 The Shadow Onee-san\u2019s trio, I guessed\u2026 As I stopped along the corridor, a hand was placed onto my shoulder. Turning back slowly, I saw John-sensei, who had a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, it is time for you to explain. \u201d</p><br/><p>He remembered.</p><br/><p>\u2026.It seemed like my work was not yet done.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026 How do I explain\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>That night.</p><br/><p>After dinner, when everyone was asleep, John was called to the office by Gion.</p><br/><p>\u201d Is it true\u2026. the [Collar of Slavery]? \u201d</p><br/><p>Gion asked bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Yes. I had suspected my own eyes as well. \u2026But it matched the description as written by the court\u2019s classified book. The rest\u2026 will to have to wait till they are awake. \u201d</p><br/><p>John said, looking at the Shadow trio on the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201d It might become a troublesome case\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Gion murmured in a low voice that even John could not catch. In any case, the both of them had the same bitter expression.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: Finally I can see the end of this case. It had been so long\u2026 I dragged it for too long.</p><br/><p>And right now I am hesitating if I could write an explanation of Will\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>But, thank you so much for being with me all this time! I am trying my best so please give me any of your opinions or thoughts so I can use it as a reference. Or rather, I would be extremely glad to receive it!</p><br/><p>Please continue to support [Tensei Shichatta Yo] from now on as well.</p><br/><p>PS: I am crying into my pillow because I just realized this is a such a no-sense name for my novel title. [laughs]</p><br/><p>TN: Argh, long chapter. Enjoy~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

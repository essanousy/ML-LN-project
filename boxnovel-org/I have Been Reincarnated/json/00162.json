I totally forgot about it ( =_=) , I was so busy\u2026</p><br/><p>As the travelling came to an end, I saw the all so familiar gate when we reached Center-Tulle. Thanks to the modified horse carriage, my bum was saved from exploding. Nor was I mistaken to be a ghost due to me floating above the seat. Even Guta was surprised at how little it rocked.</p><br/><p>\u201d So this is the technology of Elzmu. No wonder we we failed\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>He said, mocking himself. Seeing that, I felt a tiny pang of guilt. We were supposed to head through the gate but I had something I wanted to do. You know, like how your right foot was in Center-Tulle while the left foot stayed in Flowason. Or something like that.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will-Sama, what are you doing? \u201d</p><br/><p>Buu-san called out to the me who had moved towards the gate subconsciously. I froze. I had wanted to stepped inside and yelled out \u201d This is it! Center-Tulle! \u201c. What was wrong with me? The boke-soul that was sealed deep inside me was hurting! Must be because of that tsukkomi bear near me.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, nothing. \u201d</p><br/><p>I averted my eyes as I straightened up and walked ahead. I saw the members of the Intelligence Corps paying their toll fees at the gate out of the corner of my eyes but acting as an \u2018innocent\u2019 child, I simply walked right through.</p><br/><p>There was not much difference from the streets of Flowason. Putting it bluntly, the whole place was dreary. The people walking along the street looked dispirited and even the shopkeepers were the same. Although there wasn\u2019t much people walking about in the first place. Compared to the previous trip here, the place looked worst than before. Can a place changed that much in just 6 months?</p><br/><p>\u201d This is\u2026. Center-Tulle? \u201d</p><br/><p>I mumbled, surprised at what I saw. If this was the central of Hattuo, it was to the level where one had to wondered how were they able to entered into the [4 great countries]. I mean, when one spoke about the central, it would be place where all the trading took place as well as being the most crowded.</p><br/><p>Here, you could see wood shavings all over the cobble and\u2026 oh yes. The reason for looking like they were dispirited might be because of the color choices of their clothes. They were all wearing dark colors, like black, brown or navy.</p><br/><p>We then walked to the end of one street in order to not let anyone hear what we were talking.</p><br/><p>\u201d You must be wondering why it changed so much in just a few months. It\u2019s the priests. The people here are afraid of them. \u201d</p><br/><p>Guta said, in a small voice that only I could hear as we walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201d They must be thinking that we are the same as them. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Guta looked that the townsfolk who were taken aback and cringed at the sight of us. Ahh, so that was why. Now I know why they were behaving that way. They were afraid of \u2018us\u2019.</p><br/><p>Although the number of guards weren\u2019t a lot, we still had them. Plus, the clothes on us were clearly of high-quality. Even if we were not thought as priests, they could still see that we were nobles of some kind. With the priests as examples, it was normal for them to fear people who looked like they had power. Don\u2019t wake the sleeping dogs, they always said. And so, they did not even dared to looked at us. They avoided crossing our path and kept their eyes down as they trembled, trying to protected themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201d What a stifling place this is. \u201d</p><br/><p>How suffocating. Not to mention how difficult it was to live in this place. I would had never wanted to live in a place like this if I was a citizen of Hattuo. Even if I was one of the priests.</p><br/><p>I looked at the towering chimney that was situated right in the center of the town, black smoke puffing away from it. Looking down from the chimney, a huge white building can be seen. Detailed sculptures surrounded the drawn and outlined windows. Carved pillars next to the windows were inlay with gold foil.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.That\u2019s the church. \u201d</p><br/><p>Noticing my gaze, Guta turned in the same direction and said emotionlessly. So that\u2019s the church. I glared at the building as I observed it. Not a single spot of dirt was on the green roof. The scale of it fitted the central and it possessed the detailed and beauty of a place where god was honored.</p><br/><p>But it left a bad taste in my mouth.</p><br/><p>Looking at the state of the town left by the priests, I once again felt deeply that they cannot be forgiven.</p><br/><p>\u201d Damn it. \u201d</p><br/><p>I cursed under my breath. Then, I started skipping, avoiding the gap between the cobblestones, as I hummed a song.</p><br/><p>I am a naive and innocent child.</p><br/><p>If I don\u2019t get my mind in gear, I can\u2019t played out the role of a innocent noble child at all.</p><br/><p>\u201d Father, Father! Let\u2019s hurry and find a inn to place all our luggage! I wanna go there! \u201d</p><br/><p>I lifted my head as I gave a huge smile. Following that, I held Guta\u2019s hand. Seeing his shocked expression, I grinned as we walked down the street.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s time to start some cleaning.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>We checked into one of the biggest inn in Center-Tulle. Hmm, no, this was not an inn. It felt more like a high-class hotel. In Earth terms, it\u2019s the kind of hotel where there would be doorman and chandeliers would be hanging from the ceiling.</p><br/><p>I nodded to myself when I saw the extravagant lobby.</p><br/><p>The floor was laid with polished marble that was perfect for sliding on. Looking up, the ceiling had beautiful carvings on it and there was even a huge piece of art on it.</p><br/><p>They sure earned a lot here.</p><br/><p>I worked cleaning in recruitment offices as well as well-to-do families as my part-time job in my previous life so I knew. In order to keep this marble floor shiny, it had to be wiped very thoroughly everyday. Ah, the Aunt\u2026cough cough. I had totally destroyed the memories of being said that I was a butler by Onee-san.</p><br/><p>It was simply a part-time job. I did do things out of my job scope but I was not a servant. I did cursed them to be [drowned in tea] when I was glared at, or made them turned red when they scolded me for a mistake I did. I am sorry.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s get back to the topic. I had no idea how many were working in this hotel but it can\u2019t be a small number. The room maintenance as well as the salaries must all amount to quite a large number.</p><br/><p>Wow.</p><br/><p>My eyeballs almost popped right out of my sockets when I saw how much Guta was paying. No wonder they earned so much! Had they noticed how much they were charging for a night? Was their room service that great?</p><br/><p>It was really an unforgettable time where my normal-average-person mind was blown away by the money view of the rich. I hadn\u2019t even gotten used to walking on the carpet in my own house!</p><br/><p>\u201d What a amazing hotel, Father. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ye, yeah. S, son, this was build around the same time as the church. It looks different from the others, doesn\u2019t it? \u201d</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, the shape of the windows as well as the carvings did looked a little familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201d I see~ \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, as I skipped happily and innocently along. By the way, Buu-san as well as the guards and members of the Intelligence Corps had hidden themselves. As imagined, the bias against Beastmen were still strong here.</p><br/><p>Ah, they were still staying in the same hotel though.</p><br/><p>We paid for everyone up ahead. It was easier this way and Buu-san need not be subjected to any insults as well. They could all entered their rooms directly without being seen. But their rooms were all fully paid. A crime was a crime. I won\u2019t do it even if I won\u2019t be found out.</p><br/><p>I had the Japanese soul of abiding by the rules, such as waiting for the green light even when there was no cars around.</p><br/><p>I reached the last room situated at the end of the corridor. This was going to be my room today. Like a suite room, this was said to be the biggest room in this hotel.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>When I saw the room, my jaws dropped wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wow\u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>A 3rd grade kid remark just slipped right out. Yep, what bad taste. I felt like turning back, and head right home.</p><br/><p>\u201d Guta-san\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes? \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Guta for help but he simply looked at me, puzzled, like there was nothing wrong with the room at all. So this was where our difference in taste laid. Ah, come to think of it, I did had a bad taste in my mouth when I saw Guta\u2019s picture in the textbook. He had on a extravagant and heavy clothing with ample embroidery that exuded a \u2018I am a evil noble\u2019 vibe.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Nothing. \u201d</p><br/><p>Firstly, the first thing that came into my mind when I first laid eyes on it.</p><br/><p>GOLD.</p><br/><p>Lots and lots of it. The wall from the floor all the way to the ceiling was painted in gold, shining and sparkling brightly. And, the ceiling, floor and the walls were all painted very ostentatiously. Just these were bad enough but the ceiling had to be embellished with gemstones and a chandelier, and a magic tool was shooting out lights randomly all around the room.</p><br/><p>The table in the middle of the room was pure white in color, it\u2019s legs filled with detailed carvings and embedded with gold and gemstones. It looked like it would induced halation anytime.</p><br/><p>Just a look and my mouth was filled with a bad taste. I did imagined it would be something like that but this was beyond my expectations. This was just\u2026 an obsession with wealth and all things sparkly.</p><br/><p>What was with furniture causing halation?</p><br/><p>Was this not a place to stay in at and have a rest? Please let my eyes rest. I am Will\u2026. I am Will\u2026. I am Will\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Let\u2019s just head to the bedroom and have a look. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, sure, let\u2019s go. \u201d</p><br/><p>A bedroom. There should be at least a place for the mind and soul to rest, right? I headed towards the bedroom as I prayed for help.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Help didn\u2019t exist whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Sorry for the negativity. This was how shocked I was right now. I was totally defeated.</p><br/><p>The entrance to the bedroom was already in the same style. Just from the living room to the bedroom, there was 3 doors. One was the bathroom, another was like a lounge where a sofa looked like the biggest existence ever and finally, the last one was the bedroom.</p><br/><p>So I actually entered into the bathroom first.</p><br/><p>I was already at my limits. It was to the point where a star symbol would ended every sentence I spoke. Let me asked you, what was the meaning of gold-plating the entire bathtub? What was the meaning of building the toilet bowl with gold? I felt tired just from thinking of the consequences of scratching it. The toilet was a place that would get dirty right? Why did you even build it out of gold for?</p><br/><p>Onii-chan can\u2019t understand at all. Gold was a precious metal that was few and far in-between so you had to use it with care, okay?</p><br/><p>My vision started swimming. This place was too sparkly. My mind was swimming too. Ah, but there were still 2 more rooms to go. It was still too early for despair.</p><br/><p>The next room I entered was the lounge. The amazing thing about this room was that at first look, I had no idea what it was made out of. Since everything was in gold, why not just made it all gold? The sofa was made out of something similar to leather. That material was high-grade and very popular, and could get sold-out in seconds.</p><br/><p>Yep.</p><br/><p>Although the ones that brought it were all adventurers! The name of that material was [Rock Lizard]. It\u2019s english. God, why was this the only place where you use english?</p><br/><p>When translated, Iwa Tokage leather.</p><br/><p>Sure, it was a high-grade material but the comfort level was the worst! The reason for the high grading was because the toughness of it made it a perfect armor for the adventurers! Didn\u2019t you do your research, designer?! Although I don\u2019t know who you were! You would know it immediately once you try sitting on it. Not everything was good if it was expensive!</p><br/><p>I was tired from all the tsukkomi that was flooding my mind. But I still held onto that glimmer of hope. Yes, that was because I haven\u2019t seen the bedroom. A bedroom should be a place for rest.</p><br/><p>How naive. So naive and brainless like Patrick Star.</p><br/><p>[TN: Alright, raw was so sweet like a gum syrup drop. Japanese use the word sweet as another meaning of naive.]</p><br/><p>The feeling I had when I stepped into the room? Despair. Only pure despair.</p><br/><p>I had only imagined it to had a canopy. Who would think that it would be made out of gold threads sewn with sequins and sparkled. On top of that, the gemstones I thought to be was not gemstones. It was mana stones. Plus, it was craved with a magic circle that allowed it to sparkle and shine.</p><br/><p>\u2026.So bright!</p><br/><p>So bright that I can\u2019t open my eyes! Please let me sleep. Please somehow let me sleep.</p><br/><p>And, the main problem was the bed.</p><br/><p>I had at least expected the legs of the bed would be made out of gold.</p><br/><p>I came to knew that the bed itself was woven out of gold threads.</p><br/><p>And surprisingly, silver threads as well.</p><br/><p>Wow, how fancy.</p><br/><p>\u2026..It\u2019s too uncomfortable!!</p><br/><p>Ah, I had enough. My tsukkomi can\u2019t catch up. The comfort level was the worst. This bed was not made for sleeping, it purely for enjoying. After going through the whole suite, I ended near the entrance, my soul drifting away.</p><br/><p>\u201d I had enough\u2026.. I wanna go home\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Did they not think of using wood? The most important was to make it easy on the eyes. Today was the first time I felt that deeply.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

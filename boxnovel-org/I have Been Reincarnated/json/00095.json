This is a comedy. This is a comedy. This is a comedy. Important things must be said thrice.</p><br/><p>This arc will end with the next chapter. Well, to sum this arc up, it\u2019s CROSS DRESSING, Ivan and maybe a dash of The DESTRUCTION DEVIL Demon. Oh, I forgot Spinel but eh, he\u2019s not important.</p><br/><p>The direction Shadow-guy was pointing at was, of course, the place where the 3 of them were laying flat on the ground, covered by my barrier.</p><br/><p>If Zirco-san\u2019s words were true, that [God Slaying Sword] Demon was using could cut through anything. This was going to be really problematic.</p><br/><p>The barrier I set up would most likely by cut down easily. All the attributes, Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, and even Void, which didn\u2019t even exist got cut/destroyed with that broadsword.</p><br/><p>I can escape, but what about the 3 of them?</p><br/><p>It went without saying for Ivan-san but I had experience with the aftermath of being bound by the [Collar Of Slavery]. They won\u2019t be able to move for a while.</p><br/><p>If that Shadow-guy knew about it and that I would release the collars and planned all this in advance, I would admit that he was clever. As one would expect from an underworld specialist. His cunningness was unparalleled.</p><br/><p>\u201d Stop fooling around, you bastard! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I am not fooling around. Sorry for this late introduction. My name is not \u2018bastard\u2019 but Spinel, the chief of [Shadows]. Please to meet you. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b</p><br/><p>[TN: Mu. Nothing or Void I guess.]</p><br/><p>I cannot do nothing. Everything will end if I do! As he seemed like he was about to launch into a villainous laughter, I had enough time to set up a huge ball of nothingness behind Spinel\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Even the so-called Destruction Devil knew that if his summoner died, he would disappear as well so he dashed towards the ball of nothingness excitedly.</p><br/><p>Making use of that gap, I rushed over to the 3.</p><br/><p>[God Slaying Sword].</p><br/><p>A name that was overflowing with chunibyo-ness. As it was the extremely foul aspect of being able to cut anything. And that sword was fast approaching me. The slow-motion world became even slower. I thought I heard screams coming from behind me.</p><br/><p>Able to cut anything. I felt like I heard that somewhere before.</p><br/><p>[TN: Duh. Every LN ever made?]</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laughed even at this timing. Well, I do not think I can avoid this. In that case.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300a\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3083\u304f\u300b! \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Konnyaku Shokan. Summon Konnyaku, a food that has 0 calories. ]</p><br/><p>I summoned a huge Konnyaku to appear in front of me. I apologize to the otherworld factory or supermarket or any family that I stole this from.</p><br/><p>As I stared hard, so hard that I could burn a hole, at the slowly swinging sword, something shocking happened.</p><br/><p>[TN: The slowness was the slow-motion thingy.]</p><br/><p>The edge of the blade touched the Konnyaku. It sank in a little and then\u2026..Boing went the weird elasticity of the Konnyaku and the sword was bounced clean off.</p><br/><p>\u201d Viva Konnyaku\u2026.! \u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Konnyaku can\u2019t be cut in this world as well.</p><br/><p>It was my win.</p><br/><p>\u201d Destruction Devil? Stop joking. Destruction in front of creation doesn\u2019t mean a thing! I will never recognize some chap who can only cut things to be the \u2018Destruction Devil\u2019. You are at most a \u2018battle mania\u2019. \u201d</p><br/><p>I sneered at Demon, who had a bewildered expression on his face, still holding onto his \u2018bounced\u2019 broadsword.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300a\u300b! \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Kabin Shokan. Summon Vase. Ooooh, someone gonna die.]</p><br/><p>I summoned Matilda-san\u2019s vase and dropped it above Demon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Directly at the crown.</p><br/><p>\u201d Besides, the \u2018god\u2019 you speak of is an unreasonable being. For example, making a vase drop out of the sky. \u201d</p><br/><p>Demon collapsed. Then he dissolved into black smog that dispersed into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201d Please do not talk about god. That topic irritates me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Behind me with my smiling face, I am sure you can see an aura in the shape of John-sensei. That was how angry I actually was. I then turned to Spinel directly and let out my mana.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Ah, how stupid I was. Won\u2019t that end instantly?</p><br/><p>\u201d Spinel-san. This is the face of me being merciful. \u201d</p><br/><p>Spinel fainted just like that, with a stunned expressions stuck on his face. Well, I was rather evil in the end.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>First you tie Spinel up with magic~\u266a</p><br/><p>Just a little, and a little more, increase the gravity and extract the mana~\u266a</p><br/><p>And ta-dah, Spinel-scroll is done~\u266a</p><br/><p>I tied Spinel up in an easy-to-understand way those children programs often used. I had extracted all of his mana and bound him up with my magic so even if he woke up, there was nothing he could do. Plus I increased the gravity hold on him too. There was no way he could move. Not even I could move.</p><br/><p>Buu-san, who as lying right beside, was making a face as if he stepped on a bug\u2026..no, as if he bit on that bug. Was it just my imagination? I want it to be.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2026 was rather unbearable. \u201d</p><br/><p>It was my imagination that he said that with a miserable face. Yep.</p><br/><p>Anyway, I was happy that this trip, to chase after [Shadow], was over.</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, I was shocked at how fast this case was settled. At this speed, it was like I devised this whole thing before bringing the case to the \u2018detective agency\u2019. I couldn\u2019t help but had these kind of doubts.</p><br/><p>Having said that, I can\u2019t stay in Hattuo for a vacation either. Because we were here to do a job. We can\u2019t delay the report.</p><br/><p>I wanted to go for a bit of sight-seeing but\u2026there was no choice. Let\u2019s come back for a vacation the next time.</p><br/><p>Well, for now, I transported the 3 at once, who can\u2019t move because of the backlash from the [Collar of Slavery]. Of course, Spinel too. And when the scene changed to the bed in room of the inn I was staying.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wi\u2026. Willlll-dono?! This place is?! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wi-Willia-chan?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Although I was neither Willlll or Wi-Willia, I resigned myself to it. It was normal for them to be confused. I was sure if I was in their shoes, I would be so shocked that my hiccups wouldn\u2019t stop. Although I was not hiccuping right now.</p><br/><p>But, then.</p><br/><p>\u201d Aaaaaaahhhhhhaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiioooooooouuuuuuuu! \u201d</p><br/><p>Stop shaking me!</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t explain like this even if I want to!</p><br/><p>\u201d Stop it! \u201d</p><br/><p>I shook off their hands and jumped. In the air, I then pulled out my paper fan from my pendent.</p><br/><p>\u201d Gwah! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Uwah! \u201d</p><br/><p>Yosh, they calmed down. I waved my hand in front of their eyes and their line of vision followed it.</p><br/><p>Hm, they looked fine\u2026I think\u2026maybe? Yep.</p><br/><p>\u201d Do you need an explanation? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d Isn\u2019t it obvious?! \u201c\u201d</p><br/><p>I shrank back from the perfect harmony from the both of them\u2026. not. I stared in mute amazement as I regained my composure.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm\u2026.. You should know that I am the eldest son of the Duke of Elzmu Country, Gion Beryl, right? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wait a minute. That was real? \u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect I would pause at this stage.</p><br/><p>Ivan-san asked, his eyes wondering about desperately.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I thought it was a gh\u2026 ghost. \u201d</p><br/><p>At Ivan-san\u2019s words, my eyes turns into dots. [TN: This]</p><br/><p>This was really a bolt out of the blue.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Ghost? \u201d</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t help but parrot his words.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yea. I thought it was a Noble ghost called Will that was possessing Willia-chan. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..That\u2019s not it. Both inner and outer are all Will, you know? 100% man. If you want I can strip, no, please let me strip. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco-san put a stop to the me who was desperately trying to prove myself and erased the shame.</p><br/><p>Whoa, whoa.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am sorry, I went a little out of control there. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d No\u2026.no problem. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d The proof that I am not a ghost\u2026 Oh right. \u300a\u300b! \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Akurei Taisan, Banish, Oh Evil spirits!]</p><br/><p>White flames raised up at my chant and licked my body. The bed remained unburned. Although this spell was from the Fire attribute, it was a flame that deal with spirits, like ghosts, zombies and undead. The laws of nature?</p><br/><p>No no. This is a magical world that is full of fantasy, you know?</p><br/><p>Ah, correction.</p><br/><p>This is a fantasy world full of magic. Don\u2019t be bothered about it too much. In laymen terms, it was something like the Holy Fire. [TN: Fox Fire in japanese]</p><br/><p>I felt a little sorry for surprising Ivan-san but this was the only way I could prove that I was not possessed by a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201d Is this okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wh, what is this? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Magic. A fire magic that banishes ghosts. It\u2019s the magic you want the guild to cast on Will-dono. \u201d</p><br/><p>I nodded and it looked like Ivan-san finally understood.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh. Then then then Willia\u2026 Will-sama is really a noble? \u201d</p><br/><p>To grind it into him, whose eyes were pleading me to say it wasn\u2019t true, I nodded sternly.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d And, by the way, I can use magic of all attribute! \u201d</p><br/><p>Perfect timing, yay!</p><br/><p>I announced with a wink.</p><br/><p>\u201d Is\u2026.that\u2026..true\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Tee hee\u266a \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco-san simply fell back and fainted.</p><br/><p>Hm.</p><br/><p>It was lucky we were on my bed.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: I had a huge impulse to translate it as</p><br/><p>I love you, You love me~\u266a</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s make a Spinel Scroll with me~\u266a</p><br/><p>With a little bit of magic ropes &amp; gravity~\u266a</p><br/><p>Extract his mana &amp; that\u2019s all you need~\u266a</p><br/><p>He he he.</p><br/><p>And look, We got ourselves a John-sensei mention.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

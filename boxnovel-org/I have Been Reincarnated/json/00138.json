O, oi! It\u2019s time to go meet my friends! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d No\u2026. but that\u2019s what you thought, didn\u2019t you? Your expressions just got weirder and weirder as the conversation went on! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Stop it! \u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, I was very red at this moment. That was because I did felt weird! My HP had already reached zero!</p><br/><p>\u201d I mean, ku ha ha\u2026 When I was rubbing your head, you were thinking about it, weren\u2019t you? \u201d</p><br/><p>The laughing John-Sensei then suddenly straighten his posture and look at me in all seriousness.</p><br/><p>\u201d John-Sensei\u2026.? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s okay. Because I have found a better lover than research\u2026 and that is you, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>And he smiled happily. He was doing it on purpose! Don\u2019t go with the flow at this kind of stuff, Sensei! Your acting is through the roof! Let\u2019s stop with this! If this continued, we would be eaten alive by some girls!</p><br/><p>And as that thought was running through my mind, something heavy hitting the floor was heard behind me. And it was from the doorway.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wi\u2026 Will\u2026 It can\u2019t be!! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Will-Samaaa!!! This is what I was trying to prevent!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Just like a rusted robot, my neck turned creakily towards the direction of the voices. And the scene that greeted me was Chiffon and Selphy had turned and ran away, leaving a frozen Zen standing at the doorway, a weird expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wait! No! It\u2019s a misunderstanding!! \u201d</p><br/><p>I yelled after it fully registered in but I was too late. The girls were gone. The one remaining was the frozen Zen and the dejected me. And a John-Sensei who laughed so hard that he almost chocked.</p><br/><p>With a faraway look in my eyes, I began scolding the me a few minutes ago, the me who told them that it was okay to head to my room once they are done preparing.</p><br/><p>I AM AN IDIOT!! No matter how much a joke I wanted to pulled on them, this was too much\u2026.!!!!!</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, so it\u2019s actually like that\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019m relieved\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Chiffon and Selphy both gave a sigh of relief. I did the same thing quietly. I had chased after girls after that and had thoroughly and careful explained what happened and managed to clear the misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s too much of a taboo to be dating Sensei.</p><br/><p>Really, please stop it.</p><br/><p>Recalling the tragedy that happened in my previous life, I trembled. I had once fooled around with Terao like that in the classroom. And the girls who saw that, froze at the doorway and tiny mutterings of \u2018The tiny book is heating up!\u2019 could be heard.</p><br/><p>[TN: Tiny book refers to BL dojinshi]</p><br/><p>Of course, that that time, to the naive Sho, he had thought that they were scolding him and was dejectedly looking up that phrase through the internet.</p><br/><p>\u2026.And got a rude shock.</p><br/><p>That was why, having this kind of misunderstanding was harmful to my mental health. Although it did not reached the level of having a trauma, but it did still raised goosebumps all over.</p><br/><p>\u201d I believed I said it before but, I love girls. I am straight\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, I just said that at the dining table not too long again but who would had thought that in just a few hours, this misunderstanding would happened?</p><br/><p>Today was not my day.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ri, right! \u201d</p><br/><p>To the me who was moaning as I hugged my head, Chiffon replied in a panic. Selphy was grinning for some reason I can\u2019t comprehend. Zen had a even weirder expression on his face that I really can\u2019t comprehend.</p><br/><p>\u201d What, Zen? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah no. I just thought\u2026 as expected of Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>What do you meant by expected of me? Please, do tell.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it turned dark outside. The sun had completely set during the chaos. The timing was just right. Let\u2019s just stick with this silver lining.</p><br/><p>Well, it was about the time to fire off the fireworks. And everyone turned towards the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh Will. Are you all prepared? \u201d</p><br/><p>When we reached the entrance, Father and Mother were waiting there. As Father walked towards me with his arms out-stretched, I was enveloped with a bad feeling and I quickly backpedaled.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep, all preparations are finished. I had brought Sensei here too. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s great! Well then, let\u2019s all head towards the hill. \u201d</p><br/><p>Although our mansion were build on top of the highest hill, the 2nd highest hill we were heading to were located at the north side of the mansion. It was said that the higher we fired from, the better the view would be.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh, are Father and Mother both coming along too? I am only passing it to them though? \u201d</p><br/><p>I asked, as I continued to moved away from Father bit by bit. As I do not know the technique to fire it, I would be passing the fireworks to the professionals uncles to do it.</p><br/><p>We would only be heading towards the hill to passed them the fireworks before heading back to enjoyed it.</p><br/><p>\u201d As this is going to become a tradition, it would be better to meet them directly and give them thanks. \u201d</p><br/><p>I see. I used Zen as a shield against Father who was clinging onto me and quickly head towards the hill.</p><br/><p>\u201d Er, erm, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen called out, troubled. But I had no intentions of releasing him. Fu fu fu. Please become the sacrifice on behalf of your friend! Dear brave Zen!</p><br/><p>\u201d What, shield? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh, somehow that way of calling sounds very rude. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You\u2019re just imagining things. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ehhhhh\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>I grabbed onto Zen\u2019s wrist and stretched it out in front of me. Well, it\u2019s time to go or the hunter (Father) would get me!</p><br/><p>To the hill-!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

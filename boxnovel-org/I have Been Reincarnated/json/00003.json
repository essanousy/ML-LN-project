I still cannot seem to get used to walking on the so-soft-your-feet-just-might-sink-into-it carpet. Eh, isn\u2019t walking barefooted better for this?</p><br/><p>Being conservative is the part of Japanese culture. And essentially the inner me was raised with the sense of values of a commoner. To this commoner, this luxurious carpet is terrifying.</p><br/><p>But enough about trivial matters.</p><br/><p>Today, I was summoned to the office by my father. [TN: I used Dad before but now I\u2019m wondering if Father would be a better fit..] I hardly get to meet my parents around noon time as they are usually busy with their duties so this is pretty rare. I..It\u2019s not that I am excited about the fact that I get to play with him after so long! I am not happy at all since it is Father who I am meeting.</p><br/><p>Eh? My humming? Ah, it\u2019s that. The chants that monks do before they undergo their strict training. Yep, that.</p><br/><p>How was the debut the other day? Don\u2019t ask that! Why? Somehow the moment I was up on the stage, a commotion stirred among the guests. That shook me up and I fumbled with my lines.</p><br/><p>And the commotion got louder.</p><br/><p>Surely they were surprised as to why one would make a normal words-fumbling 3 years old, an age that one would call too young, to give an introductory speech for a debut. What a doting idiot Father, they might think.</p><br/><p>Recalling that memory, I sigh. Anyway, I don\u2019t think I will encounter another doomsday level stage event again so it should be all right\u2026 I am raising a flag aren\u2019t I? [TN: Yes you are.]</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t wanna! I am going to escape with all my strength if that ever happens. Don\u2019t underestimate the stealth skill that I have been polishing from my baby years where I used to sneak into the library.</p><br/><p>The conversations went on within myself as I walked along the soft carpet, I found myself at the destination already. In front of me is a stupidly huge wooden door and beyond, the area which my Dad is in for every afternoon, his office. Every time I looked at it I couldn\u2019t help thinking what a useless idiotically huge door. One so big that if you do not twist your neck up to look up you cannot get the entire view of it.</p><br/><p>I knocked lightly and immediately my Father\u2019s voice could be heard asking me to enter. Tall stacks of paper can be seen on the table as I enter. As this was my first time entering, I could not help but be in awe and started looking around. Seeing me, Father laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hey Will, if you look around that much you are going to twist your neck off. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d No I won\u2019t! \u201d</p><br/><p>I did not do that much looking around! Although it was true that I was charmed by the shelves of Spells Books.</p><br/><p>\u2026I have been acting more and more like a child these few days, let\u2019s be more careful. I let out the air that I used to puff my cheeks with.</p><br/><p>\u201d So what is the matter? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I was just thinking it\u2019s about time to hire a tutor for you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Even though my Father said that, the norm for hiring a tutor to teach about things like common knowledge, political movements, writing and math are usually when a child turns 5 for the Nobles.</p><br/><p>It must be that my appeal of wanting to study towards my Father finally got through.</p><br/><p>Eh, it\u2019s very tiring, appealing while acting like a 3 year old. I can get knowledge from reading on my own but it is rather difficult to explain when asked [TN: Remember guys, he\u2019s only 3.] so I am aiming for this development!</p><br/><p>Of course, I agree with a force as if to say \u201d Yeah! I have been waiting for this! \u201c.</p><br/><p>\u201d But Will, why are you in such a rush to study? \u201d</p><br/><p>My intention that was conveyed to my Father perfectly made him asked about the reason. It could be said that it was because of my thirst for knowledge but to tell the truth, there was another reason for it.</p><br/><p>I look at my feet. [TN: The direct translation is : I stared at the carpet.] I can feel blood rushing to my face and I am pretty sure I am blushing hard right now.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.Father is always busy right? I..will study so I can help Father. \u201d</p><br/><p>Touched, my Father started tearing.</p><br/><p>This is embarrassing to admit but I am kinda proud of my Father and I genuinely want to help out with his work. His looks are average so is this what they call charisma\u2026.? [TN: Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll have it. All LN MC have it. ]</p><br/><p>\u201d Will, thank you! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d It is my duty! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ahh, thank you! And, about the tutor\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Father\u2019s face clouded over slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah. What\u2019s the matter? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, no, I don\u2019t know much about the person himself\u2026 but he is definitely one of the guests at your birthday party. \u201d</p><br/><p>It is rare to see Father hesitating.</p><br/><p>\u201d Rather than saying he is a scholar working at the Royal Castle, it might be more fitting to call him a researcher\u2026 He is not a bad person but\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Eccentric? \u201d</p><br/><p>Father paused again.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026eccentric\u2026Hmm\u2026How should I explain. As the 2nd son of Viscount Veltor, he abandoned the family name\u2026 Sorry, the application was too sudden so I am not very clear on the details. A person who took great care of me in the Royal Castle told me about him, John Veltor, greatly desired to work here as your tutor. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.It is not Veltor himself who applied? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah no\u2026erm, would you understand if I said there\u2019s heavy taxes involved\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>I do. [TN: I don\u2019t.]</p><br/><p>I might have looked at him with reproachful eyes. Flustering, Father mumbled \u201d No matter who recommended him, hiring a strange man is\u2026 \u201c.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hmm\u2026.? \u201d</p><br/><p>I murmured before turning around to face Father with a smile. That person who took care of Father must be one that is of a higher rank\u2026 Oh well, as long as I get to study. Besides, I shouldn\u2019t be willful.</p><br/><p>\u201d Father, it\u2019s okay, I understand. \u201d</p><br/><p>With a face that screams \u2018I was saved\u2019, Father grabs both of my hands.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh! Try your best! \u201d</p><br/><p>As of now, the road of knowledge seems to be full of difficulties.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>And today is the day who the role of education \u2013 my tutor, is coming. My current state is of extreme shock. Sitting right opposite the desk across from me is a striking man with shiny black pupils and glossy black hair that is loosely tied up. His gorgeousness is amplified when he gently smiles. Plus his legs are long. Damn it!</p><br/><p>Ju..Just wait till I grow up\u2026!</p><br/><p>He was in the drawing room having a discussion with Father before being invited into my room and introduced to me. Yes, he is really my tutor. [TN: Yea, I think we got it.]</p><br/><p>Seeing that he came from a family of corrupted nobles, my image was of a fat and prideful man. Instead, a slim handsome young man [TN: Ikemen. I\u2019m calling him Ikemen from now on.] walked in. Really, you can\u2019t blame me for being surprised.</p><br/><p>Plus, this Ikemen was looking at Father with sparkling eyes of admiration like how kids\u2019 eyes looked like when they were at a Hero\u2019s stage show. But for some reason, once he entered this room, his expressions went stiff. That, coupled with his upturned eyes, makes him look quite scary.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, sorry, I am kind of nervous. As you already know, I am John Veltor and I am going to be your tutor from now on. \u201d</p><br/><p>Said John-sensei timidly, with a stiff and slightly embarrassed face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, I will be in your care. My name is William-Beryl, you can just call me Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Why is it that only his name got an equal = sign in it?].</p><br/><p>Saying that, I bowed and for some reason, John-sensei was showing a surprised expression. Did I do something wrong? Nothing came to mind so I ignored it. For this kind of moment usually one would look for another subject to talk about\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm, what should I call Mr Veltor from now on? \u201d</p><br/><p>Mr Veltor smiled.</p><br/><p>[TN: This name change is in the web novel. Is the author experimenting with all sorts of combination for John Veltor?]</p><br/><p>\u201d You can call me whatever you like. However\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>He had a slightly bitter yet teasing expression on.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026anything but Veltor. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, I get it.</p><br/><p>I finally believed that, indeed, this man, as rumors said, had abandoned his family name. Right now, he seems like an honest and gentlemanly fellow and I cannot sense any bad vibes from him nor he seems like the type who uses flattery.</p><br/><p>In fact, he feels a bit like a puppy\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026I can\u2019t deny the possibility that he might be a sly fox who had won thousands of mind battles.</p><br/><p>My instinct? Not a bad guy.</p><br/><p>Happy by this fact, I smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then, John-sensei! Is that okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, if it\u2019s a tutor, then it cannot be anything other than Sensei right!</p><br/><p>[TN: I think you all knows what Sensei (teacher) means\u2026]</p><br/><p>Once I said that, John-sensei beamed at me.</p><br/><p>\u2026What is this sense of defeat? Hm.</p><br/><p>He is beautiful. He is handsome. He is a bespectacled Ikemen prodigy.</p><br/><p>\u2026And also a gentleman.</p><br/><p>It might had been he was nervous before. Now that I looked at him again, yet first impression was not wrong. He is really an Ikemen. [TN: An Ikemen?] This is the first time I felt an intimacy with a black pupil, black haired person ever since I arrived in this world.</p><br/><p>Grrr\u2026. I\u2019m jealous.</p><br/><p>[TN: Missing Terao?]</p><br/><p>It\u2019s okay! In the future even with an average face I will be popular!</p><br/><p>\u201d By the way Mister Will.. \u201d [TN: He is using -sama.]</p><br/><p>I nearly drowned in the tears of my thoughts before John-sensei\u2019s voice pulled me back to reality.</p><br/><p>\u201d John-sensei, please stop with the \u2018Mister\u2019. \u201d</p><br/><p>Again with the formal tone! As a tutor we are going to be together for a long time to come and if we are to be this formal, my upper lip was going to go stiff! [TN: In original text : My shoulders are going to go stiff. ] Ah, this is not a pun\u2026you there, don\u2019t say that it\u2019s cold! [TN: Cold jokes = pun\u2026get it?] It is an accident, just an accident.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then\u2026 Will\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Is fine. \u201d [TN: Original text is that he is to call Will-kun, not -sama.]</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Eh\u2026That is a bit\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s okay because you are my Sensei! \u201d</p><br/><p>I got impatient and reflexively puffed my cheeks. With a slightly troubled face, Sensei finally agrees to call me Will.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah yes Sensei, what is it that you want to ask? \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, pulling the conversation back on track. Hearing this, John-sensei turn serious.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah. It\u2019s just..If you don\u2019t mind me asking, it is a little early for a 3 year old to have a tutor. I was wondering if you made this request or was it Sir Gion\u2019s idea? \u201d</p><br/><p>This person\u2019s eye sparkles whenever the topic is about Father. He really seems to admire Father. Me too, apart from his face, aim to be like Father. [TN: What is wrong with his face? I mean he even has fangirls around the world!]</p><br/><p>Sorry for dashing your hope\u2026 I gave a small bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, it was me who requested for a tutor. \u201d</p><br/><p>John-sensei looks to be very shocked.</p><br/><p>\u2026Yep, I\u2019m sorry for betraying your expectations\u2026</p><br/><p>But Sensei too, betrayed my expectations so I was not in the wrong!</p><br/><p>[TN: Do you prefer a prideful fat Sensei instead?]</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s Will\u2026? But why? I don\u2019t mean to be rude but boys at your age usually only think about having fun. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I don\u2019t know anything. I am proud seeing Father so needed (busy) but as for me, I can\u2019t help with anything\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Sensei with a mischievous glint in my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026And I am frustrated with that. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN : I meant to finished this yesterday but I had overtime so\u2026Enjoy!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

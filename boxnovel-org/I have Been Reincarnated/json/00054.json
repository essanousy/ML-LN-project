And for that reason, we were also grouped under the Faeries by the Human race.</p><br/><p>But, I was the bottom of the pile. Even within my village, I was ridiculed. Because I could not make a clear distinction of what I should and should not hear. In other words, I lacked control. The faeries voices were heard on 24 hours. It never stopped. Like a ringing sound that just wouldn\u2019t go away. It just kept bouncing around my head. I was already at my limit.</p><br/><p>There were loads of faeries in my village as we were in the middle of a forest. Which was why my parents told me to attend the Capital\u2019s Phillis Academy since there were lesser faeries there than what we had here (village). The Capital was also at the front lines in terms of research so they might have a way to heal me.</p><br/><p>Fear of me being lonely, being separated from my parents, they enrolled me into a dormitory so I could make some friends.</p><br/><p>It was true in the academy, the number of faeries were not as much and I did not feel the giddiness I felt in my village. However\u2026\u2026 Once I entered the dormitory, the noise! It was as bad as ever!</p><br/><p>As everyone began to do self-introductions happily, my heart was just not there.</p><br/><p>So noisy, so noisy, so damn noisy!!</p><br/><p>Please stop talking!</p><br/><p>I had begged them millions of times.</p><br/><p>And was rejected millions of times.</p><br/><p>They were laughing at me, saying it was my own fault for hearing them. That they wouldn\u2019t obey orders from a person with mana lower than them.</p><br/><p>It was impossible.</p><br/><p>I would have to live with this noise forever. I hate myself for thinking this way. I hate the faeries that forced me to think this way.</p><br/><p>I somehow managed to endure through the day. But I am reaching my limit.</p><br/><p>Today my class went through body check-ups. They also had \u007ftheir mana measured but as Elves usually have a higher amount of mana, the check for me would be done on a different day with a different crystal ball.</p><br/><p>Through the gaps from the classroom, I saw how everyone placed their hand on the crystal ball. The day was ending soon. It was still fine in the classroom, but in the dormitory\u2026. Why was it so noisy in there!?</p><br/><p>The last student was a very beautiful boy. He looked like he skipped grades to be here. Because he looked younger than all of us, plus, he was really afraid of the crystal ball. Try your best! I shouted in my heart, encouraging him and when his fingers touched the crystal ball, it shattered! He, who fell on his butt, started bleeding. Was he okay?! Sensei then, in a panic, brought him somewhere.</p><br/><p>Worried, I looked down the corridor and saw the rest of my classmate, as worried as I was. The whole classroom was in a buzz and the faeries buzzed along with them. My ears hurt! I scowled at the noise and at this time, Sensei came back. With a shout, he quieted the class down. It affected the faeries too, as they fell silent as well. \u2026.Zelda-sensei, was that it? I give you my thanks.</p><br/><p>And when I was thanking him, he announced that lessons were over. Ahh\u2026 I don\u2019t want it to. If possible, I wouldn\u2019t want to return back to the dormitory because of all the noise. But the only place apart from this classroom that I know of in the academy was only the dormitory. Having no choice, I followed everyone back to the dormitory.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 Night.</p><br/><p>The faeries were making a racket again. Thinking that a wide space would be better than this narrow room, I took hold of a lantern and walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>Rustle.</p><br/><p>The faeries buzzed around me, laughing \u201d What now, what now? \u201c. In the end, I reached the lobby and squatted down by the sofa. It was so noisy that I was about to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026so noisy, freaking noisy! Shut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>I shot up and shouted at them, unable to stand it anymore. And yet, the faeries all just continued to laugh at me. I can\u2019t\u2026 I really can\u2019t anymore.</p><br/><p>And as I was about to squat down again..</p><br/><p>\u201d Are you okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>Despite always having troubles listening to what people are saying due to all the racket from the faeries, I somehow can hear that clearly. Shocked, I turned towards the direction of the voice and saw a boy standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300a\u300b\u201d [TN: Hikari, Light]</p><br/><p>He said something and a beautiful ball of light appeared and lighted up the boy as well as the surroundings. As I stared shocked at him, he started making his way over.</p><br/><p>The faeries then started talking again.</p><br/><p>(( Hey, let\u2019s prank him! We haven\u2019t done it in a long time! ))</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t come any nearer! I wanted to warn the boy but the fear made me unable to make a sound. He was the boy from the afternoon incident. Such a beautiful face. And he seemed to be telling me that it was okay. There was no way it was going to be okay. And when my eyes met his, he smiled at me. Was he worried about me\u2026.?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s dangerous! Was what I wanted to tell him but for some reason, my voice was not coming out. Looking at that shiny silver hair that sparkles like an angel, my voice just wouldn\u2019t come out. What should I do?</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026.that boy, that boy was going to bump into the faeries! Listening to the chatter from the faeries who seem to be having fun, I felt irritated. Why can\u2019t I even do (say) such a simple thing!</p><br/><p>Be careful!</p><br/><p>By reflex, I closed my eyes, fearing the impact.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026!! \u201d</p><br/><p>He let out a tiny gasp before backtracking. It cannot be\u2026 Was he able to see them!? But he is a human! Then, at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh! \u201d</p><br/><p>He then covered both ears with his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..No, no way\u2026!</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t believe this! And it seem like the faeries were having the same thoughts as I had as they were in an uproar.</p><br/><p>(( Oi, this human seems to be able to see us? ))</p><br/><p>(( Don\u2019t talk crap. There\u2019s no way he can! ))</p><br/><p>(( That\u2019s right, but he did take a step back, didn\u2019t he? ))</p><br/><p>(( I-It\u2019s your imagination, there is no way a mere human can see us faeries\u2026 ))</p><br/><p>\u201d I can. \u201d</p><br/><p>He cut off the old-sounding voice. I began to suspect my hearing. This was not a dream\u2026right? And with his response, the faeries went into an uproar again.</p><br/><p>The boy then stopped smiling and looked straight at the grandfather fairy whom sentence had just been cut by him. \u2026\u2026He really can see them.</p><br/><p>\u201d You are troubling her, would you mind shutting up? \u201d</p><br/><p>I was stunned at what he said. I was touched that he said that for my sake. But even so, he was being ridiculed by the faeries. They mocked him as the grandfather fairy spoke.</p><br/><p>(( To think a low powered mere human dares to command us. ))</p><br/><p>Yes, it was no use. Even I, an elf, a race that have mana higher than humans, couldn\u2019t get them to listen. But you had my thanks for trying to help.</p><br/><p>But then, the boy started grinning.</p><br/><p>\u201d In short, you guys would abide me if my mana is higher? \u201d</p><br/><p>What was he talking about\u2026\u2026\u2026..?? Sorry to say but the mana felt from him was a lot lesser than mine. With that amount, what can he do?</p><br/><p>(( Huh? Is your brain melting, human? As if anyone of us would lose to a human. To compete with us\u2026\u2026\u2026!!?? ))</p><br/><p>The grandfather fairy\u2019s voice faded out in the middle of his sentence. And it was not just him, I was shocked too.</p><br/><p>What\u2026.is this power?</p><br/><p>Really\u2026.was he even a human\u2026.?</p><br/><p>As he had said, the power he let out was way higher that all of the faeries combined. Due to the huge pressure, the faeries were unable to make a sound. I too, was unable to move.</p><br/><p>But I was not afraid. It was a preposterous amount of power. Really really huge. But to me, it felt like I was being wrapped in a warm sunny light. Tat tat tat tat. The boy started moving towards the grandfather fairy.</p><br/><p>\u201d Would you abide? \u201d</p><br/><p>(( WAH!! ))</p><br/><p>But that smiling face was scary. Maybe it was because he looked like an exceedingly beautiful angel. The faeries started trembling, fearing him. I wonder why I don\u2019t feel afraid at all.</p><br/><p>\u201d I-I abide! Please\u2026..forgive us for all the impolite things we had done! \u201d</p><br/><p>I was surprised by how the grandfather fairy was desperately shouting for his life. It was really true that they will abide anyone with a high power. I looked with interest at the boy who smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201d Is that so. That\u2019s great. Would you mind leaving this place then? \u201d</p><br/><p>He had a bad mouth despite of his angelic face. But his gentle manner does match his face. Just like an angel. Even though I had never seen one before.</p><br/><p>I wonder why my heart beats so fast whenever I look at him. Hahh\u2026 The boy let out a sigh and the power disappeared instantly. He then started walking toward me. A cuter and younger boy than me\u2026 Why does my heart beat so fast?</p><br/><p>It was\u2026beating. It was\u2026tightening\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201d Sorry. \u201d</p><br/><p>I jumped a bit at his apology. Why was my heart beating even at his apology?!</p><br/><p>\u201d I did not mean to scare you, are you okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, he crouched down besides the squatting me. Wah-! Don\u2019t do that! I can\u2019t look at his eyes.</p><br/><p>Beating. Tightening.</p><br/><p>I heard about this from my mother. That this was love. Uwah\u2026.love\u2026dove\u2026glove\u2026Nyaaaaaaaaa!</p><br/><p>[TN: In original Japanese: \u3001\u3001. Koi, koi, koi. Love, carp, Intention / purpose. What\u2019s that nya-ing at the end for though?]</p><br/><p>What should I do? What should I do? M-m-m-my ears were definitely red\u2026 Embarrassed, I looked away and then I remembered. That boy, what did he say? \u2026\u2026\u2026scared me?</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026It\u2019s not that. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was not scared\u2026. Or rather, I came to like you very much.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm\u2026.? \u201d</p><br/><p>H-how embarrassing\u2026.But I had to tell him because I was really glad! From tomorrow onward, I can finally live peacefully!</p><br/><p>\u201d I am not scared\u2026.Erm\u2026.Thank you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Our eyes met. What beautiful eye color he has. But really, this was too embarrassing so I turned my eyes away again. And then, he stood up. Panicking, I called out.</p><br/><p>Eh\u2026..what should I say? I wanted to call out to him but I hadn\u2019t even thought about the subject\u30fc! With my mind in a frenzy, a question popped out.</p><br/><p>\u201d Who are you? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Most likely an angel though. The Angel, with a troubled expression on, tilted his head and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019m Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>So..so cute! That was foul play.</p><br/><p>\u201d The-then, who are you? \u201d</p><br/><p>I was asked back. Fine then, I shall copy your answer.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am Selphys. \u201d</p><br/><p>Father, Mother, I think I am going to be fine from now on. I can live quietly from now\u2026ah..eh?

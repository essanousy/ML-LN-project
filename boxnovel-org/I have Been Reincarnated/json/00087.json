Or rather, me.</p><br/><p>When the pig was knocked out by my killing intent, the attack started. Those guys, just because they were wearing armors, came at me full of confidence. But due to the weight of said armors, their movements were slow and without making use of its defense capability, they were all put to sleep by me.</p><br/><p>Ah, how weak. Even if I was not a magician, you guys would still be beaten to the ground, you know?</p><br/><p>Though I was using strengthening magic. Let\u2019s keep it a secret that I did think of not casting it. Carelessness is the biggest enemy one would ever have. A vase might just fall from the sky if you were not careful. But still, how weak. Too weak. Yes, my body was strengthened but they were weak to the extent that I think I could defeat them without even using magic. They were so weak that it being a trap was not possible.</p><br/><p>I was using my enhanced hearing to check their heartbeat and breathing so I knew they were all knocked out. I don\u2019t think anyone could fake their heartbeat. Well, they could use magic to fool me but if that did happen\u2026.. checkmate.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think that will happen though. I cannot see any reason for them to go that far. If they possessed that high of an ability, it would be faster, and much more fun to simply come at me from the start, head on.</p><br/><p>Which means.</p><br/><p>Occam razor. These guys were illegal slave merchants and their rogues. That would make the most sense. Yep. I wasted a lot of my time on them.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Sigh\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>A deep sigh escaped from my lips. During this entire time, Matilda-san must be preparing for the \u2018auction\u2019. Let\u2019s clean this up quickly.</p><br/><p>But this was kind of embarrassing. To think I was thinking seriously and even nodding to myself\u2026 how very embarrassing. Oh well, it\u2019s no use thinking further.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Let\u2019s not bother about the small details- \u201d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s stop.</p><br/><p>A young girl along in the jail cell spouting some old gag will not look good to anyone. Hm? It\u2019s too late? And that it\u2019s not a young \u2018girl\u2019?</p><br/><p>Mm. It must be my imagination that I heard something just now. Yep, my imagination. I will make it so.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. I am a man who does not bother about these petty things, full stop. \u2018For goodness sake, just get this [shadow] business over and done with so I can stop this cross-dressing!\u2019 was not what I was thinking! \u2026..Ah, no, no.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s stop. My shoulders slumped in dejection.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Yep, let\u2019s get it over with. \u201d</p><br/><p>Anyway, it\u2019s total annihilation time.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Even today, in the barracks, it\u2019s noisy. In exchanged for staying quiet on the streets all evening, the soldiers squeezed into the barracks were going as loud as they could.</p><br/><p>Flowason was not a big town. The soldiers here were almost all in-charge of the checkpoint. They do patrol the town but as night approaches, they don\u2019t do it as much, nor as detailed \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 Those who go out in the night are responsible for their own action.</p><br/><p>It was common sense in Hattuo. Without streetlights, it would not be as bright as the daytime. Hattuo, Hadazerl, and even Dyuvu, a mercantile nation, were as so. The only place which had street lights was Elzmu.</p><br/><p>Which means, it is indoor once the night comes. The only open stores were high class restaurants or bars. They were the kind of places where Nobles, that had bodyguards, or people who could protect themselves went to.</p><br/><p>No one came out much at night. No one would leave. That\u2019s why once it\u2019s night time, the soldiers\u2019 job ended. And when these rogue-like soldiers gathered, of course it would be noisy.</p><br/><p>And in that chaos, someone came running through the pack.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ex..excuse me!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Within the barrack, a slender man stood panting. A beastman stood behind him. His guard? And another white-haired man then joined them. At the 3 who disturbed them, the soldiers glared at them. Who was this man who could afford to hire a guard, that beastman, and why was he here? It went without saying but jealousy was mixed into the glares as well.</p><br/><p>Die, ikemen!</p><br/><p>Was what the alcohol-fueled eyes seemed to say. But the slender man desperately continued on, seemingly unobvious to the glares or just don\u2019t care about it. No, in this case, he seemed just too desperate.</p><br/><p>\u201d My daughter! Willia was kidnapped!! \u201d</p><br/><p>A rustle went through the soldiers and within the noise, 1 soldier stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201d What?! Willia-chan is? This is serious, we have to go now!! \u201d</p><br/><p>It was the soldier that they met at the checkpoint. The rest of the soldiers were startled at him, whose behavior was so different from how he used to be. And the soldier himself had a frantic face on, like he would start running anytime.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2019s wrong with you, Ivan? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Oi oi, why are you serious all of a sudden? \u201d</p><br/><p>Word after word of teasing were thrown at him, but he ignored them as he prepared to leave. He put on his uniform in a hurry, and hung his sword by his waist. Everyone else was dumbfounded at how fast his movements were. At them, Ivan roared angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oi, what are you blokes waiting for?! We have to rescue Willia right now! \u201d</p><br/><p>And to the him.</p><br/><p>\u201d Forget it, it\u2019s useless. \u201d</p><br/><p>Someone said, interrupting him. A man then walked out from the back, a shady smile playing on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201d But why, captain?! \u201d</p><br/><p>The man whom Ivan called Captain looked surprised at Ivan\u2019s panic before shifting his gaze to the slender man.</p><br/><p>\u201d This is not an office for lost kids, Mr.Father. Firstly, why do you know your child was kidnapped and not lost? \u201d</p><br/><p>The Captain hid his despising expression as he looked at the slender man.</p><br/><p>\u201d I left her in the Inn for a while and when I came back, she was gone! It must be the inn\u2019s master who scoffed at my guard! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Scoffed? That beastman? It\u2019s her inn so of course she can look down on it. Beastman is a thing that you can\u2019t trust. Without proof, I won\u2019t move my soldiers just to look for a lost kid. In the first place, it is your responsibility for looking away from your daughter, isn\u2019t it? \u201d</p><br/><p>What unreasonable argument. Discrimination against beastmen was common but why would he use it here? [TN: I assume he meant Willia was not one] Ivan thought to himself.</p><br/><p>The slender man, Ivan remembered that he called himself Jill Stuart, looked down, vexed. That\u2019s right. Ivan just couldn\u2019t accept his captain\u2019s argument. Staring at his captain, he raised his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201d The hell! Just 1 kid?! Willia-chan is not just a \u2018kid\u2019! She is an angel that came down to earth! The treasure of all Humans! Won\u2019t move your soldiers?! In that case, I quit! I\u2019ll help her of my own record! \u201d</p><br/><p>Ivan\u2019s threatening attitude shocked his captain and before he could say anything, Ivan ran off.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oi, Ivan!? \u201d</p><br/><p>To the far away Ivan, the captain\u2019s roar was fruitless. His hand, which was stretched out, swipe at the air. It was when he slowly lowered his outstretched hand as he had a self-mocking smile on his face. The one waiting for him was not his soldiers who laughed at Ivan along with him but instead, hell.</p><br/><p>The slender man grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201d I see. To think it would be the top of Hattuo\u2019s Military, Former General Fet Ale Grousil, who did the kidnapping. \u201d</p><br/><p>It was then the Captain finally noticed. All the soldiers there were already on the floor. There were some who moaned, some who shook and even some who were sleeping soundly. Everyone was best friends with the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201d No worries, I leave them all alive. I won\u2019t hurt people who know nothing. \u201d</p><br/><p>That grinning face appeared in an instant in front of the Captain.</p><br/><p>\u201d !! \u201d</p><br/><p>He backed off reflexively and the slender man laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, how much did you receive? Spit it out. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Ivan panted as he ran. Kicking the drunks aside, he dashed down the street. It had been a long time since he had given his all running.</p><br/><p>Rogues, seeing Ivan running past, were surprised as they grumbled. It was rare to see the soldiers of this town as desperate as he was. Never had soldiers in-charge of this street been threatened before. So what does this mean?</p><br/><p>Was the street under attack from demon beasts or did Elzmu come attacking? Either way, it was a serious situation. The rumors spread in an instant and the usual rowdy street that was lined with pubs and the back alley went dead. Everyone were shutting themselves in their house to not be involved with whatever was coming.</p><br/><p>But Ivan, who was desperately running, ignored the eerie silence as he ran, with full speed, passed the main street and into the back alley. If it was kidnapping, there were only a few places possible. It was most likely illegal slave trafficking. No matter, he was certain about the suspicious back alley.</p><br/><p>Right now, Ivan was regretting hard. He wanted to go faster but his body, which had been skipping training, could not seem to catch up. And right now, his body felt like it was being whipped all over.</p><br/><p>I have to rescue my Angel (Willia-chan) as soon as possible!</p><br/><p>His mission burned within him as his irritation grew. He had to be faster. Had to be quicker. As if answering himself, Ivan subconsciously gathered mana around his feet as he sped up. His calf screamed in pain because of the additional workload but Ivan pushed it to the back of his mind as he continued running. His breath was getting shorter. His heart was beating faster.</p><br/><p>\u201d Where is it?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Ivan screamed. He could imagine Willia crying in the distant. Now he felt like crying, as he got even more impatient. And when Ivan was preparing to run.</p><br/><p>\u201d Here. \u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing a calm voice behind him, Ivan jumped reflexively. Looking back, he saw a slender man, emotionless, standing there. His eyes got big.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ji, Jill Stuart-san? Why are you here\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d No time to explain. Follow me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Jill Stuart then ran at a speed, without even panting, where Ivan had to use all he had just to even follow.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wa, wait!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Ivan, who was desperately trying to follow.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015After that, rumors about a soldier desperately chasing down a criminal spread and the soldiers were being looked upon in a new light.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: Ivan\u2019s hair color\u2019s green. And he had a croc-like face. A typical mean face. And weak. You would think he was a villager A but surprise, he had quite a big role.</p><br/><p>TN: Guys. Guys. Guys!!</p><br/><p>Just wanna say my thanks again.</p><br/><p>For reading this. For liking this.</p><br/><p>Despite the slow updates. Despite the grammar mistakes. (Yes, like the car beastman. It\u2019s just transformers, guys.) Despite the slow pace. Despite the lack of action. Despite the inner monologue comedy. (Which I loved. I chuckle a lot when it happened.)</p><br/><p>Thanks a lot for supporting this site and my translation and love to all my editors as well. I can be a troll so thanks for your patience as well.</p><br/><p>Thank you!!</p><br/><p>And so, pumpkin pies for all of you at the back!!</p><br/><p>Ah, do be slightly careful of the carnivorous pumpkins I am growing. But I had always said, those you eat, deserves to eat you right back.</p><br/><p>Enjoy~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When we are captured by him, the rest of the boarding students already go in. Even though we come first, our time get wasted. What a troublesome thing.</p><br/><p>This is my lesson to him. Status is nothing and it would be good for him to learn that. But he seems like a guy who is going to repeat his mistakes. Looking at him, I direct a cold look as though asking if he is that stupid or not.</p><br/><p>With that over, Zen and we step into our dorm.</p><br/><p>\u201d Welcome, to the White Wind Dorm! \u201d</p><br/><p>We are welcomed with enthusiasm. Looking closely, many seniors are gathered at the entry hall of the spacious dorm.</p><br/><p>\u201d Thank you very much! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d T, t, t, thank you very much! \u201d</p><br/><p>We give our thanks at the same time and do a quick bow. By the way, Zen is the latter. I am not nervous at all.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026I am 25 years old after all.</p><br/><p>Then, from the crowd, a sharp-eyed Onii-chan steps out. Oh, he is the one who brings all of us to our class\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d I see, you are the \u2018Door Duty Officer\u2019 this time round! \u201d</p><br/><p>He speaks when I am stuck reminiscing about the time I first meet him. Still as forcefully and energetically as ever. This school sure has a lot of hot-blooded types\u2026 It seems he is talking to me instead of Zen.</p><br/><p>\u201d Door Duty officer\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Hm? Eh? You didn\u2019t know? \u201d</p><br/><p>When I return with a question, I am approached at a great speed that I instinctively take a step back. People are laughing, saying something like \u201d Don\u2019t go scaring small kids like that, Kiro. \u201c. I see, this hot-blooded young man is called Kiro. Rather than that, I think I hear something rude being said about me being small. I want to think it\u2019s my imagination. Let\u2019s do that.</p><br/><p>Pulling myself out of the depressing thoughts, Kiro nods at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Eh? Is that so? Then why did you opened the door? \u201d</p><br/><p>At first he is observing but his curiosity gradually wins and he asks happily.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will skipped grades! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen, standing beside me, still very nervous, answers even he does not need to. Instantly, all eyes are on me.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026..</p><br/><p>I let out a sigh internally and speak up.</p><br/><p>\u201d I had a little practice in magic circles. \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, everyone comes to an understanding. Kiro then shouts \u201d Is everyone present? \u201d and the dorm\u2019s welcome party starts.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Eh? Where is Mi Sociunnov?</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Right when you step into the dormitory, it looks just like a hotel lobby. The room of the Dormitory manager is facing the entrance as well. The dining hall seems to be right inside. Sofa, chairs, tables are placed in there for everyone to enjoy a light meal.</p><br/><p>Today, it will be where everyone staying in the dorm are gathering. Contrary to expectation, the dormitory is not separated into males and females. The top floor belongs to the girls while the lower floor is where guys stay.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then, let me start by introducing myself! \u201d</p><br/><p>By Kiro\u2019s words, everyone cheers.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am Kiro, obviously a 3rd year! The leader of the white team as well as the dormitory leader. Come find me if you have any trouble. Attribute\u2019s earth. Ah, by the way, I am still single. That\u2019s all! \u201d</p><br/><p>With all different kinds of meaning he is rather amazing, this guy. White Team Leader\u2026 Does this Academy have some sort of Teams events going on?</p><br/><p>Kiro is blond and blue-eyed but is also blessed with light brown skin color and coupled with the way he speaks, he simply exudes a wild-ish feel. His hair, different from Sociunnov, is short, might add on to the feeling as well.</p><br/><p>[TN: I am currently suppressing my urge to simply call him Mr Miso. I\u2019ll have you know I am really trying hard.]</p><br/><p>Kiro then hits the back of the boy next to him, as if asking him to introduce himself next. That hit looks painful though.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am Calius. 3rd year\u2026the vice-dorm leader tentatively. Attribute\u2019s wind. Interest is observing. \u201d</p><br/><p>His name sounds like calcium\u2026 let\u2019s put that impression aside. As compared to Kiro, he does not speak all that much. Most likely in his future, he will be called a \u2018cool beauty\u2019 by others. Blue-eyed with long white hair that has a bluish tint tied it up in a low ponytail. Another ikemen.</p><br/><p>Ah, instead of that, his interest is observing\u2026. how scary. Please do not say that without any expression on!</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019m Freya. As you can see, I am a lively and energetic girl. I am also currently the vice-team leader. My attribute is fire, please take care of me. \u201d</p><br/><p>To the left of Calius stands a girl. And she has just introduced herself in an earnest tone despite what she says. Lively and energetic girl\u2026.. Ah no, I would like to believe in that.</p><br/><p>Freya is actually a beauty. Deep blue hair with grey eyes. Depending on the angle, her eyes would sometimes look like some gold is mixed in as well. What a wondrous beauty she has.</p><br/><p>Oh well, I am not a lolicon so I am not that infatuated with her. [TN: Japanese, Or moe about her.]</p><br/><p>And now, I am extremely troubled.</p><br/><p>Why? Because that Freya is sitting right next to me, to my right.</p><br/><p>\u201d Next is this year\u2019s door duty officer! \u201d</p><br/><p>I am urged on by Kiro when I am feeling flustered. In the first place, I am pulled by Kiro to sit over here. I wonder what I need to say\u2026. Let\u2019s just give a simple self-introduction.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am Will, 1st year, and I kinda opened the door\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Why are you questioning us back? You definitely open the door. \u201d</p><br/><p>I am completely retorted back. Saying that, I have no idea what \u2018Door Duty\u2019 is, which is why I want to ask\u2026</p><br/><p>But as I think, in this world, the vague expressions Japanese love to use do not work here. But being a former Japanese, it still comes as a shock to me. Then, the girl sitting next to me slowly raises her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201d Leader Kiro, maybe Will does not know what \u2018Door Duty\u2019 is and is currently troubled at how to answer. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, my meaning gets through. And when I am thinking that Freya is smart and thoughtful, I see everyone around me nodding. It seems like it is only Kiro who does not get it.</p><br/><p>Regardless it is being Noble\u2019s culture or Japanese\u2019s culture, things are usually not said straight out, which is why learning how to read the meaning behind is an important skill to know.</p><br/><p>Having bathed in both culture for 25 years, I have already gotten used to it. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s great that the meaning gets through. Relieved, I smile as Kiro, seemingly embarrassed, starts explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah sorry. Door Duty Officer is what we call someone who is in charge of the door. In this dormitory, we have a welcome event where \u2018Door won\u2019t open, everyone troubled and flustered, let\u2019s help each other out and open the door!\u2019 kind of thing. But as recently there is situation where no one could open the door which is why someone who heard about it from a friend will act as the HERO (Door Duty Officer). Ah\u2026it can also be said to be a prearranged performance. \u201d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>I think Mi Sociunnov is shouting about something like that just now. Looking forward to being a Hero, he must have been very angry to find out that the title has been robbed from him.</p><br/><p>\u201d So that\u2019s why, since you are the one who opened the door, you are called the \u2018Door Duty Officer\u2019. Hahaha! \u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing unlike a 12 year old, Kiro uses his eyes to urge me to proceed with my self-introduction.</p><br/><p>\u201d I see\u2026. It is great that I did not made any trouble for opening the door. \u201d</p><br/><p>I smile, relieved, but somehow, someone besides me lets out a snort.</p><br/><p>D\u2026Don\u2019t laugh! I am only a 1st year so it is fine for me to know these, isn\u2019t it?! \u2026..Don\u2019t tell me it is common sense? A sense of shame started spreading within me so I hurriedly continue.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am Will. As to why I open the door is as I said just now, I have a bit of practice with magic circles, the reason is I want to skip grades. Ah, I am 8 years old. \u201d</p><br/><p>I wonder if I manage to convey my feelings across. I have a feeling that Calius, who says his hobby is observing, has turned his gaze towards me with a smile. I would really like to think I misread that. Even though I just say I am not flustered because I am 25 inside, please ignore that\u2026.. after all I am still a child.</p><br/><p>I will try not to get pulled by my body\u2019s age! That\u2019s right! I am going to train everyday! My to-do list increases yet again.</p><br/><p>But, there is no need to feel down. It is my turn now! I grin and turn to my left.</p><br/><p>Hehehe\u2026. Definitely flustered. Very flustered.</p><br/><p>Ah, I am not laughing in other\u2019s misfortune. Definitely not. I would not do something so un-adult-like, even though I just refute myself just now\u2026</p><br/><p>This is\u2026I mean, \u2018that\u2019.</p><br/><p>Like a father watching his kid in class for observation day\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2026I..I..I..I am Z..z..z..zen!! 1st year!! \u201d</p><br/><p>My anticipation\u2026no, as I expected, he stuttered perfectly. That guy, Zen, he might be the nervous kind.</p><br/><p>\u2026.It is amusing so it\u2019s fine. I burst out in laughter and even if I am being glared at by Zen, I paid no notice to it.</p><br/><p>And after that, the welcome party and self-introductions truly start.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: Because I wanted Will to give a proper self-introduction instead of the one in the classroom, I had him do it here.</p><br/><p>TN: You don\u2019t say.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

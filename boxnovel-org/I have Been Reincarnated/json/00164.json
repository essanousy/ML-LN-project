It was not that I was really looking for an answer but the answer given to me made it worst.</p><br/><p>This was not the answer I was looking for!</p><br/><p>Why was I seeing old men kneeling in front of me\u2026 old men.. old men\u2026 A scene of a Lieutenant General, with his posed look, as the BGM of jang jang jang ja ja ja jang jang and kan kan ka ka ka kan kan kan\u2026 Eh? You had no idea what I was talking about?</p><br/><p>\u2026.Anyway, as long as you understand the feeling I felt as I looked upon the rows of old men prostrating themselves in front of me. The scene was something easily understandable when you laid your eyes on it! But it was also a scene incomprehensible! I mean, this happened the moment I entered the room, you know!?</p><br/><p>The point was, I had no idea what caused this to happened. With my head in a mess, I looked at Guta-san, who then gave me a big nod. No! Not what I was looking for!! All I wanted was an explanation! As I tried to conveyed my thoughts through my eyes desperately, the only response he gave back was \u201d As I thought. \u201c.</p><br/><p>As you thought what?!?!</p><br/><p>\u201d Raise your head for a second please! \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, almost crying out. As I was already half-crying, it might not be \u2018almost\u2019. Could this be part of their conspiracy? They might be looking for chance to ran as I was overwhelmed by it all.</p><br/><p>Finally getting it I glared at them as I started searching around for any suspicious behavior but there was none. This made me even more confused. And as I was doing all that, the old men from the first row lifted their heads up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Please forgive us! O\u2019 messenger-Sama from the heavens! We are idiots!! \u201d</p><br/><p>They stared at my face for a bit before howling, and once again lowered their heads to the floor. Enough!!!! I had enough!!! Can anyone please just explained to me what all of this was about?!?!?!</p><br/><p>As I hugged my head, I began to recalled all that had happened a while back.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>As Guta-san and I was on our way to the innermost room, members of the Black Knights Intelligence Corps that were with me, came down from the ceiling and stood behind us as we made out way over. And finally, we reached the innermost room.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s here? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Un. \u201d</p><br/><p>I confirmed with Guta-san and he nodded sternly. We had walked through the chapel, to the left side of the stage, and through the control room before standing in front of a door.</p><br/><p>It was made out of wood, and looked thick and old. The handle was made out of gold and looked pretty heavy. Interestingly, the handle was placed at a higher height. As I reached out for the handle, I froze.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t reached it.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Definitely not that I was a chibi, but that the handle was placed way higher.</p><br/><p>I could reached it if I jumped but that just looked too uncool. Thus, I looked up at Guta-san. Our eyes met. His eyes were questioning why I was not going in first but after reading my strong gaze, he had a realization as he stepped out in front of me.</p><br/><p>Yes, please don\u2019t say anything. It hurt.</p><br/><p>As so to hide my embarrassment, I walked a lot more flamboyantly behind him, like I allowed Guta-san to opened the door. I was not running from this. This was simply a way of protecting my heart.</p><br/><p>\u2026.But weren\u2019t they careless in not locking the door? Weren\u2019t these guys hated by the town? Did they not even considered that people would try to assassinate them?</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.There\u2019s no one here, huh. \u201d</p><br/><p>Looking into the room, it was empty. Although I knew that when I didn\u2019t felt any presence coming from the room. Plus, they really did not even had any guards around. How unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201d They might be in the inner room, the game room. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Game room\u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>What was with this playful-sounding name? Was it really okay to had such a room in a church?</p><br/><p>\u201d You might not think that there would be a room for games in a church but there really is one. It was often being spoken about by them. \u201d</p><br/><p>My thoughts appeared on my face again. Without stopping, Guta opened the door wide. Game, huh? I wondered what they do in there. I do had a bad feeling though. I could felt a lot more presence in that room than the estimated number.</p><br/><p>\u201d Somehow, I can feel a lot of presence gathering around a table. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Most likely they are gambling. \u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like sighing. To think they were even priests. So they left their work in the afternoon and gambled the money their took from the citizens instead. But of course, there wasn\u2019t anyone here anyway.</p><br/><p>I felt my blood vessel pounding.</p><br/><p>\u201d Guta-san. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I can destroy them right? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Please. \u201d</p><br/><p>Guta-san returned a smile to me when I asked him with a face full of smiles. That face of his was really\u2026. a very villainous one. Ah\u2026 but I think my face was not one of any difference at the moment though.</p><br/><p>As that thought went through my head, I strengthen myself with magic, before kicking the door flying. In a word, I was pissed off.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hahh! \u201d</p><br/><p>Forgetting the noble-like airs I put on in front of Guta-san, I kicked the door. A fabulous loud bang sounded as the door broke apart. The door was not in pieces, it was in crumbs. In the moment, I stomped into the room as I released my mana.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2026\u2026.?! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d The door was\u2026?!! \u201d</p><br/><p>As the people inside took in the broken door, it was chaos. But the moment I released my mana, everyone froze. They did not even made a sound. Ah, not good. I might had released a tad too much. I can\u2019t have them fainting away, all I wanted was them to give themselves up without resisting.</p><br/><p>Panicking, I lessen the amount of mana I was releasing. And finally, the people started moving as they panicked. Spotting people who were trying to escape, I chanted coldly in my heart.</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b</p><br/><p>\u300a\u308c\u300b</p><br/><p>[TN: Kousoku, Bind &amp; Damare, silent]</p><br/><p>The usual combo. As my mana was floating throughout the room, binding them was a piece of cake. Although I wouldn\u2019t had any trouble otherwise. Because, I had an awesome body at the moment. With this strengthen body of mine, I believed I wouldn\u2019t had any trouble chasing down those who ran.</p><br/><p>Anyway, I was currently very pissed off at them so I wanted them to shut up. In the room that went back to being silent, the only sound that was heard was the clickety-clack of my footsteps. I could felt Guta-san smiling wryly behind me.</p><br/><p>The dust from the crumbling door had formed something of a smokescreen that hid my figure. My ears caught onto the fast heartbeats of the people inside the room. I was thinking that if I were to show myself, I would most like be looked down upon on\u2026. but it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve long given up. After all, I was good in making people fear the me that I was, right?</p><br/><p>\u201d I am here to judge. \u201d</p><br/><p>It was too bad that I can\u2019t threatened them with a deep gravelly voice. I grinned, standing in the foggy room.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026It\u2019s time for them to learned the fear of that was me.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>And that was how the plot was supposed to go!!!!</p><br/><p>Why did the old men prostrated themselves the moment they saw my face? What? Do I looked fierce?! Why now\u2026. Argh, I want to hit someone.</p><br/><p>\u201d O\u2019 messenger-Sama? \u201d</p><br/><p>A careful voice sounded out from one of the old men when they saw I was staying silent. Bending down, I hid my unrest face from being seen.</p><br/><p>Guta,san, HELP!!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Will\u2026. is still Will. Don\u2019t worry, you would get there someday.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

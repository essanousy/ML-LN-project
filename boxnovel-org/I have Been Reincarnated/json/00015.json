Welcome. Thank you.</p><br/><p>I am panicking because I really have to start thinking about world building.</p><br/><p>\u2026Oi, have you not even thought about it yet?!</p><br/><p>Please ignore this issue and leave it aside. I\u2019m sorry. But I would like this world to be simple and easy to understand.</p><br/><p>And so (\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40)</p><br/><p>The boring days were over.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! I could finally lift my head!!</p><br/><p>And then, I learned how to crawl immediately due to the result of me doing muscle training frantically every day. Now, I could even do \u2018bye bye\u2019 movements.</p><br/><p>Yep, I was so moved when I could first turn myself. It was my most emotional moment since my reincarnation that I could just cry\u2026</p><br/><p>But, from here on now it would be difficult. Why? Because I was under 24 hours surveillance. By Mother. By Mary San. By all the other maids.</p><br/><p>Talking about them, they loved to make silly faces as they looked at me while going \u201d So cute! So cute that I can just eat him! \u201d and pinched my cheeks. To tell the truth, they were really scary. Mah, to the plain looking me, this might just be the only time I was going to get this treatment.</p><br/><p>And so I would slip under their surveillance and escape from the room\u2026.which had to happen after I could break out from my crib.</p><br/><p>This. Annoying. Fence!</p><br/><p>I wanted to climb over it but as the strength in my legs was lacking, I sadly gave up. This would be impossible till I had the strength to stand. And so, in my disappointment, I moped around.</p><br/><p>While glaring at the fence.</p><br/><p>And then, I realized something.</p><br/><p>There was a door on the fence! The lock was fashioned like some wooden puzzle ring to prevent babies from opening it. However! I had this (brain)!</p><br/><p>I pointed to the sky, setting it as my victory pose and grinned.</p><br/><p>The result.</p><br/><p>So easy.</p><br/><p>It was a little scary going down but relying on the special strength of a baby\u2019s grip, I somehow managed to reach the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hmpt. \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the crib and waved bye-bye while laughing.</p><br/><p>Yep, what a sense of achievement.</p><br/><p>But I could not afford to stand here carelessly anymore. Because I made use of the time where everyone was busy doing their chores to slip out.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>And so, after many cycles of infiltration, after so much sweat and tears, I finally conquered this huge house! What great job I did since I was not once found by anyone. Please praise me. Could it be that I actually had the talent to become a spy?</p><br/><p>And I made a big discovery.</p><br/><p>We had a room that was filled with so many books that it could be called a mini library! This discovery to me, who\u007fwanted knowledge, made me so excited!</p><br/><p>But!</p><br/><p>I hit a huge roadblock.</p><br/><p>I\u2026could not read the words of this world!!</p><br/><p>And so, I was planning to use \u2018that\u2019.</p><br/><p>I grabbed the thing that was placed at the entrance of the library with my mouth. Yes, I looked like a dog but there was no choice, this was the most efficient\u2026. To the crawling me.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh my, are you awake, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>Today, my gorgeous Mother, as always, came in from the room next door at the perfect timing. Whew\u2026.That was dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201d Uh. \u201d</p><br/><p>And then, I took out the thing I got hold of. Yes, I was going to use \u2018that\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201d A picture book? Why is it here? I wonder if Mary brought it to you\u2026 Would you like to read it, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>To Mother who made up a random reason on her own, I did a victory pose mentally. With a \u2018 Yes! I was waiting for this! \u2018 meaning behind, I replied happily.</p><br/><p>\u201d Uh\u266a \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d And happily ever after. \u201d</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, the story was awful. It started with \u2018Once upon a time\u2019, a Grandpa and Grandma who wanted to leave their life of poverty behind, found an abandoned child, picked him up and raised him and suddenly their magic talent went through the roof and they became rich and saved the world, kind of story.</p><br/><p>What the heck was that. Somewhere in the middle suddenly magic entered the story. As soon as I thought this story was going to be like Japanese folk tales with some kind of morals to be learnt and suddenly things just took a turn towards fantasy!</p><br/><p>Such unexpected development just made me want to tsukkomi. [TN: Retort]</p><br/><p>Ah, but thanks to that I memorized the alphabets. [TN: Genius, Will\u2019s a genius.] But man, a baby\u2019s brain was awesome. [TN: Oh.] I thought I would have trouble memorizing if it was symbols like Hiragana [TN:Japanese alphabets] but it turned out to be stuff like (english) alphabets so it was easy.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ta..Ooo. \u201d</p><br/><p>I thought I would at least say thank you to Mother.</p><br/><p>\u201d You are the most welcome. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mother smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2026It got through\u2026!</p><br/><p>This is the rumored bond between a mother and child?</p><br/><p>And so, from now on, my daily activities consisted of muscle training, pronunciation training, infiltration investigations and book reading over and over. [TN: Please sleep, Will, stop torturing your little wittle baby body.]</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: Will thought it was the brain of a baby but in reality, it was a [Cheat] ability given by god. [TN: KNEW IT.]</p><br/><p>Thanks for all your likes! I am tearing up. Sob..sob.</p><br/><p>I will try even harder from now on!</p><br/><p>And please, yoroshiku onegaishimasu!</p><br/><p>My writing is lousy so\u2026I am trying my best. Advice or impressions about this novel given would make me very happy!!</p><br/><p>TN: Enjoy~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

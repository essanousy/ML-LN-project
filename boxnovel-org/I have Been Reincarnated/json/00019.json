But\u2026</p><br/><p>A few days ago, the heir, Williams Sama, was born.</p><br/><p>Williams-Beryl Sama.</p><br/><p>He inherited the silky and soft silver hair from Master and the green eyes from Madam. His eyes shone brightly like the gemstone of the sun, Peridot.</p><br/><p>His long and thin eyes, strong nose and small cute lips. [TN: As for his eyes, remember that they are closed.] All perfectly balanced and arranged on his face. There was no doubt\u2026his beauty would exceed Master\u2019s\u2026.cough.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, his first birthday came and he welcomed it in the cutest way possible.</p><br/><p>The other day, he was surrounded by the other maids, who kept saying how cute he was and even pinched his cheeks. How unbelievable, I wanted to do it to-\u2026. cough.</p><br/><p>And that Young Master Will was no other but a genius! Beautiful and clever, and since he was the son of the now-defeated Master Gion, his athlete abilities must be good! Why was he such a genius?</p><br/><p>To be specific; firstly was his language ability.</p><br/><p>Before he could even support his head, he seemed to be able to understand our words. I had a feeling he could understand and even answered me whenever I spoke to him.</p><br/><p>And in these few days, he could already carry a normal conversation.</p><br/><p>However, Young Master \u2026</p><br/><p>Time to time would sing some strange songs.</p><br/><p>\u201d A, E, I, O, U \u201d [Japanese Ah,Ii, Uu, Eh, Oh]</p><br/><p>He would sing with that 5 tones like there was a regularity to it\u2026.Maybe there was some meaning to it?</p><br/><p>But, this perfect Young Master, had a flaw!</p><br/><p>He loved to wander! Leaving your eyes from him even a moment, he would slip off somewhere, using those skillful baby hands of his.</p><br/><p>Good grief\u2026I wondered where he wandered off to everyday.</p><br/><p>Tomorrow, Master was expected to return from his investigations of the territory.</p><br/><p>I wondered if I needed to get up early tomorrow\u2026Well then, it was time for me to head to bed.</p><br/><p>I wondered what reaction Young Master would give tomorrow\u2026 How exciting.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Yawn.. \u201d</p><br/><p>I had a good sleep.</p><br/><p>A maid\u2019s morning started early. However, I was the head so I was not allowed to sleep in late.</p><br/><p>Which reminded me, it seemed like Young Master had not been wandering around these few days. It started after Master talked to Young Master about something.</p><br/><p>I cracked my neck and got down from the bed, putting my shoes on. Standing in front of the mirror, I tied my long hair up the way it usually was tied.</p><br/><p>\u2026Sigh, I was getting older\u2026I could see crow\u2019s feet\u2026</p><br/><p>It was inevitable since I turned 40 years old, I could only accept it.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I wanted to inform Young Master that Master was returning today but was stopped. \u2018It\u2019s a surprise!\u2019 he went, in high spirits.</p><br/><p>I ended up having some free time before I was to call on Young Master for lunch.</p><br/><p>\u201d Mary San isu busy with wirk. I am fine bi meself so it\u2019su okay to finish yuor werk fiist. \u201d</p><br/><p>Was what Young Master said, so I could only play with him after finishing all the housework.</p><br/><p>He had said it in a polite way but it seemed to have an underlying meaning to it.</p><br/><p>I needed to finish all my housework fast so I could play!</p><br/><p>I walked briskly towards the room next to Master and Madam\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u201d !!! \u201d</p><br/><p>I was able to hear Young Master\u2019s ecstatic voice from inside the room even when I was in the corridor! How rare!</p><br/><p>I wondered what he was doing! I was going to participate as well!</p><br/><p>\u2018Knock knock\u2019.</p><br/><p>I lightly knocked on the door and pushed it open\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Young Master\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>My eyes met with Young Master who was raising his fist up in a pose happily.</p><br/><p>How cute! Too cute!</p><br/><p>As I temporarily went speechless..</p><br/><p>\u201d Mary San\u2026whatsu uppu? \u201d</p><br/><p>He said as he slowly lowered his raised arm and looked up at me. Yaaa, how dangerous. I must be showing what I was thinking on my face\u2026</p><br/><p>And then Young Master tilted his head.</p><br/><p>Ah, my nose bled.</p><br/><p>Without thinking, I turned my back on him.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Cough. Young Master, your lunch is prepared in the dining room. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Okay, I am going\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Too cute. What was it with this kind of torture?!</p><br/><p>I trembled from the thought of wanting to hug him tight.</p><br/><p>Think zen thoughts\u2026zen\u2026</p><br/><p>Reaching the dining room, I opened the door.</p><br/><p>\u201d Thank chu\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master was a kind soul who never forgot to thank me, a maid. But his lisping was too cute.</p><br/><p>Our eyes met when he was being hugged by Master\u2026 Too cute!</p><br/><p>He must have been looking forward to playing with Master!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: The story of how badly Will doesn\u2019t understand himself (\uffe3\u2200\uffe3)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

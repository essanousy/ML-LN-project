Hm, I was hungry. Which meant, oh crap, I felt like crying. But I was not going to cry! A real man does not cry!</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Waah. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026. I was not crying.</p><br/><p>I was only sweating a bit through my eyes, and I was somehow still trying to bear it. And then, my limbs that I still could not fully control started to wiggle about.</p><br/><p>What soft futon. [TN: A kind of japan mattress] Ah no, it should be a bed? I was not complaining, it was just that I felt like I was laying at a higher height like a bed than a futon.</p><br/><p>Twisting my neck, which was still unable to support my head, sideways, I just barely managed to look down. As I thought, I was laying at a certain height, and it looked like the entire house was covered in basic red and brown tones. Dimly, I could make out the white walls. The ceiling was white too.</p><br/><p>Ah, I forgot to say \u2018It is a ceiling I have never seen before\u2019. All the main characters in the novels I read said that. To think I missed out on this chance to say it\u2026. How regretful.</p><br/><p>Trying to divert my attention by thinking about these things, my body started to complain about my empty stomach.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Wah. \u201d</p><br/><p>No! Please endure, me! It is embarrassing for an adult to rely on another adult!</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.ahh \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.I could not hold it in anymore!</p><br/><p>\u201d Wahhhhhhhhhhhh! \u201d</p><br/><p>What forceful cries I made. Ah, I cried. This was embarrassing. But thinking about it, I was a baby. Whatever, I gave up.</p><br/><p>Yep, knowing when to give up was important. Because from now on the rumored period of time was coming. The super embarrassing period\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d \uff05\u00a3\uff05\uff20\u309e\u25b2\u25bd\u2606\u30fc? \u201d</p><br/><p>As I thought, my Mother\u2019s voice was heard and I could dimly see her standing in front of me. She carried me up gently and while I was surprised, something was pushed into my mouth and I reflexively started sucking.</p><br/><p>Oohhh!</p><br/><p>\u2026.Aaahh, no\u2026, erm\u2026This was instinct, I had no ulterior motives, please forgive me.</p><br/><p>\u2026Man, who was I explaining to anyway. While I was thinking about all these things, my body was feeding and I became full.</p><br/><p>Haaa, I drank a lot. Eh? The word used was wrong? It could not be helped, my mind was in chaos. Because in my previous life I was avoided by the ladies so I had no immunity towards them. I..I was not making a weird face\u2026 was I?</p><br/><p>It felt good drinking milk\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Yep, giving up was important! Yep!</p><br/><p>I finished drinking, so I was all right now but I was not going to be all right if you didn\u2019t put me down now!! Trying to appeal, I looked at the dim face that I recognized and smiled.</p><br/><p>Woah.</p><br/><p>I was brought up in front of her body to lean against it. She patted my back gently. Pon Pon. Oh, Mother was trying to make me burp right?</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Burp. \u201d</p><br/><p>This was a little embarrassing. But I was trying hard not to vomit milk. Good job, me.</p><br/><p>And when I thought she was going to place me back onto the bed, she held me in her arms and started swaying.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u25bd\uff06\u309e\u2033\uff0a\uff06\uff03\uff05\u00a3\u00a2\u00a2 \u201d</p><br/><p>I had no idea what she was talking about but she said quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Ahh\u2026\u2026I was sleepy\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN : After this Will will face a huge barrier \u2013 The terror of the changing of Diapers. He will finally get enlightenment in a week will finally get used to this life.</p><br/><p>Slow tempo? That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>It will be like this from now on~</p><br/><p>Thank you for liking!</p><br/><p>TN : And the harassment of Will begins.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In addition to the difficulties of raising a child single-handedly and doing her job were proving to be more difficult than she thought caused her spirit to wear away everyday.</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s mother was beautiful.</p><br/><p>But \u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>That day, the boy\u2019s mother returned home late after her overtime.</p><br/><p>\u201d Welcome home. \u201d</p><br/><p>The boy who turned 8 honestly waited for his mother to come home every night.</p><br/><p>Just so to give his mother warm food after working hard everyday for his sake.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.. I\u2019m home. \u201d</p><br/><p>The dinner prepared by the boy was splendid. So good that he could open a restaurant. The boy, since young, has been trying his best with the housework.</p><br/><p>In order to lessen his mother\u2019s burden. In order to get a smile from her. In order to get praised by her. In order to get approval from her.</p><br/><p>But no matter how he tried his best, his mother never smiled at him. Never ever praised him. She even treated like he was not even there.</p><br/><p>Today was the same. His mother did not smile, did not say that the food was delicious and simply went to bed with a darkened face.</p><br/><p>Even so, the boy never did once blame his mother.</p><br/><p>Because the boy knew how many difficulties his mother had faced.</p><br/><p>The boy had a thought.</p><br/><p>Anyone can do housework. It was the boy himself who hadn\u2019t tried his best.</p><br/><p>And so the boy tried harder.</p><br/><p>His studies. Sports.</p><br/><p>He tried hard as like in the past. He got full marks every time. Before he realized, he had already studied all the way till university level.</p><br/><p>Without slacking at housework.</p><br/><p>He would fold the clothes neatly, clean every nook and corner, cook delicious dinner every night, get full marks in every test.</p><br/><p>And all he got was a \u201d Right. \u201c.</p><br/><p>It was a wearisome, short reply.</p><br/><p>A reply that did not recognize the effort the boy put in.</p><br/><p>And even so, the boy did never once blame his mother.</p><br/><p>It happened on a certain day.</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s mother fainted.</p><br/><p>She was admitted into the hospital but no cause could be found.</p><br/><p>She was already skinny and yet she got skinnier day by day.</p><br/><p>The boy devoted his time in taking care of her.</p><br/><p>And even so never had once his mother looked at him.</p><br/><p>The final day came.</p><br/><p>It was a rare day where his mother was smiling self-deprecatingly which caused the boy to involuntarily ask.</p><br/><p>\u201d Mum, why do you hate me? \u201d</p><br/><p>The boy knew it in his heart.</p><br/><p>Why his mother never once looked at him no matter how hard he tried.</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s mother smiled a gentle self-deprecating smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d I hate that face of yours. \u201d</p><br/><p>The boy\u2019s mother knew in her heart that the boy was not in the wrong.</p><br/><p>In fact she was even thankful towards him. If she ever managed to be frank to him.</p><br/><p>In the end, anger took over her.</p><br/><p>Every time she looked at his face she would remember her divorced husband.</p><br/><p>And now she was looking at that person\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019m sorry. \u201d</p><br/><p>The hoarse mumble of the boy\u2019s mother did not reach him. For he had left the hospital room.</p><br/><p>The next day, it was the first time the boy was not in the hospital room.</p><br/><p>Then, as if it was at her own choosing, the boy\u2019s mother breathed her last.</p><br/><p>With a graceful smile that not even the boy had even seen on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201d So it was because of this face. \u201d</p><br/><p>The boy clenched his fist.</p><br/><p>\u201d This face\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>And he decided.</p><br/><p>To live strongly.</p><br/><p>That even with his face there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..It\u2019s a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>He woke up as it was hard to breathe.</p><br/><p>Looking outside the window, the sky was still somewhat dark, looking like it\u2019s a little before dawn.</p><br/><p>But it had been some time since he last had that dream.</p><br/><p>\u2026..He thought he managed to forget about it.</p><br/><p>He laughed self-mockingly as he got up.</p><br/><p>Careful not to wake his parents who were sleeping on either side of him, he got out of the bed and walked down the corridor.</p><br/><p>\u201d Fuwaaaa \u201d</p><br/><p>He let out a huge yawn as he headed towards his own room.</p><br/><p>It must be because of the conversation yesterday that he had that dream.</p><br/><p>The meaning behind what John-sensei said could be guessed easily as he had been through it before. He thought they were quite alike.</p><br/><p>Which was why he thought that they can get along well.</p><br/><p>Even though there was a huge age gap, he still thought that they can become close friends.</p><br/><p>Even though he was a little worried when he heard about John-sensei\u2019s problematic family, unexpectedly it just might turn out well.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Since I had some time after finishing chapter 3 so I thought I can get started on chapter 4\u2026turns out I managed to finish this within 1 hour.</p><br/><p>DOUBLE RELEASE for you guys!</p><br/><p>PS: Please don\u2019t get used to this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

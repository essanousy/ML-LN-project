He\u2019s heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oi Shiro. What are you doing? \u201d</p><br/><p>My voice came out dangerously low but Shiro looked like it did not concern him at all. No, I was not unhappy about this difference in height at all, nope.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Oi, why was I not even touching his waist? Or rather, your legs were too long, baka.</p><br/><p>\u201d Lack of oxygen\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Shiro then proceeded to leave his entire weight onto my head. If I was just a normal 8 year old kid, I was pretty sure my neck would be bending at an odd angle by now. Which summoned beast would harm his owner\u2019s body like this? \u2026..No, if it was Shiro, he most definitely knew what I was capable of before doing it. What bad taste.</p><br/><p>But, thanks to Shiro\u2019s action, the sparkling eyes filled with pure admiration that was causing me to itch all over the place soon died down. If this was what Shiro was aiming for, then my valuation of him had to change.</p><br/><p>\u2026..The him who was humming a song while shaking his butt\u2026 No, not possible.</p><br/><p>After clearing my head of those thoughts, I returned to the topic, ignoring Shiro.</p><br/><p>\u201d And that\u2019s why, how about doing a collaboration with our summoned beast? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Sounds good! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I agree! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wonderful! \u201d</p><br/><p>At my suggestion, the 3 of them agreed happily. Then looking at each other with a happy grin on their faces, they took some distance from each other.</p><br/><p>After getting into their position as if they were surrounding me, they nodded, satisfied, before facing outside, taking something out. They then proceeded to gather mana and when they had gathered enough, they shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201d \u300a\u300b! \u201c\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Shokan, summon]</p><br/><p>Cute \u2018pop\u2019 like sound sounded before the magic x 3 began to activate at the same time. It seemed like the thing that they took out just now were magic circles drawn on a sheet of paper to help aid them in summoning their beasts.</p><br/><p>Looking at the unruly head of red hair, he pounced straight towards a dog that appeared while looking like it was swimming in the air, crashing into the ground. \u2026.Zen. I know you miss him, I do. Really, you don\u2019t feel embarrassed at all, do you?</p><br/><p>An unusual sense of admiration came over me. That was because I did not possess that ability.</p><br/><p>Since it was dangerous for his head, I used wind magic to absorb the shock. Like a certain princess in a certain castle, Zen floated in the air for a bit before floating down, gently. As for his dog\u2026. his summoned beast, Dogg, was licking his face all over as its tails wagged hard, like rotating blades.</p><br/><p>I turned to the others. Well then, if I remembered correctly, Selphy\u2019s summoned beast was a Bird species beast, Asuka. \u2026.No, the reason why I did not see it the first time was not because I found it tiresome. It\u2019s that, you know. I have to control my beast. Yep.</p><br/><p>A gust of wind blew and a beautiful greenish bird appeared. Selphy\u2019s beautiful green hair was dancing in the wind. The little bird flew high into the sky, before turning around immediately and landed on Selphy\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201d Gruuuuuuu\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>The bird chirped happily as they looked each other in the eye. Selphy, as though embarrassed to be looked in the eye, smiled bashfully.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Yep, how cute. Too cute, damn it.</p><br/><p>I have to say again, I am not a lolicon. An elf with her green hair dancing in the wind while smiling at her pet bird, a beautiful elf, surrounded by the forest! Only beautiful and cute could describe it! Those that don\u2019t feel it must have something wrong. They need a doctor.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026cough \u201d</p><br/><p>I coughed and tore my eyes away to another spot. To Mi. I knew about Zen and Selphy\u2019s beasts but I left for the \u2018secret mission\u2019 before I even found out what Mi\u2019s was. I wondered what he summoned. As I looked over with anticipation, Mi was already greetings with his summoned beast. They both bowed to each other before shaking hands.</p><br/><p>\u201d I will be relying on you. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Gigigigiii. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mi said to which his beast answered him.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, so Mi\u2019s summoned beast is a monkey. \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, and the both of them turned towards me. Monkey, as its name suggested, was a monkey-like beast. But the color of their fur was not the same as Earth, they possessed all sorts of colors.</p><br/><p>\u201d Um. Aiki the monkey. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mi said, introducing his beast proudly. And Aiki, sitting on Mi\u2019s shoulder, puffed its chest out and looked proud. Aiki had a deep blue coat and his short fur made him look really cute. I wondered if his fur felt like velour. Maybe it\u2019s still young, it was really quite small in size, just like a lemur, and very cute.</p><br/><p>I felt like stroking it. To ruffle its fur.</p><br/><p>And as I was thinking of it, our eyes met and it quickly hid behind Mi\u2019s back. Maybe my enthusiasm was too strong and it scared him. It looked to be a wild monkey so maybe they were sensitive to these kind of feelings.</p><br/><p>I need to control myself.</p><br/><p>As I reflected upon it, I waited for the next chance. If I can hide my feelings well enough, I might be able to stroke it the moment it let its guard down. Hm? Why was I not quitting? There was no way I could. How could I, after seeing that soft fur?</p><br/><p>The dog that would make all mofu mofu believers swoon, the cute Dogg was licking Zen\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>The natural beauty that was everlasting, Selphy and her bird, were looking at each other.</p><br/><p>The soft and velvety fur of the cute monkey with its proud face and Mi who was enjoying its presence.</p><br/><p>And then, there was the me, who was being leaned on by my summoned beast.</p><br/><p>Oi, wait a minute.</p><br/><p>Instantly, I darted out from under Shiro and pointed at him. There was lot about our tactics I need to discuss about but I had to deal with this first.</p><br/><p>\u201d Shiro! Your cuteness level is hideously low! Soothing and healing therapy! Give me some soothing and healing therapy! \u201d</p><br/><p>My soul was crying out loud.</p><br/><p>I was not wrong for wanting to be healed! I was totally not happy about having an ikemen leaning on me at all! I don\u2019t have that kind of hobby!</p><br/><p>At my words, Shiro looked like he realized something and clapped his hands together.</p><br/><p>\u201d I got it! That must be an order from master to cross-dre\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>I gave my all in shutting Shiro\u2019s mouth, which was saying something weird again. When will this cross-dressing gag ever end\u2026.. My head hurt. I then let out a deep sigh, before lifting my head up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Since our summoned beasts are all here, let\u2019s us start our strategy meeting. \u201d</p><br/><p>I could only give up.</p><br/><p>On my healing.</p><br/><p>Yep, but once I go home, my mofu mofu-sama would be waiting for me! I still have Chiffon! She would definitely allow me to hug her while smiling sweetly!</p><br/><p>As my heart sobbed, I put out a smiling face.</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t lose! Not for the tournament, and not for everything else either! Yep!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

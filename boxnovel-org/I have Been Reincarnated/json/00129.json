I had this habit back on earth too and doing this would help me in organizing the situation.</p><br/><p>Firstly, today\u2019s the 2nd day I came here. Here refers to the all-so-common alternate world. I too, can\u2019t believed it but I had seen magic right before my eyes and plus, I can feel the flow of mana myself so I had to believed it.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s start from 2 days before.</p><br/><p>The 1st day. On that day, before I came over, it was morning back on Earth. I met Shou on the way to school and after our usual bantering, a vase dropped directly onto Shou\u2019s head. And while I was still stunned, a truck headed my way.</p><br/><p>And when I thought I died, I was already in this world.</p><br/><p>All these made no sense.</p><br/><p>To appeared within a forest after seeing your best friend died and a truck running you over.</p><br/><p>Shou, I\u2019m sorry. I did not even had the time to grieved over your death. You might be laughing at how ortherdox this was to get reincarnated in an alternate world after being run down by a truck but in my case, it\u2019s a trip instead. What was this, really\u2026</p><br/><p>Although I\u2019m okay with it being a trip\u2026 no I\u2019m not but let\u2019s just leave it at that! For me, who read all mangas, novels, web novels, I came to realized it\u2019s a trip to an alternate world pretty soon.</p><br/><p>But, to have a sparkling ikeman who was like an assassin attacking you the moment you came over?! Usually, people who came over would have time to organize their thoughts and calm themselves down, don\u2019t they?!</p><br/><p>PLUS.</p><br/><p>That silver-haired Onii-San looked exactly like Shou! When I thought that Shou had trip over as well, I called out to him only to had him come attacking me. And when I thought I was about to be beaten up, I could somehow repelled him. I\u2019m so glad for the all-mighty other-worlder [cheat].</p><br/><p>If all of this was not as ortherdox, I would had died. And when I wanted to speak to Silver-Shou, he muttered something incomprehensible and fainted away. Shou, who had fainted away, had a head of such beautiful silver hair that I thought this trip over had activated his chuunibyo-ness.</p><br/><p>In the end, Shou, who had woken up, stood guarded against me and kept me at a distance. It seemed like he wasn\u2019t Shou.</p><br/><p>And above all, I can\u2019t speak their language.</p><br/><p>For an other-worlder such as me, wasn\u2019t there supposed to be language [cheat]?!</p><br/><p>Then, Shou-lookalike then finally introduced himself. It seemed like he was called Simon Beryl or something. If I was not wrong, I had an inkling that the name Simon usually had a nickname as Shou.</p><br/><p>That was why he was very surprised by me when I first called out to him using Shou. I just realized it now. But the difference in language was hindering me in obtaining any information whatsoever.</p><br/><p>On the 2nd day, he was still on guard against me but had also started teaching me their language.</p><br/><p>Clothes were dorrieraxe, hand was jiccoreth or something similar to that prounciation. At the very least I was sure this language do not exist on Earth. Yes, there was way to many little sounds in there.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I feel like eating potato chips. I\u2019m sick of meat\u2026.</p><br/><p>In these few weeks, we had been hunting down monsters and eating it. It was really delicious at first. I mean, I was one of the rare carnivores men, you see.</p><br/><p>It was great that the trip had given me some [cheat]. My strength seemed like it had grown 4 times better than before. If not for that, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hunt any monsters down.</p><br/><p>Now, I could understand simple phrases of this world\u2019s language. And from S-Shou, I came to know that he was on the run from his country for having committed a crime. He\u2019s a criminal?! But after getting along with him, I found him to be quite a good guy.</p><br/><p>Maybe something happened behind the scenes.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>A big discovery. Magic chants were in Japanese! My excitement was raised to the max! That meant that I had been shooting out random magic until I passed out.</p><br/><p>Now, it was time for my legand to began!</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>The reason S-Shou was hunted down was because he proposed to null the treatment against Beastmen and angered the Emperor. What a good guy. As he was being chased by assassins called [Shadows], he could only hide within this [Demon Forest].</p><br/><p>In that case, let\u2019s create a country here.</p><br/><p>There was nothing impossible that I can\u2019t do. Because I was a living [Cheat]. I shall create a place where furry eared girls would lived in peace!</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>We started developing a part of land within the [Demon Forest]. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a country yet but it\u2019s a space where we could protect Beastmen.</p><br/><p>Anyway, let\u2019s just create a space in the middle of the [Demon Forest] first.</p><br/><p>We had arranged tomorrow to be the day where we started cutting down trees. It will be alright as long as I cut it cleanly with an air knife.</p><br/><p>S-Shou had said that if we were to developed the [Demon Forest], a calamity would befall us. But it was not like I am going to wipe the entire forest clean, just a tony part should be okay.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no use.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t clean up the trees at all.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s god\u2019s punishment or something but monsters would started to gushed out once I cut the trees.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s just sleep for today.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I met god. He was a grandpa with a really long beard.</p><br/><p>Anyway, developing the forest would result in a calamity was not false, it seemed. It was not that god had purposely done it but it seemed like there was a fine balance between the positive and negative energies on this world and all the bad energies was sealed within this forest.</p><br/><p>And if the trees were cut, the barrier sealing the energy would wavered and negative energy would gathered and created monsters.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, god spoke in Japanese. Maybe he\u2019s former Japanese?</p><br/><p>Anyway, I felt a sense of closeness with him. Anyway, it was not only the energies being in trouble, even nature. Stuff like landslide, global warming, and when I said that I understood the importance of these issue, god had promised that he would somehow emptied a space out for me.</p><br/><p>After returning to the forest from the vast white amusing space in the god realm, I had to explained to the worried S-Shou about where I had been since I suddenly disappeared.</p><br/><p>The face S-Shou made after I told him was hilarious.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Today, I got my first summoned beast. It\u2019s a dream of everyone. A dragon.</p><br/><p>Superrrrrr cool.</p><br/><p>Since there were nothing to do, out of boredom, I went over to S-Shou and he taught me summoning. Although he said that summoning was not dangerous at all, the Dragon I summoned came attacking immediately.</p><br/><p>After somehow defeating it, we made a pact. It said that it would follow me because it looked it it was going to be fun. Since it wanted a name as well, I named him \u2018Shiro\u2019.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a cute name. Just like a dog.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>A space had been emptied. Facing the empty land, I gave my thanks to god. After deciding that this place was going to be the capital, I joked to a smiling S-Shou that the named of this country would be Simon Country.</p><br/><p>\u201d Isn\u2019t it confirmed that this is to be called Elzmu? \u201d</p><br/><p>He said. Well, it was true that I went bargaining with god for this but it was not like I did anything great. God was just being a kind old man.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re joking. It counldn\u2019t possibly be\u2026</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be S-Shou, who was a former Noble to do this instead?</p><br/><p>As for Elzmu, it was because Azuma seemed to be really difficult for S-Shou to pronounced and no matter how I corrected him, he could only call me Elzmu.</p><br/><p>But when I explained that Azuma meant North in my country\u2019s language, S-Shou started grinning. I had a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I made a pact with yet another beast.</p><br/><p>It was a humanoid creature that was about 10cm tall but for some reason, it\u2019s head was an eyeball. It\u2019s look was exactly like Eyeball Ojiisan.</p><br/><p>I saved it from being attacked by other monsters out of curiosity and was told by it that it wanted to make a pact with me. The magical pact that I made between us\u2026.. Let\u2019s stop. I\u2019m a male.</p><br/><p>For this beast, it seemed like the price for the pact was to named it. I came out with a genius name \u2018Alcumedes\u2019.</p><br/><p>Cool.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Alcumedes was able to used space magic, something like creating another dimension, and was able to place stuff inside.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, I thought of something.</p><br/><p>I wondered if it\u2019s weird to go asking him to make tools for me just like a certain blue cat robot.</p><br/><p>I immediately used that magic. The higher one\u2019s mana was, the bigger the space was going to be.</p><br/><p>Mine was 53 million so\u2026. it was going to be big. I can put quite a lot of stuff in there.</p><br/><p>Space magic sure was awesome. This, was what was missing. Well, tomorrow, we shall be heading towards S-Shou\u2019s country, Hattuo.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>The person who read this was most probably one of us. I don\u2019t know if you are a tripper or a reincatator but, erm\u2026. Please don\u2019t mind my black history.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m regretting it.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

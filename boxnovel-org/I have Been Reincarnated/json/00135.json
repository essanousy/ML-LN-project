What do you mean? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Isn\u2019t fireworks just something that goes bang? \u201d</p><br/><p>Questioned Zen and Selphy. And I had no idea what Selphy was talking about. What had making fireworks got to do with \u2018bang\u2019?</p><br/><p>Well, in this world, only the King (Terao) knew how to create fireworks and this craft was never taught to commoners. It was all confined within the Royal family\u2019s knowledge.</p><br/><p>Know your place, royalties.</p><br/><p>\u201d I should have a semi-circle in here\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Grabbing hold of something in my subspace, I pulled out a beige semi-circle. Zen and Selphy\u2019s gazes, filled with marvel, was directed at my wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201d We just need to put small black balls as well as gunpowder in this and it\u2019s done. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh?!? \u201d</p><br/><p>After explaining it simply, Zen raised his voice in surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201d Why is it that you how to make fireworks?!? \u201d</p><br/><p>Being a magical tool craftsman\u2019s son, Zen sure was sensitive to these kind of stuff. I had always made something up when it came to knowledge from my previous life but not this time. This time, I had a card up my sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201d Heh\u2026 Don\u2019t look down on me. I still am a duke\u2019s son. I have the First Founder\u2019s diary in my hands. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, Terao\u2019s diary.</p><br/><p>How wonderful. People closed to me already knew I was well-versed in the magic language and now, I had this great present in terms of Terao\u2019s diary. Now I can pinned all my weird knowledge on it.</p><br/><p>\u201d So now you know. Let\u2019s get started! \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, nodding proudly as I passed Zen and Selphy each a piece of the semi-circle.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Making fireworks was a different task. So difficult that there exists firework artisan. And even if we normal people were to make a novice one, it would still take some time.</p><br/><p>So what should we do?</p><br/><p>Actually, this semi-circle was a magic tool I created. And it\u2019s name was, easy firework\u2026.. let\u2019s stop.</p><br/><p>[TN: Basically, if you guys had even watched or read any Doraemon, you know what the author is referring to.]</p><br/><p>To go into details, it\u2019s made of out wood fashioned into a semi-circle shape magic tool. Then, you would need to imagine the shape and the pattern you want the fireworks to be as you filled it up with gunpowder and black balls and the black balls will then moved according to your imagination when you set it off. Amazing, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Well, since I had never ever made any fireworks in my previous life, I had to rely on magic for this. Really, magic sure was convenient. Hm, that was also because it\u2019s actually Japanese.</p><br/><p>So, after giving Zen and Selphy\u2019s instructions, their eyes sparkled as they worked on the semi-circles.</p><br/><p>Well well, what shape would be it, I wondered. This was going to be fun. Zen and Selphy, as they made their versions of fireworks, they eyes kept roaming the sky, as if they were in deep thoughts. Glancing at them, I made my portion and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm? Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving Selphy who went into her own world, Zen looked at me and asked. I smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201d I have to go and receive someone whom I invited to this fireworks show. That\u2019s why I will be leaving for a while. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh! I see! No problem! Then we\u2019ll be here waiting? \u201d</p><br/><p>Having people looked at your creation was a wonderful thing. I don\u2019t\u2019 know if he realized that or not, but Zen stood up and waved at me as I headed towards the house.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Father, it\u2019s a go for the fireworks, right? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, I have already settled everything. It seems that people had already started reserving their seat at that area in town where the fireworks could be seen. \u201d</p><br/><p>I stood facing Father, confirming for the last time. At my words, Father smiled, a bit wryly.</p><br/><p>Yes, I had planned this way in advance and had gotten the authorization for this. Before today, I was still troubled over the fact if I should make some original fireworks or not. Even so, I had already ordered a large order of fireworks.</p><br/><p>As for where I had the money for this, it all came from the sales I did with Buu-san, which Father knew about. This time, I was planning on mixing in some of our original fireworks into the existing ones.</p><br/><p>And the main aim of this was to introduced this culture/habit into Elzmu!</p><br/><p>I was planning to turn the Beryl\u2019s territory into a famous spot for fireworks! In this world, fireworks show were like those small neighborhood summer festival kind and none of those of huge impact.</p><br/><p>Just that would be unable to satisfied this matsuri-loving soul of mine! Thanks to having the funds, I was able to make this a reality.</p><br/><p>When I became the head of Beryl, I want this land to be the place where everyone would visit during summer for the wonderful fireworks show! Plus, I want to make it so that this was not something only couples enjoyed for for all ages and status! Muhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!</p><br/><p>\u201d But\u2026 fireworks show.. You sure thought of a good thing. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d The fireworks made by the First Founder was beautiful. I truly find it wasteful that people other than those living in the capital get to see it! As a citizen of Elzmu and also as a Noble, I want to spread the wonderful things the First Founder created to everyone!! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d O, oh, you sure are excited. \u201d</p><br/><p>Oops. I got a little too carried away. Let\u2019s calm down.</p><br/><p>Hee-hee-hooo.</p><br/><p>I gave a wryly smile after doing some deep breathing in my heart.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, hmm, well.. I tried to think like a merchant\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I see. Yes, merchants are like that\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>At my excuse, Father thought back to all the merchants he met before and his expression turned weary.</p><br/><p>That was because, even for those high-ended ones, most merchants came from Dyuvu. In short, they were always excited and talkative. Very good at making their cases, good at drinking and strong as well.</p><br/><p>They were like the strongest of all mankind.</p><br/><p>As a head of a territory, Father had talks with them often. His eyes glazed over.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well, then I would start bringing the guest over! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d O, oh, sure. Take care. \u201d</p><br/><p>At father\u2019s words, I imagined the place as I chanted in my heart.</p><br/><p>\u300a\u300b\uff01 [TN: Teni, teleport]</p><br/><p>I proceeded to then disappeared from the office as the scene in front of my eyes changed. It was a dimly-lit dreary house. Books were packed fully at one side of the house. And opposite of that stood only a coffee table and a sofa.</p><br/><p>I wondered where the clothes were stored. It can\u2019t be in that wooden chest stuffed into a nook of the house.. right? Rather that saying tidy, it was more like there was nothing in here. And the owner of this house was none other than\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d You look surprise no matter how many times you came. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Sorry for bothering again, John-Sensei. \u201d</p><br/><p>My sparta teacher as well as my closest friend, John-Sensei.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

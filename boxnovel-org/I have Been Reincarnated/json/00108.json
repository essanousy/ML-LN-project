My eyes opened at the same moment I was thinking that as my consciousness awakened.</p><br/><p>\u201d Morning chirps\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I mumbled as I rubbed my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026..That\u2019s wrong. The meaning was slightly different. Yep, I knew that. Unfortunately, regardless of the previous life or this, it was something I had not experienced before.</p><br/><p>[TN: Explanation time. Raws are chu chu from the birds. Morning chu, raws\u2019s asa chu, means a morning kiss after sharing the night. ]</p><br/><p>Rising up slowly, I stretched my arms, warming up my body. Since this body was still young, there was no stiffness whatsoever. It was just that I was used to doing it.</p><br/><p>By doing this, I felt like my head too, was clearing up from the muddiness from sleeping, not just my body. I suddenly thought of something as I was climbing down from the upper bunk without making a sound.</p><br/><p>Here, the White Wind Dormitory\u2026. or rather, dormitories inside Phyllis Academy were situated right in the center. And in this academy, magic was being taught. Which meant, the academy was sound-proof. Explosions that could not be simply covered by thick walls as well as the previous incident where my summoned beast destroyed the classroom, the noises were all prevented from leaking outside. This was, of course, something to be expected since the academy was inside the Capital.</p><br/><p>See, strange right?</p><br/><p>Why could the soft chirping of the birds be heard? How particular.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well, then. \u201d</p><br/><p>While I was thinking all that, I had finished changing as well as washing my face. I then slowly tip-toed, before taking a deep breath\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d WAKE UPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>I yelled, right into Zen\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201d UWAHHHHH!!!??? \u201d</p><br/><p>A loud bang was then heard, as Zen crouched down, hugging his head. Glancing at him, I nodded, satisfied.</p><br/><p>Mission complete.</p><br/><p>This way he would be fully awake. Eh? What, I\u2019m mean? Although stones were about to be thrown at me for not using a gentler method, this was the gentlest method. You see, this guy, Zen, he just can\u2019t wake up.</p><br/><p>Just to mention, he wouldn\u2019t wake up even if you kicked him. It was that bad.</p><br/><p>Eh? No no no, it was not that I kicked him before or something. I won\u2019t ever do such a horrible thing, you know~ I will never do such a horrible thing such as kicking him to see if he could wake up or not, you know~</p><br/><p>Plus, he would be late and missing breakfast if not for me. The way to solve the dilemma was this method. Yep, can you feel my love for going through all this instead of just leaving him?</p><br/><p>I was really quite reluctant to use my strengthened voice too.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ouch\u2026..Will, please stop waking me up this way\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Even though there was a creature with tears in his eyes and looking up at me, I felt no guilt whatsoever. Oi, you. Why were you sitting there like a girl as you massaged your head while trembling? It made me looked as if I was the bad guy! I won\u2019t apologize!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Maybe I went a little too far. Maybe.</p><br/><p>Since there was no helping it, I pointed to the clock hanging on the wall without changing my expression.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.Crap! It\u2019s already this time?! \u201d</p><br/><p>It had only been a few seconds since Zen lay eyes on the time but he had already stood up and stripped naked. Oh!? What just happened? Zen just stripped in a speed even my eyes cannot catch up\u2026. Not to mention his movement were a blur, like it was drawn in a gag manga?! Even that 3rd generation thief would be surprised at that speed! Zirco-san would even cry! Zen, when exactly did you learn this skill?</p><br/><p>[TN: That reference was Lupin the 3rd.]</p><br/><p>\u201d Phew\u2026.! Thank god! I made it! \u201d</p><br/><p>As I indulged in retorting, Zen had already finished changing. Although his hair was artistically sticking up everywhere, I ignored it.</p><br/><p>\u201d Good. Let\u2019s rush over to the cafeteria. \u201d</p><br/><p>Swallowing my retorts that were almost flying out, I said only that.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, good morning. \u201d</p><br/><p>Once we reached the cafeteria, Selphy, who was already there, greeted us with a dazzling smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d Un. Good morning~ \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Morning! \u201d</p><br/><p>As though infected, both of us returned the greeting with bright smiles. Although Zen had some drool coming out of his. As always.</p><br/><p>And as usual, Zen sat besides Selphy as I sat opposite them as we began eating. It was a simple meal of bread and soup but since this was breakfast, it was just right. After blowing to cool the soup and drinking it, Selphy opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh yes, Maria and I was talking about it yesterday, about how there\u2019s only a month to the tournament. \u201d</p><br/><p>I snapped my head up at this. Thanks to that, Selphy and I were staring at each other for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201d Tournament? \u201d</p><br/><p>I was pulled back into reality by Zen\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Here it came\u2014\u2013! The standard development for the other world\u2014\u2014-!!</p><br/><p>Well, let me stop my inner cheering at this. Tournament\u2026after everything from the secret mission to Hattuo to Zen acting weird, I had forgotten that this academy had the standard development of a [Tournament]. And the rare thing was that I knew about it.</p><br/><p>That was because when I was still at home, Father had bragged about it. \u201d At our generation, the winning team was your mother\u2019s, you know! She was really really beautiful up there.. \u201d Father had said that many times in delight, as Mother smiled gently as she blushed, as beautiful as ever. Though it was a scene enough for anyone to vomit sugar.</p><br/><p>Or rather, since young Father had been a raijuu, didn\u2019t he? Just explode!</p><br/><p>But Mother\u2019s team managed to win despite Father, being strongly suspected of having a [cheat], was there\u2026..made me felt that Mother was stronger than she looked. And\u2026 let us stop this topic right here.</p><br/><p>Anyway, when I knew about this event, I was very very excited about it but\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201d Un. Right before the skipping of grades exam. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That means it\u2019s around mid-July. \u201d</p><br/><p>At Selphy\u2019s frown, I too, had a troubled look on my face. At our sentences, Zen tilted his head in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..What kind of tournament is it? \u201d</p><br/><p>He asked timidly. Selphy and I looked at each other and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d Swimming tournament! \u201c\u201d</p><br/><p>Really, what was the First Founder thinking?</p><br/><p>Since an academy from the other world was holding a tournament, why was it not a martial tournament but a swimming one? How puzzling. My expectations were totally betrayed.</p><br/><p>Until now, he had left so many standard events so why a swimming tournament? Had he wanted to relive his younger days when he grew older? Or was it his youthful indiscretion? I see, it must be.</p><br/><p>Ah, you should understand by now. Anyway, there was only 1 month to the swimming tournament. As the name implied, a giant pool would be set up in the school and students would be separated into teams and undergo a 1 km swimming relay.</p><br/><p>But, this was after all a different world.</p><br/><p>It was not just a simple swimming relay.</p><br/><p>Yep, I\u2019m glad I was not betrayed in this aspect.</p><br/><p>\u201d I can\u2019t swim\u2026.!! \u201d</p><br/><p>A sad cry was heard as we walked down the corridor. It went without saying, the owner of that voice was Zen.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well, lessons will begin from now then. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes! It will be okay as long as I practice! \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy and I smiled wryly at the depressed Zen before throwing him a bone.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>The continent Elzmu was in, Riina, was extremely big. In other words, different from Japan, which was an island country, there was no place near that could allow one to swim. You could think of it as an inland without any pools or river.</p><br/><p>Another thing was that Elzmu was a wasteland until 200 years ago. There was nowhere for one to swim leisurely. There only existed a river which would eat you up the moment you entered it.</p><br/><p>Therefore, there was hardly any students who knew how to swim.</p><br/><p>That was why it was really a mystery why Phillis Academy, situated in Elzmu, would hold a swimming tournament. I was starting to feel that it was just to betray my expectations.</p><br/><p>I mean, think about it!! It could only be a martial one when one mentioned tournament in another world, wasn\u2019t it?! Right?!!?</p><br/><p>As I moaned in my heart, Zen started moaning.</p><br/><p>\u201d But why can the 2 of you swim? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Since I live in the forest, we have a spring I can swim in. \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy said proudly, sticking her chest out.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh-, so there\u2019s a spring you can swim in inside the forest. \u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that aloud, Selphy looked slightly troubled.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, you see, there\u2019s the faeries. \u201d</p><br/><p>I get it.</p><br/><p>Although not much was known about the ecology of faeries but most of them could be found at places where a beautiful spring gushed out. They might have unconsciously created the spring with their magic when they yearned to play in the water, John-sensei had said something fantasy-like when he said that faeries loved pure water but he certainly did not sound like he believed it.</p><br/><p>My eyes were shining when he said that so he stopped whatever he was about to say further on. Thinking back now, I shuddered to think what he wanted to say. But, things like Elves and Faeries were fantasy-like to begin with so I could accept that explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..And, why is Will able to? \u201d</p><br/><p>I just realized it when I was asked.</p><br/><p>About why I could swim.</p><br/><p>I mean, I had worked part-time as an instructor in my previous life but ever since I was reborn here, I had never ever swum. Ah, it was really difficult to answer why I could swim.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Ha ha\u2026.I wonder why\u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>As I tried to pull one over by smiling wryly, my help appeared.</p><br/><p>Yes, we reached the classroom.</p><br/><p>And so, as I gave a not-really-an-answer, we sat down on our seats as lessons started.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Now, I had to think of an explanation.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: Anyone interested in translating the POVs of other characters?

My heart was beating really fast.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s all thanks to you readers!</p><br/><p>Really really thank you!</p><br/><p>My writing is still bad but yoroshiku onegaishimasu.</p><br/><p>It was me who agreed for him to be the tutor, but he seemed to come from a really problematic family.</p><br/><p>Home tutor \u2014 Was he planning to use the role of an educator as a connection to the Beryl\u2019s House, or, he just took notice of what a shameful performance I put up at the party and wanted to put me right\u2026.</p><br/><p>Since it was all unclear at the moment, the only thing I was certain was that he would really be teaching me. Being 3 years old, I did not think he would be flattering me.</p><br/><p>\u2026It must be so. No, if I didn\u2019t believe in that I could not go on.</p><br/><p>The person who took care of Father must be someone of a higher rank so I took pity and agreed, I could not possibly take it back now\u2026</p><br/><p>It would be so uncool.</p><br/><p>Since that day, I visited Father\u2019s office and asked to borrow some documents about my tutor\u2019s family for information\u2026</p><br/><p>I could not back off here! I had to do it properly! Do not turn into a wimp!</p><br/><p>The man who expressed his deep desire to become my home tutor this time was John Veltor.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be the 2nd son of Viscount Veltor but as he had already abandoned his family name, I did not see any connections he had with his family now. Now, he was doing research in the Royal Court as a researcher and scholar. He also seemed to hold a position as an assistant.</p><br/><p>But, the problem was Veltor\u2019s House.</p><br/><p>The present head of the family was John\u2019s father, and it seemed that the next head was decided to be his older brother. The territory they ruled was one that had the heaviest tax in the entire nation. That was poor judgment no matter who looked at it. Plus, they squandered money away like water. Luxurious furnishings, branded clothing, gemstones. As for food, they only ate meat of the highest grade.</p><br/><p>What an irony, when you compared the pointless gaudiness of the residence with the worn-out village.</p><br/><p>According to Father\u2019s documents, villagers from Veltor\u2019s territory moving over (here) had been increasing yearly.</p><br/><p>What a picture perfect example of a heinous noble.</p><br/><p>I closed my open mouth, looking at such cliche villains. It seemed that they had connections with the black market and dealt with slave trading as well.</p><br/><p>Did John Veltor abandon his family after seeing all that? Or, despite being the 2nd son, possessed the ambition for greatness and reached for the Royal Court?</p><br/><p>I definitely wanted to think that it was the former. Without thinking, I shuddered.</p><br/><p>And because of that, Father asked if I could read all that documents and I panicked.</p><br/><p>With \u201d Because everybody often read pictures books to me. \u201c, I managed to pull one over his eyes.</p><br/><p>Father\u2019s sharp.</p><br/><p>And so, I was very nervous about this home tutor.</p><br/><p>That man, was coming right now.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Ah\u2026This was so worrying\u2026You didn\u2019t really need to come you know? Yep.</p><br/><p>Ah, would he be a willful bastard who left in the middle of it on a whim?</p><br/><p>So in that situation, sitting beside Father in the drawing room, I could not help but fidgeted.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Are you okay, Will? If you don\u2019t want it we can stop it now\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Father said, turning his worried eyes on me.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s okay. \u201d</p><br/><p>I puffed my chest, stuck my thumbs out and placed my left hand on my waist. And my stiff smile was just my way of showing affection.</p><br/><p>Yes, I did not have cold feet.</p><br/><p>Not me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Master. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mary San, the head maid, opened the door silently.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, has he arrived? \u201d</p><br/><p>And just like that, Father wiped his face clean of all uneasiness and stood, face full of smiles.</p><br/><p>As expected of Father~!</p><br/><p>What fast facial switch! A wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing!</p><br/><p>[TN: Japanese is \u2018A cat is good at pretending!\u2019]</p><br/><p>I had to start learning if I wanted to help Father out in the future. Yosh, sheep\u2019s clothing if there was a customer\u2026Note taken.</p><br/><p>I walked unsteadily behind Father down the long corridor till I reached the entry hall.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>With my heart beating, I cracked open the door a smidge and peeked inside. The black double doors opened inwards and I could see a face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Welcome. Thank you for specially making your way down today. Please, come in. \u201d</p><br/><p>The smiling Father was an escort and the man, who Father invited, entered\u2026.</p><br/><p>For a while, I was stunned. This was surprising.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was the 2nd son of a family of corrupted nobles, my image was of a round, fat, ugly, pig looking bastard\u2026the one who appeared was normal, no, possessing a well-balanced-figure man.</p><br/><p>His silky black hair was tied up low at the back, on top of his upturned black eyes lay a pair of glasses. And through his glasses, which was resting on the bridge of his nose, was his intellectual eyes, like they were emphasizing on how clever he was.</p><br/><p>I could not help but shout secretly in my heart, \u2018Here comes the megane [TN: Glasses] character!!!\u2019.</p><br/><p>Plus, despite of being a scholar, he had a well toned/balanced muscular body. He was not as tall as Father but his legs were long.</p><br/><p>And I looked at my own feet.</p><br/><p>\u2026.I, I was only 3 years old so I still had a long way to go!!</p><br/><p>And when I realized it, Father and Mr.John had walked away. Panicking, I chased after them with my short legs. I felt slightly humiliated\u2026sob.</p><br/><p>And once John entered the drawing room, he sat across from Father and me, with a desk between us.</p><br/><p>\u201d This time, thank you so much for inviting me to come in as an educator position! Once I came to know that I am accepted, I am so grateful that I came flying over! \u201d</p><br/><p>Said John, just when Father was about to invite him to have a seat.</p><br/><p>His eyes were sparkling.</p><br/><p>He looked just like a kid who just came face to face with his Hero. \u2026.I felt that before too, when I was at that age.</p><br/><p>I smiled and looked at John Veltor, who, for some reason, fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Please pardon my rudeness. I got too excited and forgot my manners. \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he gave an ambiguous smile and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u2026.That\u2019s great, he did not seem like a bad person.</p><br/><p>Father seemed to be having the same thoughts as our eyes met.</p><br/><p>\u201d Nn, Veltor Sama\u2026 John Dono? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes! \u201d</p><br/><p>Just like a dog. He seemed to really revere Father. But, his eyes had been flickering over to me now and then. As I thought, he was interested in me who was to become his student.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, John Dono. You will accept the position of being the Home Tutor to my son, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the two, bewildered by how different my Father sounded as compared to his usual self.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, with great pleasure. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d We will be in your care from now on. Would it be fine for you to stay here? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Y..Yes! \u201d</p><br/><p>John replied, full of emotions and with a face of satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u2026.I thought we could get along well together.</p><br/><p>While I was thinking about that, Father went \u2018Well, I will leave this with you.\u2019 and went out of the drawing room, leaving only the 2 of us and Mary-San alone.</p><br/><p>I exchanged looks with Mary San, and with an elegant smile, she faced John.</p><br/><p>\u201d John Sama, may I show you the way to Will Sama\u2019s room? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: John Veltor.</p><br/><p>Black haired, black eyed stylish megane san desu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

From now on, it\u2019s the real story instead of the digest so for those who had already read the digest, you\u2019ll find a lot more details in here!</p><br/><p>Editor : Poor_Hero</p><br/><p>2nd Editor : Lazarruz22</p><br/><p>\u201d Gkyaaaaaaaaaaaaa (It hurtsssssssss)!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>And a wonderful birthing cry was done by me.</p><br/><p>Hey, it seriously hurt! I mean, imagine the huge force dealt to this soft baby\u2019s skull! For a moment I saw the field of flowers again. Or rather, the vase.. that made me depressed.</p><br/><p>But being out in the open with the light after a long time made me dizzy. I could not even differentiate between left and right\u2026.Was that a nurse? Or a midwife? In my blurry vision, I saw that I was carried by a plump hand and dipped into lukewarm water.</p><br/><p>Ah, was that the baby\u2019s first bath? Hmm\u2026.so comfortable.</p><br/><p>The blood sticking all over my body was the proof of a mother\u2019s effort but to tell the truth, I would really rather choose it not sticking.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u309e\u3006\u2267\u221e\uff0b\u00b1\u2642\uff05\u00a3\uff06\uff03\uff04 \u201d</p><br/><p>Said the plum woman as she looked at me\u2026Wah\u2026 Of course, I had no idea what she was saying. Ah, what a failure. I should have asked god to bless me with an ability in languages\u2026.</p><br/><p>Oh well, no use crying over spilled milk. It was better not to be able to speak fluently all of a sudden as it might seem weird. I didn\u2019t remember having any difficulty in learning Japanese so no worries!</p><br/><p>As I was thinking that, I suddenly felt like I was floating, like someone was lifting me up. I could feel the soft fingers upon my back.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u203b\u3012\u00a2\uff04\uffe5\uff03\u3001\uff03\u00a2\uff03\u309b\u309c\u3003\u30fc \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.Yep, I was able to comprehend that they were happy. I was then passed to a person who seemed to be my mother and she looked at me. But, even with this distance, I was unable to see her face clearly. I had thought that it was because of just being born and the brightness made me unable to see but it didn\u2019t seem like it. Come to think of it, were a baby\u2019s eyes really bad? I felt like I had heard that before\u2026</p><br/><p>But just from the atmosphere, I knew she was delighted. From her gentle embrace, I could feel that I was being handled with great care. Just that, made me feel so happy and blissful that I smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201d \uff03\u25c7\u25ce\u00a3\u00a2\u2267\u3001\u30a6\u30a3\u30eb\u3001\uff06\uff0a\uff20\uff05\u00a3\uff05, Will \u201d</p><br/><p>It was a beautiful voice that sounded like a bell ringing. I had heard it being repeated a few times so I came to understand that, yes, my name was Will.</p><br/><p>Being spoken to in a valuable manner made me realized that this was what parent\u2019s love felt like. Recognizing this feeling which I was unable to feel in the previous world made me feel warm.</p><br/><p>Even though I was killed, concerning this result I felt a little grateful towards the god. As I was thinking about this, in the warmth, I suddenly felt drowsy. Ah, I kinda still wanted to bask in this warmth\u2026.</p><br/><p>The Shou\u2026.Will now, who tried to resist, fell defeat to the body of a baby.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s Note : Thank you very much! Tenpure desu. I like these kind of things so this novel will proceed in the middle of all these roads. [TN: No idea what this means. \u3053\u306e\u306f\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u306e\u3093\u3092\u3086\u304d\u307e\u3059] I will run though all the cliches.</p><br/><p>From now on, yoroshiku~</p><br/><p>TN: So an apology, double release for you guys!! Yay!!</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, this is so short it hardly took any time at all.</p><br/><p>Like how you train running by wearing a mask and after you remove it, running feels so easy-peasy. LOL.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Did I say to memorize the entire book? \u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t feign ignorance-!</p><br/><p>Though yes, he never said that. But! Even if he did not say anything, the unsaid pressure was obvious!</p><br/><p>I tried my best to put the tiny pieces of my broken heart back together. Normally, one would only start lessons when they were older but my inner age was 20 years old. It would affect my pride if I could not even memorize it.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Man, this world\u2019s (study) level was ridiculously high..</p><br/><p>\u2026Plus, when I heard about Sensei\u2019s research in court and was excited for it..</p><br/><p>\u201d Magic? What nonsense are you talking about? Do not make light of it. Please complete your basic studies before asking. \u201d</p><br/><p>Completely stunned, every time I saw that face, I thought I was going to cry.</p><br/><p>As Sensei dropped his facade, I, recently, began to drop mine, 3 years old mask, as well.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026Might be thanks to that, I felt that we somewhat became friends\u2026 At least that was what I thought.</p><br/><p>In these 3 months, I learned about this world\u2019s geography, history, religion, etc.</p><br/><p>To my relief, at least the passing of time was the same. A year is 365 days, 1 day is 24 hours. If that was different, it would be hell studying for history.</p><br/><p>It had really been a long 3 months\u2026 I thought as I snapped the thick book shut. Then, a knock was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201d Come in. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Please excuse me. Hello, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>The one who entered was the rumored John-sensei.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh? Is it the time for lessons already? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, it is. Oh, are you revising? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Kinda. \u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it you who gave me this homework in the first place?! My reproachful eyes turned towards him for an instant and our eyes met. As the stare was getting scary, I broke it off.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, since you did revise, here are some questions. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Yes. \u201d</p><br/><p>My thoughts might have been read as Sensei spoke up at the perfect timing.</p><br/><p>\u2026Sigh, was I too easy to read? I needed to be careful. As a Noble, this was a disadvantage! I clenched my fist, having the motivation in the wrong areas.</p><br/><p>\u201d What is the name of this country? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Elzmu Kingdom\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>In this world, there was 1 discovered continent. The name was Ranaa. It was rumored that there were others.</p><br/><p>In Ranaa, there lay 4 kingdoms.</p><br/><p>They were nicely separated into North, South, East and West.</p><br/><p>North \u2013 Hattuo</p><br/><p>South \u2013 Dyuvu</p><br/><p>East \u2013 Elzmu.</p><br/><p>West \u2013 Hadazerl</p><br/><p>Elzmu sounded like Azuma [TN: East Japan] so that\u2019s East. Hadazerl sounded like a cross between Left [TN: Hidari] and West [TN: Sei] so I remembered it as such.</p><br/><p>Hattuo just sounded like North. It was a militant nation and its emperor, Kvita Hattuo, took over at the age of 53 years old. The climate there seemed to be very cold which caused them to focus on developing magic tools as crops could not grow.</p><br/><p>They were rumored to have \u2018Magic Fields\u2019 which held much \u2018Mana Stones\u2019, stones that were packed with mana, the fuel for magic tools. And with that, it was the most of the Nation\u2019s revenue.</p><br/><p>Hattuo felt just like an industry nation of a dictator from my previous world. Instead of the manufacture and oil, it was magic\u2019s tools and mana stones.</p><br/><p>Although the possibility was close to zero, I really did not want to have any involvement with the Hattuo Emperor, as seen in the illustration of my textbook.</p><br/><p>Balding and fat and wearing loads of pointless ornaments. You could not help but went \u2018Holy smokes!\u2019 when you saw it.</p><br/><p>Next was Elzmu. The name seemed to mean the Fruit of the East. It was a country that I would love to live in if not for the fact that I was already living there. Although it was still under the imperial rule, a parliament had been established as well.</p><br/><p>Due to good ruling by the present Emperor, Elzmu was the country with the best standard of living. Agriculture and magic were both being developed and their economics were also said to be the best. However, they were one of the smallest countries of the four, which sounded a lot like Japan. I laughed, feeling like it was god\u2019s prank.</p><br/><p>Emperor Banzai! His name should be Kesamu Milla Oio\u2026 something. I remembered that it was an insanely long name. Sorry, Kesamu-san.</p><br/><p>Next was West, Hadazerl. The biggest population of all, with countless of races living together. It seemed like the Human King was overthrown, just like the period of The Three Kingdoms.</p><br/><p>\u2026Well, I was not well-versed in The Three Kingdoms so there was not much I could say. They did have farming and not much magic was being developed but in any case, a place that had loads of cheap stuff.</p><br/><p>As I heard from John-sensei.</p><br/><p>Lastly, South \u2013 Dyuvu. Population was ranked 3rd. The Human\u2019s tribe could produce magic fairly well and their physical abilities were also fairly high\u2026 a half-baked kind of country. However, the citizens here did not discriminate, kinda hot-blooded, yet cheerful, frank and optimistic.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Sounded just like a southern country. There were many who loved wine as well. Yep, southern country. It was said that their trading business was the best.</p><br/><p>Why? They actually greeted each other by \u201d Are you making any money? \u201d \u201d Meh, so so. \u201c.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s put aside the jokes.</p><br/><p>In Ranaa, from Northwest till Southeast, a huge area was taken up by [Demon Forest]. What was [Demon Forest]? It was as it was, an area where mana gushed out, causing many strong demons to be born.</p><br/><p>Strong merchants from Dyuvu were the only ones who were trading between all 4 countries.</p><br/><p>\u2026I could not help but be in awe of the nature of merchants\u2026</p><br/><p>This nature could be said to be the only common feature between all sorts of worlds!</p><br/><p>To add on, Elzmu lay in between the [Demon Forest]. [Demon forest], Elzmu, [Demon Forest] of the East. Actually, the Fruit of the East together with the [Demon Forest] was said to be under Elzmu, but then natives who lived there became defiant and started calling themselves a country. And the founder and the First Emperor was actually the soldier who cleared the lands.</p><br/><p>\u2026How un-royal-like. Maybe it was because of this history that the royalty were very close to the people.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hmm, you passed. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was grumbling a bit about how weird my method was to memorize but as long as it worked!</p><br/><p>\u201d By the way, John-sensei. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was changing the subject because of that! Not because I wanted to gloss over this!</p><br/><p>\u201d What is it? \u201d</p><br/><p>Damn! Don\u2019t look at me with those teasing eyes!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t smile at me with that lovely face!</p><br/><p>This \u2018S\u2019 bastard! \u2026.Whatever. It was true that I really had something to ask. Let\u2019s just resign to this fact and keep these comments inside.</p><br/><p>\u201d Previously there was a chart of Nobles you asked me to memorize but till now you haven\u2019t taught me anything regarding the court ranks yet. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah. The changes in his facial expression did not escape my eyes! This guy, he had forgotten about it, hadn\u2019t he.</p><br/><p>Immediately, his expression returned to normal and he pretended that all was well.</p><br/><p>\u201d I planned on teaching it today. \u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Is that so? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.I finally won one over him. It had been so long. I got a bit cocky\u2026Hm\u2026? Why was it kinda cold\u2026?</p><br/><p>And then I noticed it. John-sensei\u2019s sharp stare.</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I was sorry.</p><br/><p>I was too easy to defeat. No. It was only something really scary would happen if I continued, not because I was scared!</p><br/><p>It was that, that thing, where I needed to protect the pride of Sensei\u2026Heck, who was I explaining to anyway?</p><br/><p>With a stiff smile\u2026no, a cramped smile, I looked up at Sensei. Come now, please start teaching.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Can\u2019t be helped. Let us start. \u201d</p><br/><p>What \u2018can\u2019t be helped\u2019? It was you who forgot about it! \u2026.This could never be spoken out loud.</p><br/><p>But the instant I was thinking about it, I was stared at.</p><br/><p>\u2026He found out.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Yes please. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d For Elzmu, you know about this, there are Nobles, Knights and Commoners. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Court ranks are the positions between the Nobles. There is a system of [6 Rank], from the top, Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, Baron, Baronet. The top 5 usually are of old noble families. What do you think Baronet is? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm\u2026For people who made a great contribution to the country\u2026something like that? \u201d</p><br/><p>The light novels I read in my previous world all had setting like this.</p><br/><p>\u201d Exactly. I am surprised you know. Depending on their contributions thereon after, they may become a Baron. If they start out as a Noble, without any contributions, the rank will only last for a generation. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, as expected. I gave a small nod.</p><br/><p>\u201d By the way, Will\u2019s family, the Beryl\u2019s, is of the highest order of being a Duke, and is one of the oldest families around. Maybe friends of the Founder. \u201d</p><br/><p>I learned something new.</p><br/><p>I thought they were soldiers of the Royalty or something but they turned out to be more awesome than I thought. As astounded as I was, somehow, I accepted it. So Father\u2019s [cheats] came from his blood.</p><br/><p>\u201d Just to say, Veltor House is one of the old families as well. You can understand why they are always a Viscount no matter how much time has passed\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.Erk.</p><br/><p>Woah, dark. Your aura was turning black, John-sensei.</p><br/><p>\u201d The current Emperor is one with an outstanding ability even among history. He is currently looking for a way to clean out all rotten garbage lurking in this system. I really hope he can get it done soon. \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei, who narrowed his eyes, looked beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..Though very very scary.</p><br/><p>As I sat timidly, listening, John-sensei went</p><br/><p>\u201d Anyways, that\u2019s confidential information from the royal court. \u201d</p><br/><p>He said in a small voice, coughing to clear his throat. But I heard it. Oi, this was scary. You were scary. What were you anyway!?</p><br/><p>\u201d I am just someone who really wishes to participate in that. \u201d</p><br/><p>Father seemed to be active in it as well\u2026.</p><br/><p>I thought back to all the documents in Father\u2019s office and finally understood.</p><br/><p>\u2026Hm\u2026 He must be a detective or something!</p><br/><p>Sensei lifted his bag, smiling, holding high hopes.</p><br/><p>I had a bad feeling about this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d And so, for that, let\u2019s study diligently from now on. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the end it\u2019s still that\u2026!!!</p><br/><p>Today, I had a feeling I learned something important.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>Father [Ah, John, how are the lessons coming along?]</p><br/><p>John [Master, we just finished the level of court examinations.]</p><br/><p>Father [Oh, as expected from Will\u2026..eh? What?]</p><br/><p>John [Court examination level.]</p><br/><p>Father [\u2026..For real?]</p><br/><p>John [For real.]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

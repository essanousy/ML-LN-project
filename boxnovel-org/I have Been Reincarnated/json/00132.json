Yes, it\u2019s actually summer now in Japan. So humid. So hot. A total match with what I\u2019m translating right now.</p><br/><p>What would pop into your mind when you heard \u2018Summer Events\u2019?</p><br/><p>Fireworks, Summer Matsuri, Pool. [TN: Natsu Matsuri, Summer Festival]</p><br/><p>Aah.</p><br/><p>No matter which, they all shined brightly as wonderful events like how jewels in a treasure box would, after being hit by the sunlight.</p><br/><p>Yes..! \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015That was if you had a partner!!</p><br/><p>Fu ha ha ha ha ha! All you unpopular guys! You understand, don\u2019t you? Those couples whose smiles even outshined the fireworks in a firework event. You thought you would be having fun with your friends at a matsuri but you would find your mental strength wearing down by all the couples surrounding you. And might find yourself having a new weakness after heading to the pool and getting blinded by all the couples lovey-doveying together.</p><br/><p>Yes, summer events were all meant for couples. Truly horrifying. That was how it felt like to me anyway. That unpopular guy comment above was actually pointing right at the previous-life me.</p><br/><p>That was why, I would only admit watermelon smashing as a summer event.</p><br/><p>\u201d Watermelon\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Smashing? \u201d</p><br/><p>Both Zen and Selphy tilted their head. The watermelon (suika) I was talking about was not the contactless smart card Suica. It would be a tragedy if that broke\u2026 Eh, that joke would not get through in this world I guess\u2026</p><br/><p>Since we had time after dinner, I invited the both of them to play and we ended up in the garden. Although I said garden but remember, this was a highly secretive place. Although our garden meant entire hill, we had no access to most places.</p><br/><p>As if guarding against the visitors or protecting me.</p><br/><p>Plus, my idiots parents were worried about a variety of things and we were only allowed to head towards a spot where they could see us from the window.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep. Watermelons are a kind of fruit\u2026 Well, vegetables actually but it tastes really sweet, just like a fruit. And the game was to correctly smash it! \u201d</p><br/><p>I said proudly.</p><br/><p>Smashing watermelons were the best!</p><br/><p>Why? Because no matter the popular meter, it\u2019s an event where everyone would have fun! And it would taste even sweeter when you get to eat the watermelon you smashed.</p><br/><p>Also because this event was at the top of my list I made in case I had friends coming over to play.</p><br/><p>\u201d Huh\u2026..? Is it fun to smash it? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen asked, his face puzzled.</p><br/><p>Well\u2026. simply smashing it might be fun I guess. Like how people love bursting bubble wraps for hours. As there were nothing similar in this world, I understand their bewilderment.</p><br/><p>But I am a man who was prepared.</p><br/><p>Grinning, I pulled something out of my pocket.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ta-dah~! B l i n d f o l d! \u201d</p><br/><p>Like a certain blue robotic cat pulling something out of it\u2019s pouch, it was long piece of white cloth that would be used to cover one\u2019s eyes. I used my superb sewing skills to made it. Hehehe.</p><br/><p>Okay, I\u2019m lying. All that was needed to be done was to simply cut the shape out.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm, why do we need a blindfold? \u201d</p><br/><p>Asked Selphy. Me, in an exuberant mood, sneaked up from behind Zen and blindfolded him while he was still surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yosh\u2026 The person whose eyes are blindfolded will now attempted to smash the watermelon while the people around him will be giving instructions. That\u2019s how the game is played. \u201d</p><br/><p>I spread a sheet on the ground as I explained the rules to Zen and Selphy. After knowing the rules, Selphy\u2019s eyes shined.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sounds fun! \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy exclaimed as she got excited. On the contrary, Zen was panicking by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201d I, I\u2019m the one who do it?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe he was trying to protested to me but with his eyes blindfolded, Zen had moved towards a totally different direction as he yelled into the distance. To tell the truth, it was amusing. I grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well, because it\u2019s amusing. Let us get this started! \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I took a bat out of my magic space dimension and handed it over to Zen.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: So we have already reached 120 chapters. Phew. It felt like I started translating not too long ago.</p><br/><p>And yes, I heard of this. It\u2019s the same idea as pinata, only with food. I like my watermelon cut though, thanks.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If you prefer to ready the main story, please ignore this as it would only be a recount in Miso-kun\u2019s POV.</p><br/><p>Just to let you know, there will be another digest chapter after this before I get started on the next arc.</p><br/><p>And so sorry for delaying this for a day as I was hit by a combo of fever, flu and cough. And it seemed to be getting worse. orz\u2026</p><br/><p>Changed Williams to William as Christopher Williams had commented. Thanks for that!</p><br/><p>Before I noticed it, it was morning. I seemed to have entered the dormitory without realizing it. I could vaguely remember \u2018Kiro\u2019, the dorm leader, leading me into a room\u2026</p><br/><p>It appeared that this was going to be my room. Remi, my room mate, had told me that I would have to go to the cafeteria if I wanted breakfast. Reflexively, I gave my thanks. What a blunder! I think Father once said that a noble should not lower their head easily.</p><br/><p>After breakfast, I was dragged into the classroom by Remi and his friends. Why were they not lost in this maze of an academy? I wanted to go back to my room to retrieve the map I had forgotten and was guided by Remi, who did not even use one.</p><br/><p>But the way of pulling my wrist along was\u2026.. Ah, it can\u2019t be helped since commoners did not know about etiquette.</p><br/><p>\u2026Wait\u2026 I had a feeling I broke etiquette too\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2026.That\u2019s right! I did an outrageous thing to the son of a Duke\u2019s family! It was at this point when I finally remembered all that I had done.</p><br/><p>I had not even apologized.. What should I do?!</p><br/><p>As I was about to leave my seat in the classroom, Prof.Zelda entered the classroom, banging open the door. I lost my timing to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201d Good Morning! Well then, today would be the body checks I mentioned yesterday! Follow me! I had forgotten to mention, apart from the measurement of body weight, there would be a measurement of mana as well. \u201d</p><br/><p>And the classroom was drowned in cheers and moans. We then, as a group, walked down the corridor. Being blocked by a wall of classmates, I did not get to see off the child with silver hair \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 William Beryl, who went out first.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I had been looking forward the the mana examination even before school start. I was lucky to have an above-average talent in swordsmanship but if I were to have a high amount of mana as well, I would be able to do anything. Like \u300a\u300bmagic. [TN: Karada shintai, Body strengthening] I could defeat all the demon beasts and get praised by Father! That\u2019s why I was looking forward to it. Though I was feeling slightly uneasy as well.</p><br/><p>But now was not the time. I still had not apologized to William Beryl-sama yet. But what should I apologize? How do I apologize?</p><br/><p>William-sama seemed not to mind me one bit as he spoke with the curly-haired kid happily. As he did not introduce himself with his family name, our classmates may not know that he was a noble.</p><br/><p>But why?</p><br/><p>Even if I could not understand his reason for doing that, it would still be better to apologize to him first.</p><br/><p>As I worried about that matter, my mana examination was over. I had 20points above the average of 50, bringing it to 70 but now was not the time. When should I apologize?</p><br/><p>How to do it? Where to do it?</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026 In that case, what about Father\u2019s words? What did he mean?</p><br/><p>\u201d We are not commoners but the lord who governs over them\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Never forget this \u201c</p><br/><p>He gave that advice to me while patting my head, before I set off. It should mean that even if we were only a country-side noble, we should not be looked down upon by the commoners in the academy. I should stand on the ruling side and face them with a firm attitude.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 that\u2026! Father did not teach me how to handle nobles that were of a higher rank!</p><br/><p>But Father had always said \u2018When you are apologizing, know and understand the reason as to why and with an attitude of wanting to change, truly apologize from your heart.\u2019. But I didn\u2019t even know the reason and how I could change! I would only be doing a \u2018pose\u2019 if I were to apologize like this. I am surely going to get a harsh scolding from Father.</p><br/><p>Our family had only just gotten our position back and to think I did something like that to a Duke family!</p><br/><p>As I worried endlessly, it was William Beryl-sama\u2019s turn. He looked afraid of the mana measuring tool. As he timidly reached for the magical tool and his fingers brushed against it\u2026.</p><br/><p>There was an accident!</p><br/><p>In that instant, the tool exploded into tiny pieces! Surprised, William-sama fell onto his backside and his honorable hand was bleeding!</p><br/><p>\u201d I am going to bring Will over to the infirmary! The rest of you just wait here silently, okay! \u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving only that to the panicking class, Prof.Zelda brought William-sama out.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>In the end, William-sama did not return to the class for the rest of the day and I missed my timing to apologize again.</p><br/><p>I knew I had to apologize but as time dragged on, questions started swelling within me.</p><br/><p>What was the meaning of Father\u2019s words?</p><br/><p>Father was amazing but William-sama\u2019s father, Gion-sama was amazing too. That person must have also passed his words down to Willliam-sama before he left for the academy. But what was the behavior William-sama put on before the commoners? There must be a meaning to it.</p><br/><p>Father, please teach me how to handle people with a class above me!</p><br/><p>I feel like shouting with all the questions swirling inside. Even I know I cannot go on like this. Before I knew it, I had stopped walking and started running.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I knocked. My breathing was erratic and all over the place from running but I didn\u2019t care about that right now. After a while, the door opened. And the one who appeared was William-sama.</p><br/><p>He, with his beautiful silver hair that was slightly messy, had a confused look on his face. He had every right to be. He could not have expected a fool would visit him at his room after going through that accident yesterday.</p><br/><p>When apologizing, one would have to understand the reason for doing that, truly reflected on it, as well as to improve on that mistake.</p><br/><p>Me, not knowing what to do, decided to visit William-sama. I was disappointed at myself.</p><br/><p>\u201d Please excuse me for visiting suddenly. Could you spare me some time? \u201d</p><br/><p>I stabilized my breathing and asked. William-sama did not get angry by my sudden visit but instead welcome me inside his room. When I entered, I saw the curly-haired commoner looking at me, shocked. I shifted my sight to a nook on the floor. So he was William-sama\u2019s room mate.</p><br/><p>Resolving myself, I told William-sama everything. Even if I thought this was foolish, I would rather ask William-sama directly instead of confusing myself.</p><br/><p>I told him how my father\u2019s words and how his action were confusing me.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..and that\u2019s it. \u201d</p><br/><p>William-sama, showing not even one repulse expression, listened to me quietly till the end. What a kind person. And then, he nodded slightly and opened his mouth. That action looked just like what Father always did that I instinctively curled myself up and looked at him with respect. He had an adult-like presence.</p><br/><p>\u201d Did your father really say that? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d He did! \u2026..I think. \u201d</p><br/><p>Questioned by William-sama, I suddenly got insecure about what I remembered and added that last part to my answer. With all the uneasiness pilling up inside of me, I can\u2019t help but asked William-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm\u2026.Williams-sama, why did you do all that..? \u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at me and smiled. I stared dumbly at that angel-like smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d That was because I did nothing. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Huh? \u201d</p><br/><p>The answer was so unexpected that I responded in an impolite tone. At this me, William-sama smiled wryly.</p><br/><p>\u201d Which mean, I had not yet done anything to support our people. The only amazing thing about me was my luck for being born into this house. Which was why, as I said before, in this academy, we are only students. Why would I go around acting superior when I am not doing anything? \u201d</p><br/><p>It was like I was struck by thunder by the smiling William-sama words.</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>I had only focused on Father\u2019s \u2018We are not commoners but the lord who govern over them.\u2019 word \u2018govern\u2019. But the sentence was not about that.</p><br/><p>It was as William-sama had said. I see, I finally got it now. But what was the true meaning that Father wanted to convey to me? We were the ones being supported by the commoners so I should revere them? I had no idea what that last sentence meant.</p><br/><p>\u201d Is there any communication tool in your house? \u201d</p><br/><p>I must have an extremely confused expression because William-sama laughed and pulled out a magical tool and opened it.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>My son, who was currently in the academy, contacted me.</p><br/><p>Within the communication tool \u2015\u2015 our house was a version which can send and receive letters \u2015\u2015 had a letter from my son addressed to me, surprising me. Being in-charge of the defense of the border, it was important that we, the Sociunnov Family, can communicate easily with the capital.</p><br/><p>According to the letter, it was sent borrowing a simple communication tool from a friend but this kind of tool was not something a student usually has. Maybe they had created a small mobile one which students can bring about. I would need to check this information with the capital, I thought to myself as I continued reading the letter.</p><br/><p>[ I cannot understand the meaning of Father\u2019s words. \u201d We are not commoners but the lord who govern over them\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Never forget this. \u201d What does it actually mean? ]</p><br/><p>Reading that, I buried my head in my hands. My son was a straight and frank person but he was a little\u2026. no, too frank.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sigh\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Letting out a deep sign, I began writing the reply to my son.</p><br/><p>[My dear son. What I said was \u2018 We are not commoners but the lord who govern over them. Which means, we are fed by them in exchanged of us governing over them. Never forget this.\u2019 \u2026\u2026Apart from that, was a new model of communication tool released in the capital? I had never seen any tool that could correspondence without registering first\u2026..]</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: The truth was that Will can\u2019t escape his commoner\u2019s root from his previous world.</p><br/><p>TN: Everyone who wanted to know Miso-kun\u2019s father reply now have their answer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

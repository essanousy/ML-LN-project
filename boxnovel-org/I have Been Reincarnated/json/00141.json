Sorry for the late releases!</p><br/><p>3 days after meeting the weird little boy.</p><br/><p>After returning from the usual sales rounds outside, Gurus was puzzled as to why the office was stirring up with sounds of people talking when the office was usually empty.</p><br/><p>In this company, aside from Gurus, the rest of the workers were all fireworks craftsmen, ones who truly take pride in their work so you would hardly see them hanging around the office when they could secluded themselves at the workshop.</p><br/><p>And from the usually lonely office where Gurus stayed by himself, voices were heard. This was clearly abnormal. He wondered what was the matter. Did they had a burglary or something\u2026. No, there was nothing in the office to steal from. Ah, reality sure was harsh.</p><br/><p>But, what then?</p><br/><p>Gurus then ran towards the door in a bid to reached the office sooner and when he got close, he heard laughter coming from within. That eased his pounding heart. Despite knowing there was nothing of worth in the office, Gurus still felt a tiny bit of uneasiness.</p><br/><p>\u201d I have returned\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>He said, in a tiny voice that could just slipped past your ears if one\u2019s not paying any attention, Gurus opened his eyes wide when he saw the person inside the office.</p><br/><p>\u201d The boy\u2026 from before..!? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, it was the young boy who said he would be coming back 3 days ago. And the person chatting with him was none other than the boss of this company, as well as the top fireworks craftsman, Master Bran. And on top of that, there was a very tough-looking bear beastman standing behind the young boy.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh! Gurus, you\u2019ve finally back! \u201d</p><br/><p>Master Bran said, realizing the Gurus\u2019s presence immediately as he was sitting facing the door.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ye, yes! Erm\u2026 Ah, welcome. \u201d</p><br/><p>Bewildered by the sight in front of him, Gurus tried pulling himself together and greeted the young boy. The young boy then stood, unfazed, and slowly turned towards Gurus. Just that turn alone looked elegant to Gurus who came from the countryside. Gurus felt like he lost even though he went though training in terms on how to hold himself better for the sake of being a salesman. But now was not the time for him to be distracted by these useless thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201d Nice to see you again, Gurus-sama. \u201d</p><br/><p>The gentle smile from the boy was oozing elegance. Gurus really wondered which company did this little apprentice came from. Realizing the scale of company, cold sweat started dripping down Gurus\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201d Nice to meet you. You came back. \u201d</p><br/><p>Without thinking, Gurus\u2019s tone turned polite and as if noticing the changes, the boy\u2019s smile deepened.</p><br/><p>\u201d I brought along a way to prove my identity. Once again.. \u201d</p><br/><p>The boy bowed elegantly. Gurus unconsciously did a little nod in response to the bow.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026let me introduce myself. I am in charged of managing the B-grade gourmet food company, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>Gurus froze.</p><br/><p>\u201d And this here.. \u201d</p><br/><p>The boy moved aside and the bear beastman who was standing behind him came into Gurus\u2019s sight. Meeting the boy\u2019s eyes, the bear beastman did a bow too.</p><br/><p>\u201d My name is Buhual, and I am the chairman of the company. \u201d</p><br/><p>The beastman then proceeded to take out a guild card from his breast pocket. And on it, Buhual\u2019s name as well as his company was written clearly on it.</p><br/><p>Description on a guild card was created by divine power and it can\u2019t be forged. Therefore, the company written on it was\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201d Kuma Neko Private Limited\u2026?!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Kuma = bear, Neko = cat, I\u2019m pretty sure everyone knows this by now. Bear Cat company just doesn\u2019t sound as good\u2026]</p><br/><p>Gurus exclaimed once he laid his eyes on the card.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>[Kuma Neko Private Limited] was a company dealing in foodstuff that suddenly stood out 3 years ago. Now, they were one of the major companies around and was said to had brought about a new revolution in terms of food.</p><br/><p>It was to the extend that every citizen in Elzmu knew about [Kuma Neko Private Limited]. It was because they were famous for causing chaos whenever their food cart rolled out that needed the use of the Knights in helping to stabilized the situation. And recently, there were rumors of a new shop opening too.</p><br/><p>So how could Gurus not know about them? He had queued up for their food several times while thinking they were someone he could never get closed to in his lifetime. B-grade gourmet food\u2026 it\u2019s too delicious. And his favorite among all was a dish called [Yakisoba].</p><br/><p>Enough about him.</p><br/><p>The problem right now was, that famous company, [Kuma Neko Private Limited]\u2019s chairman was standing right in front of him. And his face grew pale when he saw the seating arrangements.</p><br/><p>\u201d Master Bran\u2026!! Why did you not let our precious customer have a seat?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Gurus was despairing to the point of almost shrieking it out. Every customer was of great importance! Plus, the beastman standing right in front of him had the power of crushing this small company with just a finger. No one could blamed Gurus for panicking.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ha ha ha! Relax, Gurus, I did offer a seat but he firmly declined. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wh, why?? \u201d</p><br/><p>Bran said, laughing at the sight of the panicking Gurus. And that question was answered by the chairman himself.</p><br/><p>\u201d Because I\u2019m only here to observe this time. \u201d</p><br/><p>The slow and steady tone of his calmed Gurus down. And at the same time, it allowed him to digested his words.</p><br/><p>\u201d Observe\u2026.? \u201d</p><br/><p>And another question popped out of Gurus\u2019s mouth. Realizing it this time, He quickly held his mouth. As a salesman, it was not his place to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s right. \u201d</p><br/><p>The chairman nodded happily, not minding it at all.</p><br/><p>Gurus could not understand. Wasn\u2019t the boy someone hired by the company? To be heading the negotiations instead of the chairman of the company was indeed very weird. It looked just like\u2026 the boy was of a higher position than the chairman.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then. I\u2019m sorry for causing all the confusion but may I explain the new business plan I had in mind? \u201d</p><br/><p>The boy said with an amused expression and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Fireworks sure is beautiful, aren\u2019t they? \u201d</p><br/><p>The stunned Gurus was brought out of his thought by that phrase. After all, he entered into this industry because of his love for fireworks. He looked up, his hands slowly tightening into fists.</p><br/><p>\u201d I had seen them in various parties. \u201d</p><br/><p>If Gurus said nothing when the talk had progressed till this, he would failed both as a sales man as well as a lover of fireworks.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes! That intensity and beauty! They shined brightly even without magic so they would most definitely add color to your party! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s it! \u201d</p><br/><p>The young boy cut into Gurus\u2019s sentence. Gurus had no idea what was it. Had he said something wrong? As Gurus\u2019s heart pounded, the young boy stood up happily and pointed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Why did fireworks need to be a embellishment? Let\u2019s make them into the star of a event! \u201d</p><br/><p>A shock ran though Gurus\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

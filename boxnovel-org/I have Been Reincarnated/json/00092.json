How frank, are you turning homosexual? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco said, alighting from the horse carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Eh? \u201d</p><br/><p>Willia\u2026.no, Will was in the carriage with Mr.Bear, discussing something. This came when Ivan was blankly staring at the starry sky. The soft and gentle smile of Jill Stuart was nowhere to be seen on the emotionless face. For a moment, unable to process, Ivan stared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201d Is Ivan-dono turning homo- \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d No! Wait a minute! What are you mistaken about?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Ivan cut into the sentence Jill Stuart was repeating to him, thinking he hadn\u2019t heard it. He can\u2019t overlook this. He had somehow heard something outrageous. Ho\u2026. Homosexual\u2026. ? How rude.</p><br/><p>\u201d I think I still love woman very much. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Please face reality. \u201d</p><br/><p>Harsh words were given back to Ivan. He knew that in reality, there was no one who could accept him loving a young child. But still, he can\u2019t ignore his feelings. What he loves was what he loves.</p><br/><p>\u201d Even if the inner was an adult (ghost), I still can\u2019t give up. \u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, Ivan did not have the determination to hit Willia but one day, he would do it. Until then, he was not going to give up.</p><br/><p>\u201d What about you, Jill Stuart-san? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco gave a puzzled face to the smiling Ivan.</p><br/><p>\u201d What are you talking about, Ivan-dono? What ghost? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, that. Willia-chan is possessed by a ghost. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Hah? \u201d</p><br/><p>For a brief period, the 2 of them stared at each other, stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201d As I said, the spirit of the noble called Will\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d No, Will-dono has always been Will-dono. He cross-dressed as Willia in order to conceal his identity. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Stop lying. I understand how you feel as a father but no matter how I look, Willia-chan is only 5, 6 years old. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.That is true.. \u201d</p><br/><p>It was actually 8 years old. Zirco conceded on this fact. If Will heard this, he could definitely cry. It was lucky he was not around to hear this conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201d Can a 6 year old act and speak like that? There\u2019s no way! I don\u2019t even use honorific speech. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Urgh. \u201d</p><br/><p>There was nothing Zirco could argue against. It was true that commonly, a child can\u2019t do it. He knew Will personally, and knew that he acted like this originally but if not, he would not have believed it either. In truth, he had doubts when the respected Kesamu-sama told him about it.</p><br/><p>Somehow, this had turned really troublesome.</p><br/><p>Can he convince the guy, who had fallen in love, in front of him? They would be together since he was hired. Whether if he liked it or not, Ivan could most likely come to realize it. Zirco gave up quickly on this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201d I will save Willia-chan. I can\u2019t stand to hit her now but one day\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Glancing at Ivan, who was speaking enthusiastically, Zirco let out a deep sigh. The emotionless eyes were tinged with tiredness.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Going to the Adventure Guild will prove helpful for the possessed. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d In that case, let\u2019s go! \u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ivan, whose eyes were sparkling, Zirco nodded emotionlessly. He knew the [Shadows] would come attacking and Ivan would prove to be a help so there were no loss.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Sigh\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>But at least he was allowed to sigh, he thought as he turned it towards Elzmu, his hometown, that was far far away.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>The horses went \u2018clop clop\u2019 as they walked down the road, pulling the carriage along, I was, as usual, floating above my seat. It was early morning, when the sun had just risen. The refreshing air was calming.</p><br/><p>With a \u2018wow\u2019 name like Foir Centeru Street, its streets cannot be even called as one, as it was simply hardened soil. Since the carriage had gone over it, the \u2018animal trail\u2019 should be renamed as \u2018horse carriage trail\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2026..That was wrong?</p><br/><p>Ah, whatever.</p><br/><p>[TN: Ha, the tone shift whenever it\u2019s Will\u2019s POV]</p><br/><p>Instead of that, yesterday, when I was discussing the employment terms of Ivan-san with Buu-san, Zirco-san and Ivan-san was getting along quite well and were currently whispering behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.I knew it is a ghost! She is floating! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.I know, since you had been repeating it. Once we reach the Center, we will head towards the guild, is that fine? \u201d</p><br/><p>I had no idea what they were talking about but it seemed like they had business with the guild after reaching the Center. But there were many kinds of guilds.</p><br/><p>The standard of the Otherworld, starting with the Adventure Guild, Merchant Guild, Craft Guild, etc etc. And, even though it was only a rumor, in our country, Elzmu, there seemed to be a fan club which was called \u2018Guild\u2019.</p><br/><p>I heard it from Selphy\u2026. but it seemed that to the same even for this Otherworld. Fan clubs exist everywhere, can be made by anyone, even in Phillis Academy. I was not in the wrong to want to retort that it can be called a \u2018Fan Club Guild\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201d What guild? \u201d</p><br/><p>It was the fault of the 2 whispering but since I had heard it, there was no other way. Since it was not nice to eavesdrop, it would be the best to come out in the open and asked about it.</p><br/><p>As I thought, Ivan-san jumped in surprised as Zirco-san had an expressionless face, as usual, as he replied. By the way, Ivan-san. You were that tortured by muscle pain yesterday but today, it was already healed, seeing you moved so lively. Youth sure was great.</p><br/><p>\u201d The Adventure Guild. Since Ivan-dono has not registered, we are thinking of doing it as a proof of his identification. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, he exchanged looks with Ivan-san. Hm. Somehow there was an aura of tiredness from his face even though he was as expressionless as usual\u2026. Must be my imagination. Anyway it was most probably something to do with Ivan-san.</p><br/><p>\u201d I see. I haven\u2019t been to one before too, is it alright not to register as well? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d We have identification papers from Elzmu as Jill Stuart so there is no problem. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, that legal fake passport.</p><br/><p>I, who was a little lost at what to reply, gave a \u2018That\u2019s good\u2019 before flying out of the window at the back and onto the roof of the carriage.</p><br/><p>It was cloudless as usual with the never ending road. Hm, how otherworldly.</p><br/><p>One of the standard plots for Otherworld was to encounter bandits and I wondered if I would too as I looked at the sky while I floated.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026.!? \u201d</p><br/><p>Something seemed to be flying.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ehhhhhhhh!?!!? \u201d</p><br/><p>A tako was flying in the sky. [TN: Tako = octopus]</p><br/><p>Wiggling its tentacles, it was flying in the sky. I heard that Ajipo was often caught by Sea Birds\u2026..</p><br/><p>The generally peaceful trip continued.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d We are here! Center! \u201d</p><br/><p>I yelled as I spread my hands wide, causing people around me to laugh. The gatekeeper was laughing as well. His fleeting glance caught my eyes and our gaze met. Since that was embarrassing, I hid behind Zirco-san\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201d Identification please. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Sure. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco-san took the identification papers out from his pocket.</p><br/><p>\u201d Jill Stuart from Elzmu Country and\u2026eh, the one behind you is? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s my daughter, Willia and the other person and the Beastmen are our guards. We are on a trip this time. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I see. I\u2019ll collect the entrance fee then. 4 person would be 40 rook. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Okay. \u201d</p><br/><p>As he had prepared it beforehand, Zirco-san immediately passed 4 pieces of silver to the soldier. Little info, in Hattuo, 1 rook was a copper coin, 10 rook was a silver coin while 100 rook was a gold coin. I heard that 1 rook was about \u00a5100. I hadn\u2019t said it but Elzmu\u2019s money unit was in Yan. Just 1 word difference from Yen. Very easy to understand. As expected of the First Founder.</p><br/><p>\u201d Welcome to Center~ \u201d</p><br/><p>Somehow the gatekeeper seemed frivolous. He was messing around and laughing as he gave a sidelong glance at Zirco-san as we walked into the streets.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Hm. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco-san mumbled as we crossed over the gate and into the streets.</p><br/><p>Central streets felt a lot more urban then Flowason. The stone paving was as beautiful as ever, however, it did not feel like it was flourishing.</p><br/><p>It was the afternoon of the 2nd day since we set off from Flowason.</p><br/><p>It only took 3 days from Elzmu to Hattuo and yet it needed 2 days from city to city here. Once again, I came to realize how big Hattuo was.</p><br/><p>\u201d For the time being, let us find an inn first, shall we?</p><br/><p>We nodded at Zirco-san\u2019s words and we cut through the central street.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: This is confusing. Okay. The capital of Hattuo = Center, a name. And there are central streets in Center.</p><br/><p>Yep, I did well explaining.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

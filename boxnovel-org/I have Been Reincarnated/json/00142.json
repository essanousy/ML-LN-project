Brain\u2019s burning up. Now my quota for the last week is met!</p><br/><p>\u201d To produced such a detailed plan to raise a revolution in the fireworks industry and even to produced such a matsuri to go along with and moreover in planning to make it known worldwide!! Will-Sama is really our savior!! \u201d</p><br/><p>During the time Father was talking with the fireworks craftsmen, we took a walk around the vicinity. And when the talks ended, Gurus, whose eyes were sparkling, suddenly broke into a fervent speech about how we made my plans came true.</p><br/><p>Why the sudden torture?</p><br/><p>This was embarrassing.</p><br/><p>On top of that pure goodwill in telling, was the pure praises towards me, just made it all the more unbearable. To be more precise, the glittering eyes of Zen, Chiffon and Selphy during the entire speech.</p><br/><p>My face must be burning red right now. I really feel like digging a hole and burying myself.</p><br/><p>Anyway, this fireworks show was also made as a plan to create a new business opportunity for the merchants. Leaving aside my evil personal goals.</p><br/><p>To push matusri happening throughout the country and also to implement the image of eating b-grade gourmet food during matsuri. It was also a time where people would released their stress and play to their fill during the matsuri. If this plan came through, it would be our win. A totally new market would open.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the matsuri in this world in totally different from the matsuri on earth. Well, one could say they were closer to what resembled a countryside matsuri. There was a need to have an attraction like how the portable shrine would be carried throughout the street during a matsuri. To create the same atmosphere, a huge pan would be used to made food for the masses and also be used as an attraction to gather people around.</p><br/><p>Of course, the main point was not about the food but to created that kind of atmosphere. I wanted to implement the image of a matsuri was to have fun and to relax, to enjoy eating and the beautiful fireworks. If it could be done, that it would definitely yield a profit.</p><br/><p>But it was all still in planning stages. This time, the only investor was me. Buu-san was only helping in rolling out his food cart during this event.</p><br/><p>But in reality, I only really wanted to hold a matsuri.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will\u2019s awesome\u2026!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen directed his glittering eyes towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201d As expected of Will! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Of course, it\u2019s Will-Sama! \u201d</p><br/><p>Chiffon and Selphy looked at me with moist eyes.</p><br/><p>Ahh, I really only could answered them by turning my flushing red face away from them.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>And so, all of us returned to the mansion. At the last minute, Father and Gurus-san got into a frightening mutual understanding. Really, what made them so riled up about?</p><br/><p>Oh, shut up, I\u2019m not really asking, idiot.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s about time for the fireworks show. \u201d</p><br/><p>I said to the 2 of them as I pointed to my watch. A sheet was laid out in our garden and on it, table and chairs were brought out. Ta-dah, a VIP seating area was made easily.</p><br/><p>The 3 of us were sitting as we elegantly sipped on tea while waiting for the show to start. And a little further away sat my parents. The lovey-dovey aura around them were thick.</p><br/><p>Eh, this was weird. I was supposed to create a matsuri for friends to hang out. So what was my flirting, reality explode, parents were doing right now?</p><br/><p>But really, it was quite difficult to hold any negative feeling towards my parents. How should I said it\u2026 They looked really happy..</p><br/><p>A, ah, I did not, for a moment, thought that it would be alright to made it into an event for married couples to expressed their love to each other as a way of filial piety! No, not me!</p><br/><p>When I averted my eyes from my flirting parents, I saw Chiffon standing there, smiling. Although I don\u2019t really like it, but Chiffon had a position as my attendant so she would had to behaved like one, standing behind. When our eyes met, she smiled happily.</p><br/><p>Influenced by her smile, I too, felt the corners of my lips raising up.</p><br/><p>When I first caught her as a [Shadow], Chiffon had eyes that were dead. But when she decided on the goal to became my private attendant, as time when on, her expressions grew varied.</p><br/><p>And now, she was able to smiled like that. Her smile really struck me deeply. It was like looking at how your sister slowly grew up. Chiffon, Onii-san was really glad for you.</p><br/><p>Ah, although I still wondered if it was alright for her to aim to become my attendant. On top of my plainly average face, I used to be rather reserved and hesitant as a child. Defiantly not someone who would do great things in the future.</p><br/><p>But that was where I needed to improved upon. That\u2019s my homework. Because that was what I wanted to be.</p><br/><p>\u201d Mou.. \u201d</p><br/><p>And it ended up with me and Chiffon staring at each other for a while as those thoughts went through my mind. Seeing that, Selphy let out a disgruntled voice.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm? What is it, Selphy? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s that. Th, this matsuri is supposed to be an event where friends have fun together, isn\u2019t it? \u201d</p><br/><p>I see.</p><br/><p>My shoulders drooped down.</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019m sorry. \u201d</p><br/><p>I apologized. What was I doing, staring at my attendant? Reflect, reflect.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s okay if you realized it. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Never mind that, look at the streets! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen continued from the tsundere comment from Selphy. Although the subject was changed abruptly, I totally welcomed it right now. If Zen had did it on purposed, he sure was a good friend.</p><br/><p>I lowered my eyes to where the streets were. What I saw was a scene much more beautiful and filled with a sense of fun than I initially thought. The streets were lit up beautifully and thanks to Maria\u2019s father who helped in contacting other merchants, games stalls such as a shooting both, were set up too.</p><br/><p>This was another world. Other that those big cities, other streets were usually dark and quiet once night falls, unlike Japan where street lamps lined up along the roads.</p><br/><p>And today, among all the streets, Beryl\u2019s streets were glittering and shining brightly. Apart from the lanterns, the lights from the food carts and stores were adding on to the overall brightness. To be able to see all of the street, this was indeed a VIP seat.</p><br/><p>And as if cementing that fact, Zen and Selphy had been watching happily at the scene since Zen pointed it out.</p><br/><p>Ah, as for John-Sensei, he said that he preferred to stay behind at the other hill and happily mixed in with the fireworks craftsmen. In the end, the stem of researching ran it\u2019s roots deep in John-Sensei.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ladies annnnnnnd Gentlemannnnnnnnn! \u201c</p><br/><p>And as we were looking down on the street, the lights went out and a huge echo-y voice ran through the Beryl\u2019s street. Zen and Selphy jumped, surprised by the sudden appearance of the voice. As for me, I can\u2019t helped but grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201d Thank you for waiting! The very first year of the Beryl\u2019s Fireworks Show has began! \u201d</p><br/><p>I had prepared for so long just for this moment. I am going to enjoy every bit of of it.</p><br/><p>And as the 2 were recovering from their surprise, the first shot of fireworks burst brightly in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

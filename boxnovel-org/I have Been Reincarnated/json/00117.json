And at that exact moment, the one who dived into the pool was no other than our Mi-sama.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yosh! \u201d</p><br/><p>I did a tiny pump of my fist. It wouldn\u2019t be good to be a bother to others. I was a man who learned, a gentleman who would not commit the same mistake second time. And I shall ignore that tsukkomi about how a gentleman would not even make that first mistake in the first place. I can\u2019t hear anything.</p><br/><p>Aiki the monkey immediately dived in after Mi and started running at the bottom of the pool. After passing Mi, Aiki held onto Mi\u2019s hands, like baton touching. The scene and the timing of that was like a primary school relay baton touching race.</p><br/><p>Ah, although I did not get to participate in that the last time. Because there would always be a fight about who was being the one to grab the baton from me so I was removed from the race by a visibly troubled Sensei. And after that, it was impossible for me to participate in any relay.</p><br/><p>Because I was a good kid! I would never do anything to trouble my Sensei! I would certainly pull myself out of it with a smile! It was not like I was hated so much that no one wanted to be in a relay with me, you know!</p><br/><p>\u2026..Ha ha. I tried using a tsundere tone to convince myself but I ended up only feeling quite empty.</p><br/><p>Anyway, let\u2019s put this aside.</p><br/><p>Aiki, holding onto Mi\u2019s hand, ran through the water without any resistance. Seeing this scene once again reminded me that I was in an alternate world. By the way, this strange phenomenon of being able to move in water as if on land was a special trait of the water-attribute of Monkey, who lived near the river in the forest. This little tidbit was new to me too.</p><br/><p>As I thought about all these random stuff, Mi was getting closer and closer to me. Fast. Because it had only been 4 seconds since he dived in. And the difference was very obvious as the rest of the opponents had only advanced about 2~3m ahead.</p><br/><p>Mi was securely in the the first place.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Though it didn\u2019t mean that we would come out first in the tournament. Why? Because this was the Phyllis Academy, located in the heart of the capital.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the population was, of course, highest in the capital and Nobles that came from other territory, like me, were few and far in between. Many people chose this academy because of their grades skipping system like I did, although this being the place where my parents met each other as well as the alma mater of John-sensei factored in as well, another main point was to increase my connections within the Noble society.</p><br/><p>There were many who sent their children into this academy for them to try to get into the royalty\u2019s good side. Thanks to that, Phyllis Academy became the school that had the highest amount of Nobles attending which in turn attracted other nobles as well as merchant family enrolling in for the connections.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside the history, what I was trying to say was that there was a large number of students currently enrolled in this academy.</p><br/><p>If everyone was to enter into this tournament at the same time, the pool would have to be as big as the Tokyo Dome! So the tournament was separated into blocks and even that took some time.</p><br/><p>Which meant, time was of the essence!</p><br/><p>I finally see what you were planning, First Founder. Did you want to hold a swimming tournament that badly, First Founder?! \u2026..To the extent of even creating a magic tool that record time\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ah, Mi touched the wall as that all was going through my mind. Wah!</p><br/><p>Yes, I was the last leg. The important anchor. I wanted to give a perfect performance as a tribute to my last life of being unable to participate in any relays. Anchor was a heavy responsibility.</p><br/><p>\u2026..You were cold? Eh, how strange. Right now it was the middle of summer.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300a\u300b\uff01\u201d [TN: Shokan. Summon]</p><br/><p>Because it was a festival today, I shall allow some flashy moves, Shiro!</p><br/><p>Thinking of that as I chanted, water splashed around me as Shiro appeared in the air. Of course, the form was of a dragon. Sunlight bounced off the scales of its huge form and even though that was awesomely cool, I kept that comment to myself as I dived into the pool.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d EHHHHHH!! \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, I dived all the way into the pool. I knew others were making noise. I also knew I had a grin on my face. And then, I landed at the bottom of the pool.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026I was pretty sure some of you had guessed it by now. My strategy was \u2018Moses\u2019. Or maybe some would like to call it \u2018Red Sea\u2019.</p><br/><p>Shiro then separated the water of the lane I was at. Water began to split into left and right as I sprinted forward.</p><br/><p>How exhilarating. And how very fun.</p><br/><p>Grinning, I ran. In this case, the most appropriate lines would be \u2018AWESOME!\u2019 and \u2018The water is making way for him!\u2019. The feeling I felt was like a young child running through a corn field to pass something to his mother.</p><br/><p>Eh? That\u2019s not Moses? It\u2019s of the same feeling! Who else were you thinking?</p><br/><p>\u201d YOSHHHHH!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>I gave a roar as I touched the wall of the pool. Of course, the roar was because we were totally in the first place. Because, thanks to excitement, I left everything to my cheat-ability of my legs and sprinted, spending a total of 2 seconds. The speed was about 45km per second. The same speed as a beginner riding a bicycle. Ah\u2026that example might not be correct\u2026</p><br/><p>But, if it was a 100m run, I would take only 8 seconds. It would be the world record for an 8 years old. Ah, someone like a referee would be running too, pale in the face if that ever happened. But since this world had magic, this much was common.</p><br/><p>Selphy then came over and we high-touched. After everyone had finished recording their timings, Headmaster gave the orders for us to return to our respective dormitories. Students then began to leave the noisy grounds as per orders.</p><br/><p>Looking at each other, Selphy and I gave each other a wry smile. And somehow, our first tournament came to a close.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

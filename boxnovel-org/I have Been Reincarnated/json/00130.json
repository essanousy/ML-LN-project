You gave me time to unpack and even to chat with Chiffon-san about many things\u2026 fu fu fu fu fu. \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy, who was laughing happily was being really cute but after spotting a slightly flushed Chiffon standing at the back, my face cramped.</p><br/><p>Wh, what did you guys talk about, Chiffon-san?</p><br/><p>\u201d I, I see. That\u2019s great. Are you okay too, Zen? \u201d</p><br/><p>If I were to tsukkomi badly at that, the scene from earlier would most likely played out again so I changed the topic to Zen. Although he was looking nervous, his eyes were glittering like Selphy.</p><br/><p>\u201d I finished unpacking too\u2026 It\u2019s just that this house is too awesome that I am feeling nervous but\u2026. this house is really awesome! The magic tools used in this house looked like it has being in use for a while and the quality of it! \u201d</p><br/><p>As expected of a magical tool craftsman\u2019s son who was also aiming to be one. So he was being excited by all the tools we had in our house.</p><br/><p>But he might be right about that.</p><br/><p>I had been living here since forever so I did not really noticed it but it was true that most tools in this house had an aged feeling to them. Not in the way of being worn out but more like having a strong and sturdy kind of feeling. Especially the lighting and the air conditioning.</p><br/><p>To put it simply, it was like having brought a good product and had been using it for years without it breaking down.</p><br/><p>Ah, but having since read that diary, I can\u2019t help but had a nagging suspicion that these might just be magical tools back from the days when Elzmu was founded.</p><br/><p>After all, an air-conditioning magic tool was really unusual. It\u2019s most probably Terao who made that. Somehow, thinking this way made it all quite amusing.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..from the curve of the ornament, it looks like it had been here for at least 100 years. \u201d</p><br/><p>My excitement seemed to be raising after seeing how heated Zen was about it.</p><br/><p>\u201d Might be. The paint used on it looked to be from Hadazerl so it might really be from the founding year. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Serious! \u201d</p><br/><p>Since I can\u2019t tell them about the diary, I simply randomly gave an excuse that sounded like I was joking. But to even know about the paint as well as the ornament\u2026 It was already quite tough with studying for the skipping-of-grades exam but to even possessed these kind of information\u2026 Zen was really quite smart.</p><br/><p>\u201d A kind of preservation or maintenance magic circle must be carved on the tools. \u201d</p><br/><p>As we got heated over the discussion, Father\u2019s voice was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, Father. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d The air-conditioning tool used is still currently moving right now but never once had it been taken down for maintenance. \u201d</p><br/><p>A face, which peeked out from behind Father, was as beautiful as ever.</p><br/><p>\u201d Mother! You came! \u201d</p><br/><p>I exclaimed, feeling surprised.</p><br/><p>During these few days, Mother was busy going for tea parties doing some politics that only women could do so she was hardly at home. She did came back by evening but she would usually spend the time in her room, working.</p><br/><p>Which was why we usually had dinner at night. But since Zen and Selphy, 2 children, were here, dinner was pushed forward to during the evening but to think Mother would appeared.</p><br/><p>I grinned without thinking, before feeling a strong gaze upon me.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Father looked lonely.</p><br/><p>\u201d Fa, Father too? \u201d</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t know the reason, from the fact that this person was an idiot parent, I guess his face fell from me not caring. Ah, since my past life was like that, I was really treating this family as something really important to me.</p><br/><p>I do loved the both of them deeply but for some reason, I was willing to let Mother see it but not Father.</p><br/><p>I mean.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it embarrassing?</p><br/><p>\u201d Wiilllllllllll! \u201d</p><br/><p>But more than anything, annoying.</p><br/><p>It was like the same scene replayed from when I first came back home. I was hugged by Father, whom then rubbed his cheek against mine.</p><br/><p>\u201d Stop! Your beard hurts~~!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>This time, although Zen and Selphy were surprised, they were looking on with smiles on their faces.</p><br/><p>How can I stand this?!</p><br/><p>Onii-San is seriously going to cry!</p><br/><p>Why was I being watch with warm gazes from children younger than me?! I\u2019m already 25! Although I looked 8.</p><br/><p>Ah no, please don\u2019t say I don\u2019t even looked 8.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Welcome! *Passes cookies and ice cream*</p><br/><p>EN: Thank you very much for the welcome my friend. *Enjoys said desert treats.*</p><br/><p>Guta looked at the sky. The clouds in the sky were thinning out and were almost all gone. This marked the end of summer and also the little amount of time he had left.</p><br/><p>The listless Guta then rang his summoning bell. Although Spinel, who would always appear when called, was gone, Guta still had to go about his plan. He had to make sure it succeeded.</p><br/><p>He was not that naive to think that he could act in Elzmu without his [Shadows] so the fact that he would be found out was already being thought of. But the next step was a gamble he was staking everything on.</p><br/><p>This gamble was betting on the fact that if lost, he would only need to pay a minimal amount of damages and if won, his country would be saved. That was why, this gamble relied heavily on who was the fastest to move. As long as they make a move before their opponent, they would have the advantage.</p><br/><p>This wish of his had followed him since young. Although his hair had thinned and his belly had grown, his wish remained unchanged.</p><br/><p>\u201d Capture all the hunters! Fall out! \u201d</p><br/><p>He commanded. The luxurious and gorgeous throne room that Guta was always in, was empty. He was, instead, in a little worn-down lodging, sitting on the sofa.</p><br/><p>Some sacrifices had to be made.</p><br/><p>Guta mumbled to himself. In front of losing his position and having the country dying of hunger, this much wasn\u2019t anything.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>The summer holidays were coming to an end. He had stayed in the dorm till the very very last minute, and with the excuse that he should at least show his face in front of his father, he began setting out for home.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Will had to helped out his father so he could not come along with.</p><br/><p>Yes, Zen had pushed all responsibility onto Will. Not that he was feeling lonely. Absolutely not. It was that after hearing Will talking about how he met his goal of helping his father, Zen wish of helping his father burned even stronger!</p><br/><p>Normally, when one heard a 8 year old boy talking about helping with his father\u2019s work, they would only think that he was playing because it was quite impossible. But if it was Will, nothing was impossible, thought Zen, with a faraway look in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Will could easily solve difficult mathematical questions and could also cast magic that even the teachers wanted to learned from him. And when you thought that Will was only good in studying, he would then proceeded to jumped out from the 2nd floor only to landed safely and harmlessly, showing his awesome reflexes.</p><br/><p>And just a while back, using that petite body of his, Will had defeated Zelda-sensei in a sword battle without any handicap from him. Will had laughed and said \u201d I just won by a small margin and Zelda-sensei had also gone easy on me. \u201c. Zen can\u2019t help but look at with Zelda-sensei, still curled up in one corner.</p><br/><p>\u201d Shiro is awesome too\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen mumbled.</p><br/><p>Will, in his first summoning, had managed to destroyed the classroom by summoning a huge-ass magical beast. Not to mention it was the mystical White Dragon, the famous magical beast that was said to be one of the contracted beasts of the First Founder.</p><br/><p>Of all these things, one would think that he wouldn\u2019t have had the time to do so many things but don\u2019t forget, Will is a noble. A noble wouldn\u2019t need to do any house chores. But he overturned that again by showing how good he was at sewing, cooking and cleaning.</p><br/><p>As expected of Will.</p><br/><p>No matter how impossible a thing was, Will can do it. Because it was Will. Everyone who knew Will had the same common understanding. There was no helping it because it was Will. This was a phrase that had helped many in overcoming the huge shock that threatened to make them lose their minds. It can also be said as a way of \u2018giving up\u2019.</p><br/><p>As all these ran through Zen\u2019s mind, he glared at the communication device that was given by Will. This tool was yet another miracle.</p><br/><p>This pendent was a magical tool that enabled communications between people regardless of the distance, as explained by Will. As a magical tools craftsman\u2019s son, Zen knew of this tool.</p><br/><p>However, the tool he knew of was about as big as him and was so rare that only territory lords had one in their house. Moreover, that tool was something the First Founder himself had created.</p><br/><p>Zen was totally at a loss for words when Will handed him the small communication pendent-like tool. \u201d But this is only a receiver due to the size. \u201d Will said, smiling wryly. It seemed like it uses was restricted by the size of the mana stone set inside.</p><br/><p>[Receiver] meant that he can only reply when a call came and not make a call by himself. Zen had a dazed look in his eyes again. He wanted to yell out but can\u2019t, due to this being a shared carriage. His manners didn\u2019t allowed him to.</p><br/><p>You would have to know that most of the tools that the territory lords owned was a [Receiver]! The [Communicator] tool was the tool used for calling but the destination had to firstly be incorporated into it before creating it. And most [Communicator] tool had at most 2-3 destination programmed.</p><br/><p>For example, the tool in Sociunnov\u2019s territory that Zen lived in was only registered to the Royal family. As Zen\u2019s house was one of the best magical tool craftsman shop around, he had been taught about that tool. His father once told him that the [Communicator] tool the Royal family had that was registered to all the [Receivers], was the exception to the exception.</p><br/><p>That was why when Zen heard Will said \u201d But this is only a receiver due to the size. \u201c, he felt like his mind was exploding. Because that meant that Will had already built a [Communicator] tool and the next sentence that came out of Will was even scarier.</p><br/><p>\u201d I had already registered your mana so all you need to do is to think of the person you want to send a message to. I will be sending you the [Communicator] when I can successfully built it smaller. \u201d</p><br/><p>An impossible thing was said easily like that. Zen had a feeling that a new revolution will be brought about. Furthermore, it was not only a tool that connected the registered users together, it would even search for other tools. It was so far out that it would be said to be a completely different thing altogether.</p><br/><p>In Will\u2019s eyes, the communication tools here were like a [Telegram], or even a [Pager] but for a modern kid like him, he would still wish for a [smartphone]. Recently, he was planning on making magical tools that had a low amount of mana consumption. It was good that Zen did not know about Will\u2019s plan of making these tools widespread otherwise he would faint from shock.</p><br/><p>But Zen, who had experienced a good deal of mind-blowing stuff, had unknowingly tempered his mind to be able to withstand more than an average person.</p><br/><p>Zen looked at the sky as the horse carriage rocked to and fro. The sun was setting and it was about to turn dark soon. Thinking of something, Zen looked at the tool in his hand once again. Will had said \u201d Since you can\u2019t send a message if anything happen, I would be calling every 3 days to check. \u201d when he first gave him the tool. And 3 days after receiving the tool, he got Will\u2019s call.</p><br/><p>The tool would vibrate when a new call was received. It had been 2 days since the last communication so it would be at least the next evening or at most the day after when he would received another call from Will.</p><br/><p>2 days ago, he hadn\u2019t told Will that he would going home. As he had told Will how he wouldn\u2019t go back unless he ha graduated, it felt like he was slapping his own face with this trip back. How very embarrassing.</p><br/><p>But Will was always unpredictable, he would sometimes appeared in the dorm when he was thought to be at home. And by then he would knew that Zen was not in.</p><br/><p>If a call came, Zen could only tell the truth that he was heading home.</p><br/><p>\u201d What should I say\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen mumbled to himself, racking his head for an answer. Then, he lifted his head and nodded. He thought of something.</p><br/><p>\u201d I could just say that Father called me back to help him\u2026!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Will had knew about his father\u2019s slovenly lifestyle so this excuse was perfect! Having thought of a bulletproof excuse, Zen began nodding off thanks to the comfortable rocking of the carriage.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

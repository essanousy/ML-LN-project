But I am nothing special? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s okay! \u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled at the approval I had gotten.</p><br/><p>Lifting his shoulders for a moment as if he said \u2018Oh well..\u2019, John-sensei returned his book into his bag and turned towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, feel free. \u201d</p><br/><p>He took his glasses off and gave a small smile, as if he was trying to hide the shadows reflected in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201d How old is Sensei? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Ah, you wanted to ask about these things? 26 years old. \u201d</p><br/><p>He gave a wry smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then\u2026Do you have a girlfriend or a fiancee? \u201d</p><br/><p>He looked younger than his age. With his appearance, it would be normal for him to have 1 or 2 women!</p><br/><p>With interest and anticipation, I leaned forward.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026 Unfortunately, I am focusing on studies and research right now. \u201d</p><br/><p>This was unexpected.</p><br/><p>I thought his kind would be unable to leave a woman alone\u2026</p><br/><p>John-sensei had a faraway look in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026hen, then, Sensei is currently a court scholar right? What research are you doing now? \u201d</p><br/><p>I panicked and averted the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, are you willing to listen, Will? I am researching on magic, and in addition, incantations and magic circles. And also arithmetic when I am free. \u201d</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, he was such a multi-person that I was shocked. Incantations and magic circles were the norm but in addition to that, arithmetic too\u2026 That was not something for when you were free!</p><br/><p>But, my admiration was taken as me not having understood what was just said.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, Will have not learned about magic..Incantations and magic circles are.. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I did. \u201d</p><br/><p>I stopped Sensei who was beginning to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201d And that, again, why? \u201d</p><br/><p>Shocked, John-sensei looked at me, immensely curious. Amused, I lowered my voice and placed my finger across my lips and grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sensei, let\u2019s keep it a secret from everyone else. \u201d</p><br/><p>Going along, Sensei lowered his body and leaned close.</p><br/><p>\u201d I went to the library on my own and read the spell books. \u201d</p><br/><p>How was that.</p><br/><p>I pointed and winked.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hoh, that is.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Amused, a mischievous smile floated on his face as he took another book out of his bag. I saw that book before.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, that\u2019s the book. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300eMagic That Even Monkeys Understand Elementary\u300f, good choice. It was in my plans to read this to you. It seems that you have taken it off the \u2018Homework\u2019 list. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I.. I see. \u201d</p><br/><p>Erm, I did think that the author was rather horrible\u2026 however, it seemed like there was no problem with the explanations in the book\u2026</p><br/><p>That was the only response I could think of..</p><br/><p>\u201d However the tone (of the book) leaves much to be desired. \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei said, smiling wryly.</p><br/><p>\u2026As I thought, the problem lay in the tone.</p><br/><p>\u201d What are you researching about incantations and magic circles (squares)? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Magic circles have regularity or rules but what about incantations? For example, to produce fire, \u300a\u300b, but to produce a fire arrow, \u300a\u300b[TN: Kasen / Hiya.] is required. Magic circles are to be so as well. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.Wow, we could have a collaboration.</p><br/><p>This must be fate. It was the correct choice to have meet this person. More so, ever since I was born, there had been no one within the residence that was on the same wavelength as me. Even though John, at the age of 26 years old, was considered as an adult, with my inner age of 20 years old, not much of an age gap was felt\u2026was what I thought.</p><br/><p>\u201d My, what a delightful face you have on, Will. Did I get you interested? \u201d</p><br/><p>As I was thinking about it, it seemed to have been shown on my face as well.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes! \u201d</p><br/><p>I replied energetically. By no means could I say that I was thinking about becoming friends with Sensei. Mah, I was not lying about being interested though.</p><br/><p>And then, John-sensei gave a really happy face and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201d I..see. Fufu\u2026hahahaha! \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei grabbed his stomach.</p><br/><p>I was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u2026Wh, what happened?</p><br/><p>What was with this person? Did he hit his head or something? No, did I say anything amusing\u2026? Nothing was coming to mind.</p><br/><p>\u201d W..why are you laughing? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Are you not asking (about that)? \u201d</p><br/><p>With a delighted face while laughing, John-sensei gave off a refreshing aura.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: What\u2019s is with you, John Sensei!</p><br/><p>The conversation can\u2019t go on\u2026</p><br/><p>TN: Japan had been fun!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

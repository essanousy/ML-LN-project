No more complains now.</p><br/><p>TN: This is Chapter 001 of the Digest version which consist of Chapter 001 and 002 for the original story. Enjoy~</p><br/><p>That day. It was a bright sunny day which was a</p><br/><p>welcome change from the rain that you would usually be plagued with at this time of the year. And that placed me in an exceptionally good mood.</p><br/><p>The slightly worn down station located in a rural area just right outside the city that can be access to with a swap in trains. This was the sort of station that would only ever be busy during the evening or in the morning. This was due to the fact that it was mostly</p><br/><p>used by students commuting to and from school.</p><br/><p>The majority of the state schools had been located in this area, largely due to the fact that land was relatively cheap compared to other places.</p><br/><p>Though, luckily for me, the distance to the school that I attended was not so far that I would need to take a bus. I mean, having to do that much exercise in the morning would most definitely kill me.</p><br/><p>[TN: It\u2019s just taking a bus\u2026]</p><br/><p>Come to think of it I won\u2019t even choose that kind of school in the first place. Yep I won\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Ah..But the weather was so good today. I wonder if I should skip? At least summer\u2019s only just around the corner. Walking while lost in these thoughts, someone tap me from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201d Shou, good morning! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ohh! Morning Terao. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ehh.. Why is it not a girl from my class.. Wait. It\u2019s not like I always think about that sort of stuff! I am not thinking about it!</p><br/><p>Terao.</p><br/><p>I first met Terao when I entered high school and, due to our similar personalities, we became close quite quickly. I suppose you could now call us best friends.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2019s with that face? You must be thinking about something rude like ah, why is it Terao, right? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah. I was exposed. \u201d</p><br/><p>Although I was laughing, I was really wondering how life could be so cruel.</p><br/><p>Terao is popular. He is what they call an \u2018Ikemen\u2019. [TN: Handsome]</p><br/><p>What a troublesome guy I am? Can\u2019t be helped, that is the kind of guy I am.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026 I am jealous of your looks. \u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to the sunny sky, it was getting cloudy in my heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously? This again? Why do you always say this stuff? I\u2019m so tired of hearing it. \u201d</p><br/><p>Terao rolled his eyes at me. We have almost the same conversation every morning. I suppose you could even call it our daily greeting.</p><br/><p>Not discriminating to anyone, friendly, yet not frivolous and kind\u2026 That just about sums up Terao.</p><br/><p>And then there\u2019s me.</p><br/><p>I really hate to admit it, but I just don\u2019t seem to be liked by the ladies.</p><br/><p>Whenever I try talking to one of them in class, the strangest thing happens. Either they\u2019ll only talk to me briefly, in what only can be described as a whisper, before turning red and running away. Or, they\u2019ll be dragged away by someone before I can even say anything!</p><br/><p>Honestly, the only logical explanation that I can come up with is that when they run away, I\u2019ve unknowingly angered them in some way and when they are dragged away by one of their friends, it\u2019s obviously so they can tell them \u2018Don\u2019t get close to someone like that!\u2019.</p><br/><p>Damn it! Why is that guy so popular!?</p><br/><p>Ohh, the world can really be unfair sometimes\u2026</p><br/><p>While ranting in my heart, I caught the strange look that Terao was giving me.</p><br/><p>\u201d It..It\u2019s nothing. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ahh, why did I say it like that? I might as well have told him that there was something! But Terao just accepted it with a \u201d Okay. \u201d and a smile. I see. What a gentlemanly response. Let\u2019s learn it.</p><br/><p>As I\u2019m secretly nodding to the fact that I have a good role model by my side\u2026</p><br/><p>A vase fell.</p><br/><p>\u2026hm? Eh?</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>The vase hit my head directly.</p><br/><p>The world started spinning in slow-motion.</p><br/><p>the world begins to spin in slow-motion and, just like that, after a slight feeling of pressure, my skull cracked.</p><br/><p>I died\u2026!</p><br/><p>Having that thought, my eyes opened to a field of flowers all around me. What is happening? \u2026 That\u2019s right. I was hit on the head by a vase. But why am I in a field of flowers?</p><br/><p>Is this real? Was I really killed by something as ridiculous as a vase?</p><br/><p>Wait. What about the wheel of reincarnation or King Enma or the last judgement? [TN: I like the name Enma so I\u2019m not gonna use Hades.]</p><br/><p>Ahh, being dead is surprisingly boring.</p><br/><p>what kind of messed up irony is it to have me wake up in a field of flowers after being killed by a vase? And why is everything flowers? Don\u2019t tell me that this is a hint about my entire life? My head is not full of flowers!</p><br/><p>In the midst of senselessly retorting myself, the field of flowers around me suddenly disappeared, leaving me standing in a seemingly empty white void.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am really so sorry!! \u201d [TN: He\u2019s doing old man speak]</p><br/><p>From out of nowhere someone jumped and kneel in front of me\u2026 An old man.</p><br/><p>[TN: He is doing dogesa]</p><br/><p>Erm\u2026 What is with this situation?</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm, what is happening? Please raise your head. \u201d</p><br/><p>For now, I supposed I will just accept the situation and even though I had no idea what I should do. But I would really like an explanation first, in order to understand the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201d You\u2026 forgive me? \u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing my words, the old man raises his head, eyes sparkling.</p><br/><p>\u2026Not amused.</p><br/><p>I am not happy despite I am in heaven. The fields of flowers, this kneeling old man, is this harassment? Are you making fun of me?</p><br/><p>As the subtle unpleasantries continue, I suddenly had this thought making my face pale in an instant. Nothing good is happening, and everything unpleasant kept on happening\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 could this really be hell?</p><br/><p>\u201d This is not heaven. Yet neither is it hell \u201d</p><br/><p>While having these thoughts, the old man suddenly stops apologizing and stands up. Have you stop apologizing? Although I have no idea why you are apologizing, seeing how desperate you are means something really bad happened. Your attitude sure changes fast.</p><br/><p>I looked at the old man, thinking, while touching my lips. I\u2019m pretty sure that I wasn\u2019t just absent-mindedly speaking my thoughts aloud. Which could only mean\u2026 can this old man read my thoughts!?</p><br/><p>\u201d I am not a human but a god. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026Eh. Seriously?</p><br/><p>My jaw dropped. I began to look around this empty void. All I could see was white. White, white. White all around. Much like those countries you see on the</p><br/><p>news from time to time that are attacked by snow storms and render everything white. This space is</p><br/><p>definitely not man-made!</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026This is for real\u2026</p><br/><p>I sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Please don\u2019t tell me\u2026that I died because of..you? \u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what happened in the web novel that I was hooked up with reading. It cannot be that right, I laugh bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, it is my fault. \u201d</p><br/><p>The old man puffed out his chest while saying that. Almost like he was somewhat proud of what he had done.</p><br/><p>This old man\u2026 he\u2019s not really sorry at all is he?</p><br/><p>\u201d Would you like to hear the reason? \u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like he was speaking in a different language or something.</p><br/><p>I sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh\u2026 Ah, my beard caught onto the plants without my knowing.. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026His beard.</p><br/><p>The reason for my death is his beard. That long beard of his.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t there supposed to be some kind of special reason when a God kills someone!?</p><br/><p>And it turns out to be his beard! Isn\u2019t this too half-assed? Oi! This is really just a bit too much.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..And? What should I do? \u201d</p><br/><p>I sit down with my head tucked into my legs, giving up.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.You accept that pretty fast. \u201d</p><br/><p>God exclaimed as his eyes peeked out from below</p><br/><p>underneath his long eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 it\u2019s pointless. I can\u2019t laugh it off and forgive you for killing me. To be completely honest I\u2019m extremely pissed off. I mean, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to send me back if I make a ruckus right?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, God looked at me, visibly shocked at my response. I mean, a being such as God knelt and apologized to me. If he was able to send me back, he would have done so in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u201d Even so, most people would probably try to go against this fact. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah. Is that right.</p><br/><p>It must be because I am a lonely existence.</p><br/><p>My sigh got seen by God.</p><br/><p>\u201d And what\u2019s gonna happ\u007fen to me? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Well, even though I killed you, which was my mistake, I cannot resurrect you. You will either have to reincarnate or disappear. What do you know of the wheel of reincarnation? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019ve heard about it\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>The souls of the dead are guided by the wheel of reincarnation and return to the world with a different life. That sort of stuff. In short, they are given a new life.</p><br/><p>God, who was looking at me, nod with satisfaction. I realized that he must still be reading my thoughts and determined that my knowledge was correct. I am surprised that reincarnation really exist but hey, sure, why not?</p><br/><p>\u2026But I am not disappearing! That\u2019s horrible!</p><br/><p>Against reincarnation is disappearance.. You are really\u2026 there was never really a choice to begin with was there?!</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.. I\u2019ll reincarnate. \u201d</p><br/><p>At that answer, God nodded deeply and said \u201d This time really\u2026 \u201c. I did not pay attention to most of it but it ends with \u201d To truly apologize, I will grant you any of your wishes. \u201d</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this the legendary [Cheat] around the net? Magic cheat or maybe strength cheat? There are so many different kinds of cheats float around in my head but I just can\u2019t seem to find any that appeal to me. Also, it\u2019s usually the case that the people who receive these cheats will often find themselves getting into many troublesome situations.</p><br/><p>I mean it\u2019s not like I have some mind of god complex and have a desire to become some sort of unparalleled master. If you were to ask me what I really want, I would have to say that I wanted to be liked, to be loved. Is that too much to asked for..? Right..hmm.. at least I don\u2019t want to be hated like I am now..</p><br/><p>There are also some things in life which I would do differently if I had the choice. Should I make use of my previous experiences?\u007f</p><br/><p>\u201d I want to retain all of my memories of from this previous life. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Is that all? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d If I ask too much, it probably won\u2019t end well for me. \u201d</p><br/><p>As I laugh bitterly, I recalled the largest trauma from my previous life. Tongue-Cut Sparrow.</p><br/><p>[TM: It\u2019s a folktale, search it up.]</p><br/><p>\u201d I see. \u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing my answer, God smiled gently towards me.</p><br/><p>\u201d And so. Let\u2019s send you on your way. \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, my body is wrapped in a warm glow.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN : I finished!! Well, it did get easier as it went on but it took me close to 4 hours\u2026. Enjoy!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Do you guys want the author\u2019s note? I am getting tired of it. Most of it is about how high her web novel is ranked at and how she cannot believe and how she thanks her readers.</p><br/><p>I think I\u2019ll only translate it if there\u2019s anything interest. So there.</p><br/><p>Right in the middle, a thick, huge table stood.</p><br/><p>On the wall across, a huge window.</p><br/><p>It gave the entire room a bright impression.</p><br/><p>This was the room I had just received.</p><br/><p>John and I were sitting opposite, facing each other at the table.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, Mary San, thank you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mary San made tea and as it was, left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>How awkward.</p><br/><p>Somehow, John was making a stiff face as he looked at me, coupled that with his upturned eyes, he looked scary.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Erm\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>When I spoke, he jumped and softened his nervous expression.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I am sorry. \u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled, embarrassed and looked straight at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d I unknowingly got nervous. As you know, I am John Veltor, and I will be working as your tutor from today onward. \u201d</p><br/><p>Oh\u2026A gentleman\u2026</p><br/><p>Till now, he had defied all of my expectations. His soft manner, polite tone of speaking, none of it said \u2018prideful wicked noble\u2019.</p><br/><p>I put down my guard and relaxed my tensed body.</p><br/><p>\u2026.I was sorry for misunderstanding you.</p><br/><p>With that meaning in mind, I bowed my head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes, I will be in your care. I am Williams Beryl, please call me Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>When I said that, John looked shocked.</p><br/><p>\u2026Hm? Did I do anything weird?</p><br/><p>For the time being, I could not think of anything so I just continued.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm, what should I call Veltor Sama? \u201d</p><br/><p>And John\u2019s shocked expression changed into a good humored smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d You can call me however you prefer. Only\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he had a seemingly wry smile and a mischievous expression.</p><br/><p>\u201d ..not Veltor please. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, I see.</p><br/><p>I finally believed that, indeed, this man, as rumors said, had abandoned his family name. Right now, he seemed like an honest and gentlemanly fellow and I could not sense any bad vibes from him nor did he seem like the type who used flattery.</p><br/><p>In fact, he felt a bit like a puppy\u2026</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026I couldn\u2019t deny the possibility that he might be a sly fox\u2026</p><br/><p>According to my instinct, he was not a bad guy.</p><br/><p>Happy by this fact, my face was full of smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then, John Sensei! Would that be all right? \u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, if it\u2019s a tutor, then it could not be anything other than Sensei right!</p><br/><p>Once I said that, John Sensei beamed at me.</p><br/><p>\u2026What was this sense of defeat? Hm.</p><br/><p>He was beautiful. He was handsome. He was a bespectacled Ikemen prodigy.</p><br/><p>\u2026And also a gentleman.</p><br/><p>It might had been he was nervous before. Now that I looked at him again, the first impression was not wrong. He was really an Ikemen. This was the first time I felt an intimacy with a black pupil, black haired person ever since I arrived in this world.</p><br/><p>Grrr\u2026. I was jealous.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s okay! In the future even with an average face I would be popular!</p><br/><p>\u201d By the way, Will Sama. \u201d</p><br/><p>I nearly drowned in the tears of my thoughts before John Sensei\u2019s voice pulled me back to reality.</p><br/><p>\u201d John Sensei, please stop with the \u2018Sama\u2019. \u201d</p><br/><p>Again with the formal tone! As a tutor we were going to be together for a long time to come and if we were to be this formal, my upper lip was going to go stiff! [TN: In original text : My shoulder was going to go stiff. ] Ah, this was not a pun\u2026you there, don\u2019t say that it\u2019s cold! [TN: Cold jokes = pun\u2026get it?] It was an accident, just an accident.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then\u2026 Will San \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Will alone is fine. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026Eh\u2026That is a bit\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s okay because you are my Sensei! \u201d</p><br/><p>I was getting slightly impatient. With a slightly troubled face, Sensei finally agreed to call me Will.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah yes Sensei, what is the matter? \u201d</p><br/><p>I remembered he wanted to say something. John Sensei\u2019s expression turned serious.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah. It\u2019s just..If you don\u2019t mind me asking, it is a little early for a 3 years old to have a tutor. I was wondering if you made this request or was it Sir Gion\u2019s idea? \u201d</p><br/><p>This person\u2019s eyes sparkled whenever the topic was about Father. He really seemed to admire Father. Me too, apart from his face, aimed to be like Father.</p><br/><p>Sorry for dashing your hope\u2026</p><br/><p>I gave a small bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, it was me who requested. \u201d</p><br/><p>John Sensei looked very shocked.</p><br/><p>\u2026Yep, I was sorry for betraying your expectations\u2026</p><br/><p>But Sensei too, betrayed my expectations so I was not in the wrong!</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s Will\u2019s\u2026? But why? I don\u2019t mean to be rude but boys at your age usually only think about having fun. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I don\u2019t know anything. I am proud seeing Father so needed (busy) but as for me, I can\u2019t help with anything\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at Sensei with a mischievous glint in my eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026And I am frustrated with that. \u201d</p><br/><p>With a shocked expression, Sensei sat there, stunned.</p><br/><p>\u2026Sorry.</p><br/><p>I said something outrageous, didn\u2019t I? But there was no choice, it\u2019s true! I could never understand the conversations carried on over my head and it was so vexing.</p><br/><p>\u201d So that is why.. \u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, a happy smile floated up on Sensei\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then, let\u2019s study hard as soon as possible, shall we, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>What a good smile you had there, John Sensei.</p><br/><p>\u2026Eh\u2026.is this person possible\u2026a Spartan \u2018S\u2019\u2026.?</p><br/><p>I, whose expectations were splendidly betrayed.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: John Sensei, a sparta\u2026is he?</p><br/><p>Next chapter, all will be revealed\u2026maybe.</p><br/><p>TN: Muhahaha, what an easy chapter. Most of it is copy and paste from the digest chapter 003. Enjoy!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Sorry for waiting.</p><br/><p>My master was not to be underestimated.</p><br/><p>The man snickered.</p><br/><p>Iron fortress \u2013 Gion. It was natural to think he would lay traps around in his office but to think the Shadows, who were pro in this field, were caught so easily. Plus there was something unnatural about the way this news was presented.</p><br/><p>No matter how I sniffed around, I could not seem to even get a single bit of information. The only thing I found out was that somehow, Gion had been running around. And even that was an unreliable bit of rumor from the streets. To think Gion Beryl managed to keep such a tight lid\u2026</p><br/><p>But now, just by poking a little, the seams fell apart and information could be easily gotten. It was as if he was trying to hide something else\u2026.</p><br/><p>And my master, whose appearance was easily looked down upon, was actually a sharp and able person. To get that fact confirmed again, the black hooded man\u2026.no, the masked man laughed. My master had picked up on this tiny clue and gave his instructions quickly. To think I had decided to investigate it myself had he not say anything.</p><br/><p>I had plenty of time.</p><br/><p>And I waited for 3 years.</p><br/><p>Finally my time had come.</p><br/><p>Will\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 Williams Beryl had entered the Academy. Even if I still had to wait for 2 more years till Will graduates, this was still an unexpectedly good news. The mansion and Gion\u2019s close proximity were too dangerous. The risk of me being found out was too high. And right now, both of those were a far distance away from Will. Now is the best timing.</p><br/><p>Lowering my hood and deeply covering my face, I cackled.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I had a dream.</p><br/><p>I dreamed that I was summoned by god (gramps) and I laid all my dissatisfaction on him. To give me a [cheat] ability that I did not even ask for, did he know how much troubles I had because of him? But it was also thanks to that, I managed to help Selphys and most of all, to be able protect all the people I hold dear from now onward. I should be fine if I hide my abilities to prevent being feared or looked upon as a weirdo and if it really did get found out, I can only resigned to my fate.</p><br/><p>But that gramps.</p><br/><p>He was definitely not reflecting on his wrongdoings.</p><br/><p>To prevent the incident that happened to me happening to others, he should at least shave off his beard. If he ever appears in my dreams the next time, I am going to pluck all of it out.</p><br/><p>Ah, don\u2019t mind that too much since after all, it was only all a dream. But it did make me think. Even if I received this [cheat], I am still living as now I want it to be.</p><br/><p>My first aim is that.</p><br/><p>Yep.</p><br/><p>To be loved by people. In other words..</p><br/><p>To be popular!</p><br/><p>As I renewed my determination, the alarm sounded. I peeled myself off the bed and climbed down the ladder.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oi! Zen! Wake up! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Unn\u20265 minutes more\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving the mumbling Zen, I quickly washed up and got ready. Sorry Zen, I don\u2019t want to miss breakfast. Brushing the lint off my uniform, I opened the door. Since it was still early, I leisurely strolled down the corridor and heard bustling behind me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will~ Don\u2019t leave me behind! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen.</p><br/><p>As he had rushed out in a hurry, his bed hair was still sticking out all over the place and his collar stood up too. Since it was amusing, I shall keep quiet about it. I then grinned.</p><br/><p>\u201d I woke up on time though? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Uuuu\u2026.but what if I am late to class? It\u2019s the first day too! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Then try your best to wake up on your own. \u201d</p><br/><p>While conversing, we climbed up the stairs and as we were about to turn around the corner to the lobby, someone bumped into me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah- Sorry\u2026. Oh, Selphys. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Uwah! Yesh! Good mongol! \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphys bit her tongue from shock. But she immediately got a grip and after a small wait, she tried again, her face red.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Good morning, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>Her face was really red, was she okay? Was she running a fever? \u2026.She looked energetic so I guessed she was fine.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, the sullen girl from before. \u201d</p><br/><p>Just as I was worried about Selphys\u2019s health, Zen just casually dropped a bomb. Though it was true that she was seen as sullen from before but I am pretty sure her personality was nothing like that. Nope.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will, you spoke with her after that? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah\u2026yeah.. \u201d</p><br/><p>I did not know if it was okay to talk about Selphys\u2019 situation so I just gave a vague answer. Picking up on that, Selphys smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will helped me yesterday. I am Selphys, nice to meet you. \u201d</p><br/><p>To the smiling Selphys, Zen blushed and straightened his back. But since his hair and collar were still sticking up, it looked even more amusing than ever. Even I want to prank people sometimes.</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019m Zen, Will\u2019s roommate and best friend! \u201d</p><br/><p>He seems to emphasize on being my best friend but let\u2019s just ignore that.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Zen, you are a man too huh? Though you were still only 10. I understand, I totally understand your feelings. If I was truly an 8 years old, I would want to be liked by her too.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.Since I am not a lolicon, it was that. Like how a big brother looking out his sister. Eh? I am younger than the both of them? Shut up, it\u2019s the inner age that counts!</p><br/><p>Ahh, but it was nice to hear that Zen treated me as his best friend too. A small smile danced on my lips as I began to walk towards the cafeteria.</p><br/><p>\u201d By the way, is bed hair a fashion thing now? \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphys asked Zen, amused. Zen, who turned red, burst out at me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will! You definitely know about this, don\u2019t you! You\u2019re horrible! \u201d</p><br/><p>I laughed out loudly as Zen chased after me.</p><br/><p>Yep.</p><br/><p>This was a peaceful day.</p><br/><p>In the end, Selphys pacified Zen and we entered the cafeteria together.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Today, as Zen had previously said, was the first day of lessons. Since I had learnt it all from John-sensei, the lessons don\u2019t mean a thing but still, it was my first school lesson after so long! Strictly speaking, it was actually an academy but I was still excited for it.</p><br/><p>As this was the lower academy, the homeroom teacher would be in charge of most of the subjects. Just like primary school. My previous homeroom teacher was a useless and awkward man and I got another teacher for my music and home economics classes. Going with the flow, it meant that Zelda-sensei most likely would be doing the same thing. And he looked like he was boorish and clumsy too.</p><br/><p>I thought about all that as I ate and all of a sudden, Zen threw a question in my direction.</p><br/><p>\u201d So Will, what did you help Selphys with? \u201d</p><br/><p>He asked, curious. I looked at Selphys, asking with my eyes if I should talk about it. She nodded, letting me know to leave it to her. To think she was backed up a wall yesterday. She sure changed fast. Just like the piper uncle who ate mushrooms. She evolved instantly. Mah, it was true that children have these traits in them. With a personality 180\u00b0 from what she was shown previously, the brightly beaming Selphys was attracting gazes throughout the cafeteria.</p><br/><p>\u201d I was rather silent the entire time, wasn\u2019t I? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen did a difficult move of turning his head and nodding at the same time to Selphys, who spoke. Ah, because of his age, his neck sure was soft\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d That was because I kept hearing voices from the faeries. It was really noisy and it covered up your voices so I couldn\u2019t hear a thing. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh~ As expected, elves can talk to the faeries. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen said, impressed. But Selphys shook her head sadly.</p><br/><p>\u201d No. It is true that elves that were aware of the faeries can speak with them but for me\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphys let her sentence trailed off into silence. Which means, Selphys can hear them without being aware of it\u2026. No, she had a constitution that can hear things regardless of what they are. Zen seem to understand that too. He quickly apologized, feeling bad.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphys panicked at his apologies and said that it was okay. Still feeling slightly bad, Zen wanted to continue hearing the story about how I helped her. He might not know that I did not do much actually.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will saved me from those noises. \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphys, with her eyes sparkling, turned towards me. I felt slightly guilty at that sparkling eyes since I did not do anything much. And, as I expected, Zen had a funny, idiotic look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Huh? Eh? \u201d</p><br/><p>I smiled wryly at that.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yeah, I only asked the faeries to go away. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Only. According to what I read, Faeries only listen to people with magic power higher than them\u2026. Will is really un-normal, yea? \u201d</p><br/><p>This time, I was the one stunned by Zen.</p><br/><p>What? How rude. I only tried asking them.</p><br/><p>Since I am an adult, I shan\u2019t hold it against you.</p><br/><p>Leaving the empty plates on the counter, we left the cafeteria.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Wo~ah, lessons\u2019s starting! \u201d</p><br/><p>Gori\u2026Zelda-sensei entered the classroom as energetically as ever.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well then. Okay, stand up!. \u201d</p><br/><p>The chairs rattled as everyone stood up. It seem like this world had the same practice before class. Somehow, I was kinda happy about it. But the next part made me want to bang my head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sit! Greet! \u201d</p><br/><p>Nononononononono!</p><br/><p>I really want to bang my head against the wall at such an old joke. And I had no idea if it was done on purpose or not as Zelda-sensei just pass the entire thing with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>And so, class started with a sloppy start. Since it was the first day, we were learning about writing. But, expected of 10 years old. They had all memorized the alphabets before coming and was taking the lesson just because and in the end, the lesson went smoothly. But as I soon became bored, I started sketching instead.</p><br/><p>Next was mathematics. The 4 fundamentals were easy. [TN: +, -, x, \u00f7] I was so bored that I finished all the questions.</p><br/><p>So I am very free now. Was there nothing else to do? I looked around the classroom. On my right was Zen, left was Selphys. Zen was as good as he said, solving the questions without any trouble while Selphys was earnestly paying attention to Zelda-sensei\u2019s lesson.</p><br/><p>She then discovered me staring at her.</p><br/><p>Hehe, sorry, I\u2019m bored!</p><br/><p>To convey my message, I smiled at her and she turned her head away.</p><br/><p>Uwah\u2026\u2026Her ears were red with anger! I\u2019m sorry!</p><br/><p>Please forgive me since I am younger than you.</p><br/><p>But since I don\u2019t want to anger her again, I began to observe others. Oh yes, I wondered what happened to Miso-kun.</p><br/><p>My eyes searched all over the classroom. Oh, he was in a blind spot. He was just right in front of me. Had he repented? I would like some friends when I succeeded Father so I would really be happy if he changed his way of thinking. As I stared at that blond hair, my name was suddenly called out.</p><br/><p>Hm? Turning to the direction of the voice that called me out, it was right at the front of the classroom, where the blackboard was.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Oh man\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I was called by the teacher. This was bad, I totally did not hear what he just said. Ah, would it be fine to just answer the question on the board? I looked at Zen and he nodded. Oh, that was easy.</p><br/><p>It was a simple question that could be solved by mental calculation and when I answered immediately, Sensei was shocked. The class stirred as well.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm? Eh? I was wrong? \u201d</p><br/><p>I whispered at Zen, asking, only for him to stare at me, smiling wryly.</p><br/><p>What was it, man?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

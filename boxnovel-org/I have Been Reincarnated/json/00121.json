And outside the window he could hear birds chirping. This freezing coldness felt just like the early morning weather.</p><br/><p>As he lay there, dazing for a bit as his brain began clearing up, he began to recall what happened last night. And then, Shou\u2019s face went pale. Like how the floor beneath him just gave way.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.He cried himself to sleep.</p><br/><p>Even though he had finally proved himself to be of help to this house! Katsuo was surely bound to be stunned at his behavior.</p><br/><p>Shou felt like crying again but he gritted his teeth and resisted it. It seemed like his eyelids were swollen due to over-crying yesterday, looking like it had soaked in all of his tears yesterday. Ignoring it, he got out of his futon and began washing up. The water flowing out of the tap was freezing cold, but that temperature was just right for the him right now.</p><br/><p>Shou then headed towards the kitchen. Katsuo might not have thought much of it when he gave Shou his room but the kitchen was right next to his room.</p><br/><p>He wanted to make Miso soup and grilled fish for breakfast but he realized that rice hadn\u2019t been prepared. It was because he had cried himself to sleep yesterday. He had always prepared the rice for the next morning before he slept.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.No choice.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Shou mumbled to himself before changing his clothes and after which he left the house. It would be bread for breakfast today.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Shou\u2026.! Where had you been, idiot! \u201d</p><br/><p>Once Shou entered the house, he was shouted at before getting wrapped in a hug by Katsuo.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh\u2026..Ka, Katsuo-san? \u201d</p><br/><p>Shou was troubled. He must have done something wrong. What was it that he did? Thinking about it, he came to the conclusion that it was because he hadn\u2019t made breakfast for today. His face paled as he apologized reflexively.</p><br/><p>\u201d I\u2019m sorry! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d What are you apologizing for? \u201d</p><br/><p>Katsuo released Shou from his arms as he asked Shou seriously. Seeing his face, Shou felt even more uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.If this was to continue, I would be abandoned.</p><br/><p>\u201d I, I did not prepare today\u2019s breakfast\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>As Shou said with a trembling voice, Katsuo\u2019s face changed.</p><br/><p>\u201d Come here. \u201d</p><br/><p>Holding onto Shou\u2019s hand, which had turned cold from going outside, Katsuo forcefully pulled him into the house.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Where did you go? \u201d</p><br/><p>After pulling Shou into the living room, Katsuo began asking.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026 I went to the bakery to get bread for breakfast. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I see. \u2026..Sorry for suddenly shouting at you. But please, don\u2019t go out without saying anything the next time. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026He thought Shou had run away and died outside or something like that. Since yesterday that happened. His inside really went cold when he couldn\u2019t find Shou.</p><br/><p>After waking up, he went to Shou\u2019s room only to find him missing. To Katsuo, even though he had no idea why Shou was crying yesterday, he knew that it seemed like happy tears.</p><br/><p>Shou had never ever been willful and on the contrary, he had tried to be of use to Katsuo ever since he was here. Katsuo had always thought that it was wrong.</p><br/><p>It looked to him that Shou was afraid of being abandoned if he ever did anything wrong.</p><br/><p>Shou might think that he would be hated by him (Katsuo) for losing himself like that yesterday. Children should be willful and caused troubles to adults. And adults would forgive those behavior and slowly guide and raise them up. This was what that was normal to Katsuo but he finally realized, today, that Shou might not be thinking about the same thing as him.</p><br/><p>No wonder Shou had always been showing consideration inappropriate of his age. To read and pay attention to others without others noticing he was doing it was what adults usually did. Katsuo felt stupid for not noticing Shou\u2019s behavior earlier.</p><br/><p>But above all.</p><br/><p>The reason for not having a heart-to-heart talk with Shou was because of his pride. He thought that since he had raised a kid before, Shou\u2019s father, he would be able to do it again. [TN: Look how your son turns out\u2026.]</p><br/><p>He had once thought that it would be better to not mention Shou\u2019s mother since she just passed away but was that a good thing?</p><br/><p>Finally realizing the problem, Katsuo felt like his heart was going to burst. What had he been doing as his guardian?</p><br/><p>\u201d Shou. \u201d</p><br/><p>The left side of the Kotatsu had completely become Shou\u2019s place. Shou seemed to like that seat because it was the closest to his room. After sitting Shou down at his seat, Katsuo looked straight at him, calling his name.</p><br/><p>Shou, sitting in the just-started-so-it-was-only-slightly-warm Kotatsu, jumped a bit when he heard Katsuo said his name. Katsuo then sat down opposite of him.</p><br/><p>As expected, Shou, looking like he was scared of something, glanced at Katsuo.</p><br/><p>\u201d Shou? \u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe his shout from earlier affected Shou more than he thought. Katsuo tried again, using a gentler tone.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Ye\u2026 Yes. \u201d</p><br/><p>The tiny voice was trembling. With the urge to click his tongue, Katsuo managed to squeeze his words out. Wanting to ask how he had lived with his mother. And what made him act like this.</p><br/><p>To live while being in fear of being hated by others.</p><br/><p>And Shou, if he ever had anything he wanted to do.</p><br/><p>\u201d Shou\u2026 How are you planning on living from now on? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..From now on, me? \u201d</p><br/><p>Shou managed to squeeze some voice out as he looked like he was about to cry.</p><br/><p>Shou must have thought he was throwing him away. \u2018No matter, there was no way I could throw my cute grandson away, is there?!\u2019 Katsuo felt like yelling that out as he hugged Shou in his arms but he knew that he can\u2019t do that.</p><br/><p>Katsuo knew. If he were to use words and theory to explain, nothing would change. Shou would doubt his words immediately and think that it would not be applicable to him.</p><br/><p>And his \u2018not letting people hate\u2019 way of living would continue on.</p><br/><p>Shou still had a long way to go.</p><br/><p>And so, Katsuo did not want just a short period of comforting. In that case, he would need to pry open Shou\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>He wanted to know why Shou had become this way.</p><br/><p>If he did, then Katsuo had the confidence to help this little kid who tended to pile and do everything himself.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Can I know how you lived before? \u201d</p><br/><p>To Katsuo, who asked timidly, Shou had answered with silence. Shou, sat there as he tried to make himself smaller, his face slightly pale. As Katsuo thought, Shou\u2019s mother had not been doing a good job in raising this kid. He also knew he was forcing Shou to think back to a dark part of his life.</p><br/><p>Katsuo did not urge Shou, he simply sat there, and after a while, Shou raised his head.</p><br/><p>And then Shou began to speak, stuttering and stumbling over his words.</p><br/><p>How, from the day he could think, his father was already not around.</p><br/><p>How his mother, in order to raise him, worked throughout the day.</p><br/><p>How, in order to help lessen his mother\u2019s burden, and to make her happy, he would do all the housework as he gave his all in studying.</p><br/><p>But Shou\u2019s mother remained apathetic to him.</p><br/><p>No matter how he gave his all, he was never praised. It was vexing. Heartbroken. Lonely.</p><br/><p>Shou\u2019s tiny body began trembling and from the way he stopped time and time again to take a deep breath, Katsuo knew he was trying not to cry. He almost couldn\u2019t stand listening till the end.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Mum, had hated me. I finally realized it\u2026. When I asked why, Mu-mum, mum said that it was because she\u2026.. hated my face. My face\u2026 she hated it\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Before he realized it, Katsuo had tears flowing down his face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Stupid\u2026.. Idiot\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Katsuo hugged Shou tightly. There is no child who would be okay after knowing their own mother hated them. And above being apathetic, she had rejected everything Shou had ever did just because of his face.</p><br/><p>Shou had always been carrying this by himself.</p><br/><p>He must be hurting. It must have affected in how he believed in people. And even so, he was always smiling, and while covering his face, he was always moving in way to avoid people hating him.</p><br/><p>Normal kids would be broken by now.</p><br/><p>This kid was really strong, Katsuo once again thought.</p><br/><p>\u201d So that\u2019s why you wanted to cover your face? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Because\u2026.. isn\u2019t my face disgusting? \u201d</p><br/><p>Katsuo\u2019s face must look awful right now. From a normal perspective, Katsuo\u2019s face was definitely the more disgusting one. But, he knew that it wouldn\u2019t have any meaning in saying that.</p><br/><p>\u201d How so? Isn\u2019t it cute? \u201d</p><br/><p>As tears flowed down his face, Katsuo roughly rubbed Shou\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Shou, isn\u2019t face simply one part of you? For example, if I am to undergo plastic surgery, I would still be me. No matter how I dress myself up, I am still me. Do you understand? \u201d</p><br/><p>Shou gave a tiny nod.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then\u2026 let\u2019s say there is a beautiful Onee-chan. She might hate the dressed-up and after-surgery me because she thinks that it doesn\u2019t suit me. Another might like me because she thinks I might be rich because I have the money to do all that. And another might like me for me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Katsuo took a breather.</p><br/><p>\u201d But, I am still me. Nothing changed. I might be trying to make some people like me but I am still me. In the end, it\u2019s simply one factor. There is still a lot more. So, you are right. You can live on without your face. \u201d</p><br/><p>Shou\u2019s eyes trembled a bit.</p><br/><p>No wait. Tears started spilling out of those eyes. It gathered under his eyes and not long, flowed down his face.</p><br/><p>Shou suddenly moved.</p><br/><p>\u201d I tried my best! I know weaknesses can become a strong point for some people. Like how some comedians are great at making faces. But\u2026. I\u2019m scared! I can\u2019t do anything! That\u2019s why\u2026. I am scared of being hated! \u201d</p><br/><p>Katsuo smiled, his face wrinkling.</p><br/><p>\u201d Stupid, I am here, aren\u2019t I? I don\u2019t judge by face. Any grandson of mine is cute! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That doesn\u2019t make sense. You are not making any sense, Grandpa. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Shou still had big fat tears falling down his cheeks but at the same time, the corners of his mouth rose and he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

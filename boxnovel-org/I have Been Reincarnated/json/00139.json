The district itself was flat but there were numerous hills littered along the south side of it, as if surrounding or protecting the area.</p><br/><p>Although not the the extend of a \u2018mountain\u2019, they were still pretty big. You would have trouble trying to go up those hills on foot.</p><br/><p>Hey, but there were still some that treated it as a walk in the park. It was even more so the case when climbing up with friends. With steps carved onto the hills, it felt like hiking along with friends.</p><br/><p>But the ones who think that were only Selphy and I.</p><br/><p>Be it a city boy, or an indoor-person who studied until he could pass the skipping-of-grades exams, Zen was panting not before long. Selphy, on the contrary, was humming to herself as she walked along my side. As expected of an elf who lived in the forest. This hill was nothing compared to the forest.</p><br/><p>The sight of the district in the distance, shined brightly, as if a Matsuri was talking place. It must be bustling with noise over there right now.</p><br/><p>Right around now, Buu-san must be setting up his cart on the streets, as opposed to the morning market where he usually set it up, on my request. When it came to a fireworks show, of course there must be food around!</p><br/><p>FUHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p><br/><p>\u201d Wi-will, how much further are we? \u201d</p><br/><p>When I was laughing loudly inside my heart, a heavily panting Zen asked.</p><br/><p>\u201d Around 100m more I think. \u201d</p><br/><p>Before I could answer, Selphy had already answered it for me. It should be the first time she was climbing this hill so why was she so clear about it? How mysterious.</p><br/><p>Oh! Selphy had the secret weapon called \u2018Faeries\u2019 up her sleeve. I found out when we were on our way over. She had turned the previous problem that was plaguing her into a weapon she could used. She earned my respect for doing something I couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201d We are nearing the trees right about now. \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy said, providing additional information. The area we were walking on right now had no trees but was instead filled with grass, looking every aspect like a grassland. I had always came here for a picnic. Before I enrolled into the academy, I was rather free apart from the studies, training and the occasional bouts of doing business and so I came here often.</p><br/><p>Eh? Was it fun to have a picnic on my own here? I am going to cry soon so please stop assuming that about me. I said nothing about coming over here on my own.</p><br/><p>I only said that I had no friends around my age, but I did had quite a few friends of different ages. Like John-Sensei and Chiffon, Buu-san or Bibinyaru-san, or even those merchants I did business with!</p><br/><p>Eh, those were only my tutor, attendant and business partners and not my friends? Sh-shut up!</p><br/><p>Anyway, I was not alone when I came here to had a picnic.</p><br/><p>Those thoughts ran through my mind as we got near the densely packed trees / forest, and before I knew it, the sight before my eyes opened up and there was suddenly a space on top of the hill.</p><br/><p>The preparations for the fireworks had already been set up there. And many uncles were busily squirming about\u2026 cough, working. That was because I ordered quite a large number of fireworks\u2026.</p><br/><p>The person-in-charged whom I met with was going \u201d This is the first time I did something as big as this! This will change everything! \u201d with his eyes sparkling.</p><br/><p>Oh well. I\u2019m gonna ignored that because the first fireworks show without it being solely being enjoyed by couples was about to start! I was going to input the correct thinking into these people!</p><br/><p>\u201d Uwah\u2026..!! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Woah! Awesome! Look at the number of them!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen and Selphy remarked in admiration. That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! I puffed my chest in pride. Seeing that, Father looked at me, grinning.</p><br/><p>\u201d What is this?! Are all of them fireworks?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen shouted, a face full of disbelieved. I had ordered according to the scale of a Japan\u2019s firework show and as the show here was simply a few shots here and there, the numbers might seemed huge to them. The area filled with boxes and boxes of fireworks must had looked majestic to them. Even Father let out a whistle of surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201d Master Will! \u201d</p><br/><p>As we stood there, a middle-aged uncle came running towards us.</p><br/><p>\u201d To think you specially delivered it to us! We could have go over to take it instead! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Good evening, Bran-san. I wanted to let my friends take a look at the scenery up here too so no worries. \u201d</p><br/><p>In contrast with his shaven head and fierce eyes, he was a really polite person. What a large man. He was around 2m in height. Was he the master?</p><br/><p>\u201d I say, Master Bran, that was sneaky of you to rush over here first! \u201d</p><br/><p>From behind, a person running frantically over was none other that the in-charged I had spoken to. He had downtrodden eyes with curly green hair, looking every bit like a person who lazed about all day long. Ah, I\u2019m sorry, that was quite rude, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Hmm, how about someone who looked weak?</p><br/><p>And what was so sneaky? He didn\u2019t talk like that from at the beginning but as we met, he was beginning to change his way of speaking. I wondered if he was revealing his true self or was I influencing his way of speaking? I\u2019m really sorry if it\u2019s the latter.</p><br/><p>\u201d Gurus-san, what are you in such a hurry for? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d What, you say! Of course it was because the figure of hope, Will-sama is here! How can I not hurry?! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Really. You don\u2019t have to say that just because I\u2019m a Noble\u2019s son. I\u2019m really fine with all that, you know? \u201d</p><br/><p>To ran all the way, leaving his work in preparing for the show was because I am still a noble. A Duke\u2019s son, on top of that. That fact had always slipped by me because I was used to my commoner\u2019s life in my previous life. I hate myself sometimes for forgetting about it because it caused troubles like this.</p><br/><p>But when I made that reply, Gurus-san gave me a stunned look.</p><br/><p>\u201d What are you talking about?! I don\u2019t care if you are a noble or not but you\u2019re my hope! Of course I have to welcome you! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You have no idea how many thanks we have for Master Will! There is just no words that would express our thanks! \u201d</p><br/><p>Such moving words. Something, my eyes were drooling again, Must be my age. Ah! I\u2019m only 8, a ha ha ha ha ha!</p><br/><p>But\u2026 I see.</p><br/><p>Now I felt like thanking them too. I\u2019m happy they did not do it just because I\u2019m a noble. And everything happened because our interest met each other\u2019s perfectly. I did not meant to helped them, it was just that when I decided to hold a fireworks show, they had been worrying about their sales of fireworks being so low. It was really all a coincidence. And a business as well.</p><br/><p>And there were a mountain of reasons why they really shouldn\u2019t felt thankful to me. And yet they did. It made me happy that it was all because of my actions. Was my vow in my previous life to live a life without my looks staring to work now?</p><br/><p>Without realizing it, I was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201d It goes for me too, thank you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Smiling widely to cover the fact that drool was about to dripped from my eyes, the voice that came out was trembling instead. How embarrassing. As I lay dejected over that, I heard a panicking voice.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah!! Ah!! I\u2019m sorry!! Master! \u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Gurus-san had realized that my father was standing behind me all along. In a way, he was really a big shot. Father and Mother had auras that was sparkling brightly. Were they that happy that I was thanked? Thank you. No, or were they simply going crazy over all there fireworks here?</p><br/><p>Ah, no matter which, I\u2019m glad they looked happy.</p><br/><p>Father shook his head, telling them he didn\u2019t mind and went ahead with greetings. I really felt like I wanted to continue working along with them for all the future fireworks shows.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I cannot believe that it is that kind of door which requires you to answer what the craved word is in order to open it.</p><br/><p>When I finally get my bearings back, the moment I take a step forward, towards the partially opened door, a loud voice is heard.</p><br/><p>\u201d YOU. What did you do! \u201d</p><br/><p>I look behind, to the direction of the voice and see a blond, blue-eyes boy that is stomping towards me angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201d Is it not me who is in charge of the door this year?! \u201d</p><br/><p>Reaching where we stand, his face is flushed and he seems to be panting. It is quite difficult to differentiate if he is panting from anger of because of him running over\u2026 But he looks really angry.</p><br/><p>\u201d Besides, aren\u2019t you guys simply commoners? \u201d</p><br/><p>With a face that is as though looking down on us, he begins rambling. He keeps on grunting stuff like how he finally gets this position after using his connections and increases in his complaining to fit in about how great his family is.</p><br/><p>Slowly, people start to gather around.</p><br/><p>The thing I am so eager to avoid in class is happening here, now. Ignoring the heated young noble aside, I whisper to Zen.</p><br/><p>\u201d Who is he? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Who\u2026. Will, did you not pay attention to the self-introductions in class just now? We are in the same class and he is a noble too. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen direct his shocked gaze at me. Please don\u2019t think that all nobles are the same and we don\u2019t all know each other.</p><br/><p>He is still grumbling about something. So noisy.</p><br/><p>Even though I am turning a deaf ear on him all the while, I am getting annoyed.</p><br/><p>If I am to guess, it seems to be a welcome event which the door to the dorm is set with a charm which prevents the first-years from entering. In which he would then appear, solve it and open the door. And he is angry at me, a commoner or so he thinks, has opened the door instead.</p><br/><p>\u201d Even though I had already compromised by agreeing to live with commoners, what is with these guys? \u201d</p><br/><p>It is gradually getting so much more annoying. As I let out a deep sigh, I smile bitterly at that, which is seen by Mr Young Noble.</p><br/><p>\u201d And? Who are you and what did we do to you? \u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly being spoken to when I have been silent all the time surprises me. Mr Young Noble is silent for a while before sneering.</p><br/><p>\u201d You think you are so important, isn\u2019t it? Not knowing who I am. Oh my, oh my. Being unable to remember despite hearing it once is so pitiful. \u201d</p><br/><p>There are too many useless words in there.</p><br/><p>\u201d There\u2019s no choice, I shall teach you. I am the next head of the Count family, Mi Sociunnov. \u201d</p><br/><p>He says proudly while I am extremely troubled. I think he says something about his status but whatever.</p><br/><p>Mi Sociunnov\u2026</p><br/><p>[TN: \u30df\u30a3\uff1d\u30bd\u30b7\u30eb\u30ce\u30d5, Mi Soshirunofu ]</p><br/><p>I tremble, trying my best to suppress my laughter.</p><br/><p>Mi Sociunnov\u2026 Misoshirunofu\u2026 Miso Siru no fu\u2026</p><br/><p>[TN: \u306e. Miso Siru is Miso soup and fu a kind of wheat bread. ]</p><br/><p>What is that. Announcing your name in such a proud way\u2026! That name is too unique!</p><br/><p>Ah, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. It is rude to laugh at someone else\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Though, my funny bone is definitely stroked. And when I hang my head down and tremble, it is being mistaken for something as I hear an exaggerated laughter from above.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh, are you scared? It can\u2019t be helped, you, who did not know, shall be forgiven\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>When I show him a smiling face, he is surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201d I thought no matter the status, everyone in school studying is a student, am I wrong? \u201d</p><br/><p>Smiling even wider, I give a graceful and shallow bow.</p><br/><p>\u201d Since you specially introduced yourself, it would be rude of me not to. I am the next head of the Duke Family, Williams Beryl. Nice to meet you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Smile.</p><br/><p>Dark.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, he is finally silent.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: This is really short. So sorry.</p><br/><p>But I wanted a punch line.</p><br/><p>So the rest is not needed.</p><br/><p>I kinda do love this kind of development.</p><br/><p>TN: Ah, I thought I would take another 2 days since I took a day off to rest yesterday but\u2026 short chapter. Enjooy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

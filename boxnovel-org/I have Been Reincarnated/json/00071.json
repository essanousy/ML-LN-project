They were strong enough to pass through the Demon Forest with minimal number of guards.</p><br/><p>When passing through the forest, they were attacked countless times by demon beasts, thieves and bandits. To remain alive after all that proved their strength and how many they had killed. There were many times where they faced death.</p><br/><p>Which were why.</p><br/><p>Brainwashed into Shadows, they killed many innocent people and the guilt gnawed at them. The guilt that hanged over Buhual might be even deeper than Chiffon. Which was why he did not seek death like her. To him, he had a place he had to return to and things he had to protect.</p><br/><p>Just because he was forced to do the thing he did, did not make it right. Nor did he think that he would be forgiven. He understood that painfully. But he had something he needed to do which was why he had to continue on.</p><br/><p>You might think it was stupid. You might think that he was just adding on to his sins.</p><br/><p>And when he was released from the Slave Collar, he was assaulted by nightmares over and over. The guilt tortured him and caused his whole body to tremble. It was something he could never forget. He had not expected to be forgiven, nor did he pray for forgiveness. But even so.</p><br/><p>Now, he would instinctively save anyone\u2019s life if he could. It might be to repay for him being saved, or his feeling of just wanting to help. Or even possibly to remind himself of how fortunate he was right now by looking at their plight. He did not think he would be forgiven, and yet he realized that he was somehow trying to redeem himself little by little.</p><br/><p>And now, Buhual, who went back to being a merchant, started helping anyone who needed it. He learned the art of lifesaving from Will so in a way, Caralsdoni was very lucky.</p><br/><p>Ah, but since he was used by Spinel just to gauge Will\u2019s abilities, maybe it was better to say that the innocent him who was dragged into this mess to be extremely unlucky.</p><br/><p>Buhual, in a half-kidnapped way, brought Caralsdoni back to his house and started nursing the very confused Caralsdoni back into health.</p><br/><p>Caralsdoni, who hadn\u2019t eaten anything for a few days, was in a malnourished state so Buhual fed him porridge and forced him into bed. By the way, let\u2019s keep it a secret that Caralsdoni was trembling with fear when Buhual hauled him over to the bed.</p><br/><p>But it was true that Caralsdoni was exhausted. He was forced into this situation all of a sudden but seeing as how he was given food and even a place to sleep, it seemed like Buhual was not out to hurt him. Once he knew that, the highly-strung him just let loose and fell into a deep slumber.</p><br/><p>Looking at the deeply asleep driftwood, Buhual let out a sigh of relief. At the same moment, a wave of regret came over him.</p><br/><p>What to do?</p><br/><p>He did not think through this properly.</p><br/><p>Looking at the thing he brought back home with him, he sighed again. This complicates his future plans. Before Buhual started having this people-saving streak, he was a merchant. He had made plans with Bibinyaru to head over to Elzmu to trade spices. And that\u2019s the problem. And he cannot leave him with his family. Buhual sighed again.</p><br/><p>Looking back at his action objectively, he came to know how bad it looked. He sighed again. He shouldn\u2019t have lost himself in happiness when his CPR worked. Thinking back, he had carried that guy under his arm the moment he came to and even brought him to his house without any explanation\u2026..</p><br/><p>It just looked like kidnapping.</p><br/><p>But to think that guy did not struggle or yell during the entire time. He can\u2019t help but praised that middle-aged man. After being through that period of being a Shadow, he too, wouldn\u2019t yell if he was put through the same thing but rather than saying he had nerves of steel, it might be because he was just confused.</p><br/><p>The good thing about having been a shadow was the improvement in his strength and adaptability. Thanks to that, he was able to pass through the Demon Forest without hiring any guards. Plus another thing\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Looking at the goods he had gathered and was planning to sell, sitting at the corner of the room, Buhual smiled.</p><br/><p>Anyway, he can asked about what had happened to that guy when he wakes up tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was just excited about the negotiation that was coming soon with Mr.Specialty.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.\u300a\u300b? \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Ninja]</p><br/><p>At the words that carelessly spilled out of my mouth, the completely black Ninja twitched in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026 Indeed. \u201d</p><br/><p>It was my turn to be surprised at his words. Really? A ninja? Then I remembered.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Yes, this must be the work of First Founder.</p><br/><p>\u201d I would like to ask how you came to know the name First King granted my family. \u201d</p><br/><p>As I expected. I looked at the silent man who looked like he wanted do something.</p><br/><p>He was around 165~170cm tall. Although he was on the shorter side, regretfully as we were 8~10 years kids, we had to look up to him. He then suddenly bowed and lowered his head.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Zen and I both gulped down our breath. There was no need to rely on my previous memories for this. The lowering of one\u2019s head \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 in other words, an apology.</p><br/><p>\u201d I deeply apologized. Even if it was for work, it was rude and impolite of me to peek into your private life. \u201d</p><br/><p>It was easier to accept such a straight-forward response. I could sense apology and respect emitting from his entire body. This person was probably quite smart. Anyone would find it hard to believe it was an 8 years old kid like me. Which was why he was apologizing. He understood by theory yet his heart was unable to accept it.</p><br/><p>At this Ninja-san, I grinned and gave an answer. Respect shall be responded with respect. This was common sense, no matter between Japanese or Elzmu\u2019s Nobles. By no means have I found the ninja cosplay amusing. Not in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201d Don\u2019t worry about it. This is the matter the nation so it is natural to want to confirm the authenticity of the information. I don\u2019t mind it at all. Please raise your head. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I thank you for your leniency, Williams-sama. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Ninja-san lifted his head up and our eyes met. His eyes narrowed in worry and he continued speaking.</p><br/><p>By the way, during the entire time, Zen was frozen on the spot without moving. It was slightly regretful that it was not Alcumedes-san who appeared but if he continued like this he is going to turn into a statue. Glancing at Zen, I chuckled as I listened to Ninja-san.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sorry for not introducing myself. I am the leader of Black Knights Intelligence Corps under His Majesty, Zirco Ninja. Once again, I ask for your cooperation in this matter. \u201d</p><br/><p>At Zirco, who came to glance at Zen as well, I quickly nodded.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>To hide my face. So it was not that his occupation was a ninja but his family name!</p><br/><p>Uh.</p><br/><p>First Founder, I fear you.</p><br/><p>Within that short moment of hiding my face, I rearranged my expression into a serious one, lifted my head and placed my hand on Zen\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201d So. I\u2019ll be going. \u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving that, I followed Zirco-san back into the ceiling. As the removed panel was being placed back into place, it\u2019s a secret that I snickered when a hysterical voice was heard going \u2018 Eh, eh\u2026\u2026?\u2019 from below.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Moving along, Zirco and Will reached the impressive front door of the Academy. Different from Will, who was thinking off the tracks that he had been moving around a lot today, Zirco was trying his best to remain calm.</p><br/><p>He was lured by Will, who was staring at the door absentmindedly into staring at it as well before an \u2018Ah.\u2019 was heard coming from Will about his clothes. His black ninja clothes changed into common clothes in an instant and was being called as \u2018THE ILLUSION SHOW\u2019 in secret by Will. It was all Zirco\u2019s skill. If he was to come to Earth and work as a magician, he would be at the level where he would own a part of the moon.</p><br/><p>But Zirco had a reason for acting like that.</p><br/><p>It was because of that child in front of him. Not only was he found out when he was hiding in the ceiling, he was blown away by Will\u2019s show of intelligence from his reply as well as his polished and elegant movement. Furthermore, Zirco, who used wind to assist him to jump back into the space above the ceiling, Will managed to do so without any help whatsoever and even placed the panel back into its place for him.</p><br/><p>And he got amazed further. The wind technique passed down in the Ninja family was seen through in an instant. Zirco was totally defeated. Normally, one could not use a magic technique just because one had seen it once. You would have to understand the working and the minute details of the spell and with a suitable balance of mana before being able to active.</p><br/><p>Plus Zirco did it chantlessly. He had carved the intonation, the meaning of the incantation as well as the tone into his brain after repeating it millions of time and was able to finally activate it just by thinking of the image of the incantation. Besides, he was casting it without using any excess mana. As for Will, his brain was already wired in Japanese which was why he had no problems with casting spells chantlessly.</p><br/><p>And Zirco was troubled for not knowing that fact. Seeing as to how Will succeeded in casting spells chantlessly, the painstaking effort he had put in since young looked so absurd now. His heart felt like it was breaking.</p><br/><p>In spite of that, Zirco managed to maintain his silence and suppressed his urge to sigh which made him feel like praising himself.</p><br/><p>Anyway, the important thing right how was Abi\u2019s case and the name Caralsdoni provided by Will.</p><br/><p>Luckily, Elzmu had a flourishing capital. Composing himself, Zirco randomly entered one of the eateries lined up. And to the people inside, seeing a common-attired man together with a uniformed boy, anyone would thought they were father and son or even brothers. No one would think twice about them.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Understood. Let\u2019s find out who Caralsdoni really is. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Is it alright telling me that? \u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the nodding Zirco, Will teasingly asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201d There is no problem. I will send a letter out within Elzmu immediately. No matter if you are the mastermind or get dragged into this incident, it does not change the fact that you are involved with this matter. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco declared, having found the way to have fun with it. All he needed to do was to not treat Will as an 8 years old kid. You could say he got enlightenment or he just gave up understanding.</p><br/><p>He was unexpectedly bold, Zirco wondered to himself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

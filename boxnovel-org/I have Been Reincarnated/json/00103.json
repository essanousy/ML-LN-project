Books that were taken out from the desk drawers were sprawled on top of the desk for a long time now.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026It\u2019s useless\u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Muttering that to himself, Zen stood up.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, he didn\u2019t understand. For the skipping of grades exam, he had borrowed a book from the library but he was far from understanding what it wrote.</p><br/><p>To Zen, who was aiming to skip grades, this was a matter of life and death.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015When Will was first gone, he faced no problems. But, as early as the 2nd day, problems that he did not understand appeared and as he continued reading, those problems just kept accumulating. Finally, he didn\u2019t even feel like opening the book any longer.</p><br/><p>It had not even been a week.</p><br/><p>To Zen, rather than not understanding the book, the truth scared him more. Ah, but he still was troubled over the fact that he couldn\u2019t understand it.</p><br/><p>Before he knew it, he had totally relied on Will.</p><br/><p>And now, Zen had realized that.</p><br/><p>Right now, the only \u2018official\u2019 request from Zen to Will was only the study session held every Saturday. Which was why, when Will \u2018disappeared\u2019, leaving only a note saying \u2018I am playing truant\u2019, he felt a tiny bit offended and did not even think that he would have problems with his studies. He thought since he was not being taught by Will all that much, he must have understood those questions on his own.</p><br/><p>But no.</p><br/><p>And it was proven by Will\u2019s absurd \u2018playing truant\u2019 stunt.</p><br/><p>Thinking back, Will and Zen were often \u2018talking\u2019 in their room. Zen did not remember having asked the answer to questions or asking Will to teach him but no, that was what happened. Will was supporting Zen without him realizing it.</p><br/><p>Zen wouldn\u2019t lie that it was not vexing. But, he also knew Will was an out-of-the-norm existence.</p><br/><p>And right now, Zen\u2019s head was filled with questions that were most likely to appear from the [Skipping of Grades Exams] in July. No matter what, he had to pass that exam but there was no way he could solve those questions. At 1 month before the exam, which was now, he finally realized that he was actually not that great at studying.</p><br/><p>\u201d This is terrible\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen muttered as he hugged his head.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>As the validation of the magic tool was over, I left John-sensei and teleported to the Hall of Shadows.</p><br/><p>I came here once before when I was anxious about Spinel\u2019s death but this time, I was just making sure. It was difficult to think that people living in the city were observing my every move every second, but, just in case. It would be unnatural to see someone who had not even come out of the house to walk back in.</p><br/><p>I was, however, slightly worried about my future for being over-dependent on this really convenient magic.</p><br/><p>I was not wrong, was I? If there was not even the need to walk, the physical strength of my legs would decrease. It was unexpectedly important to build up the foundation of one\u2019s body when they were young. The health of a person who did exercise when they were young and those who did not, were going to be totally different when they grew old. Those without exercise would find it hard to even walk fast, and their immunity would be weak which caused them to fall sick easily. For the worst case, they would become bedridden once they reach their retirement age. That might be going a little too far\u2026. anyway, one must not make light of the shortage of exercising. It was something to be feared. Eh, but since this world did not have a lifetime employment system, there would be no retirement age to speak of.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Or rather, forget about that! \u2026..What was I saying? Ah, that\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>Teleport.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s keep this magic as my trump card.</p><br/><p>Only an idiot would flaunt their trump card. Well, although there existed a strategy of showing it off in order to pressure the opponent and I aimed to use this strategy wisely.</p><br/><p>But, it didn\u2019t mean to show all of my trump card. It all depended on the place, purpose and judgement. Here, was not where I should show my teleport. I shall be the one to judge when and where to use it.</p><br/><p>Because I was not an idiot!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.Un, I.. was not, right?</p><br/><p>It must be just the wind blowing that I misheard as that I did quite a number of idiotic stuff in Hattuo.</p><br/><p>Mah, there were no choice in regard to this case.</p><br/><p>I was not supposed to do anything.</p><br/><p>But it was an urgent matter.. A kid went to the royal castle and was commanded by a scholar working there\u2026. requested, before driven away you know?</p><br/><p>Ah, it might also be a little rude to just teleport away right in front of Zirco-san without saying anything\u2026! Tee hee! Will did it~!</p><br/><p>\u2026.I was really sorry, I was totally in the wrong.</p><br/><p>Calm down.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s add this to this year\u2019s resolution. Reflection.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am really sorry!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>And thus, the me who lowered my head right after I teleported again.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Ah, I somewhat managed to cover it all over and after explaining the magic tool to Zirco-san, he had on a dumbfounded as well as a relief expression as I imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201d So that\u2019s it\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Zirco-san said, looking at the ceiling as he nodded, before a wryly smile came back.</p><br/><p>\u201d But, I thought my heart would stop when Will-dono disappeared all of a sudden. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..That is\u2026 I am really sorry about that. \u201d</p><br/><p>I lowered my head, which induced more wryly smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Really a person who lacks common sense. \u201d</p><br/><p>The small mutter by Zirco-san was, unfortunately, heard by my sharp ears.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Really, I was really sorry for that. Lacking in calmness and being impolite, this William, had already deeply reflected on it so please forgive me! Yay!</p><br/><p>Ah, I should not be fooling around.</p><br/><p>I was reflecting on it but right now, I was facing a serious problem. It was time for my curfew.</p><br/><p>\u201d By the way, Zirco-san. I am really sorry but\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I looked down at my watch and Zirco-san seemed to catch the drift.</p><br/><p>\u201d It is already this time\u2026 Ah, come to think of it, Will-dono is only 8\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>To the muttering Zirco-san, I slowly stood up.</p><br/><p>Well, I was too\u2026. in a completely off-mode right now.</p><br/><p>Standing up, I stepped forward and all of a sudden, the floor I was stepping on gave a click as it registered my foot. Before I knew it, I fell into a dark place.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Where, is this? \u201d</p><br/><p>Somehow managing to land safely, I looked around me and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015There was really no need to raise a flag here at all!!</p><br/><p>If Zirco-san was not standing above me with a panicked face, I would have cried.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

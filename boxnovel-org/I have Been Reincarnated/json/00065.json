You don\u2019t seem worried at all, Eidus. \u201d</p><br/><p>At the words of Headmaster, Eidus, the man combs his hand up through his black hair. Abi, as rumored, was a legendary beast. According to rumors, it had once destroyed a small country in Hadazerl in a day. And now, it appeared in Phillis Academy, which was situated in the Capital. It was normal that the man would feel like hugging his own head.</p><br/><p>But, looking at the man in-charge of the Academy in front of him, he seemed to be suppressing a smile and his tone of voice carried an air of nonchalant. It was said that Abi possessed huge magic power as well as high intelligence. It can\u2019t be that Eidus, being that strong, had come to request for help\u2026.? Depending on the situation, there might be a need to mobilize the Black Knights. As the man was deep in thoughts, Eidus answered.</p><br/><p>\u201d Abi was defeated, your Majesty. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Wh\u2026what? \u201d</p><br/><p>The man called \u2018your Majesty\u2019, was the current king of Elzmu, Kesamu Milla Oio Lanalice De Elzmu. During when he was flushing out all the rotten people, his honored teacher, Eidus, had requested to submit his report in person via a communication tool 3 days ago. In order to make time for that, he had rushed to complete all important documents and business.</p><br/><p>And when he heard that the report was about Abi infiltrating the Academy, he cursed himself for not making time earlier and was already thinking of several ways about handling the situation when Eidus\u2019 words made him doubted his ears.</p><br/><p>He wondered if he had heard it wrongly and with his face cramping, he managed to continue the conversation.</p><br/><p>But he had not expected to fumble with his words. In order to keep himself calm, he pretended that it did not happen. As the previous words gnawed at him, he tried to prepare himself for Eidus\u2019 answer. But once again, Eidus\u2019 answer threw him off his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201d A student who happened to be present defeated it. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>What was that.</p><br/><p>After the audience with Eidus, Kesamu was walking towards his private room. The rushed-yet-still-proper sound of walking resounded down the stone-build corridor. The reason why it was not carpeted seemed to be because it was the preference of the previous King.</p><br/><p>Anyway, that mattered not. Rushing into his room, Kesamu banged open his door and headed straight towards the connecting room and opened the cover of the communication tool placed there.</p><br/><p>\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 He wanted explanation for what he heard.</p><br/><p>Thinking of sending a letter, he reached into the tool, only to find a letter sealed with a wax seal that he had seen millions of times before already there.</p><br/><p>\u201d That Gion, he sends a letter? \u201d</p><br/><p>Letting out a deep sigh, he tore open the letter as he headed towards his desk. Leaning onto a chair, which was bound in red leather as if to confirmed that it was really a chair made fit for a king, Kesamu ran his eyes over the letter.</p><br/><p>\u201d After reading this, I like your reply\u2026.O, oi! \u201d</p><br/><p>Having finally sat on the chair, Kesamu jumped up from it. He scratched his head, trying to calm himself down as he headed towards the communication tool once again. Opening the wooden box, among the bunch of levers, a receiver tool was sitting there. Lowering the innermost lever, he took the tool out.</p><br/><p>At that, a crisp *Ching* sounded.</p><br/><p>Then a *Clunk*.</p><br/><p>The transmission was received (Gion).</p><br/><p>\u201d Kept me waiting, Kesamu. \u201c</p><br/><p>The manner of speaking can be heard as impolite. Listening to that, one can see that Gion and Kesamu were old friends. Yes, they were classmates from the same Phillis Academy. Which was why, if it was only the 2 of them, there was no need for all the stiffness. Kesamu too, was thankful for this \u2018bad friend\u2019 that spoke without reserve.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh, I came directly after meeting with Eidus. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d He told me. In that case, there is no need to explain. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201d That. What is going on, Gion. What is it with your son? \u201d</p><br/><p>Kesamu pressed for an answer. It was Williams, Gion\u2019s son who defeated Abi. Kesamu could not believe it. First of all, he heard nothing about Gion\u2019s son being that strong. But Eidus won\u2019t lie. Kesamu was utterly stumped. Could it be Gion who did it secretly? All the unanswered questions was making him irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Kesamu, do you remember the incident 3 years ago? \u201c</p><br/><p>As if reading his mind, Gion dropped his tone of voice.</p><br/><p>\u201d 3 years ago\u2026the Anti-Kingdom incident? \u201d</p><br/><p>Kesamu was the King. Therefore, almost all incidents were reported to him, and the amount was enormous. A lot of incidents had happened within the 3 years\u2019 time frame but if it was a big one, it could only be the flushing-out-rebels incident that happened.</p><br/><p>\u201d That one. At that time, I said it was all due to traps I had set at my residence. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026!!! \u201d</p><br/><p>Kesamu became speechless at Gion\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201d Can it be\u2026.. I see.. \u201d</p><br/><p>As one would expected from the \u2018Wise\u2019 King. Just by Gion\u2019s few words, Kesamu had grasped the meaning.</p><br/><p>\u201d Most likely there is a puppet master pulling the strings behind those Anti-Kingdom rebels. I am still currently in the midst of investigating, which is why I haven\u2019t reported it to you. I apologize for that. Really sorry. \u201c</p><br/><p>Gion truly apologetic voice came through the tool. Kesamu laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, I understand the importance of making sure. About that, I will entrust it to you. It\u2019s fine to report to me after. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d That would help a great deal. \u2026..The attack this time round, did you know that it was a summoned beast? \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201d Yea. Are you saying it\u2019s those guys 3 years ago? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d The enemy is smarter than we thought. They even managed to gauge Will\u2019s abilities. If I have the chance\u2026 \u201c</p><br/><p>Gion\u2019s voice started wavering and Kesamu was wondering if that was Gion\u2019s black aura leaking out of the receiver he was seeing. Flustered, Kesamu tried to understand what Gion had just said.</p><br/><p>Did that mean that the enemy was doubtful of how the Shadows were caught and they aimed for the moment Will entered the Academy, where security was the thinnest, to attack? But he just realized there was something he cannot overlook in Gion\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201d Wait..wait a minute. Summoned beast? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..! Ah, sorry, I was distracted. Yes, that\u2019s the problem this time. With Abi being a summoned beast, it means that its owner was somewhere near. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201d That is\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Kesamu unintentionally groaned. As he stayed silent, Gion started speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yea, that\u2019s the problem. You can ask about the details from Will, he is more useful than some of those around you. Plus, I left the investigation to my subordinate in the capital. Most likely we won\u2019t be able to find anything but if we do, I\u2019ll inform you. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201d As expected, you sure work fast. Got it. I had also confirmed that you are one of those idiot parents. \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the line was cut off.</p><br/><p>But still, to think Abi was a summoned beast.</p><br/><p>Kesamu groaned again. Even if he had taken into account that the rumors about Abi might be exaggerated, he had the words of Gion. Which means, from Gion\u2019s word, Abi was as strong as rumored.</p><br/><p>As he had not heard any details from Eidus, he can\u2019t make any conclusion yet. In that case\u2026. it would have to be from Will. He would have to make sure that Gion was not just a simple idiot parent. Smiling, Kesamu mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300a\u300b \u201d [TN: Shokan, Summon]</p><br/><p>*Pop*, a sound like popcorn popping went off as the room lit up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Did you called, Master? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh, Alcumedes. I want you to go to Phillis Academy and tell Williams Beryl to make a trip down. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d As you wished. \u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving a phrase that if heard by Will, will retort about how oldish-sounding that was, Kesamu\u2019s summoned beast dissipated.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d Sigh. \u201d</p><br/><p>Sitting on my chair, I let loose a deep sigh. At the pleasant morning, I was already tired. And depressed. There was totally nothing refreshing about me right now.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Especially my mentality. Physically, I\u2019m still okay.</p><br/><p>\u201d What\u2019s wrong, making such a deep sigh. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen, who was sitting besides me, asked. Because this and that happened. Yesterday, apart from the crystal ball, I even foolishly destroyed the classroom. Ah, but when the morning came, everything was repaired. Yep. Viva magic. How wonderful.</p><br/><p>But it was natural for me to be depressed. I tentatively went back to my room yesterday but I was definitely going to be called out. I wondered if they have suspension from school. But this was a compulsory education right? No, I skipped grades so in the worst case, I might be expelled. It might be too much to ask a 10 years old to understand all these but I really wished he did notice.</p><br/><p>As I glared at Zen reflexively, a familiar sound was heard. It was the sound of Zelda-sensei slamming open the door. Looking at the direction of the sound by reflex, our eyes met. Then, as expected, he grinned and said.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will, the Headmaster is calling. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..Aah, see?</p><br/><p>I raised up dejectedly and left the classroom.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I stood in front of the \u2018public\u2019 Headmaster\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Foooh.</p><br/><p>I exhaled and took a deep breath. Yosh, calm down. It\u2019s okay, there was nothing to be afraid of. Then I raised my hand to knock on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201d You had come. \u201d [TN: Using a super polite way of saying]</p><br/><p>The door opened from the inside.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

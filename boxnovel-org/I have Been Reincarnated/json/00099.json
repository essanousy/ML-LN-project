It seemed like my face was ghastly pale. According to Zen, who was poking fun at me.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Argh, don\u2019t play around with your senior!</p><br/><p>Ah, it\u2019s alright. I am an adult and a gentleman. I shall forgive this trifling matter.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.sigh\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>A limp smile played on my face as I was dragged along by Zen and Selphy. I wondered what made them this desperate to get me to class. Was my presence that thin in their hearts? Were they going to offer me up as a sacrifice? Onii-san was going to cry.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Haiz. Let\u2019s just accept it. I was scared. The lesson of the 2nd period, no, to be more precise, I am shaking in terror that was very unbecoming of my age when facing Varino-Sensei. I don\u2019t care if you scold me \u2018uncool\u2019.</p><br/><p>I was not going to deny.</p><br/><p>During the moment I was thinking about these stuff, the classroom was slowly drawing closer.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Really, I felt that it\u2019s weird. What had I done to Varino-sensei? Nothing! The reason I was hated by him was all because of Father. What exactly did Father do to be hated that much by the gentle Varino-sensei?</p><br/><p>Hm, yep. I need to get an answer out of Father.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t accept being push to the edge without knowing what the reason was.</p><br/><p>And thus, we reached. The classroom.</p><br/><p>\u2026..hm?</p><br/><p>Was I imagining that everyone\u2019s gaze looking over was awfully frightening?</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Will, you will be attending lessons today, right? \u201d</p><br/><p>Turning around, Zen was glaring fiercely at me as he said that.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Un.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t say it but\u2026.. that gaze hurt.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Well well everyone, I had kept you waiting\u2026\u2026no one was waiting! Not even a little!</p><br/><p>It was the time for the smart and gentle Varino-sensei\u2019s fun fun lesson(blizard)!</p><br/><p>\u2026..Un, let\u2019s stop. It was futile to put all of my energy into flattering Varino-sensei within my heart.</p><br/><p>As my mind was continuing rambling, the door to the classroom opened. And from the other side, long and slender legs could be seen\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026William\u2026..Beryl! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Uwah?!? \u201d</p><br/><p>Letting out a foolish cry, I stood up by reflex. Because I can\u2019t help it! For some reason, the temperature right now was freezing cold, as if we were all plunged into a frozen wonderland. I had a feeling that if my butt continued to stay on my seat, it would be stuck frozen there.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.tsk. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ehhhhhhh\u30fcDid Varino-sensei just click his tongue?! It\u2019s my imagination right?! It was my imagination!!</p><br/><p>\u201d I wanted to ask time and time again why did you skip my lesson.. \u201d</p><br/><p>See, he started preaching like nothing happened.</p><br/><p>\u201d To not attend my summoning lesson seriously in the first place is not just about the question of what the rules are, do you not understand? Firstly, your safety. Even if you did summon the beast, it is still a magical beast. There is no way that is not dangerous. Second, the influence on your surroundings. If the summoned beast did not obey your commands, you are not the only one being troubled by that. Do you not understand? The people around you are being dragged into your problems as well. You already had a history of destroying the classroom, have you not\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Yes, I was totally wring dry.</p><br/><p>When Varino-sensei reluctantly started his lessons, the bell rang.</p><br/><p>Was that okay, I wonder. As an educator.</p><br/><p>And finally, after great pains, the long day was over as we made our way back towards our dormitory.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Really Will! Never ever miss a lesson again! \u2026..What is that, really? To go traveling on a whim. \u201d</p><br/><p>The one with that sharp tone was Selphy-san.</p><br/><p>I had no choice, did I? I cannot explain because it was a top secret mission given by the King himself so I made up an excuse on the spot towards the freezing Varino-sensei! Tee hee.</p><br/><p>Of course, that made things worst\u2026. no, at this stage, it was like injecting salt into ice to further freeze it\u2026. Maybe that might be the reason why the lecture time was dragged out. Even so, I did not do it! No, although I did skip the lesson! This, I did commit! But it was not like I did it cause I wanted to\u2026.ah, who was I kidding, I stuck my neck into that matter.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hahhh\u2026..Sorry\u2026 I won\u2019t anymore\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>My shoulders drooped as I hung my head down.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s good you understand. The days you are not around are really dreadful for the rest of us, you know. If you even skip lessons again, you would be facing the entire class! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I am sorry, really. I won\u2019t do it again. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yep. There was no way I can lift a hand against them.</p><br/><p>And when I decided on that.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.un\u2026.ir\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I think I heard someone mumbling something behind so I turned back.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm? Zen, did you say anything? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen, who was walking with his head down, lifted his head at my voice and shook his head, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh? I said nothing. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Hm\u2026\u2026 I see. Is it just me? \u201d</p><br/><p>I tilted my head as I continued walking.</p><br/><p>I was pretty sure I heard something\u2026. ah! Could it be\u2026.ghosts?! Or was it that? That \u2018legendary\u2019 huge snake that kills whenever your eyes meet its? I wonder it was slithering around in the pipes right now.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Yep, let\u2019s stop this reference.</p><br/><p>How scary, various stuff.</p><br/><p>Or rather, in this world, Basilisk very normally exists. Its existence might be closer to that of Shiro\u2019s. Not only that, magical beast\u2019s ghost as well as spirits were normally around the forest or at the grave sites.</p><br/><p>To hide the tiny trembles my body was doing, I started skipping.</p><br/><p>\u201d By, by the way, what was the lessons like when I am gone? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You mean Varino-sensei\u2019s? \u201d</p><br/><p>I changed the subject in a haste and Selphy responded.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep. If the next lesson is another lecture, I don\u2019t think I would be able to stand it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Ah, it\u2019s just normal lessons that Will most probably already knew. \u201d</p><br/><p>Selphy said enviously, a bitter smile playing on her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201d The last lesson was about determining the intention of sorts of the summoned beasts \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You meant the will of the summoned beasts? Ah, I see. Hmm.. So it means talking and coming in contact with your summoned beasts? \u201d</p><br/><p>I said as I made fun of Selphy with her unclear speech. If that was the case, I should be alright. During my travels, I summoned Shiro numerous times so there should be no problem regarding our communication!</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep, yep, that. Lilith-chan and I became quite close during that lesson. It was really fun. \u201d</p><br/><p>Realizing it, Selphy was glaring at me again.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Right now, everything that was related to Varino-sensei seemed to be a taboo subject. As I sighed inwardly, I tried to change the subject again.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Come to think of it, I had not met Selphy\u2019s summoned beast. \u2026..Lilith-chan? What species is she? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d A bird called Aska. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I see, Aska. \u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Let me explain. Aska is a bird-type magical beast, the size of a small Pterodactyl of which it could grow from. Knights would rode on it and it was used in scouting mission and was very popular with both adventurers and knights! A graduation of aquamarine to a greenish-brown spreads from its head till its tail so it had the perfect camouflage color to fly above a forest! It is also well-versed in wind magic, being not only able to record sounds, but even creating its own sound insulation.</p><br/><p>But that\u2019s not all!</p><br/><p>The following point is the important part.</p><br/><p>Aska loved the wind so much that it just glided in the air, like how fishes swam in the ocean. That was why, its other name is Tobutori. [TN: Flying Bird]</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Wasn\u2019t it just Hichou?! [TN: Flying Bird. Don\u2019t ask me but I think birds are supposed to fly.]</p><br/><p>Was what I retorted when I first came to know about Aska.</p><br/><p>As I recalled that in my mind, I hold onto the topic that I managed to change at great length.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Aska\u2019s color is aquamarine and a greenish-brown, just like Selphy, who has a beautiful head of yellow-green hair. The both of you are quite a perfect match. \u201d</p><br/><p>I forced a wide smile as I said that but Selphy immediately turned her head away. Was I really that hard to look at?</p><br/><p>Thank to that, Selphy stayed silent and I had no idea what to do. Even the ever-reliable Zen was silent.</p><br/><p>In the end, the rest of the journey was spent in silence.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: The very first of the scheduled posts.</p><br/><p>I had some scheduled posts lined up for the upcoming few releases as I won\u2019t be having internet nor the time to be translating for a while. I would need to settle down in Japan for a bit, get my internet, phone, bank account and what\u2019s not.</p><br/><p>All the better to serve you guys with.</p><br/><p>So I might not be able to update the chapter page so please bear with it. I\u2019ll get around to doing it once I have the time, and internet, so please don\u2019t rush me to update the chapter page.</p><br/><p>Well then, this was a fun chapter to translate. I missed the comedy inner monologue this novel is known for. Enjoy~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

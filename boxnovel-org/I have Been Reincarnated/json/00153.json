The soul state in which I was in during the visit to \u2018heaven\u2019 was fine, but I was warned that if I were to came back, even the air would be frozen.</p><br/><p>Hm. If I even thought about it a little I would had known. If I were to go about this without thinking it through, like now, and frozen even god himself, I would had died by suffocation. Once again, I had something to be thankful towards god-dad again.</p><br/><p>And so, the first thing I did after returning was to carved new words onto the magical tool. Hmm, it would be difficult to get the air moving with any water molecules.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300aApart from the minimal requirements in which William Beryl is required to continue living\u300b\u2026 That\u2019s a little long but, eh, let\u2019s just leave it at that. \u201d</p><br/><p>Releasing air and water from the time lock did take a little burden off the amount of consumption the tool need but it would be better for me to get everything done before it ran out of mana.</p><br/><p>Yosh, time to detect the mana presence in the [Demon Forest]\u2026 yes, what I was about to do was just one thing. Which was to destroy and destroy and destroy the herds of demon beasts!!</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s go!!</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Inter-dimension space was awesome.</p><br/><p>It deserved the \u2018awesome\u2019 tag when it was able to store that huge magical tool.</p><br/><p>And after running about in the [Demon Forest] for a while, I managed to cleared it all. Although it was a little boring to kill them all without them even resisting, it would just had to do. Since I was not in for the fun but instead trying to save the town as well as the people I loved.</p><br/><p>And so, I just kept mindlessly slaughtering. And in no time, the amount of demon beasts that I had killed could form a hill. The blood reeked too and it was getting really unbearable so I put them all into my inter-dimension space. I did get worried a little about how I was destroying the environment but since demon beasts do spawned on their own, it would revert back to their original state I guess.</p><br/><p>And after that cleansing, it was time to start repairing the forest. As the [Demon Forest] itself was a barrier, all the trees were part of it and once chopped or damaged in any way, the barrier would collapsed and demon beasts would rushed out.</p><br/><p>This was recorded in Terao\u2019s diary and I heard it directly from god too so it shouldn\u2019t be wrong. Global warming and mud slides happened due to trees being destroyed on Earth as well but it was just that the consequences came way faster in this world. We get attacked the moment the trees are destroyed.</p><br/><p>Easily understandable yet so dreadful.</p><br/><p>Which was why I need to repaired the forest back to the way it was. I then made my way towards the area where I heard the chopping sounds came from. And it would be killing 2 birds with 1 stone since those from Hattuo would be there too.</p><br/><p>\u201d What should I do.. \u201d</p><br/><p>From the countless web novels I read, most protagonist were bad in casting any forms of healing magic on plants but in reality, it was just that magic didn\u2019t work that great on plants. I wondered if this world was the same.</p><br/><p>I had no idea but I would only brute force through it. Although I was resisting a little about doing something like a brute would do. But since I had thought of that magic, it would be a waste not to used it. Plus imagination was the most important part for casting magic. And with the vision of a brute brute-forcing it all, I had the perfect image for the magic.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s just ignored how scary it would be if all the brutes of this world had the same image. Ignore, ignore. Stop saying I was part of that brute force army!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Please don\u2019t avoid me if I ever turned into a very macho and gorilla like man in the future. Macho was fine, wasn\u2019t it?! It\u2019s fine to shine like a bodybuilder, wasn\u2019t it?! Although I really don\u2019t want that to happened! Really, please spare me!</p><br/><p>No no no no, that would be extremely rude to Zelda-sensei if I were to thought that way. Yes. It still all came to mind clearly, that person\u2019s figure, that tan brown shining gorilla macho man in a t-back. No, I was not laughing at him at all.</p><br/><p>As I continued my idiotic inner monologue, I found people who looked like they were the Hattuo army. Because of the axes they were holding in their hands. And the most defining part was that they were wearing the exact same uniform Ivan-san was wearing when I forst saw him.</p><br/><p>Oi, Hattuo.</p><br/><p>Why were you wearing your country\u2019s army uniform when you were all sneaking into another country\u2019s land? Can\u2019t you do something about it? I can\u2019t helped but tsukkomi at their strategy.</p><br/><p>Somehow I felt tired. Well then, since I found then, let\u2019s just captured them all. As well as to rescued Zen\u2019s onee-san too. I shall start with Zen\u2019s onee-san.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u300a\u2026\u2026\u30b5\u30f3\u306e\u306e\u304a\u3055\u3093\u300b\u2026 Ooh, she\u2019s near! \u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Searching location\u2026. Zen\u2019s onee-san]</p><br/><p>Once I activated the tracking magic, a map appeared in my mind with a red dot showing the location of Zen\u2019s Onee-san. It was near to the flag that represented where I was. As I walked over, I captured all the Hattuo soldiers along the way and teleported them over to Manuel\u2019s camp.</p><br/><p>As I approached, a camp ground came into sight. I stared at it. The uniforms, this camping grounds, how careless and sloppy could they be?! Were they not thinking of hiding at all?</p><br/><p>And when I reached the place where the red dot was, an even more shocking scene reflected in my eyes.</p><br/><p>This.. wasn\u2019t this the almighty cat-eared Onee-san everyone read about in any fantasy novels?!!</p><br/><p>No no no no no, I was amazed at the wrong scene. That cat-eared Onee-san must be Zen\u2019s childhood friend. The one I was amazed at was, at the center of the camp, which looked very different from Manuel\u2019s, sat a fatty who looked high and mighty.</p><br/><p>I would never forgot the impact when I first saw his face! I remembered thinking what a typical trope it was when John-Sensei first taught me about him.</p><br/><p>\u201d Isn\u2019t that Guta Emperor..?! \u201d</p><br/><p>In the silent time frozen world, there stood a boy who was pointing as he yelled. It was a very surreal scene. Although that boy was me.</p><br/><p>But I just can\u2019t helped but to yelled.</p><br/><p>I mean, the emperor himself had participated in this risky operation?! There was no way! I stood there, mouth wide open for a while.</p><br/><p>Wrapping the cat-eared Onee-san in a blanket, I teleported her and the rest of the captured Hattuo army back into Manuel\u2019s camp. I stared at the only person left here, Guta Hattuo. He looked as evil as his portrait was. Or rather, his portrait actually beautified him instead.</p><br/><p>This uncle was just as how he was portrayed. If I remembered correctly, he was 53 when I was 3, so he must be 58 years old right now. Really an uncle. And, tentatively, an emperor. But hey, all people with authority usually had themselves beautified in their portraits as they spread it around the world, didn\u2019t they?</p><br/><p>Ah, although mine had nothing done. I wondered if all the Nobles in this world were so honest. I don\u2019t want it though. If I became the head, I am going to beautify myself as much as possible in order to leave behind a beautiful legacy for the later generations.</p><br/><p>So, what to do with this emperor?</p><br/><p>Hm, if I were to went about it normally\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201d Capture and transport! Yes! \u201d</p><br/><p>Anyway, he was still a criminal so I could hand him over to the police equivalent, the Knights, to deal with. Although I really want to questioned him regarding various stuff. But let\u2019s leave all these political stuff to the adults.</p><br/><p>Heh, though there was no need to act like a child here. But I am still a child and besides, looking at this troupe-like villain who used [Shadows] and treated beastmen as below him, I would kill him as soon as I could. But really, I wouldn\u2019t know what I would do since I hadn\u2019t spoken to him before.</p><br/><p>\u201d With this my work is done~! I\u2019m tired\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>My shoulders cracked as I stretched. Well then. I teleported myself to Manuel\u2019s camp and took Zen\u2019s Onee-san back. I wanted to princess-carry her out in a bid to look cool but sadly, there was the height difference. But I can\u2019t sandbag carry her like I did with Zen either. Which was why I chose to levitated her as I teleported.</p><br/><p>Where to? Of course to where Zen was. Since it was bad to appeared all of a sudden, I teleported to an area where no one was around. The street was wrapped in silence so thick that I could cut it like butter. Reaching into my inter-dimension space, I pulled out the tool.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u300a\u300b\u201d</p><br/><p>[TN: Teishi, stop]</p><br/><p>As the command was issued, the street erupted in a buzz of noises. Feeling relief, I took a step out. All the screams and shriek was because of the shaking (from the beast rampaging) before the time freeze I guess. To them, it was a continuation of the terror.</p><br/><p>Walking down the noisy street, I spotted the adventurer\u2019s guild where Zen and the others were. And in front of the guild was Zen and his father, as well as the Knight, with faces full of anxiety as they looked at the direction of the [Demon Forest].</p><br/><p>\u201d Zen! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zen jumped from the surprised of my shout and was colored surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201d Will! \u201d</p><br/><p>The surprise quickly changed into happiness as he ran towards me. It was an amusing scene to how different the Knight and Zen\u2019s father expression were from Zen\u2019s. They had their mouth wide open as they stood frozen. But Zen, who reacted immediately, showed how used he was to my actions. My condolences.</p><br/><p>He then realized his childhood friend, his Onee-san, floating in the air so I floated her towards him. Since there was no way Zen could carry her as well, I laid her gently down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201d I managed to do something, Zen. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Un! Thanks Will!! \u201d</p><br/><p>To the grinning me, Zen nodded as tears flowed down his cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>AN: Zen\u2019s heroine power.</p><br/><p>TN: Here\u2019s the 2nd chapter I owe you guys. Sandbag carry, I guess it\u2019s something like fireman\u2019s carry? And as fr the trees, I assumed he did something as his mind went off the rails as he thought about the brute army.</p><br/><p>Either that or the author forgotten all about it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

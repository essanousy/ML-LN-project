They were an old family with a history.</p><br/><p>And the next head, me, had graced the Phillis Academy with my presence for enrolling. I had a bit of resentment for being grouped together with the commoners for the dormitory but it was unbecoming for a high-class noble such as myself to be raising my voice. A noble would never trouble themselves over such petty stuff!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I shall endure.</p><br/><p>Look at me! Hahaha! Wasn\u2019t I awesome?!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Father, was I doing the noble-standing-at-the-top thing correctly? Feeling a bit uneasy, I recalled the words Father spoke to me when I was setting off.</p><br/><p>\u201d We are not commoners but the lord who governs over them\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015Never forget this \u201c</p><br/><p>Yes, I think that was what he said. I had a feeling he said something else but oh well. My father is amazing. He managed to rebuild the land and made it prosper after what that rubbish gramps had done to it. Thanks to that, he got back the faith from the Royal family that was lost after Grampa\u2019s generation and seemed to be relied by the King.</p><br/><p>Ahhh, Father is magnificent.</p><br/><p>I gave my all to uphold the words Father had specially granted me when I enrolled into the Academy.</p><br/><p>A situation happened when we were guided by the upper classmen to our respective classroom after the entrance ceremony. An angel-like young boy just randomly took a seat, resulting in everybody doing the same. Don\u2019t think I would forgive you just because you are cute! That\u2019s because I needed to follow my father\u2019s words! Why should I be seated behind the commoners?!</p><br/><p>But, [Free Seating] was written on the blackboard. Ah, so it was not that he simply sat as he pleased. I shall obey since it was the academy\u2019s rule. A noble shall always follow the rules.</p><br/><p>I sat down and crossed my legs over the seat next to me. That way, I can at peace knowing no commoners will be sitting next to me. \u2026\u2026No, I am not feeling lonely. I blew my nose and gazed at the blackboard.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, my old home tutor was using one as well. This was one of the First Founder\u2019s invention. Elzmu\u2019s first King sure was great.</p><br/><p>As these thoughts went through my mind, the door opened with a force and a huge man entered. My house was situated at the border and as a Knight\u2019s family, I had seen my fill of muscled guys but was such muscles needed for a teacher? Scholars and officers who worked at my house were usually slender and thin.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, everyone is here! I am glad everyone is sitting down nicely. \u201d</p><br/><p>Muscled man looked around the classroom happily. Man, his voice sure was loud. No one was making a racket nor was the classroom big enough to warrant this volume. We can still hear you without all the shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201d O-kay, let us start with self-introduction! \u201d</p><br/><p>Muscled man shouted before grinning. Why was he grinning?</p><br/><p>\u201d Firstly\u2026 My name is Zelda! \u201d</p><br/><p>And he flexed his muscles. I opened my eyes in surprised. That\u2019s because when he said the word \u2018Zelda\u2019, the name appeared in fire in the air!</p><br/><p>\u201d As you can see, my attribute is fire. Fire attribute primary level teacher, and the in-charge of this class! \u201d</p><br/><p>According to him, the fire words seemed to be his doing. Father had once said it was difficult to control magic to that extent. As expected of the academy\u2019s teacher, the name was not for nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201d So, that\u2019s it for today. There would be a body check-up tomorrow so for those staying in dormitory, don\u2019t be late just because you are not used to it and can\u2019t sleep. \u201d</p><br/><p>The man said something but I was still in awe at the wonderfully controlled magic. I wondered if I would become such a wonderful magician like him? I wondered if I would become a Knight, that after succeeding Father, developed the land and protected the border against demon beasts and caught the King\u2019s attention. No one shall be hungry and everyone would have a smile on their faces.</p><br/><p>My bad, I was lost in my thoughts. When I realized it, no one was left in the classroom. Oh, no! I was going to be late for the important task I was entrusted with!</p><br/><p>\u2026.Ah, it should be okay. \u2018A Hero always makes a late entrance\u2019 was the First King, Elzmu Dera Oio, favorite phrase. I seemed to be held in high expectation to lead the commoners as I was chosen to be [Door Duty officer], the one to open the door for the first years! The door was locked with magic and without knowing the magic word, it cannot be opened. Of course, no first years would know the magic word which was why there was such a duty. The word was taught by \u2018Kiro\u2019, who seemed to have been the dormitory leader for a few years.</p><br/><p>Such an honor. This needed reporting to Father.</p><br/><p>Panicking, I opened up the map and rushed over to where the dormitory was. \u2026\u2026.But the academy was built in a really confusing way. I was completely lost. In order to find my way, I drew out the path to the dormitory on the map. I should be okay if I walked according to this path. This time, I won\u2019t get lost.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I was lost. The map was bogus. Why do I need to go up and down the stairs a few times when it was just a straight line on the map?! Please draw the map properly!</p><br/><p>When I finally arrived at the dormitory, I panicked. What was this?! Everyone had already arrived at the dormitory! Plus, my role had been taken over!</p><br/><p>\u201d YOU. What did you do! \u201d</p><br/><p>Rushing over, I saw the silvered-hair child with a curly red-headed kid pair, who sat down first at the classroom. And then I realized it when I rushed over. What was this. Why was the door opened?!!</p><br/><p>\u201d Is it not me who is in charge of the door this year?! \u201d</p><br/><p>I stood there stunned, looking at the opened door before I realized. There were many commoners standing around the door. According to the placement of where they were standing, it must be silver-hair who opened the door.</p><br/><p>Strange! Was I not given favorable treatment from the dorm leader because of my noble status?! From what I remembered, silver-hair did not give a full-name when he introduced himself. It meant that he was a commoner. Did it mean that he was chosen and not me?! What was going on?!</p><br/><p>\u201d Besides, aren\u2019t you guys simply commoners? \u201d</p><br/><p>Was this what it meant by commoners stealing the role from me since I was late?! Had I already betrayed Father\u2019s words? Everyday, Father would tell me, \u2018Conduct yourself with the awareness of a Noble.\u2019. Which meant that I shouldn\u2019t be looked down on.</p><br/><p>\u201d Even though I had already compromised by agreeing to live with commoners, what is with these guys? \u201d</p><br/><p>Since there was no point crying over spilled milk, I shall teach them the wonderfulness of my family! By my words, silver-hair and curly-hair shrank, finally realizing the greatness of noble me.</p><br/><p>But then, for some reason, silver-hair let out a deep sigh like Father.</p><br/><p>\u201d And? Who are you and what did we do to you? \u201d</p><br/><p>Wha, what?! I had, in class just now, introduced myself with as much appeal as possible with my beautiful family name and he was saying he did not remember it?! The class went into a buzz because of my name!</p><br/><p>\u2026..I get it. This silver-hair was an \u2018airhead\u2019 who forgot things the next second. Must be. A noble must possess a large heart to accept these kind of people too.</p><br/><p>[TN: In raw, it was birdhead]</p><br/><p>\u201d You think you are so important, isn\u2019t it? Not knowing who I am. Oh my, oh my. Being unable to remember despite hearing it once is so pitiful. There\u2019s no choice, I shall teach you. I am the next head of the Count family, Mi Sociunnov. \u201d</p><br/><p>And when I shall be big-heart and introduced myself once more, silver-hair had a flash of surprised on his face before hanging his head. His shoulders even trembled. He had finally realized who he was talking to.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ooh, are you scared? It can\u2019t be helped, you, who did not know, shall be forgiven\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>But, as I was about to forgive him with me big-heartedness, he lifted his head up, interrupting me mid-sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I am sorry. \u2026..That was amusing. \u201d</p><br/><p>Wh, what?</p><br/><p>What was amusing? Was this guy\u2019s head okay?</p><br/><p>Looking at me, he gave a beautiful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d I thought no matter the status, everyone in school studying is a student, am I wrong? \u201d</p><br/><p>He remained composed as his smile widened and he did a graceful bow. The movement was refined, and did not look like he just came up with it on the spot.</p><br/><p>He looked clean and healthy\u2026. It then finally dawned on me. Was the child in front of me really a commoner?</p><br/><p>\u201d Since you specially introduced yourself, it would be rude of me not to. I am the next head of the Duke Family, Williams Beryl. Nice to meet you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Congrat\u2026..uations\u2026.!</p><br/><p>My mind just froze at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: I did not give this a run-over as usual so this would be in the roughest form. I am going to sleep away this fever before giving this a run-over. Read at your own risk.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

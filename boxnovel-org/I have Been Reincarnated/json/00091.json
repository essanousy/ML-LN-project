The encounter with an Angel that changed his outlook on life and even to be able to serve as a knight! How lucky he was.</p><br/><p>This was the day he finally felt the presence of god. And with that, regret over his past actions.</p><br/><p>Yes, Ivan changed.</p><br/><p>He was totally different from the rogue-like him from yesterday. It could be seen from the way he regretted over his past actions.</p><br/><p>And when he looked at Willia\u2019s innocent smile, he was so deeply moved that he trembled. He would have you know the trembling was not from pain.</p><br/><p>By the way, his muscles ached, especially from his calf, so he could not even stand and remained lying on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201d Well. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!!? \u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Willia-chan lost her innocence. She seemed to be saying something but Ivan was not listening any longer.</p><br/><p>Seeing the sudden serious and mature look on Willia, Ivan, unable to believe his own eyes, rubbed them hard. The sudden movement caused pain to shoot up his calf again but now was not the time to be bothered by that.</p><br/><p>What happened?</p><br/><p>What happened to the gentle, beautiful, shining, pure, Angel-like, innocent, cute little Willia-chan? She looked like a totally different person with that expression.</p><br/><p>\u2026..Was she possessed by something?!!?</p><br/><p>It was definitely possible. Because they were outside right now, and alone. And Willia was still a child, she would not have the mental strength to guard against it. Ivan had heard of a magical beast called \u2018Ghost\u2019 that possessed people every now and then. If that was the case, he needed to do something.</p><br/><p>The way to force it out was to give the possessed body a shock that forced it out. A shock\u2026. which meant a hit.</p><br/><p>He would have to hit Willia-chan?!</p><br/><p>\u201d I can\u2019t do it! \u201d</p><br/><p>Willia-chan who lost her innocent was still cute! She had a mysterious aura around her now. There was no way Ivan could hit his treasure, Willia. But that was the only way to save her.</p><br/><p>What should he do?</p><br/><p>And when he was in conflict about it, a troubled smile appeared on Willia-chan\u2019s face suddenly. And it had enough destructive power to pull Ivan back to reality.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ivan-san. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ivan, whose name had been called by Willia, flushed like the color of boiled Ajipo.</p><br/><p>Ahh\u2026 He didn\u2019t care anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>And when he was about to say that out loud..</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..There won\u2019t be turning back after this, Ivan-san. Is this your [Final Answer]? \u201d</p><br/><p>Willia-chan said.</p><br/><p>That was dangerous. If he were to say that out right now, the reborn him would die on this day too. Seeing Willia-chan waiting for his answer, he frantically coughed and cleared his throat before realizing he had no idea what the question meant.</p><br/><p>Ivan was only a rogue-ish soldier of Hattuo. Of course, he had never gone to school before. He had no choice but to start learning now. Swallowing his embarrassment, he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm\u2026*cough*\u2026 What..what do you mean? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, sorry about that. I am asking if it is really okay to be my guard. There would be no turning back. \u201d</p><br/><p>Was it really okay?</p><br/><p>To Ivan, that was a stupid question. Turning his serious gaze towards Willia, Ivan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yea. I am jobless anyway and I wanna protect Willia-chan. Plus, I have a feeling it\u2019s fate! \u201d</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Ivan was quite a romantic at heart. To think he had a girlish thinking that it was fate after that shocking encounter, as if lighting strike, with Willia. If Ivan\u2019s thoughts could be heard, Will should be able to hear him puking rainbows and sugar right now.</p><br/><p>But, to the unknown Willia, or rather, Will, he was moved by the [Way of Knight] that was in Ivan\u2019s heart and Ivan\u2019s value rose in his eyes. And thanks to that, Will had a bright and beautiful smile on his face. That smile was really bad for Ivan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>With their eyes meeting, Willia\u2019s mouth curled into a smile and Ivan\u2019s heart caught fire despite his age.</p><br/><p>\u201d Then, I would need to explain. And Ivan-san would have to give up your Hattuo citizenship. \u201d</p><br/><p>To Ivan, who was filled with expectation, the following conversation was the start of his despair.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>\u201d To start with, I am sorry for deceiving you but I am a Noble. \u201d</p><br/><p>And when I said that, Ivan-san was so shocked he was about to jump up. But he can\u2019t. Because his muscle ache was preventing him from moving.</p><br/><p>\u201d Noble-sama\u2026!!? I, I, had been impolite! \u201d</p><br/><p>To Ivan who looked like he would kneel down if he could move, there were still many things to be said so I am sorry, but I shall ignore it and moved on. Yep.</p><br/><p>\u201d It\u2019s all right, don\u2019t mind it. And again, sorry for deceiving you but I am male. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Eh? What was that just now? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I am a male. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d M, m, male\u2026what is \u2018male\u2019? I, is that a Noble\u2019s rank? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yep, he was totally confused right now.</p><br/><p>What was that \u2018noble\u2019s rank\u2019 thing? He seemed to not even know what gender was now. There was no choice, I can only wait till he calmed down. We can\u2019t continue if he can\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Male, male is\u2026eh.. You can\u2019t be talking about gender right\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I latched onto the words he mumbled in a tiny voice.</p><br/><p>\u201d Of course. My gender is male. It is certainly attached. If not, would you like to take a look? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d N, no! No, thank you! \u201d</p><br/><p>I was rejected splendidly.</p><br/><p>Luckily too. If he really said \u2018Yes please\u2019, I would be the one troubled. I withdrew the hand that was holding on to my skirt. Joking, of course.</p><br/><p>\u201d You got to be kidding\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Ivan, while groaning, had huge drops of tears falling down his cheeks. Was he really that shocked at being deceived? Reflecting upon my actions, I stopped the cheeky expression on my face and stared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ivan-san, I am really sorry for deceiving you. I could only do this as my name seemed to have been widely spread within this country.</p><br/><p>I was forced to do this. I would like to shout that my eyes had not been opened to a whole new world of cross-dressing.</p><br/><p>\u201d Uwahh\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>But it seemed like my apology was not reaching Ivan-san at all and his tears did not look like it would stop anytime soon. No, maybe he just didn\u2019t hear that. He was just concentrating on crying. I would like to believe he was not ignoring me on purpose.</p><br/><p>In that case, I spread my hands in front of Ivan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>*Clap*</p><br/><p>A loud clap rang across the area.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ivan-san! \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!?!!? \u201d</p><br/><p>Greatly surprised, Ivan-san\u2019s mouth was opening and closing with a stunned expression on his face. Let\u2019s keep it a secret that I thought he looked like a Koi fish.</p><br/><p>Yosh, now I got his attention, let\u2019s continue.</p><br/><p>\u201d Taking this chance, I will introduce myself. I am William Beryl, Elzmu Country\u2019s Duke\u2019s heir. \u201d</p><br/><p>Tee hee. \u2606\u2606</p><br/><p>I added in my heart and when I looked over at Ivan..</p><br/><p>\u201d Be, be, be, be, be, beryl?! Duke?! \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015I\u2019ve heard the name somewhere but what.. This is.. Ha ha ha ha\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Someone, he started a comedy act on his own.</p><br/><p>[TN: You broke his mind multiple times, Will, be kind.]</p><br/><p>He started laughing. Really, don\u2019t force yourself since you can\u2019t move. What gag was that, turning a dogeza into a full flat prostrating pose? And the first part, that rapid talking was amazing.</p><br/><p>While I was retorting inside my mind, Ivan-san had already lay flat and was kissing the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2019s why I told you not to mind it! Just be your normal self! \u201d</p><br/><p>Anymore and I will not be able to stand it. [TN: From laughing] I slowly helped Ivan-san sit back up.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, that\u2019s why I would need to bring Ivan-san over to Elzmu. Would that\u2026 really be okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>At my question, Ivan-san, who had been looking at the stars, turned towards me and our eyes met.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026Of course. Don\u2019t underestimate me, I will plow down any obstacle in front of me. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..Really, Ivan-san was a man straight from Knighthood. So brave and faithful. Ivan-san\u2019s strong gaze pressured down on me over and over again.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

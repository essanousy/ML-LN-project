I was not that bold and shameless as to break the school rules just after resolving to abide by them yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u201d So you did go with Father, didn\u2019t you? \u201d</p><br/><p>Calius-senpai said as he hummed happily. But that sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026..Ah, seems so. I am actually quite flustered when I heard that you knew about it. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ha ha ha ha, it was kinda fun seeing you flustered~ \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, while sighing as I tried to complain to Calius-senpai who was in a good mood, but to think it raised his good mood further up.</p><br/><p>What was with this person? Being with him was tiring.</p><br/><p>Or rather, to go \u2018 Ha ha ha ha\u2019 with that emotionless face was kinda scary.</p><br/><p>Within this short period, I finally caught glimpse of why Yuria-senpai was so afraid of him.</p><br/><p>\u201d Saying that, I thought \u2018Ah, he must have received a secret mission from the King.\u2019 when I saw Father leaving the house happily and right after, I heard that you played truant. Considering your personality, you don\u2019t look like someone who does that so when I start thinking of reasons that prevents a Duke\u2019s son from speaking out, I came to the conclusion that the 2 of you must be on a secret mission or something. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Zirco-sannnnnnnn\u2026!!</p><br/><p>How can you?! You were seen through easily by your son despite not saying anything! All information were totally leaked! What happened to being the leader of the Intelligence Corp?!</p><br/><p>I hit my forehead unintentionally and Calius-senpai smiled wryly, looking at my grim face.</p><br/><p>\u201d One of the weaknesses my Father, as an intelligence corp, has was that his emotions showed on his face too easily. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..True.</p><br/><p>At first, I was awed by how ninja-like Zirco-san was with his emotionless face to prevent his feelings from being read but as I got to know him more, somehow, even with his emotionless face, I knew what he was feeling. Maybe it was the aura around him. Anyhow, I could read his emotions.</p><br/><p>Calius-senpai was nodding every other second beside me.</p><br/><p>\u201d Haaaaaaahhhh\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was tired. Somehow I was super tired.</p><br/><p>I sighed, as I jumped from a wall to another.</p><br/><p>By the way, I was in the ceiling right now. I climbed up using the stone wall and the place I arrived at was the ceiling. Or inside of it. Was it above?</p><br/><p>The conversation we had was as we moved in the ceiling, soundlessly, and by concealing our voices. We were so ninja-like.</p><br/><p>I think it was above the route from the classroom to our dormitory. Headmaster should know this.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.He did, didn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>Ahh, if he did, I wish he could keep it like this. Since this secret tunnel looked to be created intentionally, it must have been the First Founder who did it. How cool. I was pretty sure it would not become his black history when he grew older.</p><br/><p>Ah, no matter.</p><br/><p>It was a man\u2019s dream. Not dim. Dream.</p><br/><p>[TN: In Japanese, romance (roman), chestnut (maron), romance (roman).]</p><br/><p>To have a secret tunnel within the academy\u2019s ceiling. What a nice dream-like ring it has to it. I pray this will survive to the end of time.</p><br/><p>\u201d Come to think of it, does Senpai use this route often? \u201d</p><br/><p>I asked casually and Calius-senpai tilted his head, thinking about it.</p><br/><p>\u201d I wonder which you meant\u2026hmm\u2026 I do use this when it\u2019s the school from home, I guess? About once per week. Because that house was filled with traps so it\u2019s impossible for Mother to clean it. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Sounds tiring. It\u2019s quite a big house, isn\u2019t it? \u201d</p><br/><p>Hmm\u30fc, did it mean that Calius-senpai cleaned the entire house by himself? That was really something. Senpai was only lower acad 3, in previous world terms, he was only a grade 6 student when he had to clean an entire mansion!</p><br/><p>As expected of a Ninja.</p><br/><p>\u201d You understand~? Thanks to that, I am troubled that my wind magic and my cleaning skills got really good~. Ah, having skills without relying on magic is not a bad thing though~ \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, I see. He had magic to help him. But, using magic to clean\u2026 wouldn\u2019t he cause a flood if he got to into it or something? Walking brooms sounded like what a certain mouse would do. \u2026..No no no no no.</p><br/><p>[TN: I had more of a HP vibe than MM though.]</p><br/><p>Skills being raised\u2026 could this be a hidden training routine to train the grasshoppers of Ninja House? It was scary how it sounded plausible.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Hm?</p><br/><p>As I laughed at my imagination, something nudged at me. What did Calius-senpai say just now?</p><br/><p>\u201d I wonder which you meant \u201d</p><br/><p>He said that, didn\u2019t he? Which meant, apart from using it to travel between his house and the academy, he was using it to travel to other places as well, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Timidly, I turned to Calius-senpai and tilted my head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Erm, which, you said\u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah! Yes, yes, that\u2019s because my hobby is observation~ \u201d</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, don\u2019t worry~ I don\u2019t have any weird sexual desires so of course I will not enter the rooms or any private spaces. Just the classrooms, corridors, lobbies and the back of the teacher\u2019s office~ \u201d</p><br/><p>Eh eh?</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, but I saw how Will got lost around the school when you first enrolled in~ Fu fu fu fu. \u201d</p><br/><p>Eh eh eh eh eh?!?!?!</p><br/><p>Wait, what was this person saying?! Even if he was using that cute face of his to smile at me, I couldn\u2019t smile. What forte was that? Training for the Intelligence corp? Did he say anything regarding that?</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, it\u2019s just training for my future. But still, the number 1 reason is because it\u2019s fun. \u201d</p><br/><p>Kyaaaa! Don\u2019t say that with an emotionless face! It\u2019s scary!</p><br/><p>Hm? Wait a minute. Did he say that he saw how I was lost?</p><br/><p>\u201d Lo.. lost? \u201d</p><br/><p>I asked, slightly panicking and this time, Calius-senpai showed a complacent smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yep yep. Observation sure is fun~ \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, Yuria-senpai, I am really sorry.</p><br/><p>This onii-san just understood your feelings.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>I was finally here.</p><br/><p>\u201d Hahh\u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>Descending onto the lobby of our dormitory, my shoulders slumped as I gave a deep sigh. Calius-senpai, who gracefully jumped down, looked at me and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201d Are you okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>No way I am. I was tired from this and that, plus the shocking truth about Calius-senpai\u2026. especially my mental strength. Well, I couldn\u2019t really say all of that so I hesitated a little.</p><br/><p>And Calius-senpai mistook that as some information I could not reveal as a weird aura leaked out from him.</p><br/><p>\u201d I want to get into the Intelligence Corp soon too\u2026. Will is so lucky. \u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, it turned into that. I panicked a little in front of the down-hearted Calius-senpai. I looked low acad 1 and Calius-sempai low acad 3 but my inner age was around 30. I should not let a younger child get depressed just because I was tired from some useless matter.</p><br/><p>This was bad. Panicking, I tried to correct Calius-senpai as I opened my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, it is not like I can\u2019t speak about it, it\u2019s that- \u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s nothing, but the words got stuck in my throat once again and my meaning got mistaken. Again.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah, I understand. Then, why don\u2019t you come to my room? Senpai will listen to your troubles! At this time, Kiro will most likely be in the cafeteria so there is no one in now. Yep. \u201d</p><br/><p>Calius-senpai\u2019s hair swished as he started walking ahead happily.</p><br/><p>\u25c6</p><br/><p>Yep. This is William Beryl, who was currently in Calius-senpai\u2019s room to discuss about my troubles yet had none, William Beryl.</p><br/><p>I could not lie, as it would most likely come back to me.</p><br/><p>The setup in Calius-senpai\u2019s room was the same as ours, the only difference was the bookshelf at one side of the room was totally empty. I stared at the empty bookshelf involuntarily and Calius-senpai smiled wryly, pulling up a chair.</p><br/><p>\u201d It is as you thought, that\u2019s Kiro\u2019s side. \u201d</p><br/><p>He did not betray my expectations.</p><br/><p>As the chair was pulled out for me, I had to take a seat. After doing that, Calius-senpai took a seat opposite of me.</p><br/><p>\u201d And? What\u2019s up? \u201d</p><br/><p>What should I do?</p><br/><p>Being stared by Calius-senpai, I tried to keep a poker face as cold sweat dripped down my back. I had nothing, what should I do? Let\u2019s just dig something up.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.The things I was troubled with lately\u2026. Hmm\u2026. Ah, that\u2019s it. This might be perfect.</p><br/><p>Looking straight at Calius-senpai, I swallowed, before opening my mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201d That\u2026 Zen was behaving weirdly when I came back. I don\u2019t remember doing anything wrong and Zen himself said it was nothing when I asked but his attitude was obviously different from before\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was truly troubled over this matter. This was not the reason I hesitated previously but it was still a trouble. Plus, I could hit 2 birds with 1 stone by cheering up Calius-senpai and discussing it with someone at the same time. It was not like I was expecting an advice, just by listening to it was enough.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Although, for an adult to be discussing his troubles with a child\u2026 don\u2019t mind, don\u2019t mind. Wait, no. No matter who will only see me as an 8 year old child! Safe!</p><br/><p>And, when I was not expecting an answer, something surprising happened.</p><br/><p>\u201d Ah~ I see! That\u2019s why you wanted to discuss with me~ \u201d</p><br/><p>He looked happy as he nodded at me. Hmm, minus the fact that I still didn\u2019t really know him well enough to discuss it with him, why did he think that?</p><br/><p>\u201d You must have asked because you knew I was observing right? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..Ah, that\u2019s why.</p><br/><p>Putting aside the fact if that was legal or not, he did have an advantage to offer.</p><br/><p>I gave a tiny nod and Calius-senpai turned serious.</p><br/><p>\u201d If it\u2019s that, I do have an idea. \u201d</p><br/><p>You do?!</p><br/><p>The retort I had reflexively was swallowed down. As expected of the next-head-in-line of the Ninja House. I cannot make light of the information he has.</p><br/><p>\u201d He had an increasingly sullen face as he visited the library every day. I guess he must have problems with his studies? Maybe he felt a sense of crisis when he found out that he couldn\u2019t solve the problems by himself when Will was not around, I think. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Everyone, we had a genius detective here, like a certain someone.</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/>\n</div>"}

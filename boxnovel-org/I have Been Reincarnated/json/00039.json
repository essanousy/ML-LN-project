Nobles included Veltor, of course, as well as people who collaborated and were close to him.</p><br/><p>That was fast. Father, you were too amazing. Who were you, really?</p><br/><p>As for the captured \u2018Shadows\u2019, it was covered up by saying that Father had laid a trap and caught them. Ah, that was not a complete lie.</p><br/><p>Trap = Me.</p><br/><p>For me, I would wish to avoid increasing any troublesome matters coming my way and if an incident like this ever happened again, I could act as the hidden card and mostly, I wanted to live normally.</p><br/><p>If it was exposed, I might be seen as a strange child or even be persecuted\u2026 No, if I was being treated as a strange one, then people would distance themselves away from me, to which floodgates might open from my eyes.</p><br/><p>If possible, I would still want people to like me.</p><br/><p>It had been 3 days since the incident happened and already, all the Anti-Kingdom faction had completely gone underground. And Father made new fans out of the citizens there.</p><br/><p>It was scary how fast rumors could spread. Like how germs spread themselves, or how mice bred. They always said how rumors spread like wind. It just might spread faster than the wind.</p><br/><p>[TN: English \u2013 Rumors spread like wildfire.]</p><br/><p>Oh yes, it had been 3 days when the incident was safely behind us. And now, I needed to face a problem straight on.</p><br/><p>\u201d Sensei, they are not waking up. \u201d</p><br/><p>In place of Father, who was buried in paperwork, John-sensei was entrusted with the duty of looking after the arrested \u2018Shadows\u2019. As the cover story was said to be Father\u2019s trap, it could not be left to people who did not know the truth. By the way, I was attached as a freebie.</p><br/><p>\u2026Because, my feeling of guilt was overwhelming.</p><br/><p>I seemed to have made a mistake with my gravity magic and caused them to have almost all of their bones broken and were currently in a deep sleep. I casted healing magic and there were no longer any problem with their health but the trio, who had their collar removed, had not awakened yet.</p><br/><p>Sensei said that it must be the mental strain of having their collars removed and was not my fault but still\u2026 the feeling of guilt gnawed at me. I could not forget the expression on Onee-san\u2019s face before she fainted. Sometimes, in her sleep, she would have a pained expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201d Yes\u2026 As I thought, they would still need time to recover. \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei sighed along with me and looked at the trio\u2019s sleeping faces. Sensei rested his chin in his hand and had a complex expression on his face before sitting down on the sofa placed across from the bed. As a habit, I sat beside him.</p><br/><p>Ah, that was careless of me!</p><br/><p>\u201d By the way. \u201d</p><br/><p>2 hands firmly gripped my shoulders as I was turned towards Sensei. Our eyes met.</p><br/><p>\u2026. His eyes were glittering!</p><br/><p>\u201d It is about time to tell me about your magic, Will. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, that\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>I promised to tell him later so there was no way I could run away! Having said that, it was actually the same as Japanese from my previous world! If I actually said that, he would rage that I was only a [cheat] bastard and everything would end. In short, I was very troubled right now. These 3 days, half of it were spent looking after the \u2018Shadows\u2019, another half of it were spent thinking of a way to explain.</p><br/><p>And so, today was the 3rd day. My idea was to give an adequate reason and skip the rest. As I was not very good at lying, lying to people, like my parents and John-sensei, that had been with me everyday, would get me exposed faster than you could say \u2018OBJECTION!\u2019.</p><br/><p>That was why I was trying to think of a way to explain without lying. By the way, the only ones who learned about what I did were limited to my parents and John-sensei. As much as it pained me, the maids were kept in the dark. The Beryl was the top family of the Duke class so people beneath would enter the house for apprenticeship. Apprenticeship was\u2026. something like working in a big enterprise as a clerk before marriage.</p><br/><p>Ah, and so\u2026</p><br/><p>I looked seriously at Sensei straight on.</p><br/><p>\u201d I understand. I was just about to give up avoiding. \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei\u2019s eyes sparkled even brighter so I made it a point to show him how serious I was about this. His face stiffened and looked at me anew.</p><br/><p>\u201d I could understand the magic characters since I was born. \u201d</p><br/><p>I was not lying.</p><br/><p>I wondered if I came across as creepy\u2026 If I did not, then this strategy was a success. Worried, I looked at Sensei and saw that he was frozen in state of shock.</p><br/><p>\u201d I was surprised too, when I first saw the magic spells. \u201d</p><br/><p>I gave one more push. This was a bit painful for me but I excluded an aura from my entire body to \u2018not hate me\u2019.</p><br/><p>Come back! Sensei!</p><br/><p>I smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>One part of me thought that Sensei would accept it while the other knew that normally, no one would believe these kind of things. If it was me, I definitely would not. \u2018What is this 4 year old kid talking about\u2019 and I would have laughed.</p><br/><p>As I continued looking at Sensei, his expression, which was one of shock, slowly, bit by bit, melted into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201d Haha.. \u201d</p><br/><p>It slipped out as Sensei laughed, looking as Ikemen as usual while I was only thinking of wanting him to hurry up and give me the verdict.</p><br/><p>\u201d What are you so afraid of, Will? \u201d</p><br/><p>Sensei asked, still laughing. Then, in an instant, Sensei placed his hand on my head with a \u2018pon\u2019,</p><br/><p>\u201d It seems like we are in for a fun time from today on. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, he rubbed my head.</p><br/><p>\u2026That\u2019s great, he believed me\u2026 I was so glad, my face loosened up.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.Nn. \u201d</p><br/><p>A small voice sounded.</p><br/><p>\u2026Oh\u2026.Someone woke up\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201d Someone is awake? \u201d</p><br/><p>Standing up together with Sensei, we rushed over to the origin of the sound.</p><br/><p>\u201d She is awake\u2026! \u201d</p><br/><p>I said, leaning against the bed and looking at Onee-san\u2019s face. Her closed eyelids began to open slowly.</p><br/><p>Questions were reflected in her eyes.</p><br/><p>And\u2026.. Terror.</p><br/><p>Of course\u2026 It would be better to explain things clearly to her. I leaned in close.</p><br/><p>\u201d Onee-san, are you okay? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026..!! \u201d</p><br/><p>When our eyes met, I was glad she gave a different reaction as compared to 3 days ago. That\u2019s great. She was in control of her own will.</p><br/><p>\u201d Were Onee-san forced to wear the collar? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d If it\u2019s the collar, I have taken it off~ \u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Onee-san timidly reached for her neck. When she felt nothing attached on her neck, her eyes went wide and she looked at me so hard that she could drill a hole in me. That might be funny if it was not for this situation..</p><br/><p>I took her stare straight on and said.</p><br/><p>\u201d Onee-san is free. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Hm\u2026?</p><br/><p>Was this not where she felt happy? Why was there no reaction\u2026.</p><br/><p>Please, I would be troubled if there was no reaction. As before, Onee-san was staring at me, frozen solid. And when I was about to sigh..</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026\u2026.You\u2019re lying\u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>A tiny voice.</p><br/><p>\u201d No, I am not. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d You\u2019re lying! \u201d</p><br/><p>She shouted at my words. Since it came all of a sudden, I jumped, surprised by the sudden shouting. Now that I looked at her, she was trembling. I guess it had not sunk in yet, which was why she had refused to believe me.</p><br/><p>\u201d I am not lying. Onee-san is free\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I can\u2019t be!! I cannot be free! Because\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>I was cut off mid-sentence by Onee-san who shouted, almost crying. But \u2018Because\u2019 what? Was there a reason she could not have freedom? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026. someone close to her was being taken as a hostage?! As I stood ready, Onee-san lifted her hand, and forcefully pulled off her head cloth.</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2026.. Because\u2026 I am a\u2026 Beastman! \u201d</p><br/><p>Ahh.</p><br/><p>Just now, when John-sensei treated me as like before, I was so thankful that I could not help but smile.</p><br/><p>Saying that, I could see 2 puppy ears on top of her head.</p><br/><p>\u201d Why can\u2019t Beastmen have freedom? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Because\u2026.We\u2019re revolting. In any case, it\u2019ll still be\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Her ears, as like her emotion now, went down and flattened itself on her head. I wondered how she had lived before. Was she a \u2018Shadow\u2019 since she was born? Or\u2026</p><br/><p>When I thought about her circumstances, anger welled up inside me.</p><br/><p>But, rather than the past, now was\u2026.</p><br/><p>I bounced across the bed and used my knees to get closer to Onee-san while not forgetting to smile as much as possible. When I was close to her, I reached out my hand which caused her to flinch.</p><br/><p>\u201d How so? I think it\u2019s cute. \u201d</p><br/><p>I wanted to touch her ears!</p><br/><p>Ah, I touched it~.</p><br/><p>So soft~!!</p><br/><p>Fluffy!!</p><br/><p>I acted upon a win-win situation; satisfying my desire as well as trying to heal Onee-san\u2019s spirit. I softly stroked her ears.</p><br/><p>When Mother and Father stroked my head, I felt very blessed and happy. I had no idea what made Onee-san happy but I was trying to convey my sincerity\u2026. maybe.</p><br/><p>\u201d You\u2019re lying! \u201d</p><br/><p>She got a shock from my action and went all red. Once again, the stubborn-headed Onee-san insisted she was not cute. I still think puppy ears on this gorgeous Onee-san were cute.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>I knew that even if I said it, it would not mean a thing to her. I once felt the same as her too.</p><br/><p>\u201d Onee-san, aren\u2019t your ears just a part of you? \u201d</p><br/><p>I glanced at the blankly staring Onee-san as I continued. Distance memories had awoken inside of me.</p><br/><p>\u201d For example, If I cut my hair, I am still me. \u201d</p><br/><p>I remembered the big, wrinkled hands of my grandpa.</p><br/><p>\u201d No matter how I dress up nicely, I am still me. \u201d</p><br/><p>I grinned.</p><br/><p>Did I do that because I was about to get immersed in my memories or not, I had no idea.</p><br/><p>\u201d Isn\u2019t it just that? It is the inside that\u2019s important. \u201d</p><br/><p>This time, I hugged Onee-san.</p><br/><p>\u2026 I was still a kid so please give me some leeway.</p><br/><p>\u201d I think Onee-san\u2019s ears are cute. \u201d</p><br/><p>Onee-san burst into tears.</p><br/><p>I was not thinking that her flattened ears were cute! I was very mindful of the situation I was in right now!</p><br/><p>Making use of my child\u2019s body, I patted her back as she cried.</p><br/><p>But, it was like looking through the mirror, seeing the past me. I smiled. Grandpa taught me that \u2018face\u2019 was not all that mattered. Did Grandpa look at me that day like how I was doing now?</p><br/><p>I smiled again and as I was looking at Onee-san, I felt someone staring.</p><br/><p>\u2026. John-sensei.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026 I forgot all about him\u2026.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at me smiling like that! Don\u2019t look over here!!</p><br/><p>Ahh, came to think of it, I said some really embarrassing things\u2026 Now I really wanted to jump into a holeeeee!!!</p><br/><p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p><br/><p>TN: I added our lovely puppy ears Onee San in the profile page! She\u2019s cute.</p><br/><p>Please take a look at the profile page, located at the end of the main page, I included 3~4 years old cute Will too.</p><br/><p>Yes, I like puppy ears instead of dog ears. Although she looks like she had fox ears instead.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
